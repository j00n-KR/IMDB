0,TheLittleSongbird,Disappointment in space,5,16 December 2019,"Sci-Fi is not my favourite genre in film, or overall in general life actually, by all means, but that is not to say that it does nothing for me. Actually appreciate it a lot, and a few of my favourite films, and milestones in films, are sci-fi. When Brad Pitt is good and has good material he is great and 'Ad Astra' did look really interesting from the trailer which made it look like a visually stunning and thought provoking film.'Ad Astra' left me very mixed. Do not think it is as bad as has been said here, not to the extent of vehement hatred anyhow and in my mind there are far worse films out there. Also do not think that 'Ad Astra' is as good as the critical acclaim, or at least largely positive critical reception, it hs garnered. Am talking about my experience of how the film was received just in case anybody is wondering, loved/liked by critics thus far but very mixed on both extremes of love and hate when it comes to the audience reaction.Beginning with the good things with 'Ad Astra', it boasts both dazzling photography and visual effects, as well as striking set design. One of the best-looking films of the year. The music is great music on its own and didn't ever feel any reservations about how it was placed, ""Heaven Can Wait"" is made quite powerful use of.Pitt gives a commanding and dignified lead performance, one of his better ones in recent years in a type of role he's perfect for. All the acting is good even, with the other standout being Tommy Lee Jones.However, the story never completely grabbed me, what aimed to be thrilling or thrill-packed were anything but to me, and never found myself connecting with it emotionally. Most of the time, especially in the final act that too much of it was ridiculous and didn't make sense was a turn off. The script had some intelligent thoughtful moments but also too many perplexing and awkward in flow ones.The pace was often dull to the point of monotony, apparent from the start and never really gained momentum, but the film suffered too from having too many ideas and doing little with most. Others have mentioned the non-existent science so will leave it to them. The ending was a head-scratcher when it came to sense.Concluding, watchable and somewhat intriguing but wanted to like it so much more. 5/10",Ad Astra
1,Leofwine_draca,Watch it for the cinematography,6,18 October 2020,"A different kind of science fiction film, this one, one that moves at a glacial pace while telling the slow-moving story of an astronaut hunting for his estranged father, another astronaut who's missing and possibly become deranged. It's a beautifully shot movie that feels like it offers a more realistic depiction of space travel than most, and I enjoyed it much more than the overrated GRAVITY due to the assured performances. Brad Pitt is an actor who's really grown on me over the years and he's fine here, with solid support from old-timers Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland in small roles. There's little in the way of meat to the story and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY this isn't, but it's worth seeing for the cinematography alone.",Ad Astra
2,SnoopyStyle,two problems,5,11 December 2019,"Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) is working on a space antenna when it is hit by a power surge. He jumps to safety from space. The power surge is worldwide and he is told that it originated from near Neptune where his father H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) had disappeared some 16 years earlier. He is tasked to make contact with his father. He travels to the moon and survives lunar pirates. He travels to Mars and survives space apes.I really like the start. It's like Gravity but more. I like the space elevator although I don't think it would be built like that. Nevertheless, the construction is pure old sci-fi. Then the movie tries to be 2001 and runs into two problems. They can be generalized into a heart problem and a head problem. The heart problem is Brad Pitt. He's playing an emotional closed-off character. It leaves the lead unable to do any acting drama. He's doing Joe Black again and that movie really bored me. The head problem is the logic of the space hopping. It makes no sense to hop to the moon and then hop to Mars and then hop and hop and hop. Even if they are in a straight line, it would be simpler to not have those stop-overs. I can tell that The Expanse has more scientific know-how and that's a TV show. While I do love the lunar pirates, it's also the moment when I realized that the movie is not written by any space travel expert. This world doesn't make sense. The movie presents the cinematic world as realistic but it is fundamentally flawed. This inherent conflict cannot be resolved. In the end, the ambition is profound. The effort is massive. The two problems cannot be overcome.",Ad Astra
3,Hitchcoc,Endless!,4,5 October 2020,"I really thought this was a weak film. First of all, I'm not sure of the science or the futurism. Is this really the way things could be? There are so few controls. The people in authority are weak and scared. Brad Pitt's character, Roy, is about as dull as one can make him. Yes, he has been given a difficult job, but then it is pulled out of the program. The way he gets on board the final rocket is beyond possible. Even in the future. We would hope that people with the kind of money it takes to do a film like this could have channeled it into a real script. I could list 25 questions about the absurdity right off the top of my head.",Ad Astra
4,Horst_In_Translation,And explore space with my father again.,6,14 October 2019,"""Ad Astra"" is a new American 2019 movie and the seventh big screen filmmaking effort by director James Gray, who is also a co-writer here. This time he did not work with his regular lead Joqauin Phoenix who prefers to clown around a but this year (but not à la I'm Still Here), but cast Brad Pitt to play Roy McBride a successful astronaut with just the calmest heart beat out there as we are reminded of repeatedly in these two hours. With the exception of one occasion when making contact to his father is on the table again. The movie runs slightly over two hours and it is really a showcase for Pitt, who is in every scene of the film. Now the prime years of sci-fi films with big shots also awards-wise recently like Gravity, Interstellar and The Martian may be over for now, but Ad Astra is more than just mediocre aftermath I'd say. Maybe the most impressive aspect here is the technical (visual) side. Now when they are in these vehicles on the moon, it is just downright beautiful. A bit of a pity this was destroyed slightly through the action coming with these outlaws chasing the main character. And showing us once again what an alpha stud he is, always in control and charge of the situation when needed. There are so many moments like this that it almost felt a bit cringeworthy how much Roy was depicted as a hero here. It already starts at the beginning when he is still able to switch off the electricity before falling down and holding on way longer than his co-worker. Then there is the situation with the other pilot who has no clue what to do or a nervous breakdown. The aforementioned pirate scenario, where they are also trying to make a connection to today's world. How he ends up in charge of the ship to Neptune. How he kills the lab animal and manages to bring back the other astronaut to the ship. And there are at least five more situations that I could include here. But I won't. You get the message. Even for somebody like myself who likes Pitt, it was a bit exaggerated honestly. Of course, his character despite basically being space Bond is also still the most humble guy.After the first action sequence, the film gets slightly strange as we still have to adapt to the situation how they are talking about a simple journey to the moon with other civilian travellers, then on to Mars and to send a message to Neptune from there all as if it was nothing. Oh well, these even end up flying to Neptune eventually, so the talk was just sort of nothing you could say. It says right when the film starts something like ""in the not so distant future"", but looking at the technology and possibilities they got here, I am sure it will be the very distant future as we are far far away from that. I mean we have not even been to Mars and as far as I can say there are no real plans at this point for it to happen in the next 10 years, maybe 25. And in this film they have labs there. But as progressive as they are, the one thing that still exists is gender and work-related discrimination as we find out when Oscar nominee Ruth Negga enters the picture. I guess this is the reason why she does what she does and a bit of a justification for her illegal behavior that helps the main character though. I still felt it was a bit too easy how he got on that spacecraft. I mean there must be some security applications to keep something like this from happening. And Negga is gone as quickly as she enters the picture. Same for Liv Tyler (from Armageddon), whose role as the love interest to Roy is pretty empty and superficial and while they use her as one of his motivations to get back to Earth, they do nothing with this character at all. It is never about anybody except Pitt. This also becomes clear in these scenes with Donald Sutherland early on and with Tommy Lee Jones at the very end. Jones is still a scene stealer, not just when the film almost ends, but also during his several flashback and photo inclusions earlier. I still wondered a bit with how long ago he travelled to Neptune and he sure does look almost 60 or so in some of these recordings, so he must be really old the day when Pitt arrives at his location, but yeah well the film plays in the future, so I guess life expectancy has gone up quite a bit too. The suspense of wondering if he finally finds his dad was the key aspect for me the longer the film went. And also the question to what extent he really went insane up there. The way he explains what happened sounds a bit rational, actually his entire behavior up there was not as much of a lunatic and what loneliness could have done to him as you'd expect. His mind seems mostly clear. So it is a simple father-son story too behind all these great sets and special effects. The most touching moment is maybe when Pitt's character bursts into tears after Negga shows him the video. But also while it is a father-son story, it is also about Roy being very different compared to Clifford. The latter states explicitly that he never felt love for anything else than his work, not for Pitt's character, not for any other human. Roy is not like that. He feels love. And solitude. He cannot wait to get back to Earth after his quest and be among other humans again.Now I mentioned the extraterrestrial aspect already. While this is a component too throughout the movie with what they are going to find on the ship that sends the call for help, who puts the future of danger at risk or just automatically that in space you can always run into an extraterrestrial danger the way his father was looking for all along, this is not a science-fiction movie from that perspective, call it fantasy, horror or whatever. There the film stays realistic and does not enter Alien territory or so. This is also why it is still a character study all along, which it must be really because Pitt is in every scene from beginning to end and that is a lot because it is not a short film by any means. And he is always the dominant aspect. Also letting his father go, killing him to grant his wish shows that he is again the one in charge in contrast to what happened decades earlier when TLJ's character killed these other astronauts. I think one thing I did not like too much was the ending. They could have gone out in a better way the moment when Pitt for example says he is not sure he will make it back to Earth and that there is always the possibility that the explosion kills him and not just fuels/propels his vehicle. I mean he would have finished the mission this way and it would have been a worthy way to end the movie. But they went full heroic and included his rushed return to Earth too eventually ending the film instead with a slightly pretentious quote. I didn't like this way really too much. But yeah, it wasn't too unexpected that they went full heroic this way. And there were flaws before that too. I think compared to all the big blockbusters I meantioned early in my review, this one is perhaps best to be compared to Gravity as the male-centered equivalent to that. Still, it is clearly inferior, not necessarily in terms of Pitt compared to Bullock, but maybe in terms of Gray compared to Cuarón. So this will probably not get the gigantic amount of awards recognition and rightfully not. Still 2 (or so) nominations in the Oscars' technical categories seem pretty possible and I also don't think Pitt would be undeserving for another Best Actor nomination, not because he looks relatively young for coming close to 60, but he is the movie and I don't really think anybody could have given a (much) better portrayal here. But he is not gonna get a lot of recognition mostly for the reason that he has another film in the race, namely the one where he gives a supporting(?) performance in Tarantino's newest hit that could very well have him even win his first acting Oscar. But we talked about that one on another occasion already, so back to this one here. It's a good watch and I give it a thumbs-up overall. Not a film that will turn you into a sci-fi fan immediately, but if you like the genre, then you will probably enjoy it for the most part. Some creative ideas here and technically really on the highest level. Actually, this is rather a film that could turn you into a Pitt fan. Now that would be all then. Off you go.",Ad Astra
5,claudio_carvalho,Boring and Tiresome,4,15 December 2019,"""Ad Astra"" is a boring drama in a sci-fi environment. The plot is a great disappointment for fans of the sci-fi genre and too long. The excellent cast is wasted in this tiresome film. The beginning lures the viewer. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Ad Astra: Rumo às Estrelas"" (""Ad Astra: Towards the Stars"")",Ad Astra
6,nogodnomasters,The Surge,4,26 October 2019,"Roy McBride (Roy McBride) is an astronaut in the ""near future"" one that has a large infrastructure on the Moon and Mars. His father (Tommy Lee Jones ) was lost on a deep space mission. There are some cosmic rays coming from space which may or may not be coming from the lost space probe. There are described as initially as cosmic rays, i.s. gamma radiation and then described as ""anti-matter."" They are not the same and ""anti-matter"" is doubtful. Roy has a mission, which is to go into deep space to save or destroy his father who may or may not be alive and stop the purge which may or may not be coming from the LIMA space station/probe. Roy spends half the film talking to himself, getting in touch with his feelings.If you thought ""2001..."" or ""Moon"" was boring just wait until you get a gander at this one. Nice effects. I thought the comfort room was too much like the comfy death room in ""Soylent Green."" I was waiting for the punch line which never happened.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",Ad Astra
7,kosmasp,Slow and steady,8,4 December 2019,"There are certain things that are unwritten laws in filmmaking. Like how a character is set up and what the set up can mean later when all changes. Be it him and/or his surroundings. In this case you get the very mellow and really calm character portrayed by Brad Pitt.There are many slow moving places of the movie that some viewers might have to fight through. But it is well worth it. The story works quite nice and the pace is just right but again might be too slow for some viewers. There are a lot of longer shots and a lot of passages where it seems like nothing is happening. But there is solace in those moments - something you can cherish if you are into it. Not everything has to be flashy and fast paced. If you're down (or rather high) with that, this is for you",Ad Astra
8,lee_eisenberg,space's heart of darkness,7,27 December 2019,"James Gray's ""Ad Astra"" may look like a simple science fiction movie, but it's more of a philosophical one in the sense of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". It basically addresses the question of what it means to be human, with Brad Pitt's astronaut questioning his life choices as he ventures to Neptune to find his father (Tommy Lee Jones).It's not a great movie. Liv Tyler's character gets reduced to a cliche (the wife waiting for her husband) while much of the movie tries too hard to get its point across, creating a leaden feeling. But overall I thought that they did a good job, raising questions about our existence that might not have ready answers.I've read about comparisons to ""Interstellar"". I haven't seen that one, but heard that it was a lame imitation of other movies, with the most hackneyed ending ever.",Ad Astra
9,jboothmillard,Ad Astra,5,29 September 2019,"The title is a Latin phrase meaning ""to the stars"", I saw the trailer about three or four times before the release, it looked like an interesting space movie. Basically, in the near future, the Solar System is struck by mysterious power surges, threatening all human life. Major Roy McBride (Brad Pitt, also producing), son of famed astronaut H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), is almost killed in an incident caused by a surge. He is informed by U.S. Space Command (SpaceCom) that the surges have been traced to the ""Lima Project"" - created to search the limits of the Solar System for intelligent life, under Clifford's leadership. Clifford disappeared sixteen years ago, and was last located close to Neptune, there is a possibility he may still be alive. Roy accepts a mission to travel to Mars to try and establish communication with him, joined by his father's old associate Colonel Thomas Pruitt (Donald Sutherland). After taking a commercial flight to the Moon, Roy and Pruitt are escorted by US military personnel to the SpaceCom base, located on the dark side of the moon. Travelling in lunar rovers, they are ambushed by scavenging pirates, the entire escort are killed, and Pruitt ends up in intensive care. Roy transfers to the ship Cepheus, bound for Mars. The ship receives a distress signal from a Norwegian biomedical research space station, despite Roy's protests, they stip to investigate. The ship appears to be abandoned and broken apart, but an escaped baboon test subject has killed the crew, and attacks, until Roy locks him in another module and kills it using depressurisation. Roy attempts to save the captain who was found, using a tape on a broken helmet and carrying him back to the ship, but he is already dead, a service is held before his body is ejected into space. Another surge hits as the Cepheus lands on Mars, requiring manual piloting to complete the landing. Roy is led to the underground SpaceCom base and meets facility director Helen Lantos (Ruth Negga). His task is to record voice messages to send to the Lima Project in the hope that Clifford will respond. During one recording, Roy goes off-script with an emotional appeal to his father and is abruptly taken off the mission on the grounds of his personal feelings posing a risk to himself and the success of the mission. It is presumed that a response is received, and Roy demands to hear it. Lantos visits Roy, kept in a ""comfort room"", she reveals she was born on Mars and is the daughter of crew members from the Lima Project. She shows Roy classified footage revealing that Clifford's crew had tried to revolt and return to Earth, causing him to turn off their life-support systems, and that her parents were among the crew killed. She tells Roy that the Lima Project station is to be destroyed with a nuclear weapon. It Is decided that Roy should confront Clifford himself, and Helen sneaks him underground to the launch site. Roy climbs aboard as the rocket takes off and is discovered by the crew, they are all killed in the ensuing struggle. During the long journey to Neptune, a solitary Roy reflects on his relationships with his father and estranged wife, Eve (Liv Tyler). The isolation and stress of the mission take a mental toll, but after several weeks he arrives at the Lima Project. While approaching the station, the shuttle is damaged in a collision with objects in Neptune's rings, preventing it from docking with the station. Roy enters the station drifting in space, and finds the station abandoned, with crew all dead. He plants the nuclear payload before encountering Clifford, the only survivor, who explains that the surges are coming from the ship's malfunctioning antimatter power source, which was damaged in the mutiny. Clifford has continued to work on the project, refusing to lose faith in the possibility of finding intelligent life. After convincing Clifford to return to Earth, Roy finishes arming the payload and they prepare to return to the Cepheus. Clifford suddenly uses his spacesuit thrusters to launch the two of them off into space. With Clifford pleading for Roy to untether the two of them, Roy reluctantly does so, sending his father floating away. Roy manages to propel himself back to the Cepheus improvises a shield against Neptune's ring debris. Without enough fuel to return to Earth, he relies on the shockwave from the station's explosion to gain the required speed. The data retrieved from the base suggests that humans are the only intelligent life in the universe, inspiring Roy to reconnect with those closest to him, and he returns to Earth with newfound optimism. He expresses this in a psychological evaluation and reconnects with his wife. Also starring John Ortiz as Lieutenant General Rivas, Loren Dean as Donald Stanford, Greg Bryk as Chip Garnes, Kimberly Elise as Lorraine Deavers, Alyson Reed as Janice Collins, LisaGay Hamilton as Adjutant General Vogel and American Pie's Natasha Lyonne as Tanya Pincus. Pitt as the calm astronaut who has control over his heart rate is interesting, Lee Jones does fine with his moments on screen, and Sutherland and Tyler could have had slightly more to do. It is a very simple story; NASA find the man scientifically proven to be right to help prevent Earth's destruction, but eventually his emotions start to come out in the search for his father, it does have some good sequences and the splendid special effects help it visually, the problem is it is rather pretentious and maybe attempting to be philosophical, it is also rather slow, it's an average but reasonable science-fiction drama. It was nominated for Oscar for Best Sound Mixing. Worth watching!",Ad Astra
10,paul_haakonsen,"A tedious, monotonous and downright pointless storyline makes for a boring movie...",3,3 December 2019,"Okay, a sci-fi adventure/drama/mystery starring people like Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, Liv Tyler, and others, well the scene is set for quite a movie I would say.So I sat down to watch this 2019 movie from writers James Gray and Ethan Gross with some expectations for it. I hadn't really heard anything about the movie about it being a good or bad movie, nor had I actively sought out said information. So I wanted to sit down and be impressed.Well, I wasn't impressed, quite the opposite actually, as ""Ad Astra"" was a horribly mundane and downright boring movie. Sure, it was phenomenally visually pleasing to the eyes, given the grand special effects and CGI. But the storyline was just a steaming pile of ... well, you get the meaning here.Virtually next to nothing happened throughout the course of this movie, and running at a bit more than 2 hours, it made for a long, slow paced and rather tedious movie experience. And special effects can only do so much to salvage an empty shell of a movie.Now, with an impressive cast ensemble like they had for this movie, you'd expect that you'd be in for quite a treat. Well, again I'd hate to disappoint you. This movie hardly showcased the scope of the acting talents of the people on the cast list. Sure, it was adequately acting throughout the movie, but hardly memorable performances. Which was sort of a letdown given the usual performances of aforementioned actors and actresses.It actually felt like a random collection of ideas filmed by director James Gray and put together for a final cut in the cutting and editing room. I mean, take the scene with the Norwegian space vessel in distress. Now, I will not ruin anything here, as you have to experience it for yourself. But come on. That was just as random as anything could be what transpired there, and it served the movie little or no purpose at all - as did many of the scenes throughout the course of the movie.And whatever scenes were there to spice up the experience, such as the lunar rover drive to the far side of the moon, while it was suddenly given a jolt and a boost - again, not saying what transpires here - just felt like it was forced and not even utilized to the fullest to ensure maximum enjoyment for the audience. Director James Gray just let too many could-and-would-have-been-golden-moments slip through his fingers throughout the course of the movie.Visually, as I mentioned earlier, then ""Ad Astra"" is spectacular. And that is perhaps the best thing about the movie, because it definitely helped to improve upon suffering through the movie, given its poor script and storyline. The CGI and special effects team definitely worked magic here.""Ad Astra"" is a disappointing movie, and I had expected a lot more from the movie and the cast. My rating ends on a mere three out of ten stars, as I wasn't impressed by anything except the special effects. This is hardly a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, not even with those big Hollywood names on the cast list.",Ad Astra

The film moves along with the pace of a an elephant trudging through fudge (or something of a similar colour) and by about half an hour in, I found myself considering the cardinal sin of the cinema - looking at my phone for messages I knew I hadn't received since sitting down. As ever with these kind of films, I am grateful that their box office viability helps cinemas to stay afloat in times when many prefer to watch on their televisions at home; but aside from this tangential benefit, this has precious little else to offer.

14,grantss,Great special effects but clumsy plot,6,20 June 2020,"30 years ago Dr Clifford McBride and his crew set off on an expedition to Neptune. At a point all contact was lost and the expedition is assumed to have failed. Now, life in the Solar System is under threat as strange energy surges are experienced, caused by activity on Neptune. US Space Command is convinced that McBride is behind this and sends McBride's son Roy, a highly competent and experienced astronaut, to Neptune to seek answers.A sci fi drama that promises much but doesn't fully deliver. Very realistic special effects, reminding of the two great recent sci films: Gravity and Interstellar. While I'm no astrophysicist, the physics seems highly accurate, giving the film a very genuine feel to it. Add to this an intriguing plot an epic voyage and surely we have the makings of a modern sci fi classic.Sadly, no. The plot is clumsy and not fully formed. The reasons for the voyage seem contrived, time seems to get compressed when it suits the writers, complex things get wrapped up far too simply (especially the explanation for the energy surges) and the sentimental angle - the father-son story - is overplayed.Overall, it's still interesting and entertaining enough but it's also quite disappointing.",Ad Astra

While the visuals are on par with say Kubrick, but filmmaker James Gray (who co-wrote the bone dry screenplay with Ethan Gross) keeps things at a near monotone level with little action, suspense or even humor.

Brad Pitt isn't a terrible actor, but he's limited, and he's certainly not good enough to carry off a movie like this, despite the fact that there is near-constant voice over just telling us what his character is thinking.

There's some psycho-babble about whether or not Pitt should let his dad go, figuratively and literally, before the film's most preposterous plot device that involves a nuclear explosion propelling Pitt's spaceship all the way from Neptune back to Earth. Or at least, I think that's what happened.I'll give this film some points for trying to be a movie for adults, a rare find these days, but I'd like some movies that are both for adults AND good.And what the heck was with the killer monkeys?

18,ferguson-6,2.7 billion miles of daddy issues,8,19 September 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.Brad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.Roy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.James Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.Ruth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates ""to the stars"", and it's true in every sense.Mr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished. Now, imagine yourself stationed in space and just try to keep your heartrate below 80!",Ad Astra

It's watchable but it certainly didn't meet that expectation.Engaging for the most part, though solitary. There isn't anything exceptional about Pitt's performance, though it's not bad in any way. It's all about the mission, though not really at all. It's about why Roy's the way he is and his relationship with his father, whom he learns isn't the hero that he's hailed as and possesses characteristics such as detachment like himself, which he'd like to change.",Ad Astra
20,gradyharp,'Most of us spend our lives in hiding',7,25 December 2019,"James Gray both wrote (with Ethan Gross) and directed this psychological science fiction story that has polarized viewers: while many love the film, as many loath it - and for various reasons that can be read as private opinions. In short, the story relates one Astronaut Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) who undertakes a mission across an unforgiving solar system to uncover the truth about his missing father Colonel Clifford Mc Bride (Tommy Lee Jones) and his doomed expedition that now, 30 years later, threatens the universe and the survival of earth. In the treacherous opening Roy falls from an incredibly tall space tower all the while maintaining normal vital signs and mental stability - traits that accompany him through the film's adventure until the ending. Along the way he encounters older astronaut Thomas Pruitt (Donald Sutherland) and a few other persons both of the astronaut bent and those living on other planets - very small parts in this essentially one man film.The focal point of the film is the father/son relationship altered by space and time and that allows the story to rise above routine sci-fi elements. Brad Pitt is excellent, if a bit monochromatic, and the technical, visual, and graphic elements of the production are exceptional as is the cinematography. This is a fine example of intelligent science fiction that retains nods of insight into the mind states of those who explore space as well as the quite possible future of space exploration with the accompanying benefits and potential problems.

Ad Astra what works: The space effects and moving fast pace base to base keeps the story going with the viewer asking what's next? Brad Pitt always plays the Alpha Male perfectly, and has the Martin Sheen narration. We see the benefits of the Alpha male who is calm under fire, wired tight, and goal oriented. Regrettable the calm, cool guy leaves little room for emotions which effects relationships and torments the Pitt character. We see the father effecting the son metaphors in Ad Astra. The PC characters can not be old school, while Pitt can not be attacked and when the disaster hits Pit adapts and improvises. We see a full circle in a film, and all was done for nothing. What did not work: Not a conventional film. But I wonder if Ad Astra will be a non-conventional cult classic like Repo man, Apocalypse Now and others. 7 stars.",Ad Astra

A weird combination of Interstellar and Apocalypse Now, but philosophical only, lacking the science of the former or the action of the latter. The movie is very well made, with beautiful setups and scenes, but it's not a space movie. In fact, it was annoying how many things it got wrong with the science. It is essential to watch it as an allegory and ignore the technical aspects if you are to enjoy it.Not all is rosy, though. It is long and slow and almost leave to the imagination of the viewer the internal struggles and motivations of the main character, while doing it in a space environment that would baffle most people that usually watch this kind of introspective films. I've already complained about how technical people might feel.Bottom line: if it weren't for Pitt's stellar performance and the good direction, I would have probably hated the film.

All I knew about ""Ad Astra"" before seeing it was that it was about an astronaut, (Brad Pitt), travelling to the far reaches of the universe in search of his father; so far so pretentious. Having been massively disappointed by Claire Denis' highly praised and highflautin ""High Life"", I was in no mood for philosophical soul-searching in the deepest recesses of space so I was very pleasantly surprised to find that ""Ad Astra"" is really ""Apocalypse Now"" in Outer Space with Brad Pitt as the Willard character and Tommy Lee Jones as his Kurtz; the main difference being the man he's sent to stop 'with extreme prejudice' is his father.""Ad Astra"" is a smart, intelligent and actually very exciting Space Opera and it's as good as they come. It wastes no time in getting down to business, treats its space travel with a certain degree of realism, never short-changes on the action and actually succeeds in delivering the big father/son pay-off without seeming either pretentious or mawkish. If it has a fault it's that it's all over too quickly and with less drama than we might have hoped for.Pitt, who is hardly ever off the screen, is superb. This could be a career-best role for him and Tommy Lee Jones is suitably world-weary, or space-weary, as his father. Unfortunately, no-one else is given very much to do; the likes of Donald Sutherland and Ruth Negga come and go without adding very much to the proceedings. The director is James Gray and this should prove to be his big breakthrough film. Well worth seeing.",Ad Astra
29,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The final frontier... again.,6,22 September 2019,"'Ad Astra (2019)' is a quiet and contemplative art-house film at heart - well, it would be if it wasn't for that darn narration. For a film that's mainly about one solitary person, there's a heck of a lot of talking. This dampens the effect of what could've been some striking imagery, subtle theming and a great central performance from Pitt. Instead of allowing us to see the initially enigmatic and emotionless protagonist undergo his rather small arc, we're constantly told about it. In the same vein, the final message isn't left to interpretation, it's practically screamed at us. It's a shame because this could've been a quiet, contemplative art-house piece through and through, with only its big-budget visage betraying this aesthetic. As it is, though, it's a half-and-half affair, one that sticks exposition into every available space and features snippets of traditional action in an effort to capture a wider audience who won't be on-board anyway. I mean, space battles and raging baboons don't really fit here. It's not like the movie is bad, however. I mentioned before that it features striking imagery and that's certainly true. It renders extraterrestrial vistas, long-haul space-flights and head-spinning disasters both convincingly and compellingly. The artistic direction works well enough, evoking a combination of '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' and 'Apocalypse Now (1979)'. It's a shame that we're usually deprived of the chance to draw our own conclusions about these images. The story itself is rather interesting in places - though, it's baggy and takes some unnecessary detours. When things start wrapping up, it becomes rather engaging. It's also quite enjoyable throughout, despite being generally slow. In the end, the picture just doesn't seem to amount to much. It has a distinct style and it isn't afraid to take a few risks, but it's ultimately rather 'safe'. It sort of feels like every other 'man in space' movie of recent years. Frankly, it's occasionally dull, too. It's entertaining just as often, though, and is certainly a visual treat. If its daddy-issue-based story connects with you and you don't mind being told instead of shown, you may get quite a bit more out of the affair than I did. 6/10",Ad Astra
30,ThomasDrufke,To the Stars,8,6 October 2019,"I'll always contend that the single most important thing about a film is how it finishes and makes you feel as you leave the theater. Unfortunately for Ad Astra, it doesn't quite know how it wants to close out the story of a man sent to uncover the secrets of his father's mission decades prior, and potentially, save his life. There are sequences in Ad Astra unlike any other space film I've ever seen, including an extraordinary chase on the moon. I was thrilled the trailers didn't show too much either, and quite frankly, presented an entirely different movie in the marketing material. More than likely though, this film will be likely forgotten come awards season, much like First Man last year. The ending just falls too flat to leave you with a good taste as you leave the cinema. I would love to see James Gray do more sci-fi though.8.2/10",Ad Astra
31,Cineanalyst,Name of the Father,7,25 September 2019,"Surely, ""Ad Astra"" is worth marveling for its appearance of scientific fidelity within a sci-fi setting and its cinematographic and effects-laded representation of space, especially for a such a ruminative picture as this, but having studied film theory more than I have science or space, I'm more struck by the movie's faithfulness to Lacanian psychobabble. For those who haven't struggled for hours to remain conscious during lectures on discarded theories from the social sciences recycled for film analysis, Jacques Lacan's ideas may be summed up as the flip side of the Oedipus complex; whereas Freud was obsessed with mothers, Lacan was so with fathers. So, too, ""Ad Astra"" delivers, in a journey akin to Joseph Conrad's novella ""Heart of Darkness,"" a universe driven by the cinematic--and very male--gaze and ordered in the name of the father. Basically, Brad Pitt and the movie have daddy issues.Personally, I tend to find most of psychoanalytic film theory to be amusing at best. About the only thing to ever come out of it to make much sense was Laura Mulvey's essay, ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,"" which is mostly interesting for its feminist critique of the traditionally male orientation of the camera's gaze, which seems relevant in considering a view such as that of ""Ad Astra,"" where not only does the spectator share the look of Brad Pitt's character, but that character's cosmos are thoroughly controlled by the father, and namely the character played by Tommy Lee Jones. Not surprisingly, then, what is done with Lacanian psychoanalysis here is equally vapid, if somewhat amusing in a corny way. In the movie, Jones's H. Clifford McBride is lost in space (specifically, in a vessel orbiting Neptune) where his ship is attacking the cosmos with antimatter surges of energy--causing the deaths of thousands of people and generally threatening life on Earth. Pitt's Roy McBride, back on our home planet, or just above it, has followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an astronaut and by renouncing worldly attachments to other people. In Lacan's symbolic order, the figure of the father is identified with that of the law. In the most absurd sense, this is what prevents the son from incest with the mother in that ridiculous Oedipus complex of Freud's. More relevant to a space movie such as ""Ad Astra,"" this role of the father separates the son from attachment to the mother (the person of which is hardly considered in the movie) and towards engagement with the outside world (indeed, quite broadly in this case, as the son becomes an astronaut who travels throughout the solar system).Throughout the picture, Roy struggles with the three Lacanian orders of the father: the symbolic, the imaginary and the real. There's his life that he has built on the basis of the dead hero's legacy, there's his ideal dad he remembers through video recordings and fantasies, and there's the father that others inform him may be still alive and done some terrible things. He also runs up against the bureaucratic law of the space program and the wild-West piracy of the Moon, while Donald Sutherland's character steps in for a while as a father figure. The picture's resulting metaphor has the father inwardly inflicting damage upon the son and outwardly inflicting damage with the ""anti-matter"" of outer space--and searching for life on other planets, while Roy's Oedipus journey leads to his embrace of that which does ""matter,"" which in this case is the bonding with life back on Earth. And we all know what happens to Laius, Oedipus's pops.Which brings me to the male gaze. In between Roy's patriarchal obsessions, he recalls images of a woman (""Eve,"" as portrayed by Liv Tyler)--a mostly-mute figure on screen to be looked at through the spectator's shared point-of-view and identification with Roy. Whether this Eve is Roy's estranged wife, figment of his imagination, or late mother is besides the point. Indeed, the character lacks any self-agency for any of that to matter (even her Biblical name renders her more of a symbol than a character), and she merely represents the figure of the mother or woman in Roy's ordered cosmos. Although, ironically, as we share Roy's perspective--seeing the universe through his eyes as reinforced by voiceover narration--the picture actually spends much of the time on the face of Pitt in those shot/reverse shots. Regardless, this is where another silly notion from psychoanalysis comes in, as the mother in the Oedipus complex is claimed to represent ""castration anxiety"" (supposedly because the child notices mommy's lack of a penis, so boys fear losing theirs, whilst girls envy that of their father's). Well, no wonder Roy prefers to stay clear of getting too attached to Eve. Ordinarily, I wouldn't think too much about this nonsense, except that ""Ad Astra"" seems to focus more on the phallic shape of space-exploration equipment than do other space movies. From the opening scene of Roy straddling an erected phallic antenna, to the elongated shuttles he travels within as they blast off, recall that it's also all in the duty of obeying the law of the father to conquer outer space. Surely, dad would be pleased by the way Roy jostles that joystick in landing one of these flying phalluses on Mars.Whether or not Roy returns to the Freudian framework of attachment with the mother figure, rest assured that the camera's gaze, the picture, remains steadfastly patriarchal. That the corny moral may lead him home, too, while the sci-fi imagery is consumed by space remains likewise contradictory. Such is the influence in the name of the father.",Ad Astra
32,gbill-74877,Disappointing,4,24 May 2020,"Interesting idea but very disappointing. This is a film that doesn't work as science fiction, with its contrived setup and enormous/stupefying plot holes. It also doesn't work as a metaphor of the emotional walls men build and pass down from father to son, as the payoff is very weak, culminating in a cliché moment that had my eyes practically rolling to the back of my head.Look, if you want to make an artistic film, avoid the lame narration that tells us what we can plainly see, and don't include the big Hollywood action moments that bring the film down to the level of a cartoon. If you want to go a more conventional route, get at least some of the science right - I mean, I'm willing to suspend some level of disbelief, but don't be ridiculous. The film tries to play it both ways and it ends up a mess. As for the Heart of Darkness analogy, despite what James Gray said, the most important part of that novel - the interaction with a very different culture (or in this case other life forms) - is completely absent, so I just don't see it.It's a shame too, because there was promise in the commentary on humanity, and the beautiful line ""we're all we've got"" gets buried in a mountain of cheese. The visuals are well done and Brad Pitt turns in a pretty good performance, with a very nice scene in that second transmission to his father.

36,tabuno,Great Visual Sci Fi Movie with A Weaker Script That Needed A Bit More Work,7,23 September 2019,"Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, and Donald Sutherland star in this sci fi, psychological thriller. This gorgeous visual extravaganza on the scale and look of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Ad Astra attempts to replicate the big screen space drama of the likes of Gravity 2013) and Interstellar (2014). The beginning space scenes are strongly reminiscent of the commercialization of space and how sharply distinctively the cinematography resembles that of Stanley Kubrick's 1968 work. What makes this movie more intriguing is the strong father-son relational aspect. However, this movie suffers from an exploitative script that both underwhelms and overwhelms the audience in various ways even as the amazing special effects literally explode on film. The audience becomes unnecessarily confused without more narrative or explanation about the geo-politics and the state of the world and Moon. The drama that takes place on the Moon is rather unconvincing and rather manipulative in its depiction more along the lines of an action movie instead of the more believable drama that occurs in Black Hawk Down (2001) or We Were Soldiers (2002). Even the moon parallel or actually different mode of travel as shown in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) makes the idea of the drama that occurs on the Moon in this movie even less convincing than it would actually have occurred in the way it did. The landing on Mars as shown in Ad Astra might also be somewhat suspect, especially considering thinness of the Mar's atmosphere. The distress call scene is both overkill and yet in some ways well done for its horror-like tension, though it's hard to believe that either the Captain or Brad Pitt's character would have been the ones to actually directly investigate the SOS distress call. While the special emphasis on the relational psychological impact was worthy, it still didn't seem as consistently or sufficiently developed as could be. Solaris (1972, 2002) and Moon (2009) offer more poignant relational and psychological depictions. As for the ending, several alternative endings may have been worth considering including whether or not to follow in one's father's footsteps. Even the actual conclusion of this movie could have been cut earlier and having an even better impact or the transition towards the actual ending could have been improved with better fleshed out scenes between father and son. Overall, this visually amazing movie in the company of similar such major sci fi movies doesn't completely succeed with its somewhat inconsistent and weaker storyline as it was developed. While Brad Pitt does a commendable job in this movie, it feels like he could have done much better if he hadn't been so constrained by the script as it was written. The script needed a least one more do over before it could have been made into what might have easily been the best sci fi movie of the year.",Ad Astra
37,The-Sarkologist,A Journey to the Heart of Darkness,9,24 September 2019,"Some have suggested that this is a sci-fi version of Apocalypse Now, but the thing is that this story goes back to the writings of a brilliant author named Joseph Conrad, and his short story The Heart of Darkness. This is a story about a sailor who goes on a trek up the Congo River to try and find one of the company men named Kurtz. If you haven't read this then I highly recommend that you do so since I don't believe any movie can really capture what Conrad was exploring here.Anyway, in this film we have Roy McBride who is an astronaut that just seems to have this gift of never panicking. Anyway, his father travelled out to the outer regions of the solar system to set up a research base in an attempt to discover whether there was any intelligent life, beyond that on Earth (if we can consider the inhabitants of Earth to be all that intelligent) in the universe. However, all contact was lost with the expedition, and the story was made that his father died a hero.So, years later the Earth is hit by some anti-matter waves and it becomes obvious that these waves are coming from Nepture, where McBride's father was originally sent. Anyway, Roy is summoned in an effort to attempt to contact his father, and thus starts an adventure across the solar system in an attempt to locate his father, and to deal with these anti-matter waves.The premise of the movie is basically about how hostile space travel really is. In fact, it doesn't matter where he goes, death always seems to be just around the corner. The moon has been colonised, but the thing is that because there are no actual borders, it means that once you leave the base you are literally in a realm where pirates and vagabonds rule. This is despite the fact that there happen to be a number of military bases here. The other thing is that communication is not certain either, if we take into account that the distress messages were not received immediately.Let us also consider the research station that was encountered on the way to Mars. It became evident that these experiments on the animals in space literally turned them into monsters. This, in a way, is a foreshadowing of what is coming later. One of the things that the Heart of Darkness explores is that the further one gets from civilisation, the more savage one becomes. This is what happened to Kurtz. We see this in this film, particularly since measuring one's psychological as often as possible. It is clear that there is an acceptance that space travel affect's one's psyche, and this becomes evident as the film progresses.This film is very psychological, particularly since much of it deals with Roy's thoughts and feelings. This is something that is very hard to capture in film, but I believe that they have done it very, very well. Though it is interesting that there is one thing that causes Roy to spike, and that is the suggestion that his father is alive. While for most of the film he is cool and calculated, it is when it comes down to his father there is something that drives his passion. Yet, he even admits that the further he gets out to the edges of the solar system, the more damage his psych takes. It is interesting that despite the fact that he passes Jupiter and Saturn (which is highly unlikely in my opinion, namely because they would need to be in conjunction for that to happen), he does not seem to admire the beauty of what he is seeing.Yet, I still feel that there are issues with space travel. Despite the fact that the director was trying to make it as realistic as possible, I still noticed that they certainly weren't maneuvering the ships in the way that they should be manuvered in space. Further, there are scenes where Roy seems to be able to move despite the fact that he is in a vacuum, and there is nothing that he used to push himself. However, the fact that they did take into account the fact that his bones attropied was something to be applauded.",Ad Astra

You want to expect a twist or a mind bending sci fi story. The film is simple as the trailer made it out to be. A story about astronaut Roy (Brad Pitt) who goes on a mission across the solar system to find out what happened to his father Clifford (Tommy Lee Jones). As his last message and their voyage stopped in Neptunes orbit. And their space station is causing an electrical surge across the galaxy that is affecting Earth.It is a story about a man who is lost. Feeling like he is missing something. Roy wants to find out what is going on with his estranged father. There is nothing mind bending with the sci fi tale besides the idea how space can affect a person with the isolation of being alone for a long time. The idea of being away from home and reaching the ends of the galaxy. Trying to discover intelligent life elsewhere. The concept is pretty cool that people are colonizing on the moon and Mars. The moon if you are not in a station you have to watch out for space pirates that are driving in offroad vehicles.Brad Pitt did well with his performance. He was great playing a character who is losing his love interest Liv Tyler which she can not stand by when he is always out on the move in space missions. Liv Tyler was decent with her character for the brief moment she is in. Same with Tommy Lee Jones who was only in it for a small amount of time.The film's direction is slow moving. It is trying to be like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar movie, Gravity, and 2001 Space Odyssey. The story is not as interesting as those movies. The direction is slow and boring at times. The exciting moments are already shown in the trailers which is all your getting in this film. And there is nothing surprising with its story.Overall, Ad Astra is a fair film. Performances are great. The music score and cinematography worked well with the movie. The script and direction is slow and tedious.",Ad Astra
40,zkonedog,Missing Far Too Much To Be Considered Great,5,25 September 2019,"After watching ""Ad Astra"" in the theater, I sat back and contemplated it as the lights came up and the credits rolled. Though I was impressed (especially in the film's final act) by the themes tackled in this space drama, I ultimately felt as if I were never really pulled into the proceedings on an emotional level. For me, this movie was just missing too many things for me to consider it a success.For a basic plot overview, ""Ad Astra"" sees young NASA astronaut Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) sent on a mission to find out just what is happening with a previous deep-space exploration (at Neptune) that may be threatening life on Earth. The hook? That previous expedition was helmed by the presumed-dead legendary astronaut H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), Roy's father who now may be determined to be alive.There are certainly enough things that ""Ad Astra"" does right to keep it from being a total failure. It touches on deep themes of family, love, and loss. The visuals are top-notch. The acting is generally good, with especially solid turns from Jones and Donald Sutherland (in a brief role).Sadly, there are a number of glaring mistakes here that made me feel like ""Ad Astra"" was a film I had to take at face value, rather than emotionally experience it...-A film can't try to play up a romantic or ""longing for a stable partner"" angle when that partner (in this case the character played by Liv Tyler) is hardly on screen for more than a few moments. Almost no visual connections are made between Pitt's and Tyler's character, so their relationship has to be taken ""as described"" rather than any shown capacity.-A similar problem exists with the Pitt/Jones character relationship. Ostensibly, this entire film is about the young McBride working through his complicated thoughts/emotions surrounding his father. When the two actually meet and interact, however, it ends up feeling like more of a letdown than anything due to there being no context for their relationship other than the standard ""fathers and sons are complicated"" trope. I needed more than just ""Roy resents Clifford for leaving him"" told to me regarding why this was such a big issue in his life. Again, conceptually I understand, but it was only said rather than shown.-The film seems to fall into a bit of the common space-movie trap in that it often wanders off course from its main objectives (in this case the McBride family dynamics) just to service the ""we're in space so we need to do some cool stuff"" vibe. Scenes like a rampaging baboon and a planetary dune-buggy race are cool in the aesthetic sense, but they ultimately serve little to no purpose in the overall proceedings. They could have easily been cut and in their stead had more context for the relationships within the film that so badly needed developing.Overall, my experience with ""Ad Astra"" was a bit of a strange one (perhaps explaining my middle-of-the-road 5-star ranking here). I always get a little nervous when a film (other than Star Wars, I guess) opens with explanatory text, and that is exactly what happened here. Though I feel like I completely understand and appreciate the dynamic(s) the film was going for, I only do so in the academic sense. It never moved me to emotionally invest in any of it.",Ad Astra
41,eddie_baggins,"Both intimate and grand, Ad Astra is a big budget sci-fi with a difference",8,22 September 2019,"As a word of warning, when it comes to Ad Astra, don't believe the trailers.If you have seen James Gray's long gestating sci-fi's trailers/ads you'd be expecting an action packed Sci-fi odyssey and while there's action and thrills to be found in Gray's Brad Pitt starring adventure, Ad Astra is first and foremost a contemplative character study and examination of parental bonds, that just so happens to have eye capturing space scenery for it to play out in.Gray's film takes us to the Moon (featuring a thrilling vehicle chase), Mars and Neptune, while opening with a stunning high atmosphere maintenance job gone wrong that is worth the price of a cinema ticket alone but Gray and his on form A-lister are more concerned with exploring the inner workings of Pitt's stoic and potentially emotionally void astronaut Roy McBride, who has been pulled into a universe spanning mission to unlock the mystery around his father H. Clifford McBride's disappearance while on a life-altering space voyage.Roy McBride is a layered character, a man who has never shown nerves or usual human inhibitions as he undertakes his various dangerous tasks, but a man none the less shaped and formed by his father's disappearance and quest and through both Pitt's at times understated yet beautifully formed turn, McBride becomes one of the years most memorable cinematic creations and a chance for Pitt to remind us all that his one of the very best performers working in the industry today.There may be other's listed on the cast list of Ad Astra such as Donald Sutherland, Ruth Negga, Tommy Lee Jones and the may as well have not shown up Liv Tyler as McBride's estranged wife Eve but make no mistake about it, this is Pitt's film, with the star appearing in virtually every scene, often with DOP Hoyte Van Hoytema's camera formed somewhere close to the actors face (giving off similar vibes to last year's First Man).This allows Pitt to produce one of his most memorable lead turns and he gives Ad Astra an added power that may not have been there with someone else filling McBride's weighty space boots and on the back of his Oscar worthy supporting turn this year in Once Upon a Time In...Hollywood, 2019 has become quite the year for Pitt, who in the previous years has taken more of a backseat role in proceedings rather than an in front of camera one.As McBride's deep space quest (that hearkens back in theme and events to cinematic behemoth Apocalypse Now) takes him further and further into the darkness of the unknown both externally and internally, we are witness to an emotionally charged and personally fulfilling life-shaping experience that is carefully portrayed by Gray and through Pitt's inner monologues, that provide us with an insight into a man slowly but surely coming to terms with who he is and what is important to him.Ad Astra's space-mission with a difference isn't all smooth sailing as the film suffers slightly from pacing issues early on that take a while to get use to, the films somewhat anti-climactic finale feels like it could've been reworked for maximum efficiency, while a word of warning to those cinematic scientists out there that found Interstellar's scientific flaws too much to overcome, Ad Astra has ample holes to be found in its space science that aren't even trying to be hid, so if that's a game changer, give Gray's film a very wide berth.Final Say -Mass audiences may not be ready for Ad Astra's more intimate approach to the space epic, that may cover a lot of genre staples but in a way we have yet to see utilized before but for those that connect with Roy McBride's more personal experience with the great beyond that ponders the questions of mankind and its inability to overcome its flaws, Ad Astra will become one of the year's most memorable original outings that features an awards worthy Pitt as its centrepiece.4 space baboons out of 5",Ad Astra
42,leonblackwood,Worth a one-watch! 5/10,5,29 January 2020,"Review:
I didn't have high hopes for this movie because I hadn't heard anything good about it, but it actually turned out to be OK. Don't get me wrong, the whole dark and moody tone, which doesn't change through the whole film, did get to me after a while but the various twists made it watchable. Brad Pitt played Roy McBride well, even though his persona is extremely downbeat, and he was able to draw you in, through emotions more than words. The huge sets were put together well, and it really looked like Roy McBride was in space but you have to be in the right mood to watch it. There are some intense scenes, like when Roy meets his father H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), and when they were being chased by bandits, but I still struggled to keep my eyes open in parts. Anyway, in the near future, the Solar System is struck by mysterious power surges, threatening all human life. After nearly dying from an incident caused by a surge, Major Roy McBride, is informed by U.S. Space Command (SpaceCom) that the surges have been traced to the ""Lime Project"", created 29 years earlier to search the limits of the Solar System for intelligent life, under Clifford's leadership, from which nothing has been heard for 16 years after reaching Neptune. Told that Clifford may still be alive, Roy accepts a mission to travel to Mars to try to establish communication with him, joined by his father's old associate Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland). Roy, famed among his fellow astronauts for keeping calm under pressure, shows little emotional reaction to the news that his father may be alive. After taking a commercial flight to the Moon, Roy and Pruitt are escorted by US military personnel to the SpaceCom base, located in a disputed war zone on the far side of the moon. En route in lunar rovers, they are ambushed by scavenging pirates, who kill their entire escort and severely wound Pruitt. Upon arrival at the base, a dying Pruitt is placed into intensive care. Roy transfers to the ship Cepheus, bound for Mars. The ship receives a distress signal from a Norwegian biomedical research space station. Captain Tanner has the Cepheus stop to investigate despite Roy's protests, and Roy and Tanner make their way to the station. It appears abandoned and the two split up, but Roy soon discovers an escaped baboon test subject feeding on Tanner, who is severely injured. It attacks Roy when it notices his presence, but he manages to kill it along with another escaped baboon that attacks him shortly thereafter. Despite Roy's attempts to save him, Tanner dies from his injuries, and a brief service is held where Tanner's body is ejected into space. Again, Roy shows little reaction to Tanner's death, but in a psychological evaluation, he admits that he experiences rage and recalls his father expressing his own rage. Another surge hits as the Cepheus lands on Mars, requiring manual piloting to complete the landing. The interim captain freezes in fear, while Roy using his vast experience as a space pilot remains calm and takes command of the ship, landing it safely. Roy is led to the underground SpaceCom base, where he meets facility director Helen Lantos (Ruth Negga) and is tasked with recording voice messages to send to the Lima Project in hopes that Clifford will respond. Roy goes off-script with an emotional appeal to his father and is abruptly removed from the mission on the grounds of his personal connection posing a risk to himself and the mission's success. From the reaction of the observation team to his emotional recording, he assumes correctly that immediate response from his father had been received and demands to hear it. After being sent to the ""comfort room"", he is visited by Lantos, who reveals that she was born on Mars and was the daughter of Lima Project crew members. She shows Roy classified footage revealing that Clifford's crew had mutinied and tried to return to Earth, causing him to turn off their life-support systems, and her parents were among those killed by Clifford. She tells Roy that the crew that brought him to Mars is leaving on the Cepheus to destroy the Lima project station with a nuclear payload. The two decide that Roy should confront Clifford himself, and Helen leads Roy to an underground lake beneath the rocket launch site. Roy clandestinely climbs aboard as the rocket takes off and is subsequently discovered by the crew, who are instructed to neutralise him. The entire crew is inadvertently killed in the ensuing confrontation. During the long journey to Neptune, a solitary Roy reflects on his relationships with his father and Eve (Liv Tyler), his estranged wife. The isolation and stress of the mission take a mental toll, but after a couple of months, he arrives at the Lima Project. While approaching the station in a shuttle attached to the Cepheus, the shuttle is damaged in a collision with objects in Neptune's rings and from another surge, preventing it from docking with the station. Roy enters the station via a space-walk while the shuttle drifts away. Will Roy finally unite with his Father and get a full explanation about his intentions? You have to watch the film to see the outcome if you haven't already! Personally, I wouldn't watch the movie twice because I was left feeling glum and depressed by the end of it. There are many hidden messages which people can relate to, and there are some emotional moments that are pretty deep but I just found it hard to ""stay in the moment"". It was a great achievement by the director, in terms of the look and performances but it needed some upbeat moments to make it a unique piece. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by James Gray, who also brought you Little Odessa in 1994, The Yards, We Own The Night, Two Lovers, The Immigrant and the Lost City of Z which starred Charlie Hunnam, Robert Pattinson, Sienna Miller and Tom Holland. He hasn't become a household name as of yet, and this movie won't push him up the scale, but I don't think that he was looking to produce a blockbuster because this project was close to his heart. He had a personal connection to the storyline, after losing a family member, so I think that he was mostly concerned about getting the ""father/son"" message across, in an emotional way. I'm glad that he didn't smother the script with loads of technical jargon, and I was impressed with the attention to detail, so it wasn't a total let down.Budget: $87.5million

43,TheMovieDiorama,"Ad Astra galactically depicts sorrow, proving that no one can hear you cry in space.",8,19 September 2019,"For the past few years, dramas set in the expansive dangers of space have been my bread and butter. Devouring them during my annual breakfast as I purposefully starve myself for the taste of space traversal. Every year, the likes 'Arrival', 'Blade Runner 2049', 'First Man', 'Interstellar' and my all-time favourite film 'Gravity', have secured scores ranging from outstanding to perfect. Whilst Ad Astra may be tilting towards the former adjective, it's still irrefutably one of the best films of the year thanks to Gray's understanding, yet again, of what makes a character study captivating. After unearthing the possibility that his missing father may still be alive, his astronaut son travels across the Solar System in search for him and to unravel a mysterious power surge phenomenon that threatens humanity's survival.Immediately, one thing I need to brush off my chest is the horrendous marketing. This is not a sci-fi blockbuster. There is limited ""action"". And if you're wanting the next 'Star Wars' or 'Avatar', then remove yourself from the cinema and watch mind-numbing nonsense like 'Angel Has Fallen' instead. This is a James Gray extravaganza. A meticulously woven character study, harnessing melancholia to challenge an existential crisis. Thematically, Ad Astra's premise bolsters a plethora of metaphorical imagery that divulges into the empirical purpose of humanity. Majestic planets emitting every prismatic shade available, yet emanating no emotional connectivity. The vacuous expansivity of space, marking humanity's reflection on life as a mere speck of stardust. Worldly hostility reaching the depths of our galaxy, hyperbolising the ""world-eating"" philosophy of our own self-destruction as a species. The obsession to venture forth. Departing love, hate and grief. Welcoming nothingness.Gray's space-opera is a sorrowful tale, intently focusing on the pressures of a son following in the footsteps of his acclaimed father. A patriarch of inspiration to many. Allowing a tangible tense bond to illuminate the stars with despair and anguish. Pitt's universally nuanced performance brings forward stoic mannerisms that allow McBride to feel these emotions. Minor glitches that break character, such as slamming the wall in frustration, showcase the purity of humanity within him.Gray encompasses the plot around McBride. The lunar pirate raid, mayday rescue and crew brawl scenes, whilst inserting mainstream tendencies into a contemporary drama, were emblems of McBride's emotions. Fear, rage and desperation respectively. A series of gestures that, again, hark back to humanity's endurance. The mildly engaging supporting cast, ranging from Jones, Sutherland and Negga, acting as stability for McBride. Stepping stones allowing him to find his father, as if fate was dictating his alignment. Narration, shifting between inner thoughts to exposition, was overused and irked me with its basic functionality. Hoytema's cinematography could've elicited these unnecessary lines of dialogue from his beautiful imagery. And beautiful just doesn't do it justice.Immediately, from the iridescent opening shot, Hoytema takes hold. Utilising colours and shadows to produce the incarnation of life, what it means to see. The blue of Neptune, the red of Mars. Clashing tonalities resembling McBride's emotions. Accompanied by Richter's euphoric score and the almost '2001' production design, and Ad Astra is technically a masterful piece of art. Gray's conclusion is teetering on the edge of underwhelming, for me atleast, with its rushed journey home that dissipated the simmering sorrow built exquisitely beforehand. The ending I personally would've desired, would be the ending no one wanted (but that's life I guess...).Regardless, the small criticisms here and there are subject to change upon an inevitable rewatch. Gray is fast becoming one of my favourite directors. He is a man who understands character. He acknowledges the obsession of man. Amalgamating life's wondrously challenging hurdles into singular expressive characters. Ad Astra's meditative and resonant pacing, whilst is sure to put many viewers off, ensures that loss and grief are captured wherever a soul may be. At home or in deep space. It never vanishes.",Ad Astra
44,matthewssilverhammer,Bad Astra,4,27 September 2019,"Ad Astra isn't your run-of-the-mill bad movie. It boasts a stellar cast of caring characters, led by Pitt in one of his best turns in years. The visuals are magnificent, representing another steppingstone in space-travel reality that's basically impeccable. Its baser elements of action and terror are surprising and exciting, as director Gray displays a real skill for knowing when to slow down and when to blast off. Unfortunately, all these numerous positives only serve to make it more frustrating. Its apparent potential is washed away by the magnitude of narrative annoyances and thematic insecurities.
Pitt plays a veteran astronaut, sent on a mission to Neptune to stop his long-presumed-dead father from destroying all Earthly existence. Is his father alive? If so, is he really to blame? What exactly has he been hiding from all this time? These are compelling mysteries that the film sets up, before letting them putter to a boring and shockingly predictable end.
In lieu of a compelling story arch, the film leans into its thematics, which are certainly compelling. With an intense spirituality to the visual storytelling, it argues for an appreciation of our everyday mundanities, especially if our search for bigger meaning gets in the way. It's a sci-fi space epic that believes love is humanity's ultimate purpose.
That's all fine, except much like Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, Ad Astra takes away our desire and ability to read that subtext by obnoxiously and repeatedly spelling it out, including through some of the worst narration ever spewed. When it comes to a movie's ""point"", some artful hand-holding is fine (see Gravity), but a little more trust in the audience's intelligence would be nice.",Ad Astra

48,southdavid,Monkey Business,5,7 October 2019,"Slightly underwhelming that my 300th review on here should be for something as forgettable as ""Ad Astra"" but here we are.Set in the near future, and with the Earth suffering from a potentially cataclysmic series of galactic bursts, Astronaut Roy Mcbride (Brad Pitt) is tasked with crossing the Galaxy, to Mars in order to try and contact the source of the bursts, an antimatter experimentation facility, out near Neptune. The facility, long thought failed, was helmed by McBride's father H Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) with whom Roy has held a complicated relationship.Beautiful but dull, would be my three word review of ""Ad Astra"". The space effects, including lunar bases, Martian outposts and all manner of Rockets are excellent. There are lots of gloriously 2001-esque shot choices, overlays and images. Also good is Brad Pitt's performance. His character doesn't utilise any of his easygoing charm, he's closed off emotionally and almost suicidal at certain points of the film, but there's gravitas to his performance that few other actors could have brought to the role, despite it largely taking the form of internal narration.The trouble is, space as a metaphor for the distance between people has been done before. ""Space moping"" is almost a genre of cinema itself - ""Contact"", ""Interstellar"", ""Solaris"". The story of Pitt's journey to Mars isn't particularly interesting despite the ""Pirates on the Moon"" scene and the (frankly hilarious) space monkeys reveal. I'm not sure I ever buy into the world the film is proposing. The human race is fighting for resources on the moon, but we've also turned the main moon base into a Subway/KFC generic airport. Which is it? In addition, I'm not a rocket scientist, by any stretch of the imagination, but much of the physics of the film didn't add up for me (even down to its central premise which I won't go further because I'm not wanting to post spoilers.)I understand what the film was about, but it still takes a long time to deliver a trite message in a way we've seen before.",Ad Astra

50,Vartiainen,Thinks it's the next 2001: A Space Odyssey - it's not,3,28 September 2021,"In Ad Astra, Major Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) learns that there's a possibility his father, also an astronaut by trade, might still be alive somewhere far beyond Neptune, despite having gone missing decades ago. But how is this discovery tied to the strange power surges that threaten all life on Earth?What Ad Astra is, most of all, is boring. Its story structures are very loose, don't tie up together at all and quite a lot of the running time of the film we're left floating in the proverbial vacuum of not knowing what's happening or why.It doesn't help that Roy's defining characteristic is that he doesn't react to anything. He's very calm, very nondescript, very aloof. Even with Brad Pitt playing the role, does that sound like something you'd want to follow for over two hours?It also doesn't help that the ending is so... nothing. This film clearly thinks it's saying much more than it is actually saying. Like it's examining these great big mysteries of the universe, being the next 2001: A Space Odyssey. And to be fair, there definitely is some resemblance, visual-wise. But the cold honest truth is that the ending falls flat on its face.Not a movie I can recommend.

We then get to know Major Roy McBride, who is working on the International Space Antenna. He barely survives a fall from the Antenna, which was hit by a mysterious power surge. In a subsequent top secret briefing, he is told that the multiple surges are sourced to the Lima Project, which was spearheaded by Roy's dad Clifford. The Lima Project disappeared years ago, but now it is believed that Clifford may still be alive. Roy accepts the request to travel to Mars to make contact with his dad. At this point we're just over 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from writer-producer-director James Gray (""The Immigrant"", ""The Lost City of Z""). Here he brings an epic space drama to the big screen. The movie is plot-heavy so the less I say about that, the better. But I will add this: the movie is nothing short of spectacular, and DEMANDS to be seen on the big screen (I saw it in XS, Cinemark's version of IMAX. Brad Pitt stars front and center in this, and just like he did in his other recent movie (""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood""), he oozes confidence without coming across arrogantly. Tommy Lee Jones stars as his dad, and Donald Sutherland has a small role (5 min. of screen time) as an erstwhile colleague and friend of his dad. The photography is pure eye-candy from start to finish. Last but not least, kudos to Max Richter for composing a phenomenal original score.""Ad Astra"" premiered a few weeks ago at the Venice film festival to immediate critical acclaim. There is a reason this movie s currently rated 83% certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes! The movie opened wide this weekend. The Sunday early evening screening where I sat this at here in Cincinnati was attended dismally, much to my surprise (maybe 20 people in a huge theater)/ Regardless, if you liked space movies such as ""2001"", ""Gravity"", ""First Man"" etc., I would readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Ad Astra
52,subxerogravity,Brad was great In A film that was a little dull.,7,23 September 2019,"Reminds me of the film Arrival. People keep saying that movie was one of the greatest science fiction tales ever but I don't see that, I just see a dull picture. Same with this one. The pace is like Blade Runner 2049 but the story was not as interesting. Brad Pitt is really good in the film but not as good as Matthew McConaughey, Matt Damon and Sandra Bullock were in the astronaut alone in space situation. Listening to this dude narrate this story was only good if I was trying to get to sleep.
The visual effects are not amazing they are just workable. They had this cool chase scene on the moon that was more amazing in the fact that they attempted to show you what a car chase on the moon would really be like versus it actually being an exciting car chase, although my science is not that good to tell how actuate it is.
Maybe because I saw it in a fake IMAX theatre over a real IMAX is the reason I did not like the visual sci-fi but nothing in this movie was appealing enough to get me to go out of my way to see it again.",Ad Astra
53,jtindahouse,Solid but forgettable,6,16 October 2019,"Something interesting I noticed about James Gray's movies is that they all have a very similar rating around the 7/10 mark. Almost without exception they are all right there. What it implies to me is that he makes very solid films consistently, but never dares to push the boundaries and be bold and do something great. 'Ad Astra' falls very much into the same category. It's a wonderfully put together production, with some solid acting and a well constructed plot line, but I can almost guarantee after tomorrow I'll never think about this film again.Brad Pitt is a terrific actor who can carry almost any movie all on his own. He's in terrific form in 'Ad Astra' although it is a very sombre and withheld performance for the most part. Normally when I'm finished watching a Pitt performance I'm left with a ""want to be him"" feeling, but not so much on this occasion.'Ad Astra; goes into the basket of ""I'm glad I've seen it, but never again thank you"". This isn't going to harm anyone or offend anyone's senses by any means. It's hard to imagine anyone hating this film, but it's also hard to imagine anyone overly loving it either. Hopefully Gray goes on to take some risks along the way in his career. He's got talent there's no doubt about it, now he just needs to add some flare into the mix.",Ad Astra
54,Turfseer,Brad Pitt lethargic near future sci-fi vehicle has its moments but the payoff proves kind of disappointing,5,30 September 2019,"The latest Brad Pitt vehicle is directed by James Gray. It's a sci-fi drama much more akin to ""Gravity"" than ""Star Trek,"" as it's set in the near future without any trace of extraterrestrials. To his credit, Gray presents a much realistic portrait of space travel in the near future. There's no ""warp drive"" but simply rockets with a little more booster power.
Pitt plays the protagonist, Major Roy McBride, who is the son of the famed astronaut, H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), who disappeared 16 years earlier while at the helm of the Lima Project, a mission searching for our obligatory extraterrestrials, last heard from in the vicinity of Neptune.
Suddenly earth is experiencing terrible power surges in which thousands are killed. Roy is almost killed himself when one of the surges propels him off a launching platform (he's saved by his trusty parachute). The U.S. Space Command (SpaceCom) has discovered that Roy's father may still be alive and may be the source of (and responsible for) these power surges.
Roy accepts the top secret assignment to travel to Mars where he can attempt to communicate with his father (in the event he's still alive). First Roy must stop off on the moon where there are already commercial flights to a lunar landscape replete with massive underground tunnels, run by the US government in this particular sector. To get to where the rocket takes off for Mars, Roy first meets up with his father's old associate, Colonel Pruitt (Bruce Dern) and they are set upon by scavenging pirates in ""no man's land,"" while traveling to the government base in lunar vehicles.
Pruitt is wounded and will later succumb to his injuries. While Gray stages the pirate attack with aplomb, it's a scene that's largely ineffective, since we never find out who these marauders are who are responsible for attacking Roy and his father's old pal. What's more,there's no sense of the nature of the conflict on the moon-Gray and his co-writer Ethan Gross merely allude to some kind of friction between competing companies that run the mining interests on the moon.
On the way to Mars in the spaceship Cepheus, Gray throws in another aside obviously designed to ramp up the action where there is little present until Roy's climactic confrontation with his father at film's end. The captain of the ship receives a distress call from a Norwegian biomedical research space station. Turns out that everybody there has been murdered by lab baboons who also kill the Cepheus's captain.
Keep in mind everything here proceeds at a lethargic pace (except for the pirate attack on the moon and the baboons that have run amuck). So on Mars Roy simply sends voice messages to his father in what looks like a small recording studio and is then promptly taken off the mission (presumably because he gets too emotional while sending out one of the messages to his father).
Lantos, an administrator and native to Mars shows Roy a video recording of his father admitting that he was forced to kill the entire crew of the Lima Project after they mutinied, in a futile attempt to return to Earth. Now SpaceCom decides to send a spaceship containing a small nuclear payload to blow up Roy's father and what's left of the Lima Project.
In an unlikely scenario, Roy boards the spaceship headed for Neptune just as it takes off and is forced to kill the crew after they attack him. There's another long-winded scene as Roy travels to Neptune which takes over two months. Here he reflects on his relationship with his father and his estranged wife, Eve.
There's not much more to say about Ad Astra. The climax is a bit disappointing. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. It turns out Roy's father was not responsible for the power surges-rather it was some kind of malfunctioning anti-matter power source (whatever that is), damaged during the mutiny. Roy saves earth by blowing up his father's space station along with the errant power source but his father chooses to kill himself by using his power thrusters to drift into deep space after failing to realize his lifelong dream of finding extraterrestrial life.
There's some redemption for the McBride family name (as Roy's father was indeed not responsible for causing the power surges). But somehow the father's big failures,and downbeat decision to do himself in, pegs him as a bit of a futuristic sad sack. Yes I get the idea that Roy has an epiphany about his dad at film's end-that parents don't always prove to live up to the idealistic image we have of them in childhood. But this ""bittersweet"" revelation and conclusion just isn't all that exciting as is the rest of the film which has its moments but doesn't quite captivate.",Ad Astra

The CGI is excellent but there is nothing to the story, to the point where the writers have to fill time with ridiculous chases and gunfights on the moon or an irrelevant 'rescue mission' in response to a Mayday signal (the point of these events seems to be to kill of secondary characters so Pitt's character gets to do all the heroics). The whole plot seems contrived and the ending is flat, unrealistic (even within context) and unsatisfying. The design and special effects are good but, as usual, Hollywood can't stand having physics interfere with narrative, so sounds in space, etc. All in all, a waste of talent in an uninteresting story that seems to desire the appearance of social conscience but in the end just comes across as a superficial space-opera.",Ad Astra

It really had all the makings for campy Science Fiction fun. The potential was there.But, instead, the film took itself too seriously... so seriously that kind of lost the fun element behind it. And it took itself seriously because of the political message attached to it, and unfortunately it's kind of directed towards the ""everything has to be political all the time"" crowd and they take everything so seriously that nothing can be fun.But the potential was there. It wasn't dark enough to be Sci-Fi Horror ala Alien... and the plot lends itself to campy Sci-Fi adventure, or at least a Sci-Fi adventure... and even there politics are integral to the plot. Science Fiction is a satire of some element of culture, but it's done in a way that is entertaining.Had they toned it down a bit, had they not thought they were making Chinatown, it would have been much better.Instead what you have is pretentious, heavy handed, and boring.",Ad Astra

This is a visually stunning but slow paced space story. There is some action but it's not action packed. Brad is an astronaut just like his father, Tommy. Tommy went on a mission to Neptune to find extraterrestrial life and was never heard from again and presumed dead-Brad was just a kid at the time. 30 years later, weird energy pulses start hitting the earth-disrupting anything electrical-and they are coming from Neptune. Coincidence? Brad is sent to find out what is going on before the whole solar system is in trouble. Donald is an old friend of Tommy's that advises Brad before his trip and Ruth is in charge of the Mars colony-a midway stop on the journey to Neptune-that has a personal connection. FYI: Ad Astra is Latin for 'To the stars'.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 2 minutes.

61,alindsay-al,An Above Average Visually Stunning Film,6,27 September 2019,"I think over the last few years films in space have been high in quality such as Gravity, The Martian & Interstellar so I was excited for this movie, I enjoyed this movie but knowhere near as much as those other movies even though visually this film is superior to any of them. The premise of the movie sees a damaged astronaught have to travel to Neptune to attempt to track down his long lost Father and save the world. Brad Pitt plays the lead in this film and he gives a good dramatic performance in this film, this is one of his stronger emotional perrformances of his career. However, his character is very stoic in this film and I felt this made his character bland and just somebody I guess I didn't really care about. Tommy Lee Jones plays his astranged Father in this film and even though he is not on screen that much I found him easily the most interesting character in this film with actual moral ambiguity. Ruth Negga has a small role in the film and her character had some interest but she is so underused that it becomes frustrating as to why her character was even in the film. The rest of the cast are very forgettable and it feels like they were just shoehorned into the film to create artifical conflict. The story has some interesting moral issues that it has to deal with and a great climax that I felt fit the overall story very well. Though it felt like this film had some random encounters in it in a way to pad the movie out and allow it to be long enough to be a feature length film. The script as mentioned is heavy on the drama and delivers some of it well to make you think about the film you are watching. Howvwer, when having a charismatic lead man such as Brad Pitt could it have hurt to try and use his strengths a little bit and add a bit of humour to this dark and drab film. Also this film utilies Voiceover Monologues a lot and it comes across as indulgent and it feels like it is holding your hand and accusing you of being dumb and not being capable to follow the film. The style of this film though is amazing, the space scenes look truly beautiful, never has space looked so huge and make us feel small as humans, no matter what the scenary the one thing to take from this movie is just how beautiful it is to look at.

But I found much of this film too unspecified and lacking narrative momentum to be fully engaging. The story is a clearly allegorical about father/sons and God/man but what the film is trying to say about them is too esoteric for my taste. On a plot level I am still not entirely sure on the how or what or why of the surge thing. And given that is the major tension within the story it was a huge annoyance not getting a clear picture of it.Despite the narrative short comings the film is wonderful to watch. The space travel is fully realized and the soundscapes are more accurate than they usually are. It all has been done before but the space travel stuff in this film is still cool to look at. I feel like people who like hard core sci-fi would get more from this film than I did.,Ad Astra

There are certainly some questionable moments in the movie yet they don't detract enough for me to hamper the core story of the impact of a father seeking extra-terrestrial life so passionately that he ignores his son, even when he had endured a bold mission to locate him.

I appreciate that the filmmakers endeavored to be mostly accurate about the physics involved, but I was struck by the dust floating in the ""air"" on the journey across the moon, and especially, the way the characters walked around on the Moon and on Mars. Due to the much lesser gravity of these bodies, it is not possible for humans to stroll about in the same manner as on Earth. Look at how the Apollo astronauts moved about on the surface of the Moon.

75,peterp-450-298716,A slow-paced drama that wants to be a SF eagerly.,5,26 December 2019,"Colonel, for what it means,
I think my father is dead.I can fully understand that when you haven't heard from a friend who lives a few blocks away for a long time, you get prepped and plan a visit to the person in question. Just like that. Just to find out why he or she hasn't been in touch all this time. And to check whether everything is still alright. In most cases, you're actually not going to experience anything exciting or breathtaking along the way. Now, extrapolate this situation to a much greater distance. From Earth to Neptune, for example. That's an enormously long time that you are on the road. And if you're lucky, you won't come across any life-threatening or perilous situations either. In short, you are on a spaceship, feeling at ease and try to kill some time. Maintaining your ecosystem daily. Going through your huge pile of magazines full of crosswords that need to be solved. Or you give your spaceship a decent scrubbing every week. All sorts of things so as not to get mad out of boredom. I'm afraid that many home viewers will do the same things while watching ""Ad Astra"".Claiming that there's really nothing happening in ""Ad Astra"" is, of course, a bit exaggerated. For example, there are space pirates on the moon targeting the convoy, with Brad Pitt among the travelers. Apparently, building a high-tech space station on the moon is a piece of cake. But a solid defense system to throw naughty space pirates back into the infinite galaxy (far, far away) was apparently too much to ask. Next, there's also a run-in with a crazy primate on a space ship in distress. And the end of the film is also provided with some fragments that are more action-rich. But most of this two-hour-long SF is nevertheless filled with a lot of complaining, staring at an undefined point and moments of self-reflection. To be honest, I'd call it a demonstration of navel-gazing among the stars.I confess. I expected something completely different. Let me put it this way. I would have preferred ""Ad Astra"" to be more in the corner of films such as ""Interstellar"" or ""Gravity"" (although I wasn't a big fan of the latter). The first is a more scientifically oriented SF about black holes and dimensions and whatnot. While ""Gravity"" wanted to be the most populistic one. And this by having George Clooney and Sandra Bullock make a round dance in space. I link ""Ad Astra"" to a movie like ""High Life"". This was also such a film where the aspect of human psychology and conflict situations between individuals took center stage. And just like the other listed movies, there are some amazing visual highlights in this movie. Those images of space looked impressive on the large silver screen despite their minimalistic character at certain moments. But then again, I wasn't waiting for a story about an intergalactic father-son relationship with all its ups and downs.The most impressive thing about the film? The acting by Brad Pitt. The way he plays the astronaut Roy McBride is simply stunning. An autistic character whose numbness and phlegmatic nature make him a suitable candidate for carrying out such an expedition. The way he performs the psychological evaluation tests bears witness to total body control and lack of emotions. Roy McBride is a person whose heart rate never exceeds 80 beats per minute. Not even in a life-threatening situation when he tumbles out of the atmosphere. And the way he shows how emotions slowly seep into his system is simply admirable. After ""Once upon a time ... in Hollywood"" this is also a rendition with which he could receive a well-known award. They also managed to bait star actors such as Liv Tyler, Donald Sutherland, and Tommy Lee Jones. The roles of the first two, however, have little to no impact.""Ad Astra"" is not an epic space story full of sensational space battles or creatively worked out aliens. Apart from some sporadically added action-rich scenes, this is a film full of philosophical musings and impressions of weighty loneliness. I fear that the opinions about ""Ad Astra"" will be divided. Some will regard it as the most moving film of the year. In general, the Film Press has words of praise for it. So trust me, it's a film that will be loved by the connoisseurs of the ""better"" film. Others are more likely to call it plain boring. The message about the loss of a parent and the search for that parent is kind of obvious. There's even a theological theme to discern. The result, however, is an end-product that looks long-winded with a denouement which isn't really satisfying. Well, I'm sure that an Oscar nomination will be in place next year. But for me, it remains an honorable mention.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Ad Astra

Brad Pitt shines as Roy McBride, bringing another A-Game performance to his career and this year alone with this thought provoking performance. The character of Roy McBride is brilliantly written, with enough monologue and thought for the character to fit just right in with the films complex storyline. For many, the film may seem dull at times, and it does have its moments of being so. The film, for the most part, is rather slow, but unlike many slow films, it has a purpose. The film relies on character depth and centers the story around them in truly interesting ways, making each little detail seem a little closer to lifelike than the next. The film is also beautifully shot, with some amazing cinematography, and many other good performances. In the end, Ad Astra is not a film for all, but for the most part, it is one of a kind, and the last type of film we may see from 20th Century Fox for a while.

The metaphors are deep and varied. The visuals are stunning, the universe building is incredible.The main downside is the pacing. It feels really slow and drawn out at times. There were a few times I found myself glancing at my watch.

He is supposed to have died a hero, but Roy is still bother by the fact that Clifford abandoned him and his mother.Following electrical storms, Roy is shipped from Earth, to the Moon and then to Mars in the attempt to reach his father, who is actually alive but possibly very much deranged as the sole survivor of the Lima project.Humans built a vulgar, commercial station on the Moon where violent gangs fight for the control of mines, while the last human outpost on Mars is bleak, depressing and claustrophobic. Instead of accepting the obvious (ie, Mars in not for humans) they try to fix the problem with music and colourful images projected on white walls.Roy ends up all alone travelling to Pluto and finally reaching the source of the mystery.There are some issues with plot, such as what did Clifford (and crew) ate for some 20 years orbiting around Pluto, but I still found the film hypnotically fascinating for its mix of believable (the vulgarity of human colonisation) and the psychological issues.

80,valleyjohn,Beautifully serene,8,11 March 2021,"I've heard Ad Astra described as slow , & boring but that's absolutely nonsense. The way I'd describe this film is serene , tranquil even and really liked it .Brad Pitt plays Astronaut Roy McBride who undertakes a mission across the solar system to uncover the truth about his missing father and his doomed expedition that now, 30 years later, threatens the universe.You can interpret this film in many ways but my take on it , is that it's about the relationship between a father and son.
The father is obsessed with looking for life on another planet while sacrificing his own person life .
The son is dedicated to his job in the same way but realises the sacrifices he is making to his family thanks to his fathers mistakes.This film is beautifully shot and the sound , or lack of it , is beautiful.
Because it's set in space it feels so calming and you get the feeling of time passing by very slowly .There are exciting moments but for the most part it's pedestrian and that's no way a criticism.Brad Pitt is fantastic.

81,truemythmedia,A Journey into Space and the Self,8,26 November 2019,"Like in his previous film ""The Lost City of Z,"" James Gray explores the idea of obsession and the search for meaning or truth in a deliberately paced and symbolic journey into the soul. If you watch this movie because you like Brad Pitt or because you wanted a sci-fi adventure then I am afraid you will be disappointed by how slow the film is, and how unconcerned it is by walking the audience through all of the repercussions of some of the world building.This movie is interested in doing something that few people will call entertaining. For some though, the slow journey into the psyche of Roy McBride, who seems wholly unflappable and dedicated to his mission yet finds that his personal attachments are stronger than he suspected, will be a journey into their own minds and hearts.For me, this film made even more impact by the heavy use of religious references and imagery as well as the inclusion of characters who have their own obsessions with seeking extraterrestrial life. The movie certainly has a point of view on religion that I do not share but I didn't feel like it was unfair at all in its portrayal nor was it overtly harsh.The focus of the film is on the personal journey of one man as he journeys closer and closer to his father, a mysterious figure lauded as a hero by most but to a few, a potential madman who has come unhinged.I would love to wax eloquent on this film and the ideas that it posits but I found the film to be a more personal experience that defies my ability to relate. It had me asking questions about my own father and my own search for meaning. To relate these thoughts would be more the fodder of an essay or memoir than a film review.All I can say is generalities that I hope will attract the right kind of person to this film. If you find yourself thinking, that sounds boring, or sounds confusing, then this probably isn't the film for you. If, however, you are the sort that wants to see a sci-fi film with more in common with ""Interstellar"" and ""2001"" than ""Star Wars"" or ""Starship Troopers"" then this film may be up your alley.The cinematography and effects are breathtaking and seamless. There is an action sequence on the moon which is one of the most inventive and unique I have seen in a sci-fi film in years. The imagery that is employed in the film also lends to the sense of journeying inward even as the character moves outward, further and further from the earth.
For all the praise I'm heaping on this movie, it isn't a perfect film. The movie tries really hard to be scientifically accurate but it definitely stretches into the realm of suspending disbelief in more than a couple scenes and unfortunately the climax of the film is a little bit of a letdown, not bringing to a satisfying conclusion this journey on which we have been.There is still more than enough here for me to buy the film from a bargain bin at some point and given the right ask, I would even see it in theaters again, but then again, I am exactly the kind of person this movie is for and I'm pretty sure at this point in the review, you'll know if it was made for you too.",Ad Astra

86,davidmvining,A Son becoming his own Man...in Space!,7,21 July 2020,"This has the marks of a movie that should have been an independent production but needed studio money to make. Most of the independent streak of its director, James Gray, is intact, but there seems to be a compromise. I think that mainly manifests in the movie's length. It's a two-hour film that feels like it should be at least two and a half, if not three hours long. Scenes move too quickly, never really luxuriating in the details like the scenes often feel like they should be in order to enhance the experience. Instead, it skips through these little moments too quickly, getting every moment into the film even if they feel underserved.Even without reading James Gray's own take on his movie, it seemed obvious that the two largest influences to Ad Astra were 2001: A Space Odyssey and Apocalypse Now. 2001 is the most obvious considering the new film's setting, but Apocalypse Now is probably the most pertinent. The new added wrinkle is the personal connection that exists between Roy McBride and the object of his search, his father Clifford McBride. Gray makes the story one about a son learning who he is in relation to his father and getting confronted with the choice of either being like his father or becoming someone else.A shock wave ripped through the solar system, emanating from Neptune, the furthest planet (Pluto be damned, I guess) which was the ultimate destination of Clifford McBride, a legendary astronaut sent out to search for alien intelligence free from the interference from the sun. Contact with McBride had broken sixteen years into his mission, roughly ten years before the start of the movie, so there are assumptions that Clifford is behind the shock waves that are knocking out electronics, and the space administration secretly sends Roy to Mars to speak to Clifford through a communication channel that wasn't hurt by the wave.What ends up driving the plot forward is Roy's sense of isolation, a trait that he ends up sharing with his father. The movie actually starts with Roy giving a psychological profile (a common occurrence through the first half of the film) where he describes his mental state. The profiles aren't important for showing Roy's personal feelings at the time (he lies through most of them and the program seems to accept the lies even if it probably knows that they are lies) but the first one in particular shows Roy's worldview. His complete dedication to the mission, to his job, intercut with flashes of his ex-wife (played by Liv Tyler) walking out on him end up mirroring with Clifford's late admonition where he says that he never loved Roy or his mother. All that mattered to both Clifford and Roy was the job, and Roy ends up following in Clifford's exact footsteps as he goes from Mars to Neptune. It's there, confronted with his father for the first time in decades, that Roy finally sees that he's becoming the man who abandoned him, and he has to make a choice about who he will be.The movie is in the tradition of some of the best science fiction, using the rather grounded science to tell a human story, but as I said before, I think it moves too quickly. There's obviously a desire on the part of the film and filmmakers to instill a sense of awe, especially late in the film when Roy reaches Neptune. The sights are truly great, but there isn't enough time to let them wash over the audience, limiting their impact. I think, in terms of visual grandeur, the best recent example was Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life and it's extended creation of the cosmos segment that did allow those images to linger, accumulating power as they stayed on screen long enough for the audience to really appreciate things like scale and scope.Another smaller thing about the film is that its episodic structure kind of grates. It's natural for a ""there and back again"" story to have episodes along the way, and Ad Astra doesn't fall into the trap of having events just to have events, but they stand out more than I think they should. I keep going back to the distress call on the way to Mars where the ship stops to help a vessel adrift to find a pair of raging apes who had killed the Norwegian craft's crew. It does have a point about isolation in space and changes the dynamics of the crew so that later events can transpire, so it's far from just an isolated incident that could be cut. However, I think it stands out a bit more than it should, robbing the film of a certain flow. It also feels like a certain concession to financiers to introduce an element of danger at a certain slower point in the film even if it wasn't really called for.Still, despite some rather obvious concessions to money men, I feel like Ad Astra is a worthwhile entry into the more serious science fiction genre. It's well made, often looks strikingly good, is well acted, especially by Brad Pitt, and intelligent. I wish it could have been a purer film with more time to tell the story at its core and more time to let the audience feel the same sense of awe that should be affecting the characters, but that's not to be.",Ad Astra

88,jadepietro,Zero Gravitas,5,29 September 2019,"GRADE: CTHIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: John Grey's slow-moving mediative ode to the cosmos bores rather than soars.JIM'S REVIEW: Ad Astra is a mediative ode to the cosmos, one that would rival Terrance Mallick's sense of wonder. Its title, when translated from the Latin language, means ""to the stars"". And the vast celestial universe that is portrayed in John Grey's heady sci-fi drama may loom large with its stellar use of CGI, but the movie plays slow and loose with its scientific facts.One cannot deny that the main dynamic force in the film is its star, Brad Pitt as Major Roy McBride, a stoic space traveller with daddy issues whose life on earth remains unfulfilled and lonely. This fine actor is very good in tho role. However, he is upstaged by the visual grandeur on view by the real stars behind the camera. Ad Astra is glorious in its visual sweep and epic in its details. The stunning photography by Hoyte van Hoytema and Kevin Thompson's awe-inspiring production design make the film one of the most metaphysical cinematic experience since Kubrick's 2001. A compliment...sorta...read on:But like that highly touted film, Ad Astr is technically deft but adrift in its own convoluted storytelling. (I kept waiting for the Star Child to make an appearance in this movie, but had to settle for actress Natasha Lyonne's brief but jarring nanosecond of a role ...a real space oddity if there ever was one.) Granted, Mr. Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi classic was a slow-paced spectacle in itself with much astonishing style and technique that was ground-breaking for its visuals back then. Mr. Grey, while not on the same par with Mr. Kubrick as yet, demonstrates his technical prowess for big budget visual details most effectively, as do many film directors today, but he ultimately fails in his cinematic envisioning due to his underdeveloped characters and meandering screenplay.Mr. Grey's script, along with co-writer Ethan Gross over-intellectualizes the narrative to the nth degree while ignoring the simple rules of time, space travel, and human drama. His movie is devoid of any emotional gravitas. The plot is a shamble. Power surges are mysteriously threatening life on Earth as we know it and our maverick astronaut is given a mission that may implicate his missing and crazed father, former astronaut H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) as the mastermind behind the cosmic karma. This particular space odyssey will take our hero closer to Neptune as he travels to the moon, Mars, and the outer planets in record time. (Neil deGrasse Tyson might quibble with the science facts vs. science fiction angle of this film, especially Roy's far-fetched return trip homeward. More on that later.) The writers also throw in some unnecessary detours and dangers that gives the moviegoers some action and suspense but add little to the storyline.As the mission goes seriously off track, so does the movie. Roy chooses to continually endanger himself and anyone close by. His costly actions are masked as heroic and selfless, which they are not. The further we go to the outer realms of outer space, the more absurd the story becomes. The film never latches unto any semblance of believability and gets lost in space, sucked into a black hole of illogic.Situations become implausible and lack credence. Characters are sketchy with lots of voiceover narration that try to explain the crazy actions of everyone on screen but nothing quite add up. It's all zero gravity. Everyone goes rogue at some point with no real consequences or motives for their behavior.Mr. Grey assembly a roster of fine actors that are wasted in their roles. Donald Sutherland, Ruth Negga, and the aforementioned Mr. Pitt and Mr. Jones all deserve better material. Another misstep is casting Liv Tyler in the recurring role of Astronaut's Love Interest. Her walk-ons give the illusion that this cosmic groupie is still hanging around in Armageddon mode as if she is waiting again for another hunky space warrior to fly into her orbit. (It's unintentionally laughable and just bad casting.)With all of its glorious CGI and fine production values, Ad Astra is all the more disappointing. Its earnestness and artistry cannot hide the film's on-going leaps of logic as it time-warps its unsatisfying plot ad nauseam.So, in conclusion, let me paraphrase yet another legendary sci-fi tagline when reviewing this film...In space, no one can hear you yawn.",Ad Astra
89,RatedVforVinny,Hearts of Space Darkness.,7,7 October 2019,"Quite a thought provoking and engaging space drama, with a kind of a similar vibe to 2001 but with a more down to earth (excuse the pun) ethic. The mood and tone are very much 'Apocalypse Now', so don't bother if you are expecting some brainless action such as 'Armageddon'. The story is quite a slow burner, although I can understand some saying it's more of a plodder. For me the story contained at least two or three, exciting scenes and to the credit of the director, these are nicely worked into the plot. In this day and age (it seems), a film is either regarded as a classic, or it's completely hated; so see 'Ad Astra' with an open mind and at least you can enjoy some very tasty visuals.

Ad Astra achieves the prize of beautiful style, deeper tales, and great acting to come to life. It throws away the idea of space battles or aliens and instead subjects the goer with impressive looks into a character and the symbolism that space travel can bring. It feels much like a book put to movie and I give mad credit to the vision that James Gray had when putting this film together. However, this unique and detailed approach may also be the downfall of the tale as the cascading subplots and tangents become a little overbearing at times. kA sort of linear, connect the dots like approach does not quite give the most exciting narrative and the ending, no matter how beautiful it is, seems a bit of a sucker punch that made the movie's dragging pace not so great for me. Yet again, if this kind of vague and symbolic approach is your cup of tea, definitely check this film out because there are enough visuals and effects to utilize theater technology well. However, if you want a more traditional space movie and need the lasers, aliens, and tension, this film should be on the home viewing instead.My scores are:Adventure/Drama/Mystery: 7.5Movie Overall: 6.0",Ad Astra
91,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Ad Astra,6,15 October 2019,"Ad Astra is my latest review. It was released in September of 2019 with reshoots causing the film to go $20 million dollars over budget. James Gray directs ""Astra"" giving the audience a mixture of sci-fi Apocalypse Now, Mission to Mars, and 2014's Interstellar. Oh and you can even throw in a little 2001: A Space Odyssey because well, why not.So OK, Ad Astra has known troupers in it that barely register (Donald Sutherland, Liv Tyler, Tommy Lee Jones). And yes, Brad Pitt as the lead gives a performance so inert and underplayed, his heart rate probably never rose above 60 (his character's rarely went over 80). Still, ""Astra"" has a tamed look of steely-eyed convention. It's 124 minutes of space-age, numbing beauty. Add Max Richter's Cliff Martinez-like musical score and some canvased cinematography and Ad Astra is well, total science fiction 101.""Astra"" has shards of glacial violence, some NASA implausibility (Neptune and Jupiter aren't as far away as I thought), numerous Brad Pitt-ed close-ups, and some narration by Pitt that feels awkward at best (he's no Captain Willard mind you).In truth, if you like your science fiction fantasies to be more pretentious family drama than action, then Ad Astra is your go-to vehicle. And if you like a flick that keeps you at a distance with a lonely, closed-in feel, then ""Astra"" will help you meet that particular ""Waterloo"".All in all, Ad Astra is a movie about an astronaut named Roy McBride (Pitt) who goes to Neptune to find his father (Clifford McBride). Roy wants to bring said father back to earth and help him eliminate plans for an expedition that might destroy the universe.Bottom line: ""Astra"" is an icy, slow burn journey of a film and because of its artsy-fartsy residue and languidness, I might not have the gumption to see it again. Or maybe just see it ""ad"" hoc. Rating: 2 and a half stars.",Ad Astra
92,rannynm,"Nothing like I thought it would be like, but in a good way. Lots of discussion afterwards...",8,18 September 2019,"This film is nothing like what I anticipated and I mean that in a good way. I had a lot of fun discussing the themes of this movie.The movie follows Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) as he's tasked with finding his missing father (Tommy Lee Jones) in hopes of stopping a series of electrical surges that threaten the world.Now, while the whole cast is pretty fantastic, a good majority of the film revolves around Roy McBride. There are a lot of scenes where he's by himself while narrating. And these are probably the most interesting scenes in the movie. And it's not just because of the acting. The film is filled with voice over narration from Roy and these narrations are very interesting to think about. Since Roy is essentially prohibited from emoting, the narration sort of acts as his solution to that. I think that works really well, especially since, when he actually does emote, even slightly, it hits you really hard.Speaking of the narration, that, along with the incredible ambient music gives the tone a very eerie, atmospheric vibe which fits the feeling of isolation in the vastness of space and the monotone acting. There's also a lot of ideas in this film that are really creative and worthy of discussion. For example, in this movie there are commercial flights to the moon. So when Roy actually gets to the moon, you can see recognizable restaurants in the background, implying the moon is essentially a travel location. This is such a neat idea and something I really wish was expanded upon. Not only that, but this film has some really thought-provoking themes relating to legacies, searching for something greater and repressing your emotions. For most of the film, people see Roy in relation to who his father was. And these scenes, along with some spoiler-y moments, led me and my mom to have an entire discussion about how certain people will never be able to fully escape the legacy of their ancestors, as their ancestor and that ancestor's name will always weigh on them. Not just that, but the way space is used as a metaphor for taking what you have in life for granted is intriguing.I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18.

94,Rob_Taylor,Ad Dumpster,4,3 December 2019,"So this movies biggest failing is its earnest attempt to be ""serious"" and ""dramatic"". The reason this attempt fails is the insistence on nonsense scattered throughout the film. That, and Brad Pitt's almost monotone narration at points gives lie to the film's attempt to show him as emotionally invested in his mission.So what is the mission? And what is the nonsense I mention? Glad you asked, because it doesn't get more crazy than this.An earlier mission commanded by Pitt's character's father is lost near Neptune 30 years prior. Then, in the current day, mysterious energy surges start affecting Earth and the Brass pack Pitt off to Mars to try and send a message to his father, who is believed to still be alive (no one mentions what he was eating all this time...apparently deep space missions pack decade-worth of food). The message goes through, but then the Brass start acting all weird and Pitt is shut out of the loop. Cue him going off the rails and sneaking aboard a ship (via swimming, no less!) to Neptune to confront his dad and blah, blah, blah.It's kind of a similar premise to Event Horizon, but with all the fun removed, and no fun gateways to other dimensions etc.You get the idea. As for nonsense... well apart from the couple of examples I mention above, there are Moon Pirates (no...really!) and then there are the Killer Baboons from Outer Space (no...really!). And all of the above happen before he even gets to Mars!Now, you might be thinking it all sounds like a jolly Buck Rogers style romp? But no, it is all delivered with a poe-faced (Pitt-faced?) seriousness that turns the whole thing into a tedious exercise in endurance. I haven't seen Pitt give this dull a performance since Mr & Mrs Smith. He makes Ryan Gosling look like a hyper-active ADHD victim by comparison.The music is understated, for the most part, which doesn't help matters and the lack of common sense in how physics works all do no favours to this film, which I think was meant as a psychological thriller/drama or character study. The psychological aspect is mostly non-existent, interrupted as it is by often pointless action sequences that serve only to pad out an otherwise short story. As a character study, it fails because, well...Brad Pitt is not very charismatic here and attracts no sympathy from the viewer whatsoever. The occasional flash-back images of his wife (Liv Tyler) are almost like afterthoughts designed to try and make you like him more. At this, they also fail.From a technical standpoint, the movie is solid and the effects are decent, but the story, and the plot just make you shake your head a lot. There isn't really much more I can say other than ""Don't!"" if you are thinking of watching it.SUMMARY: Dull, tedious, preposterous. But mostly dull and boring with a side-order of Valium.

In addition, a lot of lines are raised but not used (for example, the bridge section where the crew on Mars does not meet very much), what do you want to release?

Astronaut Pitt, the son of the team leader (Jones) of that expedition, is sent to Mars to attempt communication. Astounding in scope yet fiercely meditative and internal, this existential science fiction opus should be commended for its impressive reach, though its disinterest in grappling with the headier philosophical issues it teases leaves one wondering why all the interplanetary fuss was needed (three billion miles--give or take--is an awful long distance to travel just to resolve some daddy issues). Brief action scenes, such as a pirate attack on moon buggies, a zero-G knife fight, and ""When Animals Attack: Outer Space Edition,"" feel out of place; they do less to elevate the pulse than to simply baffle. Pitt, however, gives an extraordinary performance, and the breathtaking visual design and sound editing within the vast canvas is never short of amazing.

All this takes place while a team searches for other forms of intelligent life - in the outer regions of the solar system. Writer-director James Grey (The Immigrant '13) presents his story within a kaleidoscope of vast and beautiful vistas.While in some aspects similar to 2001, this is more accessible, offering a little more humanity to contemplate. In some ways it's like a cross between Silent Running and a serious take on the Star Wars theme. Some situations come across as maybe a little far-fetched or underdeveloped but it offers a mostly mature script that's worthy of some thought.

101,arungeorge13,A less-than-fulfilling father-son drama set in space! [+54%],5,9 December 2019,"As with most other James Gray films, the film is a slow-burn drama, only this time, set in space. The run-time may just be 2 hours and 5 minutes, but the viewing experience feels laborious. Brad Pitt's face is what cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema chooses to fixate on. His 'feeling-less' astronaut act is one that's conveyed mostly through facial expressions, with or without the helmet on.There is some action; then again, it's very James Gray-like. The scale of the set-pieces might be the same as that of a Gravity or an Interstellar yet they're made with Gray's signature stillness all over them. The film offers faint hints of future space horrors (in the form of moon pirates and research primate attacks) and action snippets set against the backdrop of the black-and-white Moon or the reddish-brown Mars. Unlike conventional sci-fi epics, Ad Astra places the father-son (dis)connection as its core plot with everything else including the purpose of Pitt's Roy taking a space expedition as subplots. Ultimately, it all comes down to Roy wanting to find closure about his supposedly-genius astronaut father who he never really got to know in the first place.Ad Astra features some subtle subtext; the most obvious one being detachment for the sake of furthering our intelligence but the purpose never fully attaining fruition. Secondly, it all comes down to what makes us flawed humans - we crave solitude but we cannot live without people; we crave love but we have a tendency to keep running away from it. These themes are not fully explored in the flick but a discerning viewer can easily identify (and relate to) these.Pitt's act is the opposite of what we saw of him in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood - restrained, refined, and one that warrants one-too-many voice-overs. It comes with a James Gray-like precision that I do not really fancy for casual viewing. The supporting cast (that includes Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and Liv Tyler) does not have much to do. I think I like Gray's work when he focuses on more natural, less-explanatory settings - The Lost City of Z and The Immigrant being fine examples. As for Ad Astra, I'm pretty divided.",Ad Astra

104,Troy_Campbell,Stunningly photographed but suffers from a narratively disappointing final act.,6,21 September 2019,"Set in the near future, this slow-burning sci-fi tale follows emotionless astronaut Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) as he embarks on a voyage across the solar system in search of his missing father who may be at the centre of Earth-threatening power surges. Beginning with an extraordinary outer space sequence showing off the film's impressive visual effects, as well as establishing its matter-of-fact approach to portraying the dangers of space-work, it's a bar that proves too high for the remainder of the movie to match. The first half plays like a thriller, building suspense and an enigmatic tone through dream-like visual storytelling and drip-fed information; the second half swerving away from the mystery in favour of deeper psychological drama. It's an admirable change of direction but one that ultimately disappoints, as intriguing first act questions aren't given satisfying answers and the ethereal disposition throughout is undercut by a simplistic and clichéd finale. It looks amazing without doubt, director James Gray combining beautiful CGI vistas with faded transitions, overlapping images and spliced frames of chameleonic shots to create an uneasiness that subtly hints at tragedy. Pitt is an engrossing presence as always, his calm demeanour and measured dialogue not allowing easy access to what is going on in his mind (or heart); however, his narration is occasionally too on the nose. Not as viscerally entertaining as Gravity, as provocatively convention-bending as Arrival or as intellectually stimulating as Interstellar, Ad Astra is a stunningly photographed and initially interesting intergalactic fable that suffers from a final act that fails to stick the landing.",Ad Astra
105,areatw,Another dull and uninteresting space adventure,4,16 May 2020,"Sci-Fi has never been my genre of preference but I've definitely noticed a dip in standards over the last few years. The likes of 'Arrival' and the newest 'Blade Runner' were massively overhyped and even 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar' did nothing for me. I'd have hoped technological advancements would have driven up standards in the Sci-Fi genre but it seems to have had the opposite effect and resulted in an over-reliance on CGI and special effects.'Ad Astra' is no different I'm afraid - another plot-light, boring space adventure more interested in looking good than telling a story. Though that's hardly surprising as the Sci-Fi genre has always prioritised style over substance. The casting of Brad Pitt as the lead character is perhaps proof enough that style and visual appeal was all this movie was ever trying to achieve.The Sci-Fi genre is crying out for something fresh and different but 'Ad Astra' isn't it. This is just another disappointing style-obsessed space adventure with a weak and unoriginal plot.",Ad Astra

I can also enjoy slow movies when they're well done but the pacing here is quite atrociously uneven, the plot uninspired and it's really hard to care for any of the characters.

Up to the halfway mark, the plot was reasonably interesting in a minimalist way. From that point onward, the movie goes downward to hell in a handbasket.It becomes not only horribly dull but often encourages the question 'what the hell is going on here'. A particular scene in the second half was supposed to be pivotal and climactic. Instead, it comes off as bland as cold tea.To be fair, Pitt gives a fine performance. In many close-ups, we see his face twitching with emotions dying to get out of the stoic personality that is part of being an astronaut. But overall, ""Ad Astra"" is a weak member of the science-fiction genre. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", it ain't. At times, the second half was as unbearable as listening to Torontonians talk enthusiastically about the price of real estate.Director James Gray has done much better work.

Not a psychological thriller although many attempted ""deep and philosophical"" monologues and constant ""psychological"" assessments. A family adventure? Ha!This, similar to Gravity, is a cinematographic delight wrapped in an awful plot, terrible script, some really jarring technical flaws (to be discussed later) and some totally ridiculous scenes that were thrown in as an afterthought to try keep us from falling asleep at Brad's constant monotonic narration about nothing.The ridiculous scenes:
* Raging space baboons
* Space pirates hell bent on destruction but without reason
* A military convoy of buggies with only a few hand guns in a known Warzone
* The crazed father hellbent on staying but leaves without a whisper
* Giant neon Marlboro Man visible only to space pirates...
* Rockets land in one place and take off in another in the middle of nowhere
* Underwater tunnels in the middle of nowhere that lead to the rocket
*Brad sneaks through said tunnel to climb aboard said rocket during launch... OMG
The list is endless..The technical flaws:
* A sky high Tower within the Earth's gravitational field built from Meccano sets of infinite strength
* Brad happens to be wearing a parachute with his spacesuit
* Astronauts who playfully release liquids in zero gravity amongst life critical electronic equipment
* Brad never grows a beard or hair in 79 days of space travel on the way there but grows just a bit on the way back
* Cosmic waves that increase in power the further from the source
* The source is a massive unexplained disc on the side spaceship. What was that built for?
* Brad's all environments self repairing light material spacesuit
* Dozens of cheap plastic Casio calculators stuck willy nilly on every bit of equipment
* Airlocks, or should I say none..
* Climbs aboard a rocket 2 seconds before launch and survives the g-forces just standing inside the door

It has always pulled us in for one reason or another with some films doing a great job and others a so-so. I went in wanting to be taken or swept up into this adventure but instead found myself waiting to enter into this movie. I kept thinking it is coming any moment and for me it did not come. There are some intriguing stimulating aspects to the story-telling but nothing outstanding or that which would produce a come-back experience (second showing). I found that they made traveling through space and to the moon and mars and beyond too simple to do which leads me to ask why they don't have multiple ships coming and going all the time? As far as the search for other life elsewhere, years ago we had the ability to launch voyager into space and beyond snapping the famous blue pale dot picture of earth as it left the our system. You would think in this picture with all the technology that they would have launched thousands of iPhone sized type vessels into every compass point by now and monitoring for results. Instead we see impressive ships, bases and travel and conclude an opinion on life elsewhere existing elsewhere. Hmmm. You will get visuals, expectations and some entertainment but no real pay-off for the premise. BTW...I like Brad Pit but lets not get carried away here with his (yawn) contribution on screen.

112,rockman182,Ad Astra (2019),8,23 September 2019,"To The Stars. I absolutely love space themed films and usually the smarter they are the more I enjoy it. They are the type of films that have me thinking long after viewing them. Especially when the film makes a commentary about humanity and the loneliness of it all. James Gray, the director of The Lost City of Z, returns here with a pretty marvelous looking space drama starring a very good Brad Pitt. While there are moments that dragged in the film, I have to say its a gorgeous thing to look at and is all around an invigorating watch.The film is about a lonely astronaut who is sent on a mission in the distant future to go towards Neptune because of mysterious power surges that are become harmful to the planet Earth. It is suspected that this man's (named Roy McBride) father is alive and could be responsible. Roy leaves all of what he knows behind on this dangerous mission and along the way questions his emotional and psychological state. The film also stars Tommy Lee Jones.The film is a definite slow burner. I've had a long day myself so I felt my eyelids getting heavy but not at the films fault. Its slow and quiet but resonates in its silence. There's a lot going on internally for the protagonist, and Pitt is fantastic in this quest as a reserved but determined man. The cinematagrophy and sound is just so sleek. It is a wonderful film to watch in IMAX. I immediately praised the scene in the beginning where the camera looks down on Earth. Neptune and its rings were absolutely magnificent as well.There are plot points that could have been done better for sure but I think the film is a space themed film that will grow in stature. I question some of the events in the film scientifically but still it presents visions of the solar system that seem so real. Also, the idea of the Moon and Mars being transport hubs seems like a thing that could happen with exploration and time. Its a smart film that goes above and beyond with its ambition and prediction for the future and yet jumps out with its loneliness and emotional weight about humanity. I will give this a rewatch as I'm sure it offers more on a second viewing.7.5/10",Ad Astra

114,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An outer space Heart of Darkness adaptation with some pacing issues.,6,6 October 2019,"I wasn't entirely sure what to expect with Ad Astra (2019). The trailers I had seen made it seem like it was an action-filled space adventure akin to Interstellar (2014) or Gravity (2013). While it did handle all the outer space issues in a somewhat scientifically accurate way, Ad Astra was a much slower movie than I thought it would be. In fact, I'd probably compare it more to films like 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) for its almost plodding pacing. The real trick is that the plot of Ad Astra is basically an outer space version of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, of which Apocalypse Now! (1979) is perhaps the most notable movie adaptation.Ad Astra does get credit for the beauty of its outer space environment. The settings felt massive in scale and intimate in their proximity. Each portion and waypoint of the journey seemed precisely how I would picture them eventually occurring in our not-to-distant future. Even if some aspects of the film were somewhat confusing in their ""artsiness,"" they still were neat to observe. Additionally, Brad Pitt's performance was subdued but had the emotional weight to accompany the main character's growth throughout the film.Considering that Ad Astra is basically a mashup of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Apocalypse Now! , I'm a little disappointed that it didn't take more cues from its scientifically accurate brethren like (a notable example being The Martian (2015)). More than once, I questioned the logic behind certain actions and wondered why bits of the most important science was mostly ignored to make the plot move forward. Concepts like antimatter, communication time latencies, and the effects of prolonged space travel were either explained with hand waving, a montage or never addressed at all.An outer space Heart of Darkness adaptation with some pacing issues, I give Ad Astra 3.0 stars out of 5.",Ad Astra
115,petra_ste,Pale blue Malick,6,20 February 2020,"There are some great things about Ad Astra.The cinematography by DP Hoyte van Hoytena is one, just stunning.The performance by Brad Pitt is another. Much like DiCaprio, Pitt was initially tagged as another ""pretty boy"" but has grown into a fine actor who keeps getting better and better. Incidentally, in spite of his handsome looks, he has always been stronger as a character actor in unconventional parts than as the classic romantic lead role Hollywood tried to force on him for a while.The script, though... as much as I admire the ambitious attempt to make ""2001 meets Apocalypse Now via Terrence Malick"", it was too much for writer/director James Gray. The film is overwritten and doesn't trust its excellent lead to convey emotions and nuances without spelling them out to the audience. After an affecting climax, Pitt's astronaut flat-out states the main message of the movie. Some moviegoers are irked by Malick's voice-overs, but even they aren't that blunt - and I feel trying to imitate Malick (a director I love, even if I didn't enjoy his last few movies) is one of the most dangerous things you can do as a filmmaker: pretentiousness is just around the corner.Like with Interstellar, I do wonder what's the point of making hard science-fiction (an endeavor I greatly respect) if you then succumb to melodramatic moments or cliches like a stowaway boarding a spaceship at the last minute during launch. It's like producing historical movies with fastidiously impeccable costumes, set design and accents and then having the protagonist fall fifty feet from the top of a tower only to walk away without a bruise. Either realism or ""anything goes"" movie logic, you can't have it both ways.6,5/10",Ad Astra
116,bankofmarquis,A missed opportunity,6,27 September 2019,"Like crossing the vast expanse of oceans in a sailing ship, rocketing across the vast expanse of our Galaxy would, naturally, lead one to self-contemplation. In the film AD ASTRA Brad Pitt spends a lot of time contemplating.Unfortunately, that is pretty much all PItt - and this film - does.AD ASTRA follows the adventure of Astronaut Roy McBride (Pitt) who's father Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) is a fabled Astronaut who disappeared while on a deep space mission to Neptune. When a Galaxy-wide energy pulse emanating from Neptune threatens life on Earth, suspicion is that Clifford is still alive in orbit around Neptune and the hope is that Roy can contact him and stop this life threatening force.Sounds like an interesting premise, doesn't it? And it could have been. And the world that was built for this movie - a world set in the ""near future"", one where we did not stop going to the moon and space and there are now space stations - and colonies and pirates(!) - on the Moon and Mars, is an interesting concept and I really wanted to explore that world.Unfortunately, Director and Writer James Gray (THE LOST CITY OF Z) was not interested in exploring this (so why build it?!?) - he was more interested in contemplating the meaning of life's purpose and fate and legacies and do the sins of the father really come back to seek payment by the son? And I do mean contemplate, for that is what Pitt's character does through most of this film - sit and think (which we hear through voice over), while contemplative music plays wistfully.It's a good recipe to cure insomnia.While Pitt does a nice enough job in the lead - an actor can only do so much with looking, thoughtfully, out the window. Ruth Negga and Donald Sutherland both try to inject some life in this film, but their parts are, in essence, extended cameos and the likes of ""that guy"" actors like Donnie Kashawarz, John Finn and John Ortiz pop up for a scene or two along the way as we travel across our Galaxy with Pitt but don't really register Only Tommy Lee Jones manages to liven things up...but his presence is too little too late.Like a parent, I am not upset at this film, just disappointed at the choices that were made. I thought Pitt and Gray knew better.Letter Grade: B- (it is well made and pretty to look at)6 Stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Ad Astra
117,spookyrat1,James Gray Does Conrad and Coppola in Space ... Not Very Well!,5,22 March 2020,"Though not credited anywhere where I could see, Ad Astra clearly represents James Gray's interpretation of the famous novella Heart of Darkness, best adapted cinematically by Francis Ford Coppola's wonderful Apocalypse Now. Coppola's 1979 motion picture based on the screenplay by John Milius, moved the story from the Congo to Vietnam and Cambodia during the Vietnam War. Gray in the 21st century, updates it further into ""the near future"" (debatable) and shifts the action into outer space, with the protagonist's journey now being from Earth to Neptune.Major Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) is (ultimately) asked by US Space Command to travel to the edge of the solar system to confront and potentially kill his father H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones). McBride Snr may well have gone rogue and the experimental ship, the Lima Project, he was commanding and supposedly investigating for signs of alien life outside the solar system, appears now to be causing devastation throughout Earth and its off-world colonies.Ad Astra has been a favourite of the critics, but a commercial flop. I'm not surprised. One has to be at the very least, a little wary of films held back some 9 months from release, especially after they have suffered the ignominy of extensive reshoots following poor test screenings. For my money the film has some fine cinematography and accompanying special effects, a very appropriate soundtrack and ... not much else. I have real difficulty in understanding how Pitt's very one note performance and exceedingly sombre, non-required narration have been singled out by the critics for special praise. Did we ever feel Arnie somehow missed out by not being nominated for an acting gong for his Terminator performances?But the real problems lie with the story. Adapting Heart of Darkness into a wartime allegory and a journey of self-discovery worked, because it was relatable to the craziness we knew occurred during the Vietnam war. This is not the case when moving to ""the near future"". (I even have problems with this. I am not a scientific expert by any means. Yet I can't see us having large colonies of the type we see in Ad Astra on the Moon and on Mars, for perhaps 60 to 100 years! Hardly the near future!) At any rate Gray's stated intention with the film to feature ""the most realistic depiction of space travel that's been put in a movie"", gets shunted back in priority, whilst he ramps up the action and suspense quota, with a number of set pieces, that at the very least demand much greater exposition and at worst are just plain silly and completely unscientific.Consider the following: 1 Moon pirates? Where do they live? Why do they rule no-man's land on the moon? Why does Space Command have personnel land in one place and blast off from a completely different area? Why don't VIP's get better security from Space Command? 2 The SOS from the Norwegian space ship? Where's the evidence of any of the 26 crew mentioned? Did 2 baboons kill a crew of 26? Just a plainly bizarre episode, more fitting a completely different movie. 3 Roy McBride's super hero infiltration of the Cepheus during its Martian liftoff? And his subsequent accidental (LOL!) killing of the ship's whole crew? (I'm still not sure after a number of rewinds, how some of the crew actually died.) 4 The Captain America episode whilst jet-packing through Neptune's rings? 5 And the solar system surfing back to Earth, riding on the wave of a nuclear blast? (Stanley Kubrick would be rolling around in his grave with laughter.) Time and space won't allow me to cite many other examples, highlighting the inherent deficiencies of the script.It's been said though that the ultimate horror of Coppola's hypnotic trip was how closely it's said to have captured the realities of 'Nam. In terms of James Gray's work, I think the people have spoken and in doing so have called out the admiring critics. If this is the most realistic depiction of space travel ever put in a movie, then we're all just not here. I think I'm very generous in awarding it a 5/10.",Ad Astra

There were parts of the film I really enjoyed, but there were also parts of the film that were really annoying. Can't help but feel that someone on the production side should have decided what they wanted to do with the film. Either make a blockbuster with lots of mindless action or make a tense psychological sci-fi drama. This falls somewhere in between.The movie tells the story of Roy McBride who is sent on a mission to discover the reason for radiation pulses coming from the far edge of the solar system. These are coming from Neptune which is where is father was sent on a mission severel years earlier and hasn't been heard from since. When it's good this movie is similar in tone to Moon.

120,Danusha_Goska,"Beautiful, Suspenseful, Cerebral",8,22 September 2019,"""Ad Astra"" is a beautiful, suspenseful, cerebral movie. Action fans are giving ""Ad Astra"" terrible reviews. There is a solution to this problem. Action fans should not go see ""Ad Astra""Astronaut Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) is sent to the edges of the solar system to save life on planet Earth. That's pretty much the entire plot. Brad Pitt in space is almost the whole show. There is a terrific supporting cast: Liv Tyler, Donald Sutherland, and Tommy Lee Jones, but most of these actors are given precious little to do.The film places a great deal of emphasis on the physical fitness required for successful space travel. Brad Pitt's vital signs are constantly being monitored. And yet we are supposed to believe that the US government sent Donald Sutherland, looking every minute of his 84 years, into space. In fact Sutherland's part could be lifted out of the movie and the movie wouldn't change. I wondered what Sutherland was doing there and thought perhaps it was to make 55 year old Brad Pitt look young, but Pitt doesn't need it. That man hit the gene jackpot.""Ad Astra"" is suspenseful. There is the ""Houston, we have a problem"" surge scene, that one can see in trailers. There is the space pirates scene, the bad space monkeys scene, the ""Uh oh, I've inadvertently killed a bunch of people"" scene, and a surprising scene involving travel under water that may or may not be a reference to the birth canal. These scenes are episodic. They don't build to a larger point. Characters come and go, but they are not developed. That aspect of the script was disappointing, but perhaps inevitable. ""Ad Astra"" is about the loneliness of an astronaut, and all people's loneliness. It's about an astronaut's vulnerability, and all of ours. It's about trying to find meaning in lives that can feel meaningless.""Ad Astra"" also depicts the inevitable Big Brother aspect of space travel. Here on earth, you can breathe and eat without too much government intervention. Not so in space. Astronauts are dependent on the government for the very air they breathe. If a spaceman runs afoul of what the government wants him to do, he has few options. He can't manufacture his own air.Set after set shows McBride isolated in punishing landscapes. Either he is driving around the grey, lifeless moon, or sitting in a soundproof booth facing the most sinister sound engineers and radio operators in movie history. There's an environment that is designed to be comfortable and reassuring, and it's one of the creepiest sets of all. I love the wrinkles in the wallpaper.""Ad Astra"" depicts an unflattering view of space travel. This isn't ""Star Wars"" or even ""Star Trek."" It's closer to, but more coherent than, ""2001, A Space Odyssey."" Hal isn't a mistake here. Hal is a necessary part of the system. Humans trash space just as they trash the earth. Everything that is cheap and tacky on earth ends up in space, as well.Unlike most other space movies, ""Ad Astra"" mentions earth-bound religious practice. An astronaut prays to St Christopher. What becomes of him can be taken as a statement about Catholic faith by the filmmaker, James Gray, who comes from a Ukrainian Jewish background.Even though some will see ""Ad Astra"" as a cold movie, there is a scene where Brad Pitt cries. It's one of the most moving crying scenes I've ever seen. ""Luke, I am your father"" is one unforgettable space movie scene involving fathers and sons. For my money, this scene in ""Ad Astra"" is more powerful. Max Richter's score is one of the best film scores I've heard.",Ad Astra
121,MihaiSorinToma,A big waste of time,5,4 October 2019,"I'm going to start this review with the good parts as they were unfortunately pretty few. It has an interesting intrigue which made me curious and kept me this way until the final part. It has Brad Pitt who plays his character pretty well and also presents some of his thoughts in an unique way but nothing extraordinary. I can say that the filming direction and special effects were great, even impressive at times, but that's about it.Going to the bad part, it is soooo slow-paced that you have to be a hero to resist until the end without a single yawn or without losing interest. To make matters worse, it has plenty of questionable moments which might even be considered plot-holes, which unfortunately decide key moments in the plot. This is where a spoiler alert is in order. The first thing I'm questioning is the fact that he was chosen for this mission in which it was pretty clear or at least very possible for him to meet his father and if so eliminate him from the picture; and all this just to find out in the next couple of scenes that the company who sent him didn't trust him from the beginning; my only explanation here is that he was the best from his field and that he was the ""logical"" choice, but judging by the emotional stake, it doesn't make much sense for me. The other question I have (and this one is quite big, even considering it to be a plot-hole) is why was he released from his room while on mars (by someone who knew his father was a murderer) just to be sent after his father (whom he clearly wasn't going to kill, although that character who liberated him thought otherwise, risking her freedom in the process), presumably doing exactly what the crew that he hijacks was going to do, which is, obviously, to eliminate his father and his project. The worst part in this movie is the actual finale which is so predictable that you're simply left wondering why you just spent all that runtime for simply nothing. You don't get anything out of the ordinary, just plain old soap opera which brings more anger than relief. Oh, as a quick note, there were also plenty of underdeveloped characters which took part in the plot with no clear direction or just to send an ordinary message which could have been sent in a much more creative way, but maybe it's just me being picky.As you might have guessed by now, watching this movie wasn't quite a pleasure. It kept me interested as I was hoping for a finale which might bring something truly intelligent, extraordinary or impressive. As it turns out, the disappointments kept rolling, thus ending up with a quite bad experience.",Ad Astra

123,jrarichards,"At times imaginative, but mainly outrageously and mindlessly profligate",5,21 February 2020,"James Gray's at-times pretty-looking ""Ad Astra"" starts as it means to go on by emphasising the meaning of its title (""to the Stars""); yet the furthest we get is Neptune - a pretty far distance for manned spaceflight (not least considering that no human we know of has so far gone further than 400,000 km from the Earth's surface), but still 9000 times less far than Proxima Centauri as the nearest star.But why should they care about that, in a film (set in ""the near future"" - hmmmm???) that is ultimately concerned with feelings and how we waste our time on the planet we do have, as opposed to anything like scientific details? This of course despite CONSIDERABLE attention to detail when it comes to spacecraft interiors and so on, which actually look pretty good...Yet in making the above worthy, but for some quite evident point, the makers of this movie play fast and loose with EVERYTHING, for a start trashing the venerable idea of ""the movie star"" by putting in Liv Tyler and allowing her hardly a word or a role, putting in Donald Sutherland (as good as ever) as Col. Pruitt, but then chucking that character before they have even left the Moon for Mars in an actually non-surprising plot twist, given that none of us out here in audience land ever thought Pruitt was up to the journey!Sutherland is in there for perhaps 15 minutes, and has no lasting impact on the story... So that's pretty profligate, just for starters.Our hero Roy (Brad Pitt) needs to go on though, because what is happening with his dad's mission on a small spacecraft parked near Neptune is sufficient to threaten the destruction of Earth through cosmic rays. Er..., yes, really! So the only thing left is for Roy to sneak on to a rocket that's going out there on a mission that has tried deliberately to exclude him, kill all the crew on that rocket (by mistake, but certainly confirming how the apple does not fall far from the tree), and nuke his dad's ship when he arrives.He thus travels all the way to Neptune, for heaven's sake (literally); spends about 5 minutes there; has two sentences of conversation with dad (Tommy Lee Jones as unemotional as ever); loses dad in space (yes really); then hotfoots it back to Earth having been propelled on by the nuclear blast!Various hints are given that all is not entirely well on Earth or the colonised Moon and Mars. But an exciting enough mini-vignette about a pirate attack out in the lunar badlands proves interesting, but has nothing whatever to do with the film and is entirely forgotten by us by the time we reach the movie's not-so-gripping climax.We have hints that black-oppy kinds of things are going on (with Mars Commander's Helen Lantos played by Ruth Negga for example expecting a sticky end because she has revealed to Roy the truth that his dad basically killed her parents due to his obsession with the mission at all costs). Yet when Roy finally gets back to Earth nothing happens to him - not because he knows too much and not even because his careless behaviour cost several lives. Just nothing.And when Roy gets all the way to Mars - in order to make a private phone call to his dad (duh!) - the possibility that the call has been answered leaves a moment of suspense, yet when dad is finally encountered it is not obvious that he was ever in touch, and in any case there is no mystery, no dirty secret, no discovery, no surprise, just nothing much at all. We learn that dad has in fact been trying to stop the disastrous pulse effect that is killing thousands on Earth, even though early parts of the film suggest that he might be destroying everything deliberately - in a fit of pique relating to his non-discovery of ET.Hence the mission was unneccesary really, as dad was willing to cooperate. Why he then failed to respond to hails, acted all enigmatic, and forced sonny-boy to make the trip is left unclear, just like everything else here.Likewise, a bit out on to the journey from Mars, the enigmatic situation of escaped (and extremely angry and vicious) baboons on a Norwegian research ship (the question as to why do animal research in space gets no answer) again gives some startling and quite scary scenes, that AGAIN prove to have no role at all in the main storyline (except maybe to force our Brad to take charge and be alone); and so this footage is ALSO forgotten by the time we get to the end of the movie.Needless to say, nothing is done to reverse the conclusion that Earth and the life on it are all we have and so we had better make the most of it, and that is a fair enough message, even though more than one of us audience members may be longing for a quick close encounter just to zing things along a bit, no matter how implausible and ""fixed"" a plot-line that would have looked.As opposed to all the entirely plausible and non-fixed-looking stuff we DO get...Again and again, then, the feeble attempts at breathing some life or excitement into this plot - even by means of highly tangential events - fizz out, having gone nowhere. And what we do get here, more than anything else, is Roy being made subject to endless psych evaluations.Given the moments of imagination (a space tower stretching up from Earth's surface, colonised Moon and Mars, lawlessness and so on), I finish the review wondering if I am too blind or literal to note some major subtle message in the film of the ""it was all a dream"" kind - for example, or somehow relating to the fact that ""dad actually was an alien after all"".But I don't think so, really - as I'm just not THAT dumb...",Ad Astra

There are space Monkeys and here is Review-Paying money for this film would be like buying a sports car which is visually stunning to look at, but there's a catch under the bonnet is a 1CC engine, Its another Skymovies shocker something quite expected. What I am saying is there visually stunning graphics sound and special effects and A list actors, but what drive a movie the script, the way story is told is so poor and simply a fathers burden on son in space. The son must find his father and find source of mystery power surge, but finds the man he thought he knew was far darker than he could have imagined. He then kills a crew and commits the same sin as his father. There is also so crazy mandarin monkey at one point in movie and some crazy pirate mad max moon-base. This movie is a disaster and shows us that movies are really getting worse. The ending try's to redeem the film as he find his fathers work some how from Neptune he father finds information on other worlds and his son Roy(Brad) says we are alone but what we have is far more valuable. He stops power surge and blows up ship to some how propel his ship home. The way ships travel is not really explained and time taken seems impossibly too fast. I wish I could go back a not waste time watching this movie. I had to take three breaks just to watch movie its so bad and sound dialogue was bad and not improved with subtitles.

Hollywood spent a fortune on 'Ad Astra' so they want to make sure they can reap in as much dollars as possible, not from just the sci-fi fanboys who the film is really geared towards, but also women who want to see a human interest relationship intertwined in it as well as the bible thumpers who might otherwise dismiss it as just a bunch of scientific atheists reaching for the stars. I suppose if I was spending a fortune on it I'd include those elements, too. After all, how many sci-fi fanboys are there, really?

126,abisio,Infinitely boring and shallow 2001 Space Odyssey and Apocalypse Now rip off,3,21 September 2019,"Yes, it is a rip off 2001 but without the symbolism and existentialism portrayed in that movie . It also copies the Apocalypse Now style (a secret trip, protagonist narration, strange and somber characters and lots of non-sense).
There are a few impressive (which I do not think are scientifically possible like the fall down to Earth without gravity and not burning in the atmosphere; or the Lunar car chase.
I am really do not understand what Grey (the director ) was trying to achieve. If the concern was daddy's issues there thousands of other movies that do it better. If the selfishness, boredom and required to be an astronaut; then the movie makes absolutely no-sense; since everybody dreams of being one but hardly one in a million ever really tries (adn much less succeed).On the philosophical or existentialism subject; there is none. Check 2001 which is far better and make more sense.
This is simple a very very slow paced movie; narrated by an almost catatonic protagonist (who I do not think ever could pass a psychological evaluation) on a quest that does not make any sense (a stuck ship near Jupiter that is causing chaos on Earth but you can get near and board easily ).
The potential mystery of the father in that lost ship was the only motivation to wait for end; but when it comes it is so unimportant and poorly written; basically disappointing.I like Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones and Sutherland; but only the first one makes an effort the other two are as catatonic as the rest of the movie. The only two women are basically a decoration.In brief; do not even think about, avoid it at all cost.",Ad Astra
127,bob-the-movie-man,"Like father, like son?",6,20 September 2019,"I really love sci-fi films with high ambitions. ""Psychological"" sci-fi like ""Solaris"" for example. And ""Arrival"" topped my movie list for 2016. In similar vein, ""Ad Astra"" is also a movie concerning attempted contact with alien life. So I had high hopes for it. But would this Sci-fi epic ultimately challenge my brain again, or end up in the ""Crystal Skull"" sin bin with a dodgy alien meeting?Set a few years into the future, Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) is the son of a legend. H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) was a space exploration pioneer. His picture hangs in the NASA hall of fame next to Buzz Aldrin's. McBride senior went missing presumed dead near Neptune during a mission. The mission was to get outside the Sun's heliosphere to scan for potential alien transmissions from nearby solar systems.But something went badly wrong, and now the earth (and potentially all human life migrating into the solar system) is at risk from massive electromagnetic bursts arising from Neptune. Is Clifford alive and involved in the emerging crisis? The authorities send Roy on a secret mission to Mars to try to communicate with his father.Let's start with a real positive. The cinematography here is first rate. Hoyte Van-Hoytema - well known for ""Interstellar"", ""Spectre"" and ""Dunkirk"" - knocks this out of the park. In the same manner as ""Blade Runner 2049"", many of the frames of this film could be blown up and placed on art gallery walls around the world.Add to that some cracking film editing from John Axelrad and Lee Haugen, and some beautiful sound design and I predict the movie should feature strongly in the technical awards at the Oscars.I'd like to park my physics brain sometimes when I go to the movies, but I just can't. So I really need sci-fi films to live up to the science part of their name. There are a number of areas, particularly at the back end of the film, when credibility goes out the window. I can't really say more here without giving spoilers, so I will leave them to a ""Spoiler section"" in my online ""One Mann's Movies"" blog (please check it out on the web or Facebook).In my view the film is pretty schizophrenic in nature. This is what confused me about the trailer, jumping from a cerebral sci-fi vibe to moon buggy shoot-outs.
On one hand, its the standard (but always interesting) tale of a child abandoned by a hero-father and his attempts to reconcile what that's done to his life and relationships. How can he ever square that circle without contacting his dad? As the film's tag-line goes ""The answers we seek are just outside our reach"".On the other there are episodes of action that would fit happily into an action scene from Star Trek.The two elements never really gel, leading to the feeling of the film having been written as a set of disconnected pages and the writers then saying ""Hey, Jimmy, once you've finished making us the tea, could you just write a few lines to join those pages up into a shooting script?"". Then later, ""What do you mean Jimmy you used BOTH piles of paper?!"".Unfortunately, the film commits a cardinal sin in my book. Voiceovers! I HATE THEM!! It's at the very extreme of what the great critic Mark Kermode calls ""show don't tell"". Here, we don't just have a little Brad Pitt set-up intro and he then shuts up. He just drones on and on and on with his inner thoughts. At least Matt Damon in ""The Martian"" got away with it by cleverly filming his video blog. And it's not as if there isn't a prime opportunity to use that device here! He is constantly having to talk to a computer to do his regular psychological tests! But that option is not picked up. BIG BLACK MARK!But bubbling under all of this are some stand-out moments where, for me, the film soared. One of them (ultimately setting me up for as much of a disappointing fall as some of the characters!) is the stunning opening shots aboard the ""Sky Antenna"" structure. Impressive and exciting, with falling bits of metal playing Russian Roulette with Roy's iife.Another strength for me is Brad Pitt. I've seen wildly differing views on this, but for me its a quiet but strong acting performance. There are many scenes when he has no lines, his inner (and our outer) voice gives it a miss, and he acts the socks off his peers. What with ""Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood"" its been a really good year for Pitt. I suspect ""Hollywood"" might be the one though that gets him his fourth acting Oscar nomination.For a 2019 film, it's actually a very male-heavy film, made more so by Pitt's love-interest (Liv Tyler) being given virtually nothing to do other that look a bit sulky from a distance. I'm not even sure she gets a single line in the whole film! (""Miss Tyler - please sign for your script"". ""But, there's nothing in the envelope?"". ""Quite Miss Tyler, Quite"").The only decent female role goes to Ruth Negga as the Mars colony leader. Even then, she only has limited screen time and although having the title ""Mars CEO"" really doesn't seem to have much power.Elsewhere, its great to see both Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland back on the big screen again.Final Thoughts: As any veteran RAF person will know, ""Ad Astra"" is Latin for ""To the stars"". In space terms this is less ""to the stars"" and more ""just beyond your front door"". James Gray's film undoubtedly has high ambitions but, through its spasmodic script, never really gets there. It has the beauty of ""Gravity"" but none of the refinement; there's an essence of ""Space Odyssey"" in places, but it never goes for the mystical angle; it has the potential to reflect the near-insanity through loneliness of ""Silent Running"" but never commits fully to that storyline. But if its novelty you're looking for, it ticks the ""floating monkeys in space"" box!I think it's worth seeing on the big screen just for its visual beauty and Pitt's performance. And as a major block-buster sci-fi film I enjoyed it to a degree. But for me it had just so many irritations that it failed to live up to my high expectations. A great shame and a frustrating disappointment.But at least it's great news for Richard Branson and Virgin Atlantic shareholders. They can be assured that the future is bright for their ""long distance"" flights in the future!",Ad Astra

129,kjproulx,A Wonderfully Slow Character Study,10,22 September 2019,"The Sci-fi genre has always fascinated me the most in terms of cinematic experiences. Whether you're talking about though-provoking movies like Blade Runner or something as extravagant as Star Wars, there is a wide range of stories to explore. Ad Astra marks the most recent major studio Sci-fi release and it's absolutely a winner in my books. There's so much to admire here. I went into this film with slightly high expectations, simply due to the talent involved, and I was not disappointed. Here's why I believe Ad Astra is worth a trip to the movies if you're not feeling tired.Ad Astra follows Roy McBride, an astronaut in the near future, as he ventures through space in hopes to find his father, who has been missing for years. Along the way, more secrets are uncovered and even deep emotional stakes are explored. Now, this premise seems like your average rescue mission, but it's definitely not that in the slightest. Yes, the movie takes you on this journey, but it really asks you to sit back, enjoy some breathtaking visuals, great sound design, a wonderfully immersive score, and a central character in Roy, who Brad Pitt commits very strongly to.All of these elements are fantastic and I never found myself bored, but the pacing of this movie is intentionally very, very slow, which I fear will turn off some viewers. At two hours, this movie isn't very long, but it can feel it at times. Other than that, I think what this movie sets out to accomplish is done to near perfection. I was completely immersed in this world and the slow pace almost had me in a trance. I would highly recommend seeing this movie when you're wide awake, because the great score, complemented by a slow pace, will probably make some viewers doze off.As aforementioned, Brad Pitt leads this film and demands your attention. Everyone knows that he's one of the best out there today, but it's always nice to see when a great actor goes the extra mile in terms of committing to a character. Through his performance alone, I truly cared about the final act of this movie and where certain events ended up. The way he exerts himself and becomes Roy for these couple hours was brilliant.In the end, I seem to be boasting about this film endlessly in my mind, but I simply can't state it enough. For such a simple premise, the visual effects, score, emotional impact, and overall study of this broken character, I loved every minute of Ad Astra. It's a very relaxing viewing experience, so be wary of getting tired during this movie, but I found that to actually be a positive here somehow. Ad Astra is one of the best movies I've seen this year so far.",Ad Astra
130,kuarinofu,They bit off more than they could chew (still good),7,20 September 2019,"Ad Astra is a good movie. I know this because it made me angry and this happens only if I do care about the movie I watch. You can pretty much pinpoint the moment in the movie where they started screwing up.They wanted to make the movie feel huge, so they wasted time on world-building scenes that have zero payoffs. It's like someone came to them and said - ""We can't have this small story about man's struggle to have a normal life caused by his shattered relationship with his father and him being afraid of becoming like his father"". I mean, come on, just focus on the story, it is so grounded and relatable.They have cool space shots and good space ambient music but they feel the need to insert as much basic symbolism as possible. I'm ok with that, but then they add even more stylistic editing and weird locations just to be like Bladerunner 2049. Some of the shots (and edits) are just there because they thought these were cool.After they've packed the movie with all this, they understood that general audiences would probably get confused and added a ton of voiceover narration. I'm pretty sure this was insisted on by the studio. And Jesus Christ there's a lot of narration. Most of which is just unnecessary.Other than these, I mostly had no problem with the movie. Just cut it down, remove the pointless scenes that contribute to nothing, take it a little easier with the stylistic editing and focus more on the main story. It is still a good watch as it is now, but you should dumb down your expectations to enjoy it.",Ad Astra

132,tm-sheehan,Intelligent suspense in Space,7,20 September 2019,"My Review-Ad- Astra (To The Stars)
My Rating 7/10This Space Thriller Drama worked for me , although I thought the pace slowed up a little in the second half conclusion.Brad Pitt , ageless as ever at 55 years of age must have a Dorian Gray portrait ageing in his closet or a great cosmetic surgeon .
In my opinion he's a fine actor ,after seeing him so recently in ""Once Upon A Time in America "" a totally different role to the understated cool demeanour of Astronaut Roy Mc Bride. I liked the physiological father son drama of the story the father being Tommy Lee Jones, also an Astronaut lost in Space appearing to be the hero of the Lima Project to attempt to discover intelligent life on other planets or stars.The scenes of Earths colonisation of The Moon confirms my view that intelligent life is getting harder and harder to find on Earth the way we neglect our planet just so we can find another to pollute is shameful.In the movie Commercial travel to the Moon is available to all and when you arrive all the neon franchises like Hungry Jacks are lit up with monolithic madness just like on Earth.
Underground transportation delivers you to your lunar holiday resort and virtual reality vacation. No need really to leave Earth at all.However the Moon is only a cover for our hero Roy McBride for he's is on a mission to Mars then on to Saturn to save the planet from destruction or so he believes.
That's enough plot line from me go see Ad Astra on the biggest Cinema Screen you can as it would get lost on television.Great special effects in fact Director James Gray has stated that his movie is the most realistic depiction of space travel that's been put in a movie.He's also described it as Sorta like, if you got Apocalypse Now' and '2001' in a giant mash-up and you put a little JosephConrad in there.""What would I know I'm not an expert of Space Travel movies but I enjoyed this one.",Ad Astra

135,Darkside-Reviewer,One man's journey through space,7,6 December 2019,"Before watching this movie I read a brief description of the movies plot and honestly it just sounded like another survival space themed movie that's been done many times before like Gravity, The Martian, Moon or 2001 A space odyssey to name some of the best in the genre but to my surprise this movie didn't try to simply replicate something that has been successful in other movies and instead takes inspiration from these movies and uses it to create something unique and genuinely thought provoking with it's storyline and character backgrounds that uses mental and emotional internal character dialogue to show how the strong hard working and emotionally cut off character Roy played by Brad Pitt really sees the world around him being disconnected from his emotions so much so that during a near death experience his heart rate never accelerates beyond normal parameters making him calm collected and duty driven in even the worst circumstances making him the perfect choice for a classified mission to make contact with a lost science vessel bound for Jupiters orbit thought lost thirty years ago the lead scientist and astronaut on-board was his thought to be dead father the deepest buried and most compartmentalised emotions Roy never delt with until now.The movie is a serious space themed drama that explores the psychological long term effects of space expeditionarys and the inner struggle of people in often life threatening lines of work that often cause heart problems high stress anxiety and emotional disconnection in a fictional universe of course but it is something many people in real life can associate with and understand in some basic way.Brad Pitt is at his best as an actor in this role really making use of his quiet yet stern exterior with his low key tone of voice and personality that makes his performance feel emotional and genuine even when his character is speaking internally.The movie is well shot and directed with stunning visuals and backgrounds of space that really are breathtaking visually there are also a few action scenes in the movie that are very well shot and make use of the quietness and stillness of space to create tension without the adrenaline fuled sound effects and background music that are usually put into action scenes.I recommend this movie to fans of space themed movies like The Martian and Gravity that are more focused on story and character development this is a movie that takes things slow and builds on suspence over time worth any movie goers time.",Ad Astra

138,anselmdaniel,A thoughtful space adventure,7,5 February 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Ad Astra is a science-fiction adventure movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is directed by James Gray, written by James Gray and Ethan Gross. The movie stars Brad Pitt in the lead role. The movie is about Major Roy McBride that accepts a mission to communicator with his father that is at the edge of the Solar System.Ad Astra is not an action movie. Despite the trailers making the movie out to be a space action-adventure, the movie is not an action-adventure. The movie is incredibly beautiful in its long shots and action sequences. There are action elements in this movie but they are few and far between for a movie that is more of a character study. This movie has its center across its 124 minutes of running time on Major Roy McBride. This character is played incredibly well by Brad Pitt and it serves as the audience's vehicle through the movie. The movie is anchored entirely by Brad Pitt and he does a good job playing the stoic astronaut. The movie has interesting aspects that reflect in its world.Ad Astra's world is masterfully shown and created. This world is shown through Major Roy McBride's eyes. The world is a near future where space travel has become more mainstream. The moon has been colonized and corporations influence the moon station. There are even space pirates that are present on the moon. Spaceships are more plentiful with the designs being influenced by existing space shuttles the United States of America has created in the past. The world feels dusty and decrepit as Major Roy McBride accelerates to meeting his father.The full arc of this story is Major Roy McBride reaching his father of H. Clifford McBride. This story has a lack of surprise as its surprise. Clifford McBride's mission objective was to find out if intelligent life existed. When Roy McBride reaches the Lima Project space station, he discovers that his father had not found any evidence of intelligent life outside of the Solar System. The movie plays this plot thread and it can be disappointing for any audiences that were expecting a grand science fiction movie. I thought the surprise in the plot was interesting as the movie was always going to be about the relationship with Roy McBride and Clifford McBride. The story succeeds in examining this relationship but fails in having the mystery defined.There are some problems in the story. The world has astronauts that must pass a psychological examination in order to fly. However in this movie, the psychological examination can be cheated. In this movie Roy McBride offers an emotional statement in the evaluation but he delivers it stoically. This still convinces the evaluation to allow him to fly a spaceship. Later when Roy enters into another evaluation, Roy finds himself speaking stoically but is emotionally concerned. The test fails him and he is grounded. The test is incredibly flawed but somehow plays an important role in the movie.I would recommend 'Ad Astra'.Grade: B",Ad Astra
139,msbreviews,Rating: B+,8,19 September 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I love sci-fi space movies, especially when these depict the cosmos in such a visually stunning manner as Ad Astra does. It's one of those films where the visuals elevate whatever narrative is being told. If you don't get goosebumps or get excited with the opening sequence of this movie, then it might not be the film you're looking for. From the quiet but powerful sound design to the impressive cinematography, James Gray delivers a visually captivating story with an outstanding protagonist. Brad Pitt is definitely getting tons of nominations this awards season (let's not forget his amazing role in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood).His subtle yet incredibly emotional performance shows an astonishing range. He carries the whole screenplay in his shoulders, and I don't mind that at all. There's a lot of narration, and here's where I transition to the most divisive aspect of the movie: it's a slow-burn. Now, there's no problem with a film being deliberately slow. In fact, some of my favorite movies of all-time aren't fast-paced. They cherish their story and make the audience feel interested in what they're experiencing. Ad Astra isn't an action flick or a comedy, it's a character-driven drama, so most of the runtime is devoted to developing Roy.That said, don't go in with expectations of feeling entertained all the time. Some moments aren't supposed to excite you or leave you jaw-dropped. Some sequences are just meant to make you feel immersed by the environment, be lost in space (IMAX is the mandatory way of watching this feature). Don't expect the film to make an 80-day trip to some planet end in two cuts and 20 seconds. Gray purposefully establishes a slow pace. Obviously, general audiences don't usually enjoy this type of flicks, but if you're able to manage your expectations realistically, you're one step closer to not feel bored throughout the runtime.The first act is the one that captures everyone's attention. It doesn't waste time on Earth, it goes through what's happening pretty quickly, and it possesses 90% of the heavy action (including one of the best opening sequences of the year). Sound has a significant impact on how Gray films his sequences, and it's unbelievable how well-shot the chasing scenes on the Moon are. Scientifically speaking, this is no Interstellar where you simply have to accept some mind-blowing yet unjustified stuff. Ad Astra doesn't have a single scene where one might think ""this completely takes me out of the movie, I can't accept that this is possible in some fictional future"". This is a huge compliment to a space film containing several launches, lunar bases, and (very) long space journeys.However, the remaining two acts focus intensely on Pitt's character, slowing down the main plot. Like I wrote above, there's a lot of development through Roy's thoughts. Extensive narration is almost always an issue, even when the narrator is Brad Pitt. Some monologues do indeed develop the character or explain what he's feeling, but some tend to fall into the philosophical side that doesn't always carry a meaningful or interesting message. Using everyday language, sometimes it's a bit boring... Additionally, the ending might be a letdown for a lot of people. Tommy Lee Jones (H. Clifford McBride) doesn't have a lot of screentime, and I can't really delve into details about his storyline, but his character's relationship with Roy doesn't exactly serve as a fantastic payoff.Max Richter's score is one of 2019's best, and I hope it gets recognized by every award show. It definitely helps the experience to be more enthralling. The lack of sound in space is also powerful in its own way. Beautifully-edited, but with a continuously slow pace that doesn't change from the moment the second act begins. However, the story of Ad Astra is vastly superior to, for example, Gray's The Lost City of Z, which I genuinely disliked. This space adventure is visually more exciting, its story is more engaging, and its protagonist is more compelling than everything else in Gray's previous installment. Finally, it's one of those movies that watching at a film theater (mainly IMAX) or at home, makes a massive difference. You'll never feel as entertained or captivated at home, so make sure to check this one at the best possible screen near you.All in all, Ad Astra is yet another display case for Brad Pitt's chances at winning an Oscar. With a subtle yet powerful performance, Pitt carries the whole story to safe harbor with tremendous help from the eyegasmic visuals. Technically, it's one of 2019's closest movies to being perfect. Very well-shot, well-edited, with an immersive score, and gorgeous cinematography. However, it's a slow-burn that doesn't always work as such. Narration is the go-to method to develop Pitt's character, and while it works most of the time, it slows down the main plot, becoming a tad boring during a few moments. The ending isn't the impactful payoff that the film needed, and the incredible supporting cast is under-utilized.

It's not a space horror/thriller/exploration movie you might guess from the bits and pieces you have seen on the web! It's a drama film in the core with space as the backdrop. It's a story about our main
Lead, that is Brad Pitt's character Roy Mcbride. It's about his journey and inner realisation of the whole concept of life and living. It's his learning curve from the very beginning to the last minute of the film. And also the relationship he had shared with his father or the image he set about him in his mind that makes him what he's today or slightly becoming so like him bit by bit. It's a character driven film that heavily relies on Brad Pitt's terrific performance and some visual mastery in the cinematography department. Alongside some haunting but minimalist approach of background score. It's a pleasure to our eyes and ears. AD Astra is technically fluent and rich but the main problems lie elsewhere!One of them should be the slow paced screenplay and the lack of integrity to the main plot. It seems loose and incomplete in many sections. The other characters except Roy and his father haven't really fleshed out well! The ongoing turmoil between Roy and his wife has never been shown properly ; we just got a glimpse of it. And what can I say about those logics used in this film. Although it would be less bothering if you could take those with a pinch of salt! And lastly the climax, the climax really saddened me. I was expecting some hard hitting feels or depth in it but the makers instead had gone for a lazy and generic ending where the main protagonist is in good shape and going towards a happy ending! I would have rather liked a more sad or tragic finish so that the character of Roy could have been much more impactful as a whole. That's my personal opinion though. I personally liked the film! It's a performance heavy plot that I really enjoyed ; not gonna lie.So if you are into these kind of slow burn, performance driven drama films then you are in the right place otherwise you might wanna give it a second thought I reckon!",Ad Astra

147,MrDHWong,An ambitious journey of a far reaching scale held together by a solid performance by its main star,8,19 September 2019,"Ad Astra is a science fiction film directed by James Gray (The Lost City of Z). Starring Brad Pitt in the lead role, it is an ambitious journey of a far reaching scale held together by a solid performance by its main star.In the not-too-distant future, astronaut Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) is assigned with travelling to the edge of the Solar System to seek out his father Cliff (Tommy Lee Jones), who disappeared on a mission almost 30 years prior. In spite of the ever-looming prospect of never returning, Roy agrees to this task and sets off into the far reaches of space.Visually stunning and poignant, As Astra undertakes the complex burden of distinguishing itself from similar sci-fi films with mostly successful results. The film's plot echoes Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, in which the main character journeys into outer space to search for someone previously thought to be lost. However, with the missing person in question being an actual relative, there is more of a familial connection to the motivation driving the hero forward to rescue him. Brad Pitt does a great job carrying the film, his character's determination and fragile emotional nuance served him well during several important moments, especially towards the conclusion. Director James Gray's creative use of colour to highlight the complex mysteries of space were truly beautiful to look at and his nice use of cinematography is distinctly Kubrickian. The biggest flaw with the film, though, is that the first third is very exposition heavy. Several scenes at the beginning were filled with characters discussing complicated scientific jargon and plot points that went nowhere, and this unfortunately caused things to drag on for unnecessary amounts of time. While this film may prove off-putting to casual audiences, anyone with a penchant for thinking person's sci-fi (along the lines of Interstellar and Arrival) should find plenty to enjoy.I rate it 7.5/10",Ad Astra

In general, it initially seems that Ad Astra will not be almost worse than Interstellar. In 10-15 minutes, you realize you 're not. There 's almost no action here, almost the whole plot holds on to Brad Pitt 's monologue. Towards the end, the plot is somehow starting to move. If it wasn 't for Brad Pitt 's acting, I guess I couldn 't watch the movie.",Ad Astra
149,Alexander_Blanchett,Not what you would expect,7,26 September 2019,"A different kind of Sci Fi adventure. Surprisingly psychlogical and philosophical. Also the advertising is a little bit misleading so dont expect your typical Sci Fi Action thriller.
It is rather a finding yourself story of a depressed astronaut and his search for his father.
The film wins you over by the great performance by Brad Pitt who really is outstanding and totally nailes his character. Many said he is wooden but this is what his character is all about. Great moments when he realyl showed emotion. One of Pitt's best performances to date.
Another performance that absolutely stands out and is very underrated is the performance by Tommy Lee Jones who really is engaging in the short screentime given to him, especially towards the ending.
I hoped for more scenes with Liv Tyler but she was rather wasted here. Same goes to Ruth Negga, although she was amazing in the short performance she had. Donald Sutherland also had his moments.
The visuals were more than outstanding. Some really great space and planet images that created a fantastic atmosphere. A thing that was more or less intentioned but still troubled me were the straight igoring of scientific and phyicalic facts. Yes, thats not what the film was about but sometimes they just exaggerated too much with things that could never work in real life. Also the film was often a bit slowish and I was not totally caught by James Gray's direction and screenplay, but there were the things mentioned above that really made up for it.",Ad Astra
150,cardsrock,Much more than your typical sci-fi blockbuster,9,25 September 2019,"I love seeing different ways in which new space films can expand the genre. Ad Astra takes the unique approach of mostly avoiding thrills in favor of a deep dive into the protagonist's psyche. While some may argue about Gray's approach, I believe the film's resolution more than justifies this tactic. Brad Pitt gives a tremendous, understated performance in which you really feel the emotions his character experiences. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema is truly stunning and produced several shots which will likely live on in space film history. A beautiful score and story round out this brilliant, introspective space character study.",Ad Astra
151,CANpatbuck3664,"Stunning Visuals, Solid Acting and Strong Character Development vs. Sketchy Science and Weak Secondary Characters",7,12 October 2019,"What caught my eye when I saw the trailer for Ad Astra wasn't Brad Pitt or the Interstellar style visuals, it was stuff like the bases on the Moon and Mars and the lunar vehicle action set piece. I was stoked to see what kind of world they could dream up and my reaction to this after having watched the movie was pretty middle of the road. There's cool stuff (that chase on the lunar vehicles might be the best part of the movie and the initial action scene is pretty thrilling) and they pose some interesting questions about what would commercial space travel look like. But there's nothing jaw-dropping or amazing, they're going for a more grounded version of the future of mankind (but oddly we still go to old school diners when we can travel to Neptune?) but maybe this could have used a little more fantasy. I got about what I expected but you can be the judge.Brad Pitt isn't just the first billed actor or the only name on the poster, he's at the centre everything that Ad Astra is about. Pitt is doing his best to be stoic in this, his character lacks any emotion and always has another monologue about how cold both he and the world can be but I still found him charming in this. He's a legit movie star and this represents more good work from him. He sells what he needs to, he keeps Ad Astra going and without someone of his calibre in the lead, the movie would have collapsed in on itself like a dying star.I was wondering why Ad Astra lacked big names in the supporting cast (we all like Liv Tyler, Donald Sutherland and Ruth Negga but they aren't A-list types) but halfway through the movie, I realized why. Every supporting actor or actress isn't important or gets very little screen time. Tommy Lee Jones is showing his age but he's still a wonderful actor. He's the antagonist here and he does a lot when he was only given a little. I liked Donald Sutherland as Pruitt but the character was written oddly. They seem to be setting him up for a subplot but he vanishes pretty quickly. Donald does what he can but this isn't a ""show-stopping"" supporting part. Ditto for Ruth Negga who's an underrated actress and gets the job done but her part is also small. Liv Tyler is in the movie so little, she has almost no dialogue. I didn't notice any weak acting but the rest of the cast puts in workmanlike performances.I saw this with a friend and one of my comments to her was that the movie felt very much like I was reading a science fiction novel. There's a lot of narration from Roy McBride, he's explaining his train of thought and how events are relating to him. This is fine but it presents a change of pace that could fall into the show us don't tell us pitfall. It does help fill time and Pitt is good at delivering these musings via voice over. But when my attention started to drift away, the visual sensibility brought me back in. Ad Astra is gorgeous, it may not be the most beautiful hard sci-fi movie that's come out recently but its up there with the best. The planets are presented in a vivid and arresting way and unless you're just not into science fiction, you'll at least be engaged visually.If you were one of the people who railed against this movie, I honestly get it. It's too long overall and slow for stretches, there seems like there's going to be more action than there is, anyone in the cast not named Brad Pitt or Tommy Lee Jones gets little to do and the movie pretends to be sound from a scientific perspective when its just as off course as Roy's mission. But what saved the movie for me was the good work by Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones, the fact that Roy McBride is a different kind of protagonist for this genre and being disappointed with more heralded efforts like First Man (lack of a compelling main character, slow pace) and even Interstellar (sketchy science, disappointing ending, odd character choices). Those are both good science fiction dramas but First Man was over-hyped and while Interstellar features McConaughey and great effects, it hasn't aged well. So maybe that disappointment lead me to forgive some of Ad Astra's flaws. But I thought this was a pleasant surprise, its much like the director's previous effort The Lost City of Z which I also liked despite it being too long and slow. I'd give Ad Astra a 7.5/10 which I'm instead rounding down because the longer I examine this movie, the more I'm noticing problems.",Ad Astra

156,ronakkotian,Deep and transcendent...,7,22 September 2019,"WARNING: *SPOILERS*I remember leaving the theatre feeling so conflicted about my experience with Ad Astra. I wasn't expecting this movie to take the direction it took.Ad Astra is about Roy McBride who is given task to find his father as well as investigate the increasing amount of ""power surges"" that threaten the solar system.The plot seems very simple but it's so much more than the brief description displayed above. Just to mention, this movie isn't for everyone! This movie isn't targeted for a mainstream audience.What James Gray has done here is very impressive. The movie isn't about the journey but rather the characters. The main focus is Roy McBride as majority of the shots include him. We see McBride as a very broken and emotional man, due to his father abandoning him, as he's travelling through space and what makes it work so well is Brad Pitt's stellar performance. James Gray makes our protagonist so isolated and distraught in the last 30-40 minutes to a point where we feel for him and when the big confrontation occurs, you can't help but feel that emotional attachment between McBride and his father.Aside from the story, the technical aspects of this movie are gorgeous. The cinematography and visual effects make the setting of space really atmospheric and the fantastic score makes the aesthetics look even better. Gray's direction is fantastic. The camerawork is stunning throughout. There is a constant feeling of sorrow and depression from the environment to make the audience see through McBride's point of view.A few action sequences involving pirates on the moon felt misplaced and didn't suit the artsy-like direction the film was heading towards. Some of the space physics were inconsistent and the screenplay could've been developed further to make us care about and understand our protagonist more.Despite its shortcomings, Ad Astra is a one of a kind film. The visuals seem deep and transcendant as you go along. This film isn't one of those high octane sci-fi epics that people can watch whilst eating their popcorn. This film is a character study dedicated to a niche audience that appreciate cinema as an art form and a way of expressing something.",Ad Astra
157,phenomynouss,"Unclear, unfocused, nothing to say",3,7 June 2020,"I feel like I was waiting throughout virtually the entire movie just for there to be something coherent to latch on to. At some point in the beginning, I missed literally less than 4 or 5 seconds worth of dialogue in a meeting, and as a result a full hour of the film after that became a struggle to understand. Famous astronaut Clifford McBride has been missing for decades after flying a ship mission to Neptune. Energy surges of some sort start coming from the Neptune area and hitting Earth, severely disrupting the Space Antenna and other earth-based areas, tens of thousands dead. SPACECOM puts two and two together and decides McBride needs to die.
So they send his son Roy to go and try to communicate with him to figure out, like... What? All throughout the increasingly incoherent and complicated journey, Roy narrates a voice-over presumably after the fact where he waxes philosophic on a number of issues of humanity, family, and his own mood and emotions. And he settles on absolutely nothing of substance throughout it. At one point he seems to be pushing himself towards a generally misanthropic point of view, only to almost immediately drop it and return to his glorious mission to discover whatever.
""Discover whatever"" appears to be his mission, as SPACECOM sends him ostensibly to contact his father and try to figure out what's happening with the space surges. There's implications they may end up wanting to kill him to put a stop to it. Clifford McBride's mission is to find evidence of extraterrestrial life, which for some reason necessitated him and his ship crew to travel to Neptune.
Roy McBride's mission arbitrarily bounces between those three options, largely dependent on whatever he feels like droning on about in his voiceover and whatever given moment.
The whole movie is basically like this. It's one thing to have some manner of psychological element to explore, whether it be the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or the effects of the human mind in long-term space travel and living in space, or the fragile psychology of a largely emotionless man who prides himself on never having his heartrate rise above 80 bpm even during catastrophic situations.
None of those things is ever stuck to for any significant portion of time. None of those themes is explored to any depth. None of it sticks, and the script just fluctuates between the three as carelessly and aimlessly as if it were put together from the notes of two or three different writers without any attempt to make each theme flow together.
As an aside, entirely from a storytelling perspective, this film made some big mistakes of adding pointless detours that went nowhere and serve only to waste time. The similarity in content leads me to comparison with ""Interstellar""
In ""Interstellar"", like a Choose Your Own Adventure, they reach a point where they have 3 planets to choose from to visit for signs the planet is habitable for humanity. The rules of drama state that something has to go horribly wrong. When something goes horribly wrong, it affects the entire mission permanently, to the point of irrevocably re-shaping their future mission and removing one of the planets from their entire plan. You could not cut out the side-trip because it had a catastrophic impact on the main story.
In ""Ad Astra"", there are Choose Your Own Adventure moments like that which add nothing and do not affect the story at all. For ill explained reasons of secrecy, Roy McBride has to land in a commercial port on the moon then hitch a ride on some incredibly poorly built lunar rovers (the type where literally gently touching the wheels causes it to fall apart) to the far side of the moon, when he's ambushed by moon pirates.
Nothing significant happens and he moves on to his next wacky adventure. Wild stuff happens. On to the next wacky adventure. You could easily cut out each of these moments and it would not have affected either the story or the pacing of the film in any way. Not only that, but their presence would do little to alleviate a sense of boredom from watching the film. Action in a space exploration movie is not a necessary component, and its addition here feels almost comical in how incoherent and needless it is. It ends up not being a release from the quiet moments, but just more stuff wasting time and making the film feel a lot longer than it actually is.",Ad Astra

AD ASTRA seems to be reaching for comparisons with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, but it doesn't quite make it. Our astronaut hero has a couple of hiccups on his way to Neptune and is much given to introspection, thinking about his missing dad and his failing marriage. Brad Pitt is not in such fine form as he was in the Tarantino movie a few months back: introspection occasionally looks more like constipation.2001 had a 'mythic' quality to it which AD ASTRA just doesn't have. It is an odyssey, and the complex father-son relationship brings faint echoes of classic Greek tragedy, but it falls short of epic. Maybe we've become a bit blasé about space movies since Kubrick's day (1968). The STAR TREK chapters in which Mr Spock died and was resurrected did 'mythological' a lot more effectively.",Ad Astra

There are several exhilarating scenes in space or in the ships, including the opening scene. What's truly engaging here, though, is Pitt's performance and the character study of Roy. The narrative and primary takeaway is a deceptively simple one for how broad its implications are. Pitt struggled to connect with those closest to him and on some level felt obligated to live up to his father's great legacy as an astronaut committed to discovery about the universe. When he hears his father, who has been gone for many years, may be sending signals, he is determined to go see him. He ends up making it to him, only for his father to have no desire to return to Earth or see him. Roy realizes that his father became so obsessed with succeeding in his work and finding extraterrestrial life that he loses sight of the emotional connections and human value in his life, even as the data clearly shows that aliens don't exist. Roy had been holding out hope that his father would justify his methodical and emotionless emphasis on work, but after realizing his father's failure, he doesn't make the same mistake, literally and metaphorically lets go of his father, and returns to Earth with a newfound appreciation for the people he interacts with.That, I think, is the real takeaway from the movie: stop looking outwards and trying to find something out there that will explain everything or give your life meaning, and instead look inwards and realize that life is given meaning by your human context, by the relationships you have. There are hints at critiques of consumerism (seeing the pillow and blanket cost $125, and seeing the Moon with an Applebees and Starbucks) and pure individualism (both Roy and Cliff fail because they try to do everything themselves and believe they can, while others pay the cost - Roy and his mother in Cliff's case, and his wife and his crewmembers in Roy's case). Even the monkeys scene, which at face value seemed jarring and out of place, does make some sense when you consider the idea that failures on ships don't come from aliens coming out of nowhere like in Life, they come from human error and misestimation, as they decided to bring the monkeys on board. While you could read the ending in a more negative and cynical light (as Joe did when I watched it with him), if you take my view it's an optimistic one, that Roy realizes his father's mistakes and really does change for the better. Pitt's performance is really great in this, and I'd be very surprised if he wasn't in my personal Best Actor nomination group for the year. The cinematography is great, all of the shots are absolutely beautiful, and the score is also very good. While I liked The Lost City of Z, Ad Astra is a masterpiece that is my favorite movie of 2019 so far thanks to its thoughtfulness, performance from Pitt, and wonderful visuals.",Ad Astra

Honestly, how can you spend $87,500,000 and end up with an awful script? I'm not a script writer, I'm unemployed, but if you had paid me $200 I would have read this and said..hold up..section A-D is pants.. and crikey all of this dialogue here.. is wooden as eff. With an outlay of $87,500,000, how did a script with such terrible dialogue pass the bosses? Honestly, it's that bad. This is one of those films where you as the audience start asking yourself: ""Wait, why don't they just do this..."" or ""What? Why did they do that""? Grrr! So frustrating lol. The dialogue is sooo bad it makes Brad Pitt look like a GCSE drama student (UK school exams aged 16). It's also edited badly. Clunky dialogue = I hate character A = next scene I love character A! WTF! Look, I love all things space. The scenery in this film is great. I loved the scenes on the Moon, Mars and near Neptune but the script killed it. The original story had potential but it was destroyed by a terrible script. My advice to Hollywood is this: Next time a film has an $87,500,000 budget, pay $1 million and hire great writers and then spend $86,500,000 on the film. If you do that, you might have an Oscar winner and not a piece of pap like this. I'll give this a VERY generous 5/10 for the space scenery which I loved.",Ad Astra

168,braquecubism,"so boring even with Brad- BORING, SLOW",1,22 July 2020,"I watched on HBO Max before looking at reviews. How bad could it be SciFi with Brad & Tommy. I want my money back. I reluctantly sat through this hoping it would get better. No such luck. there are so many 1 star, this may not get seen, but I added my voice ""0"" stars. and I cannot imagine there were this many 7-10 stars. Impossible
I wonder how these producers got enough money to pay Brad Pitt an Tommy Lee Jones with such a deary script. Oh Brad has Producer credit, an inducement. maybe oil rich Arabs who want to get into show biz.People commented on how wrong the 'science' is- sci fi has to follow known physics, and its' metaphysics like time travel, has to have an established universe.

169,harryplinkett14,Is this a joke?,1,25 September 2019,"Somewhere in the near future, as the film tells us, humans have colonized the Moon, planet Mars, and sent a mission to Neptune. Now, this would have taken at least a century to accomplish, but the film insists it's 'near future'. Maybe a century is near future for the writers of the script, who knows? But it did confuse me, as did everything else. We never get any proper exposition. We learn that there is conflict among nations, which exists on the Moon as well, but we don't know how bad it is, who is at war with whom, over what, etc. We learn there was a mission to Neptune designed to search for extraterrestrial life, which was presumed lost. But later on we learn that we have the technology to send a rocket to Neptune, which only takes two to three months to reach that planet. So why was no such rocket sent to investigate what had happened with the mission? No one knows. Then we learn that there are power surges caused by some sort of energy emission from Neptune, which may or may not have something to do with the mission. Guess what? We never learn what it was. No clue. And this is the kind of confusion that is present in every single scene. The plot is all over the place, never focused, never clear, often tonally confusing, filled with forced action scenes that contribute nothing in terms of furthering the plot. I would say that the film ends with an aniclimax, but by the end that's what everyone expected. It was fitting for this boring anf pointless film, which failed to provide emotional payoff in any of the scenes, to end with a whimper. There is Liv Tyler in this film, too, but you forget about her until she shows up in another pointless and boring scene at the end. What was the film about? Something about dealing with abandonment, existential issues, sins of one's father... while there is also an idea about humanity having to turn to themselves to solve their problems, rather than hope some aliens would do it... as if anyone expects aliens to solve anything. It's just crazy and boring gibberish. That being said, the actors did their best. I don't blame anything on them. Also, in purely technical terms, the film is well made. But the script is atrocious. One final note: there is more feminist rubbish here, which most people have had enough of. What an unlikable film.",Ad Astra
170,Xavier_Stone,Dang what miss,3,2 June 2020,"This was billed as an action movie similar to Gravity and it becomes a pointless close up advertisement for Brad Pitt. I love Brad in almost anything, but here there are way way way too many close up views of his face in many scenes.
I guess it's an attempt to create tension and drama. This movie is a drama. Very little action at all.
And the whole movie is pointless. Why would you send a manned spacecraft to the edge of the galaxy to inspect something when an unmanned craft would be more reliable, cheaper and, well without giving away too much the ending is very poor.",Ad Astra
171,PyroSikTh,Apocalypse Now in Space,8,18 September 2019,"I love when sci-fi movies try to be a bit more cerebral or artistic and use its sci-fi concepts to tell an emotional story. Inception, Interstellar, Arrival, Blade Runner 2049, 2001, Solaris, First Man, Annihilation, Ex Machina, Moon, District 9, Sunshine, Gravity etc etc etc. These are the movies I look forward to, and Ad Astra fits in with them perfectly. It's no surprise that I came out of the cinema happy, despite the troupe of special needs people making a racket throughout, despite the two and a half hour journey home thanks to insane traffic, it was all worth it for Ad Astra.Roy always had dreams of becoming an astronaut. What kid doesn't? But Roy lives in the near future, where humanity has already spread out to the stars, or at least the Moon and Mars. His father was a pioneer of space exploration, pushing the boundaries up to Neptune before disappearing on a quest to find intelligent life. For all Roy knows, his father died a hero. The best way to describe Ad Astra is Apocalypse Now in space, as strange and deadly power surges emanating from Neptune puts Roy on the trail to find a madman.Much like Apocalypse Now, Ad Astra is almost entirely about the journey. Through Roy we see what the space travel could be like in the near future. Commercial rockets take passengers to and from the Moon, which is like a lawless frontier you'd find in a Western; the wilderness is full of bandits seeking a quick payday, while the city base is safe, bustling, and full of consumerism. Further out is the Mars base, stripped back and almost militaristic, and its underground positioning has made it immune to the power surges. It's the last outpost left. Also similarly to Apocalypse Now, the movie focuses a lot on psychology. Roy is routinely required to take psychology assessments to make sure he's still impartial enough for the mission. The assessments are ironically done by artificial intelligence, and as the mission goes on, Roy starts to feel the psychological impacts more and more.Of course what I ended up enjoying most about this movie was its attention to detail in its depiction of space travel. At first glance the world doesn't look all that more technologically advanced than we are now. The ISS has been integrated into an oversized antenna routinely maintained, planted firmly in the ground and extending beyond the atmosphere. The buggies used on the Moon aren't too dissimilar to the moon buggies used most recently, and every ship, station, and base is designed with the limitations of current space travel in mind. Of course it's not perfect, particularly in its third act (such as Roy's catapult back to his ship through Neptune's rings - that felt a little unlikely), but by that point you're so invested you're happy to just roll with it.But the design and attention to detail would be nothing without the visual brilliance bringing it all to life. The visual effects are fantastic, particularly in the moon buggy sequence, and the research monkeys look incredibly realistic, but Ad Astra's real beauty is found in Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography. Every frame is oozing with his visual style, from the ever-shifting shadows of Mars' underground base, to the looming presence of Neptune. There's a great and often subtle use of colours married to each destination - green for Earth, grey for the Moon, orange for Mars, blue for Neptune - that gives the film it's own visual journey to follow.Brad Pitt is obviously the centrepiece of this movie, and he gives a subdued but emotionally tortured performance as Roy. As the film starts he's calm, apathetic, almost cold, but as the movie goes on you start to see the cracks. He always has his mission at the forefront of his mind, but the promise of reuniting with his father starts to weigh on him heavily, and he begins to reflect on where he's going and all he's left behind. ""It has proven to be quite bothersome"" he says during his seventy-nine days alone. Tommy Lee Jones is also great as Roy's father, Clifford. While you would be hard-pressed to describe him as insane, he holds the same calm demeanour and the same single-minded dedication to his mission, no matter the cost, against all odds. His confession to Roy; that he never really cared for his life on Earth or anyone there, is delivered so matter-of-factly that it falls from his tongue like breathing.As much as I enjoyed Ad Astra I find it difficult to put it up in the echelon with many of the great sci-fi movies I started this review with. In truth it probably sits nearer the middle-lower end. It has some great ideas, and on a technical basis is there and back again, but the story is slow, lacks a real sense of conclusion, and as great as Pitt and Jones are, their emotionally distant characters create a bit of a disconnect with the audience. Roy's improvised heartfelt message from Mars is as close as the movie gets to an emotional gutpunch, and as emotional as it is, it lacks the gutpunch. I give Ad Astra a very high 8/10, pushing for a 9. It's absolutely worth watching on a big screen though, to digest all those Hoytema visuals.",Ad Astra

The central question upon which the rest of the story and character development pivots is weather there is other intelligent life in the universe, one of the main two or three storylines in all of science fiction!I almost gave this movie seven stars because of the way it approaches the latter - very differently from pretty much every other science fiction movie - and because it is trying very hard to do something special; but at the end of the day the plot problems noted here and in other reviews keep it from being all it could have been.",Ad Astra
174,sweidman-28016,Great Philosophical Messages,8,3 October 2019,"Ad Astra Review:Astronaut Roy McBride undertakes a mission across an unforgiving solar system to uncover the truth about his missing father and his doomed expedition that now, 30 years later, threatens the universe in James Gray's new film Ad Astra. Going into the film I didn't know much about it. From the trailer that I watched it looked somewhat like Interstellar, which happens to be one of my all time favorite films. What I got out of it was not what I expected too much of, and I'm happy with what it provided. Here's the thing people need to know when going into Ad Astra: this is not just a space movie. If you're anything like me you like a good philosophical film disguised as something else. This is exactly what it is but different. Ad Astra explores the themes of father and son, science, life, and fears. I won't do a full on analysis since I don't like to spoil much. Let's start with the acting. Many people are going to criticize Brad Pitt for his acting. His character is mellow and monotone but that's part of who he is. I enjoyed his performance a lot. It sort of reminded me of Ryan Gosling in First Man (an underrated film by audiences in my opinion). Just because a character is mellow doesn't mean they're bad at acting (in most cases). It's their character and they're doing it the way it's written. Also a good majority of the film is voice over from within Roy's mind. Voice over is kind of a cheap tactic in my opinion but they did it justice somehow in this. His thoughts are real and philosophical making the audience reflect on situations and actual life. His relationship of trying to find and figure out his father (Tommy Lee Jones) was interesting to me. There wasn't a strong relationship but it grows and grows over time as he's exploring. I think Jones did a fine job and along with Donald Sutherland with the time they're in it. The acting is nothing award worthy but I'll point out that it's good. Now to the screenplay. The story is really good. I'm kind of explaining it as I go on in this review. Overall the plot is interesting and explores many topics. This is a slow burner so if you don't like that this is going to be painful for you. Also I don't think of this much as an action movie. The action scenes are different an unique. It's nothing big and in your face but more realistic. The best one takes place on the moon and the sounds of explosions and shots aren't really in your face and sound more subtle, like the sound is being drowned out from the helmets. Like I said it's nothing super intense but the tension and stakes are there. I should add that I think this film should win Best Visual Effects this year. They're so realistic and nothing looked fake. There's something about space movies that can just do it right where everything looks realistic. This brings me back to First Man winning that award this past Academy Awards show. It's realistic and nothing super in your face. At the beginning there's a scene (all these scenes I'm talking about have been in the trailer just to let you know) where he climbs out of their space station and there's a shot of him going down, Earth right below him. The detail was stunning and I really wish I could have seen it in IMAX. The cinematography along with the visuals was always a beauty to look at. Hoyte Van Hoytema also did the cinematography for Interstellar (which should've been nominated) and I think he's even better from that. Hopefully this film will earn another nomination with that. Back to the story, as the journey continues the story goes deeper and more interesting. I will admit there are some slow spots and also an unnecessary minimal plot line with his wife. It didn't add much to the story in my opinion and could've gone without or at least not come back to as often as it does. Scenes are just burned into my head of all different sorts. Some scenes are pretty violent but in a unique way that I liked. The audience doesn't see much of the violence but the little is just enough. This is a film to remember. Another thing I should add before finishing this review is the score. Wow does this have an amazing score by Max Richter. It's such a shame that he's only released one song, To The Stars, for us to listen to. Sort of like the tactic made by Arcade Fire when they composed their Oscar nominated score for Her, except Max Richter actually released a song. The score isn't over bearing and in your face. It's just the right volume and not over the top. I put it in my own genre of scores that make me reflect on everything. There's no other way I can describe it but that. I'd highly recommend Ad Astra. It's not for everyone so be warned if you don't want to think.My Grade: A-",Ad Astra

They're right about that but this film is more about relationships and the effect that losing his father had on Brad Pitt and how this has shaped his entire life.I think it's a very moving film with a fine cast and good filming of the sci-fi scenes, even though some of them are rather incredible. But then so are most films of this type, which you can pick holes in forever. It'll hold its own with the best of them imo.",Ad Astra
176,ethanbresnett,A feast for the eyes,8,18 July 2020,"Ad Astra is an exceptionally beautiful film to look at. The stunning visuals will leave you transfixed and in awe, and they are the run-away success of the movie. How this film was only nominated for Best Sound Mixing at the 2020 Oscars and not cinematography and production design is beyond me.What I love most about this film is that it feels very very sci-fi. There were lots of stylistic borrowings (homages) to classics such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, the eeriness of Alien, the visuals and tension of Gravity, and the colour hues and design of Blade Runner 2049. It was just beautiful and cultivated this near future so vividly. You could freeze this film at almost any moment, print out the frame and hang it on your wall - almost every shot was picture perfect. I'm just gutted I didn't see this in the cinema and could only enjoy this on the small screen! If you have a good home cinema set up, this film will be a good one to showcase and justify the expense. The score was expertly crafted, once again delivering a vintage sci-fi feel as well as pouring tension and beauty into numerous scenes and moments.The camera work and cinematography in Ad Astra was sublime, effectively displaying the vastness, beauty and terror of the final frontier. Alongside all of the above the costume and set design were exquisite. This film delivers on so much, and the entire production crew deserve vast amounts of praise for what they put together here.Dare I say it though, did we get style over substance? Perhaps this statement does a disservice to the content, as the plot and characters weren't bad in the slightest, maybe just not as deep or complex as they could have been. I did very much enjoy the near future that they created, and their interpretation of our future in space. The plot in general though was very straight forward, and not too intriguing. There were a couple of plot kinks, I wouldn't go so far as to call them full on twists, but nothing more than that. There's nothing wrong with plot simplicity, but I think it needs to be coupled with a deeper or more complex character. Pitt's performance was great, but I feel we were only scratching the surface of his character, and there was little to no development of any of the limited supporting cast.Ad Astra is a very well put together and considered film, with endless beauty in its visuals and score. The failings come in its plot and characters but that doesn't by any stretch make this a bad film. Ad Astra accomplishes so much and deserved more love at the Oscars and so much more love at the Box Office.",Ad Astra
177,CineMuseFilms,A feast of special effects and Freudian themes.,7,28 December 2019,"Some space movies fill you with awe at the vastness of their domain, while others feel claustrophobic. How you react to Ad Astra (2019) will depend on whether you go along with it's inter-galactic pursuit of a menace to earth's survival or you become immersed in the film's psychological drama. These twin-storylines do not always sit well together.The plotline is simple: Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) is an elite astronaut who has spent his career in the shadow of his famous space pioneering father H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones). Three decades ago, Cliff led a mission to find life in distant galaxies and has not been heard of since. Space Command have intelligence that he is still alive and poses an existential threat to mankind. Roy has been secretly recruited to hunt his father down and eliminate the threat.Viewers get two very different movies for the same ticket: a sci-fi chase with enough digital effects to please the most demanding techno-obsessive, and a space-opera framed around the Freudian theme of father-son love (or its absence). Neither movie fills its potential, and each is a distraction for the other. Roy dominates screen time as both protagonist and narrator. This might have worked except that the elite astronaut's pulse rate flatlines below 80 bpm, which is mirrored in the film's tension curve (except for a five-second shot of a tear rolling down his face when his father tells his that he never cared about him).Hoping to load intensity into the Freudian theme, the cameras spend far too much time gazing into Roy's vacant face as he grapples with the moral dilemmas that Space Command has thrust upon him (including patricide). This filming style becomes tiresome when it is applied to most of the cast, except for the feral space-lab monkeys whose fate will alienate animal rights supporters. If the photography was half as exciting as some other recent extra-terrestrial films, the depiction of Ad Astra'sinterior emotional space might have provided a poignant contrast. Instead, it imparts a claustrophobic feel to both of the film's twin storylines. Brad Pitt fans will disagree, but it's hard to imagine a more wooden hero.There are several scenes of infinity that we come to expect from space movies and lots of shiny steel with buttons and switches and flashing lights to remind us that space exploration is at the front edge of technological innovation. But that's about all this moderately entertaining film achieves, despite being hailed as the space epic of the year.",Ad Astra
178,akcenat,"""Apocalypse Now' look like disappointing slow space (sci-fi shopfront) cinema",6,16 December 2019,"This is a male-heavy film in which first half of a movie was relatively OK, but after that, for me, everything crumbled. The cast looked incredible (Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland...) but the director definitely made an incoherent emotional journey. The presence of Liv Tyler as Brad Pitt wife is so underused that for all the minimal impact those handful of scenes have, the film could easily have not included her at all. Despite the slow rhythm, film has some moments of action - there's a rover chase on the moon which is interesting 'car chase' - and tension build up with Norwegian space ship, but that is all. It is visually, also, very pretty, but this movie titled in Latin ""to the stars"", is not nearly as profound as it wants to be or should have been.

But it's disappointingly surface level, ultimately; the idea of people projecting their father issues on to God, and vice versa, is familiar to me as a pastor and is rich territory for science-fiction to explore. However, it needs some subtlety to really work and this film doesn't so much advertise its themes as it does take out an enormous poster about them and splash them at the busiest intersection in town. There are spectacular sequences which are beautifully staged (sometimes hinting at Gravity, a film with which this one shares much); but the director and writer don't seem able to decide how to marry these scenes with the subtlety required to pull off the bigger themes they are floundering to express with real seriousness.

Given the bulk of what's being produced lately, I give them credit.But if you set out to do a project, please take the time to do it right. Don't ignore the details, in favor of some macro vibe. Creating a somber or depressed atmosphere from the start of a picture is ok. But give us a chance to understand the why of the vibe. Sullen narration is not enough. It's lazy.We get that our protagonist is a loner and distrusting of common living. But we need more. What is Earth like in the near future when this is set? They never show it. Is it depressing? We learn later that he inherited a nature and mental baggage from his eccentric, loner father. But is that it?If I was in phenomenal shape, married to Liv Tyler and had no kids, I'd be in a great mood.The original Blade Runner did a way better job of creating a somber atmosphere.Why was his dad obsessed with finding ""intelligent life"" on other planets? Is it part of a rebellion against religion, or Earthling self-hatred, or just curiosity? I can understand wanting to find water or food.Is the Jones character supposed to be like the Harrison Ford character in Mosquito Coast? Contemptuous of ordinary people, highly independent, and wanting to find a better way of life than the one of his birth?We do hear some philosophizing, but not nearly enough. There is some alluding to the notion that he despises our trivial, commercial culture. So I think he was searching for something more sophisticated.Because as a man of science and adventure, he couldn't accept the banality of our world, and he did not possess the nature to handle the nuances of love and responsibility.The Donald Sutherland appearance was totally gratuitous. As was Liv Tyler. Pitt's narration wonders what makes an old guy like Sutherland's character continue to work, and concludes that he is just like his father.The character mentions that he had dropped out of the program that Jones commanded, but he doesn't explain. There was way more potential for that character. Did he choose a conventional pilot's life out of fear and secretly admire Jones' courage? Therefore regretting dropping out? Or does he think Jones pursued folly?Does anyone believe in God in this film? Let's hear their opinion about intelligent life elsewhere.The use of maudlin, emotional orchestra music for space scenes is so cliché and manipulative. I don't mind being manipulated, but please manipulate me in new and interesting ways.Loren Dean appears in most space films. I may be the only person who notices this. Do they do this because he has a good space film resume? Or is it some kind of six degrees of separation concept? I'd like to see him in more vehicles like Mumford, in which he starred.Yes, most reviewers are correct that this is not a movie about space. It's about people and set in space.

Some really hit the mark, like 'Gravity' and 'The Martian,' while others fell flat, from 'Passengers' to 'Elysium.' 2019's 'Ad Astra' ends up somewhere in between, as the Brad Pitt vehicle rests squarely on his shoulders but doesn't have the kind of story that can sustain its overall weight.In 'Astra,' we meet veteran astronaut Roy McBride, who must embark on a mission to rescue his long lost father (played by an aging Tommy Lee Jones), as he's the only one who can help put an end to things that are going haywire on Earth. Sure, we've all seen this story before, but the plot is not the weakest aspect of 'Astra.'Instead, the film really suffers from boredom. Aside from a few unsettling curveballs (the chimp scene, anyone?), everything here is ""been there, seen that,"" and little is left to the imagination. Pitt's acting doesn't help matters much, as he comes across as dry and wooden throughout the entire film.

""Ad Astra"" (Latin meaning ""to the stars"") soars into deep space and Brad Pitt is at the centre of it all. Pitt delivers yet another grand performance in this starring role. As much as I enjoyed this drama, it is true that Hollywood has taken a risk they haven't done in a long while. Releasing this film to a mass audience will have people disappointed; this isn't your typical man vs aliens science-fiction film. ""Ad Astra"" is a hard-core, emotionally draining drama with a ton of brains, and a message that should resonate if you think about it hard enough.",Ad Astra
192,ferdmalenfant,So Long and Boring,1,6 December 2019,"I sat, I watched and the only other thing I did was wait for ANYTHING to happen because nothing does happen. If this was anyone but Pitt it would be the biggest flop to ever come out of Hollywood.",Ad Astra
193,fluffchop,The bad user comments are hilarious,6,17 February 2021,"Go rent Star Wars you pack of whingers. This is a serious film. There aren't any cheap tricks going on here. Well they did drive across THE MOON!!! shooting at each other in moon buggies. So Brad Pitt can't die no matter what happens. I watched I am Mother and this film back to back. IF you enjoy slow movies you'll enjoy this. Not everything is an action film, and that's probably what people thought they'd get. Oh yeah everyone suddenly has a PhD in Physics whenever a movie is set in space, the comments are just hilariously stupider than the movie they're attempting to criticise. The movie is about anything you want it to be about. So many people writing about how nobody gets it, and then proceeding to read all sorts of meaning into something that just isn't there to begin with. This movie has a lot of 'space'. It doesn't let a good story interfere with the atmosphere of the film, so people start to imagine all sorts of things. I think that's the real point. I often imagine traveling through space watching films. Hey it's Dad on TV.",Ad Astra

195,adrianovasconcelos,"Ad Astra: an insult to intelligence, knowledge, and science fiction",2,23 September 2019,"Two stars for a credible performance by Pitt and good special effects. The rest is an insult to intelligence, knowledge and sci-fi: 1. It takes about 12 years to travel from Earth to Neptune. In addition to his time traveling to Mars, and his return from Neptune, Pitt does very well to look exactly the same 30 years later; 2. Did no one in the crew know that when an astronaut returns to Earth, he/she has to be quarantened? Instead, some soldiers retrieve Pitt from space module immediately after re-entering the Earth's atmosphere! 3. Why all the efforts to see Dad only to agree to cut him loose into space? 4. What is the explanation for apes to be on board a spacecraft? Was evolution inverted and humans went back to being apes? 5. How can Pitt and Jones just breathe normally as if they were on Earth, when they are close to the extremely poisonous gases that form the rings around Saturn?AD ASTRA borrows shamelessly from Joseph Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS, and Francis Ford Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW, with Lee Jones slotting into Brando's role in that 1979 movie. It also does not hesitate to copy ideas from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, notably when Pitt re-enters space shuttles 3 or 4 time!Waste of time and effort. Liv Tyler did not have even one spoken line!",Ad Astra
196,Cinema_Fan,The space between us:,6,27 September 2019,"Space; the space between us. The space that divides us. The space that we use to keep our distance. The space that pulls us together. The space that unites us. This paradoxical concept of nothingness that fulfils the need to pull toward, or divide against, one another is forever constant within this concept of James Grey and Ethan Gross' space drama Ad Astra. Space, albeit the cosmic, interstellar void of deep space here, could very easily have been translated into desert, ocean or continent, but it reflects well with the metaphor of division that there can be only one belief that is space; space as a vessel to reconnect.Ad Astra's theme here is connection, or more simply, reconnection with those that are lost or abandoned. This feeling of loss starts very early on when we see the wife placing her keys on the table and walking out, for the final time. Roy McBride has concerns; his wife has gone and he assumes his father has come to an untimely end whilst surveying the outer ridge of the solar system searching for extra-terrestrial life whilst the earth is being slowly destroyed by power surges from deep space.The magnificent backdrop of interplanetary opulence perpetuates and excels this disconnection in which brings about loneliness, despair and madness. Its all a very interesting design that has glimpses of past space exploration as Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) and not too dissimilar to Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), substituting space for continent here and with themes of isolation and madness. The imagery is second to none and befits, and contradicts, the tiny, insignificance of human existence against this limitlessness of time & space. Here lies the paradox within the narrative, while we witness the protagonist and his father reconnect, albeit for differing reasons, it is only with deep, and final, parting that they both become truly father & son once more.This true enlightenment of the human spirit that our protagonist dictates throughout forms an inner conclusion that brings about a self-awareness amongst, and against, this vacuum of both inner and outer reaches of the soul and space. Ad Astra is simply more than a voyage of the body, it is an inner voyage of consciousness that comes about when all may appear at their lowest, their most despairing and, too, reassures that all is not lost, all is not solitary.",Ad Astra
197,DeBBss,"Cinematic, But a Little Boring",7,12 July 2020,"Ad Astra is a combination of Event Horizon and 2001: A Space Odyssey. It has 2001: A Space Odyssey's cinematography and themes with an Event Horizon type plot. Ad Astra is interesting at first, but it starts to slow down a lot, and it gets to the point where you're yawning several times throughout the runtime. But the weird thing is, is that there are plenty of great scenes that are extremely intense. The issue is that those thrilling scenes are so short when compared to other normal scenes.As I've said, Ad Astra is surprisingly alike to Event Horizon. And I love the plot, and the way they wrote it to be somewhat of a psychological thriller is great. But although the plot is interesting, the pacing kind of ruins it. There are too many scenes that are boring, and they go on for way too long. I think this movie should've been 10-20 minutes shorter. And I do understand that Ad Astra is supposed to be a slow burn with lethargic cinematography, but I think they focused on that a little too much.The best part about Ad Astra was how beautiful it was. The colorful palette and slow shots are amazing. When it comes to aesthetics, Ad Astra is totally on point. The sets and lighting were great, and it really reminds me of 2001: A Space Odyssey's practical effects.Ad Astra is a great movie that is also scientifically realistic. You could simply enjoy Ad Astra just because of how well it was shot. But since Ad Astra is such a slow burn, it could turn off some. Overall, Ad Astra is a good movie, but it's not all that special.",Ad Astra
198,TheHoodOfSwords,A return to great Sc-Fi!,8,12 September 2020,"A whole lot of thoughts here and not an easy thing to explain out so I'll just word vomit onto the page.First, this is my 900th film! I was going to make it 2010, the sequel to one of the most personal and moving pieces of media I have ever seen. But instead, I decided to see this. I wasn't disappointed because in a way this feels like 2001. A movie about solitude and loneliness. Sometimes I forget why I like Sci-Fi so much and then a movie like this comes along and makes me remember. Sometimes I forget why a lot of people don't like Sci-Fi, then movies like this come along and I remember. This movie isn't for everybody, but if you like slow-moving deeply captivating science fiction that focuses on humans and their emotions you'll love this. I need more time with it though.Brad Pitt is great, I like how they casted someone older. The cinematography was stunning but I think much of this movies poor reception from the general public comes down to the way it was marketed. It isn't a fast-moving science fiction action movie, it's a slow-moving movie about solitude and clinging onto things.Maybe this movie resonates with me so much because Brad Pitt's character feels like me. Excelling as his craft and everything he does and yet still feeling so hopelessly alone all the f*cking time.I need to watch it again, but I'll leave it at an 8 for now.",Ad Astra
199,saraccan,Must be a joke,4,11 May 2020,This movie manages to make a mockery of many aspects of science and film making in multiple layers. I don't have an interest in making a list of all the things they did wrong because there are more than a few. It is also extremely boring and uneventful. I would highly not recommend it.An astronaut is on a mission to stop his father from destroying the universe.,Ad Astra
200,DuskShadow,Classic Sci Fi in the black and white era had more Heart and Gumption,5,8 June 2020,"Yes, that is a word. But clearly many would not recognize it because it hardly exists any more in the modern age.
The film had potential, yet from the get go I felt a wincing hesitation due to the stinkers that came along in the last f years like Gravity and most of the other "" big budget"" crap shoots that hollywood has near ruined the genre with.
And this was almost as bad. It had some heart only due to Tommy Lee Jones being a great actor, despite Brad Pitt being the mostm onotone I have seen him since he played an insipid vampire or that nutjob persona in Fightclub. And those were good movies. There was just too many red flags that somebody, even a lame brained military dog should have recognized as dangerous hostility or danger imminent. YET WE GOT NOTHING FROM THE LEAD CHARACTER! Maybe that was intentional to further the weak plot, after all this took place in the not too distant future. SO lets say its 40-60 years hence. And we are still using crappy rockets with fuselage size fuel components still being jettisoned from high orbit like its still the 1960s. There is obviously more advanced tech than this, and though everything is run by an overreaching military industrial complex supported by billionaires, because honestly everything was foretold by REAL sci fi that has and will continue to happen, I just cannot understand why this film had so much low tech non spectacles in it. Maybe because it was low budget, or something had to give to pay the actors.
I really couldnt say. The main concerns in the story were unanswered in the most tedious ways, choices were abysmal all over that could have been better delivered and though I did enjoy some sights and some of the acting here and there, it really did not impress or inspire me to even rewatch.
I felt it, and at my age, I can tell a stinker from a mile away in film, television, gaming, or in people. I guess some would call that wisdom. I just call it experience. Any number of pre 2010 sci fi films was better than everything from this to gravity to star wars that have ruined the genre in the last 10 years. R.I.P. entertainment 1950s-2010. *smfh *",Ad Astra
201,evening1,Why does a mega-star do a movie like this?,3,10 July 2021,"One thing I got out of viewing about 15 minutes of this is that Brad Pitt is a damn good-looking guy. Yeah, there wasn't much new here.Nor was it surprising to observe that Man had transplanted his warring ways to the ""The Moon,"" battling, albeit primitively, via shootouts in a chalky terrain.I found the opening premise here to be fairly interesting. Pitt's dad, played by Tommy Lee Jones, was the most decorated-ever astronaut in the space force, yet he somehow disappeared or went rogue out near Neptune, and it's Brad's job to find out what happened.But when a gorilla-type monstrosity attacks on an eerily abandoned ship, I lost interest in this stinker.

director: James Gray
starring: Brad Pitt,Tommy Lee Jones,Liv tyler,Ruth Negga,Donald sutherland
overall rating 97/100Ad astra is based on astronaut Roy Mcbride ( Brad Pitt) who gets sent to neptune in order to stop the destruction of the earth. But when this mission also turns into a rescue mission to find his dad ( Tommy lee Jones) Things take a shocking turn. Wow Ad astra was truly excellent and in my opinion a real cinematic masterpiece. Yes it might not be an average audience goers cup of tea but as a film student i could appreciate this films artistry,acting and visual elements. Lets talk about this more.First of all the films aesthetics and visuals were absolutely stunning to look at. Wow this film was truly incredible to look at. It was the most visually thriller and detailed space film i have seen. Usually slow pacing is a down for me in most films i watch. But for in Ad astra it made the film better as it allowed more time for each beautiful scene to stick in your mind the CGI to make it look so realistic was truly incredible to see.Next the film had a very good dramatic tone. The film had every little thing going wrong. It had me on the edge of my seat for most of the film. As they composed the scenes in a way where you really feared for Roys life. In particular when he snuck onto the rocket there was multiple occasions were he either couldn't get into the rocket or had to fight off his supposed work colleagues. So the film new exactly what tone to go for and they stayed consistent with it throughout the whole film.Next there was enough action scenes to keep you entertained. This film didn't need to much action as it was the required tone or genre for this type of film. But when they did have some action sequences they really left an impact. The gore and the use of the monkey was a surprising change to the film and i welcomed it. So the film had a good enough balance of entertainment and incredible cinematography.Next the acting was incredible. One of my key standouts was Ruth Negga. She did an excellent job with what little screentime she had. Her words largely thanks to a very strong script really left an impact on me as an audience member. And she felt like the motivation that Roy needed to try and find his dad and complete his mission when he felt like turning back. But the main star of the film was Brad Pritt. He was absolutely incredible in Ad astra and in my opinion is worth a awards contendership. His performance was so believable and powerful. And brad really took us through the journey of Roys character and his mental health. Sometimes he didn't even need to speak you could tell how he was feeling just by his facial expression.Next the film had an interesting plot and an excellently executed plot twist. I thought the whole reasoning for Roys character trying to find his dad and not feeling connected to him was an interesting plot point. And the whole reasoning for the electric surge storms was a really interesting part of the plot as well as for most of the film you didn't know what was the cause of this. And the realisation in the film that Roys dad. was a bad man and murdered all of his crew members was really well executed. You could tell the shock on Brad Pitts face when his father said he never even loved him so this was excellent.Now before my final two big positives i do just have to say my one little nitpick of the film. I thought a lot of the characters were underused and the film was to focused on Brad pitts character as a whole. Ruth neggas and Donald Sutherlands character had great moments but could of had better character arcs and served more of a purpose in the film but this is my only negative comment about the film.Now time for my final two positives. The powerful themes and messages. And the excellent use of voiceover. First of all Brad pitts voiceover was fantastic. It really was helped with the excellent script. His voiceover really helped us to understand how Roys mental health was and really helped me understand how his character was feeling. And next the film had excellent themes. Of never taking your relationships for granted with Roy being so distant and sacrificing his work for a relationship. And then the power of reconnecting with loved ones with his father and celebrating each other differences.Despite one nitpick. Ad astra is a cinematic masterpiece. And despite understanding that it wont be everyones cup of tea it had excellent cinematography and acting with an impactful script and themes.",Ad Astra

I saw reviews that acted as if it was everywhere and all over the board as far as science but once again, if your looking for a science movie, try NASA's documentaries. They're actually pretty good.

205,gavinp9,Very well-made space journey.,8,29 September 2019,"'Ad Astra' is another very solid entry into the semi-realistic space films of the past few years - 'The Wandering Earth', 'Interstellar', 'Gravity' - and is conveniently set in the ""near future"", meaning some of the potentially questionable physics can be explained away. Major Roy McBride (Pitt) follows in his father's - Clifford McBride (Jones) - astronaut footsteps. Clifford's either dead or stranded around Neptune, so Roy sets off to rescue/recover him.Firstly, it's amazing that Jones is only 17 years older than Pitt - he looks about 30 years older! Good to see him again, but he has very little screen time - as does Eve (Tyler), Helen (Negga) & Pruitt (Sutherland). Basically, this is Pitt's journey and most of the film is him on his mission from Earth -> Moon -> Mars - > Neptune. Thankfully, Pitt brings a great earnestness and honesty to the role and is easily watchable.As well as being visually spectacular, with all the planets (including Earth and the Moon) and the spaceships looking excellent, the score's good and the colour motifs are superb, especially on Mars and around Neptune. It's also great to see a futuristic Moon, with a few winks to 'Total Recall'. The father/son relationship is pivotal and well-handled - it never gets too overbearing, but is still logical. The isolation of space is very well depicted.",Ad Astra

It is a feast for the soul, with it's galaxy hopping narrative, powered by an excellent performance by Pitt.This is a gutsy mix of a big budget storyline, which is sometimes mixed with an arthouse narrative.The action scenes set on different future outposts of humanity are brilliantly choreographed and make up for some edge of the seat moments. The length could have been pruned somewhat.Recommended.",Ad Astra

Introspective, human, perphaps moving. All the reviews criticizing it because of alleged factual inaccuracies are way off-target: this story is something like an ancient myth, and both the tone and the plot follow accordingly. Couple the overall good movie with an outstanding photography, and you have a couple of nice hours. Outstanding photography: it's like a summary of Gravity, Interstellar and First Man.",Ad Astra
208,pkpera,Brad Astra,1,4 December 2019,"I could give some other headline to this review:Like: Adventure, Drama, MiseryHow to spend 80 millions in stupidest wayIs Sci-Fi dead now ?
Massive failure in all important aspects: poor direction, miscast of main hero's actor. Yes, Brad Pitt is now not suitable to play some role of high intelligence requiring profession. Well, maybe they wanted someone who looks troubled, to play man from troubled family, but his troubles are different kind. And I was very nice how said it.
Worst part is of course story self, the script. It is just stoopid - yes now I'm not nice, but when something is so bad, well, must think about millions of young people watching this. What authors wanted at all ? Money for sure. To say that space exploring is waste of time and effort, that main danger in it is that you may become crazy, harmful, dangerous ... What is wrong with Hollywood this years ? Really, I did not see really good Sci-Fi over years. In compare with this Interstellar looks as some great masterpiece, and yes, it is directed very well, but whole idea and some parts of story are very questionable.
Some reviews here say that visual effects very great. I don't think so. Especially considering budget. Below average. And space ship designs were extremely poor, unimaginative, space travel physics was totally unrealistic. Even worse where interiors. I have feeling that all involved made it as fast as possible, and no one took care about quality. Especially producers (one of is Brad self), director.
I was about to stop watching after about half hour, but was nothing better to watch, so continued, and was interested only for father-son meeting. What happened at the end, and was total .... ahh, again must say: stoopid.
I did not expect much from Brad Pitt in last years, but expected more from Tommy Lee Jones. He was mostly in very good movies. OK, he is very old now, so I forgive him. And same for Donald Sutherland. Surely, there was some hype about this project, that's why they took roles, I guess.
And what was the message ? Be with your family, beloved ones. Sure, we need to travel (in stupid, unrealistic, explosive way) to end of Solar system and back to realize that. Final scene with Liv Tyler approaching was something what 10 years old could direct better. But was best one in whole movie - it was last :-)Script: some big negative number hereIdea: see aboveDirection: 1Brad Pitt: 2 for acting, 1 for producingWell, at least he took some effort, indeedVisual effects: 2Music: 1Sound overall: 1Gore: 4Yeah, I added new category, gore here, because we got it too in this creation.

210,movieman6-413-929510,Beautiful but slow space journey,6,21 September 2019,"Ad Astra is een nieuwe sci-fi avonturen film geregisseerd en deels geschreven en geproduceerd door James Gray, de regisseur van The Lost City of Z en We Own the Night.De film speelt zich af in de nabije toekomst waar de mensheid zich heeft gevestigd op andere planeten uit ons zonnestelsel. Astronaut Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) wordt gevraagd om naar Mars te komen om een persoonlijke boodschap in te spreken om naar Neptunus te verzenden. Roy zijn vader H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) is namelijk vermist geraakt samen met de rest van zijn onderzoeksteam op Neptunus. Zijn vader was bezig met een missie om intelligent buitenaards leven te ontdekken.
Als Roy leert waar zijn vader mee bezig was en heeft ontdekt, probeert hij ook op Neptunus te komen. Sommige mensen hebben liever niet dat de ontdekte informatie verder met de mensheid wordt gedeeld. Hierom proberen ze ervoor te zorgen dat Roy niet op Neptunus kan komen, maar Roy wil kosten wat kost zijn vaders ontdekte informatie verder bestuderen om het uiteindelijk toch met de mensheid te kunnen delen.Deze film ziet er mooi uit de reizen van planeet naar planeet hebben ze mooi in beeld gebracht. De film speelt leuk en realistisch in op de toekomstige ideeën van de mensheid voor ruimtereizen. Ondanks de mooie beelden heeft de reis die Brad Pitt zijn personage aflegt wel een sloom tempo, waardoor de film wat langdradig overkomt.Brad Pitt zijn personage komt ook wat teruggetrokken over in deze film. Zo lijkt hij wat emotieloos. Dit komt wel vaker voor bij personages in ruimere films, want Ryan Gosling kwam ook zo over als Neil Armstrong in de film First Man. Toch heeft Brad Pitt wel een paar scenes waarin hij zijn emoties toont. Zo laat Brad Pitt zien wat voor een goede acteur hij is. Hij heeft namelijk weinig tekst en emotie in deze film, maar toch weet hij de film te dragen en interessant te houden. Met Voice-Over tijdens zijn scenes weet je wat er ongeveer door het hoofd gaat van zijn personage.
Tommy Lee Jones heeft maar een paar scenes in deze film waarvan vele herhaaldelijke videobeelden zijn van zijn onderzoek.Het uiteindelijke bericht van de film over de mensheid op het eind van de film valt wel wat tegen, omdat het bericht wat te onduidelijk naar voren is gebracht in de film.",Ad Astra
211,EvanKevelson,What I learned,3,8 January 2021,"Ok.....I gave this three stars simply for the effects and Brad was good enough to prevent me from not shutting it off.
What I learnt is that Metascore and Rotten Tomatoes are as incompetent in determining the quality of a movie as the academy awards.
Anything that could have been elaborated on to make this interesting were intermittent bursts of action with no background. The primary being this undying loyalty to Spacecom like an Orwellian nightmare.
The Martian was Castaway in space where he grows something on Mars...ridiculous..
I have yet seen Interstellar or First man to comment if they are just as lame as This box office bomb or the Martian.

212,christian94,Cinematography and Philosophy,7,27 September 2019,"Hoyte Van Hoytema delivers a thrilling sci-fi cinematography that rivals his own visuals in Interstellar (2014) but unfortunately without the character development of the Nolans. Emmanuel Lubezki's Gravity (2013), Dariusz Wolski's The Martian (2015) and Rodrigo Prieto's Passengers (2016) offered more visual feasts and tension, yet Ad Astra has two memorable scenes: the opening sequence and the hectic chase on the moon.Brad Pit is competent in a conflicted lead, but as with his previous effort The Lost City of Z (2016) writer/director James Gray reaches for the stars but falls slighty short. There is a lot of good stuff in Ad Astra, yet the characters of the love interest and the dad fall way short. The rest feels like forced excuses for less impressive action scenes later in the movie and a conclusion that is too easy and underwhelming. Apart from the action and the philosophical implications that are a big part of the constant musing and slow pacing, the movie is supposed to evoke with quiet contemplation, something crucial is missing in authenticity. We don't quite care for the characters or the story by the end. Ad Astra is almost but not quite the gem other critics talk about.",Ad Astra

215,williampsamuel,A Fascinating Journey to the Center of the Mind,8,16 April 2020,"If you're looking just for another fun sci-fi adventure movie, you might want to look elsewhere, because Ad Astra isn't it. It's something so much richer and deeper on an intensely personal level, like First Man meets Kubrick's 2001. There are certainly thrills and action, but it's the inner drama that truly drives the affair and makes it compelling.If you've seen the trailers then you know that Brad Pitt stars as astronaut Roy McBride, on a secret mission discover the fate of his father's long-lost expedition, at great danger to himself. I can't say much more without spoilers, except that there's much more going on than he realizes, and not everyone is what they seem. At times the film is almost dystopian, with its references to wars back on earth, the almost menacing secrecy of Roy's superiors, and the frequent ""psychological evaluations"" that seem like something out of Equilibrium or Blade Runner. Though later we find out that maybe there's a very good reason for them.Ad Astra is of course deeply psychological and emotional, in the best way possible. We get frequent glimpses inside Roy's mind and are kept intimately in touch with his increasingly conflicted emotional state, especially as it relates to his semi-legendary, long absent father. Perhaps as important as his completion of the mission are his emotional development and his struggles to stay sane in the vast solitude of space. Perhaps I'm giving a bit away here, but it really is inspiring to see Roy open up, and step out of his father's shadow to become his own man. All of this may be driven home a little too hard, but never to the point of becoming sappy or mopey.This is in large part due to Pitt's excellent performance. His acting is incredibly restrained in comparison to his usual work. It's kind of amazing how a performance so purposely emotionless can be so engaging. But the subtle nuances make it work, while his gradually increasing displays of emotion (and serious ups and downs) keep us engaged. It really is a masterpiece of minimalism. Tommy Lee Jones also leaves a strong impression as Roy's father, H. Clifford McBride, who we see mainly in snippets of flashbacks and old recordings.Ad Astra is a gorgeous movie, in terms of cinematography, editing, and special effects. The long panoramas of outer space and the scenes of the lunar surface easily on par with 2001 or Interstellar, while the frantic zero gravity sequences are the best since, well, Gravity. Between the seeming weightlessness of the actors and the objects around them, the utter absence of background noise, and the stark lighting contrast, every frame of the EVA and lunar sequences looks like they were shot in outer space.This movie also has some very good action and really knows how to generate suspense. The moon buggy sequence ranks up there with some of Hollywood's best, tensest car chases, and the distress signal scene is deeply unnerving and kind of terrifying. Other parts, like a certain launch sequences, are nail biting, down to the last second affairs. Then there are some action scenes that would sound utterly ridiculous if I were to describe them here, but which absolutely work.All in all, Ad Astra is many things. A suspenseful, if occasionally slow, deep space sci-fi thriller. A technical triumph and visual tour de force. A nuanced character study, buoyed by one of Pitt's best performances.

219,jeremy3,A chilled pace movie like 2001 was,7,24 August 2021,"This movie is very slow and thoughtful. Roy seeks his father Clifford 2.7 Billion miles away at Neptune to find out why static electric outbursts are threatening Earth. The movie takes place circa 2049. For anyone who says the movie is unrealistic, The Moon is 1/360th the way to Mars from Earth, and Mars is 1/30th of the way from Earth to Neptune. All sci fi movies are unrealistic, because humans have not even made it past the Moon yet. The movie mocks the present and future. The Moon is now inhabitated, but wars have migrated there like on Earth. When Roy gets to Jupiter he is suddenly barred from going to Neptune by NASA. He ends up calling them and speaking with a voice response unit. Hilarious. The main point is that space is beautiful, but also very lonely and isolating. In the end, Roy meets his dad, Clifford, but Clifford has gone crazy from being alone and isolated for thirty years. The only downside may be my lack of understanding. I still did not get why these static outbursts were threatening Earth. It seems like Clifford's crew had created them, and Clifford had to destroy their mutiny over this. But, I never got why and how it happened. Maybe this is irrelevant. The movie was about the distant relationship of father and son, and space was a metaphor for their isolationism and inability to be close to other people for very long.",Ad Astra

Unfortunately, the movie has useless or bad-written character or minor roles that contrast too much with the performances of Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones, who both did decent performance. As I said the way that minor roles are written pull down the movie and the scenario, in this rare case for a Blockbuster the problem isn't the visual effects, but the scenario itself is bad-written. But don't confuse the story and the screenplay, it is very different. A story is only the basic of the movie (The Intro, The Mission, The End).

The movie starts hitting nails in its coffin from the very beginning: the hint on something much more in the premise department died out almost instantly and I was left watching this ""near future"" for the next two hours. The plot centers around one person who alienated himself from the world, from his close ones, from the things that hurt - nothing original there. Then there's that world that needs to be saved again - nothing original there either. You get the point.

But there are those.............who don't believe that, and still do believe the father is the one causing all the pulses all over the world. Roy believes he is like his father who abandoned his family and Roy admits he, too, was distant with Eve (Liv Tyler) his wife, who we see leaving him in the beginning.We hear Roy narrate his thoughts throughout and this is good as we sense what he is going through without having to guess.On Mars he does transmit his message and isn't told if there was a reply or response, but he is now told he didn't pass his Psychological profile and must return to Earth and he will not be on the ship to Neptune. Ruth Negga as Helen Lantos, the Director of the Mars base, tells Roy what happened regarding a mutiny on Clifford's watch on Neptune and she knows what will happen when the next Rocket goes to Neptune. Roy knows he must be on that Ship to save his father as he NOW knows the truth.Surprised there was no memorable music to speak of. Sad. Cinematography is excellent.Notables: Donald Sutherland as Col Pruitt, who knew Roy's father and accompanies Roy only to the Moon and comes down with a medical emergency; John Ortiz as General Rivas.One could make the case for Brad Pitt for Best Actor Oscar as he is always excellent on the screen.

228,TheVictoriousV,A good film with a weirdly polarized reception,7,30 September 2019,"Ad Astra is the latest in a long line of Hollywood films where I am forced to make a comment about other people's comments, since that stuff is at least as interesting to talk about as the movie.The funniest one came from alt-journalist Tim Pool - who, I gather, is well-known for saying funny stuff but not on purpose. He claimed that the ""rotten"" Audience Score, compared to the 82% Critics Score, was proof of how out-of-touch and disingenuous critics are in order to keep their jobs and score political points. This is especially fascinating since Pool said in the very next tweet that he also thought the film was good, but that he wouldn't ""give it"" 82% - the most solid grasp of how the Rotten Tomatoes system actually works since the Suicide Squad drama.Whatever it is that appeals to the politics of ""ivory tower elitists"", I guess it is supposed to make mainstream critics ignore the fact that the film aspires to be two different sorts of film that do not quite match. Mainly, it wants to be Tarkovskian and cerebral; the rest has spurts of Hollywood action (albeit with some unique presentation choices), presumably for the sake of mass appeal. It seems everything else was too languid to salvage that Audience Score, then.I didn't get as much out of the film as the critics, but I won't contribute to its low Audience Score, ultimately. I am annoyed by the clichés it plays straight and the previously discussed needless action interludes, although I cannot discount the splendid leading performance from Brad Pitt or how the central space mission affects his character on multiple levels, including those of the human soul. In the movie, he plays astronaut Roy McBride, the son of the renowned Clifford McBride (Tommy Less Jones), whose mission to discover intelligent life ended mysteriously near Neptune.As the picture starts, it has been 30 years since Clifford disappeared, and so Roy vows to get to the bottom of the mystery; it is revealed that whatever took place back then, is only now starting to threaten the solar system. Although it is never as deeply unsettling as 2001, despite aping its deliberate pacing (and imagery, at times) when it doesn't shake things up with an action moment, there are chilling concepts at play, for sure.The supporting cast adds a lot as well, through the performances of such players as Ruth Negga, Liv Tyler, and Donald Sutherland, at last reuniting with Jones, a fellow Space Cowboy. The brilliant Max Richter (Waltz with Bashir; The Leftovers) provides the music, so of course that would be another point in the movie's favor. I cannot fault its visuals or space travel accuracy, either. I just get the sense that they added things like Brad Pitt's incessant voice-overs as an afterthought because, yet again, the masses won't want to see a film that would've otherwise been quite Tarkovskian, unless you add something that keeps their attention.This is not a popular assessment, but I would say High Life is the more effective science-fiction slow burn of the year, mainly due to how it was equal parts claustrophobic and cosmically intimidating. It failed to make sense in certain respects, but it succeeded at making me feel like I was trapped between the walls of a lost spaceship, and that something unfathomably unfathomable lurked in the dark beyond said walls.Ad Astra is good enough, though. The spiritual sorts may enjoy it even more than I did, but everyone can appreciate visuals and acting prowess of this magnitude, even those who insist on giving it a ""rotten"" score at the end of the day.",Ad Astra

If the viewer does not invest into the Brad Pitt character's dilemmas, one wont get a lot out of this.Overall the images are awesome and beautiful, the sound and music is divine and there are many opportunities to gaze at the beauty because of the long shots.
There are a few moments of action, but it's slow in general.One premise that was absolutely ridiculous was the characters, and by implication the worlds scientific community, arriving at the conclusion that humans are the only intelligent life in the 'entire universe' by only observing some outer planet moons.

232,carlos37andre,What if we are all we've got?,8,15 November 2020,"I'm gonna be sort here, I like the movie, the score is so minimalist, and quiet, fitting the mood of the whole thing so well, and building such a somber atmosphere, and I loved it. The cinematography is gorgeous, you feel like you are watching people and space, which is great, since most of the film is in space. I liked the mystery of the whole Lima Project, and I particularly love the answer of... the dude just went insane, of the thought they came all this way to find nothing at all.And that's a scary thought, as humans, if you really think about it. This has been such a question for centuries and centuries, and the most likely scenario is that none of us will live to see it answered, so in a weird way you can kind of relate to his father's faith, and understand what did happened there. That was probably my favorite thing in the whole movie. I love when a movie makes me think of something, I hadn't thought about it before, or often, that's always a positive.Anyways, Brad Pitt is just amazing here, he carries the whole movie by himself, it's truly at its core a character piece, exploring the relationship of his character and his father, while touching in some very human questions and themes. Sure, there are clearly some weird science in it (one of the main one been in the very beginning of the movie, when Brad Pitt's character apparently falls from orbit straight to earth wearing just... his space suit?), but I can overcome that, since I was so invested in the story, although moments like those, are probably what prevents the movie from having a higher grade, imo.I also love the world they've built here, all the colonies, and space exploration, it seems like a reality that could happen. Even tho, the science is pretty rough, as I already said, in other moments like the ending where he catapult's himself through the rings...? Like, ok, that's probably a bit of a strech lol.The chase scene at the moon is amazing tho, is such an awesome sequence, incredible cinematography, and, once again, world buiding.To sum up, Ad Astra is a great film, is far from been a space adventure, and is more of a character piece, a very reflective movie, into the sci-fi genre, and in all honesty, as a sci-fi fan, I couldn't be happier when I see a different approach to this theme I love so much.",Ad Astra
233,quaseprovisorio,people mix this with a sci fi movie. space is just the expansion of his own mind. this is a man going to the deep side of himself.,8,21 June 2020,"Ad astra doesn't classify exactly as a sci fi film. yes it is filmed in space, yes it has spaceships and yes it has other planets. but this is one of the few cases where the inner monologue is as deep as the space itself: we quickly realize the deep space is just a metaphor for a lonely and scary man to come to terms wth his father and his life. in a way not that different between if his father had disappeared or died on earth and he never had recovered from it. or even if they lived three kilometers away from each other but wouldn't talk for ages. and now he needs to get inner strength in order to visit him or to go to the cemitery, or where he is at the moment.the space gives you a bigger portrait than this mainly because it's an escapism: it's how you run from your problems and don't need to think about anything else. it's your excuse to be alone while not giving a damn about your world and your life. and it seems to become addictive. you start getting addicted to the loneliness to the pain of not to talk, to the nothings you feel along the way. space is like a drug. or alcohol. or a fight club. or anything else you do to forget your feelings.i think the action in the movie is not that slow paced: we still have a bunch of places where he goes, very well made action sequences that i actually was a bit mesmerized about - the sense of the space as a looong deep and silenced place that can feel like home because...well you can't relate as much to people that never experienced it. for the ones at earth space is too far away to care. for the people at space it's probably the only place where it feels everything fits.this movie wants to touch that theory of austronaut psique and i think it succeeds at it. but it also want to touch to our inner demons, (and on his case a lot of daddy issues) our luggage under the bed we don't take away and the actions we must perform in order to put it out there. this isn't more than a travel inside a human brain materialized on a space trip. and at the end of the day movies should be in general an excuse to question the nature of human beings. this one does that. and technically is flawless, plus it has great sound effects.this is a film for an immersive experience where we can think about our own histories, and past. of what hurts us. brad pitt personifies this perfectly. he is the film. and throughout his eyes and mind and voice we go into the trip all together: after all, all of us have unfinished business to solve. being at space or inside ourselves. in this movie they seem to be pretty much the same thing.",Ad Astra

As you might've guessed, it's not exactly smooth sailing...From the trailer, this looks like your typical gotta-save-the-planet sci-fi adventure. And there's nothing wrong with that of course. But in reality this is an intimate character journey, combined with some really beautiful visuals. Just like in Mandy, you're kind of put into a trance, where you just let the picture-esque quality absorb you. This is a case where the cinematographer deserves just as much credit as the director.The cast is very strong, with great performances from veteran actors auch as Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones as well as Ruth Negga. But who the movie truly belongs to is Brad Pitt. It's extraordinary how you can go from the carefree Cliff Booth to the reserved and hurting Roy in the same year. The change from a distant to a much more personally involved and wounded person is portrayed in a very realistic manner. Roy finds he's got his own personal demons to deal with. His father always cared more about his work than establishing a meaningful relationship with his son. And Roy starts to realize he's becoming the same as him. He neglected his wife in favor of the mission, and is prepared to die without ever really living.The confrontation between Roy and his dad is underwhelming on a scientific level. Clifford found nothing, didn't even come even close to what he was looking for. But that's exactly the point: sometimes we reach too far to find answers that might not be there. Roy tries to talk his dad into returning to earth with him, but Cliff isn't looking to be rescued. For him life on earth is practically meaningless at this point. How could he live with the shame of spending all this time searching for extraterrestial life and wind up with nothing? Roy's pain over losing his father is very emotionally captivating. He never got the reconciliation he wanted. But he learns an important lesson: always put personal happiness before everything else, or else you end up confused and lost.There are a few things that drag it down for me though. For instance, the dialogue can be a little on-the-nose at times, with Pitt pointing out things that are already obvious to the audience. It's also left vague how Roy actually fixed the electrical circuit problem. I know it's not the *main* focus in the end, but still would've liked to see how he solved it.
The fight scene between Brad Pitt and the alien was intense and well-orchestrated, though I'm not sure about the decision to make it look like an ape. Why would there be aliens on Mars that look like gorillas? Or did someone bring their pet onboard. I don't know, just struck me as odd.If vast space landscapes coupled with character introspection sounds good to you, I highly recommend Ad Astra.",Ad Astra
237,harrylosborne,A staring contest with Brad Pitt,4,26 March 2020,"Ad Astra makes no sense. I am talking moon-pirates, space-monkeys, nuclear-bombs-propelling-spaceships levels of nonsense, between which we get tedious monologues delivered by the equally tedious Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) as he stares out of windows.Initially I was quite taken: a different approach to space travel (where humans haven't perfected the finer details), alongside a galactic conspiracy that McBride's father (played by Tommy Lee Jones) is at the heart of. This unravels quickly into a preposterous space mission that is trying so hard to have the nuance and excitement of Interstellar, but without any quality whatsoever. I haven't the energy nor the time to look at the scientific inaccuracy of what's on show here, but to give you an idea, Pitt's character enters a spaceship through the rocket thruster - as it is about to launch. Yeah.It's a pretty film (what space films aren't), but it doesn't really do much with the scope of space. You get no concept of vastness when flights require a stop-over at the Moon when they fly to Mars, but can then reach Neptune in a couple of days. Spacecraft interiors look flashy and well-designed, but that isn't what you're watching for. The lighting is decent and the differentiating between planets and their environments is reflected in the colours on show, but again, its little in the way of compensating.Finally, I can get onto the acting. So Pitt's character starts the film by being described as someone who's heart rate has never exceeded 80BPM. So you think ok, he's a bit of a weapon, doesn't get fazed at all - and then he becomes an emotional rollercoaster for the rest of the film. Other notable characters are: absolutely nobody because this film revolves around Brad Pitt only. I think Pitt may have taken this role because he thought there was an emerging niche for space dramas again and he wanted to take advantage, but this is as big a misfire as you could get.It just makes no creative sense from whomever wrote Ad Astra; did they want a subtle film about emotion, or did they want an action film that uses space as a new medium? It's so jumbled that you have no empathy for any of the main players, no tension in the drama and no investment in what the plot is trying to accomplish. I fell asleep during the final act of this film, but I wouldn't be surprised if you turned it off long before then.",Ad Astra

So the people in charge send his son Roy McBride, another genius astronaut to find out what happened out there. On the way to set up a long distance call to his dad from Mars, Roy fights space pirates on the moon, starved baboons on a abandoned research facility, even secretly stows away aboard a spaceship to commander it to go save daddy!!

239,Bertaut,"Despite some utterly absurd diversions (chase scene! horror scene! shoot-out scene!), this is a decent science-fiction narrative",7,8 October 2019,"A short while ago, the mesmerising Aniara (2018) pondered the insignificance of mankind when considered against the infinity of space and time. An esoteric science-fiction film in the tradition of 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solyaris (1972), it attempted to convey the universe's near-inconceivable vastness and the psychological ramifications of what it might feel like to be lost in such a vastness. This is the lineage into which Ad Astra wishes to step, but for me, it has more in common with the excellent Sunshine (2007) and the flawed but entertaining Interstellar (2014) - irrespective of its themes and tropes, it remains a mainstream Hollywood movie, wherein the demand for crowd-pleasing content often clashes with the desire for esotericism. In the case of Sunshine, this clash took the form of a genre shift into horror that Boyle doesn't fully pull off, and in the case of Interstellar, it's a predictable and unnecessary third-act twist. And so we have Ad Astra, where it's in the form of an overly convenient resolution and some of the most ludicrous narrative diversions I've seen since the abomination that was Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi (2017), diversions which seem to belong in a different film entirely, so tonally unrelated are they to everything else (space pirates! enraged simians! knife-fight/shoot-out!). Which is not to say that I disliked the film - I didn't; even if the narrative never manages to get beyond the ""Heart of Darkness in space"" template and the script relies far, far too heavily on a sub-Terrence Malick voiceover. The craft on display is exceptional and the story is thought-provoking and generally entertaining, with a terrific central performance, and some spectacular visuals (especially in the IMAX format). But it could have been so much better.Set at an unspecified point in the near future, space travel has become routine, with the moon not unlike any major city on Earth. As the film begins, a series of energy surges originating near Neptune leave much of Earth and the moon without power. 29 years previously, H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), left Earth as the leader of the Lima Project, a mission aimed at establishing contact with alien civilisations. Travelling to the same region near Neptune from which the surges are now emanating, 16 years into the mission, all contact was lost. SpaceCom presumed the crew dead, but now they fear that Clifford may be behind the surges, and with an antimatter power core at his disposal, if he has become unhinged, he could create a chain reaction that would eradicate all life in the solar system (it's best not to dwell too much on the script's fundamental misrepresentation of how matter and antimatter interact). And so Maj. Roy McBride (Brad Pitt), Clifford's son, is tasked with travelling to a secure long-range communications base on Mars and recording a message for Clifford in the hopes he might respond. Of course, it's no spoiler to say that the mission doesn't exactly go smoothly.Written by James Gray and Ethan Gross, and directed by Gray, Ad Astra wastes no time in tying us rigidly to Roy's perspective; it opens with a POV shot from inside his helmet, and the first words we hear are him speaking in voiceover. This sets up the narrative to come, as Roy remains the sole focaliser throughout - we learn things as he learns then and we never experience anything with which he is not directly involved. The fact that the film is set amongst the stars, but remains always tied to Roy's perceptions allows Gray to fashion a narrative that's both massive in scope yet emotionally intimate. He's aided immensely in this by cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, whose gorgeous 35mm celluloid photography effortlessly captures the overwhelming scale of the milieu, but also frequently frames Pitt in tight close-ups.Depending on your perspective, Pitt's portrayal of Roy is either one of the film's most laudable aspects or one of its most alienating. Initially played as emotionally closed off (he tells us in VO, ""I've been trained to compartmentalise my emotions""), he's depicted as cold and distant. This stoicism, however, slowly starts to erode as his mission begins to go wrong, although there are a few early hints that all is not well - for example, his fixation on the breakup of his marriage to Eve (a thankless and largely wordless performance by a blink-and-you-miss-her Liv Tyler), or his observation of the crew of the Cepheus (which takes him from the moon to Mars), ""they seem at ease with themselves. What must that be like?"". His performance is such that one viewer might praise it for shunning emotional grandstanding even as another might criticise it as too taciturn. Personally, I think it's a terrifically modulated and minimalist performance in which he uses the lack of outward emotion to inform the character's emotional beats, relying on subtlety and nuanced gesture.Thematically, on the most basic of levels, Ad Astra is the story of two men obsessed with their profession to the detriment of all else, a theme not unusual in Gray's filmography, receiving its most thorough exploration in Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) and Henry Costin (Robert Pattinson) in Gray's masterpiece, The Lost City of Z (2016). Like most of Gray's films, Ad Astra is heavily androcentric, as are its most obvious narrative influences - Heart of Darkness (1899) and Apocalypse Now (1979). In the reformulation of the narrative template, Roy is Charles Marlow (Benjamin Willard in the film), whilst Clifford is Kurtz, with the parallels obvious enough - a conflicted man sent to find a brilliant and pioneering man who has gone off-grid and who must be stopped, with the journey proving to be as much about travelling into the self as reaching a specific geographical destination.An especially interesting theme is commercialism, which is introduced when Roy takes a Virgin America shuttle to the moon, whilst an exterior shot of a lunar base shows signs for, amongst others, Applebee's, DHL, and Subway. And since the moon is now so like Earth, it has become blighted by many of the same issues as Earth; crime, political division, materialism. Indeed, in VO, Roy laments how sickened Clifford would be with what the moon has become, pointing out it's simply a ""re-creation of what we're running from on Earth"".However, for all these positives, there are some significant problems. Firstly, there are three utterly ridiculous pseudo-action scenes (a chase, a horror scene, and a knife-fight/shoot-out) which seem to have come from another movie entirely. Imagine if in 2001, instead of attempting to outwit HAL, David Bowman (Keir Dullea) had pulled out a shotgun and engaged in a running battle with androids controlled by the AI. Ridiculous? Of course. The three scenes in Ad Astra are only slightly less so. The third at least is the springboard for the second half of the movie, but it's still a monumentally silly way for Gray and Gross to advance the plot. The first two scenes, however, serve no such purpose - remove them from the film, and you'd have to change virtually nothing in the surrounding material - they're that disconnected and irrelevant. They lead nowhere, reveal nothing about the character or his psychology, and have no connection to the esoteric themes found elsewhere.Another problem is the overly neat and anti-climatic finale. I'm led to believe this ending was a reshoot after test audiences responded poorly to the original (and far superior) ending - look it up online; the originally scripted ending made a lot more sense and was as thematically fascinating as it was existentially audacious.The other big problem is the VO. I can count on one hand the number of times VO has been done well in film - there's the hard-boiled noir films of the 40s and 50s, the narration of Apocalypse Now, the work of Terrence Malick, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)...and, well, that's about it really. The VO is obviously intended to function in much the same way as Willard's in Apocalypse Now, providing some factual info, but also probing the soul of the character. However, the problem is that most of the time, the voice is describing something we can see plain as day on the screen. Pitt's performance is strong enough that the VO is unnecessary. You know the way the best films show rather than tell and the worst tell rather than show? Ad Astra does both, and it's hugely distracting. By the half-way stage, I was sick of Roy's cod-philosophical ramblings that aspire to portentousness, but end up coming across as someone trying and failing to imitate Malick.With all that said, however, it's a testament to the story the film tells that despite these hurdles, I still enjoyed it. Pitt's performance is excellent, and what the storyline says about man's place in the universe is unexpected and fascinating. The original ending was infinitely superior, the VO is a huge misstep, and the action detours are ludicrous, but this is still an entertaining movie. It's not a patch on Lost City of Z, but the manner in which Gray juxtaposes an intimate tone with such massive themes is really impressive. In essence, Ad Astra is a fable about the importance of transient human connection, played out against the backdrop of the infinite, and despite some not insignificant problems, it's well worth checking out.",Ad Astra
240,Michael Fargo,The answer is not in the stars,5,20 September 2019,"James Gray has made some wonderful films. This isn't one of them.Two things to watch out for in the ""near future"": The credibility of psychological tests and security on rockets headed to and from Mars.The main character asks a question while at the far reaches of the galaxy as he's bobbing around in space. It's a simple one. ""Why?"" I had a lot of why's to ask during this film. Given the screenplay, why chose interplanetary space travel and not, say, a nice beach resort for everyone to sort out their issues? It would has saved around $70 to $80 million in production costs.This is a beautiful film, glacially paced, with a near catatonic Brad Pitt being the only character around. He's often alone traveling millions of miles, delayed here and there, on a mission to confront his daddy. Father abandoned his son for his work, and might be the cause of power surges wreaking havoc on earth since their origin is the planet Neptune. Daddy was last heard from near or about the planet Neptune, so it's a good guess he might be the problem. Brad assumes he's been dead for a number of years, so the news he indeed could be alive barely registers a change in heart rate for Brad. We're very preoccupied with Brad's heart rate since you can't seem to do anything to raise it like getting chased by pirates, being asked to step into the pilot's seat of a commercial rocket where he's been a passenger, arm a nuclear device, or probably putting him in a room full of a barrel of monkey's. Is this is a metaphor or perhaps does Brad have issues? His wife, who's walking out the door as the film opens, has an opinion about that.The casting of this epic is odd. Occasionally, a familiar actor (Donald Sutherland, Ruth Negga, Liv Tyler, Nathasha Lyonne, Kimmy Shields) will appear for no apparent reason and then speak (since Brad rarely does) and disappear from the film never to be seen again. Casting unknowns could have saved another 5 or six million bucks.In particular, Tommy Lee Jones, who we very early on learn is the father who may or may not be causing all this trouble on Neptune, could have been played by anyone old enough to be in geriatric care. I don't think it's a spoiler to say--if you're waiting for some big reveal--it's not waiting out on Neptune...other than the realization that hard work and no play makes Brad a dull boy, but we caught onto that 10 minutes into the film. So whoever's Odyssey this is, if they'd skipped all the computer generated psychological profiles and taken a good self-inventory, the answer to the question ""Why?"" is really simple. We didn't need this overblown, over-hyped film to discover anything. Well, maybe that antimatter doesn't really matter...and should probably not by the choice of energy to replace the fossil fuel kind.",Ad Astra
241,celt007,Slow like a space walk,5,4 December 2019,"Pitt is good in lead roll but is brought down by the pace of the dialogue. Reminded me of Terence Malick movie ,with the slow speech and scenes. Another Malickian theme was the plodding of existential dread like watching paint dry and your mind wanders about in space .
Visually nothing great here , considering the director stated he wanted to create the most realistic space movie. We've seen this stuff before in 2001 Kubrick's masterpiece. Perhaps Malick borrowed pace and speech from Malick and Kubrick s cinematography ?",Ad Astra
242,Lewis_Heather787,"Almost brilliant, the ending is not what I expected!",8,21 September 2019,"I have mixed feelings after seeing this film because there is so much going for it, there are many positives that are really good. However there are a few things mainly towards the end of the film, just left me feeling a little let down......essentially there is no big reveal or revelation at the end. The film just slow whimpers out.........very odd considering what had been built up before it.Now lets start with the positives because there are many of them. Firstly Brad Pitt, what a year this man has had, early this summer there was ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"" and now ""Ad Astra"". He has been round a long time now but doesn't show any signs of slowing down or losing his magic because he was quite simply brilliant in this film. Probably quite an understated role for Pitt because plays a Neil Armstrong sort of introvert that keeps himself to himself. He is definitely not this flashy hero.......he has his flaws that we can all connect to. I completely understand even the whisper of Oscar being bounded around for Pitt........yes he is that good. Another nice surprise was Tommy Lee Jones, you don't see him in main big scope films this days......a nice change of pace. Although I must say that he fits the role very well, his few scenes with Pitt are very good, showing the emotional side to the film that comes to fruition at the end.Other positives the cinematography from Hoyte van Hoytema is simply outstanding this man definitely has a skill, showing us some incredible jaw-dropping scenes. From start to finish simply amazing.........although I must say I'm not fully surprised considering his work on ""Interstellar"". The score by Max Richter is simply mesmerising and crucially it is not overused it just comes in now and then. Definitely leaves an imprint on you after leaving the cinema. Lastly and not least the special effects in the film are spectacular.....just brilliant. Even though this is set in the near future it definitely feels like a world that has been lived in......has this believability to it.Now the few gripes I have with the film that stop it from becoming a great film are to do with the ending of the film......or should I say lack of a real ending. Now the entire film has followed Pitt's character being sent on a top secret mission to find his father, played by Tommy Lee Jones, who went missing for years in space and now has reappeared orbiting Neptune. So the main story line of the film is a father and son narrative, its their relationship or lack of a relationship that we are following through Pitt's characters perspective. So once they finally met at the end, there is a quick emotional heart to heart....Jones admitting that he couldn't find alien life, he is a failure. Pitt is there to take both them back to Earth.....unfortunately it is so on the nose that Jones is not going to go back to Earth. So when he more or less kills himself, it doesn't have much emotional punch at all. Pitt gets back in his spacecraft blows up the Lima project and goes back to Earth alone. Is it me or is the ending a bit lack lustre........no big reveal, no big twist........its like seeing a massive firework going off really quietly, I expected something else. Especially considering how impressive the rest of the film was before the last 20 minutes.Overall though I did really enjoy the film a lot even though it has its problems. 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, I didn't mind the little hints of space action that were thrown in here and there. I could completely understand if that put you off. For me the balance between the serious and cerebral to the fast paced action was just right....definitely needed both of them I think. I would definitely recommend going to the cinema to see this......the visuals deserve to be seen in their best glory.",Ad Astra

And no doubt should be an awards contender.Story wise, I think it has some interesting ideas about importance of family and duty and of all these things....but the film is so slow. The film is only a little over 2 hours and yet feels like it is 3 hours long. But my real big annoyance with the film comes with the voiceover. I'm more of a fan of the ""show dont tell"" method. I dont need Roy's (Brad Pitt) inner monologue telling me that a crew member is scared or that he's being used etc. It feels like you dont trust the audience enough to pick up on clues and instead have to forcefeed them information.The acting is fine. Not horrible, but most of the time of all the characters seem to play it very strait-laced. There isnt much personality that shines through these characters. If you want to watch a more impressive Brad Pitt role this year than watch Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.I give it a 6 mainly because from a technical standpoint it is wonderful.",Ad Astra

Yes, Yes...I can understand, it's about his father, being abandoned and this is his coping method...except--He's EMOTIONLESS.And so is everyone around him. So he moves thru the movie, stuff happens, people die around him...and he's utterly emotionless. Worse, Brad Pitt gives me the unchanging impression that he just 'damned tired' thru-out the entire movie.So the average viewer STOPS CARING.The Visuals are pretty good. The special effects are studied and consistent in giving me the same visual experience I remember when I first saw 2001 in the theatre all those years ago...and in many ways, Brad Pitt's character is very similar in temperament to David Bowman aboard the Discovery. And when I think about it-- that character was pretty emotionless, too.But 2001 was the First of its kind all those years ago. And the STAR of the Movie was really HAL, Starry Vistas and the other the Special Effects of that time.But 2001 was already Done. Ad Astra struck me as a thematic homage to that movie-- except nowadays, there needs to be some EMOTION...somewhere... for the current day viewers to side with and follow. Roy McBride needed to play his stoney stoic-ness off of someone else, side-kick, a fellow traveller, ANYONE...otherwise-- what's the point of watching?Overall, compared to the Vision of an amazing Future that glowed from 2001, Ad Astra left me with the sense of a dry, colorless milieu where no-one really cared enough about anything even to smile.The Scriptwriters could have done much better...",Ad Astra

249,TuesdayThe17th,Excellent Brad Pitt vehicle,10,8 March 2020,"This is a very good movie and actually it hit just the right spots for me. This is the type of film that can suck you in and not spit you out until the credits. The problem is, however, it is poorly paced and at times it drags big time. The mystery of the film runs deep through out, captivating the viewer, piquing out interest to see what comes next. We too, along with Roy McBride, are invested and want to nake it to the end of his journey. There are some very eerie notes to this film which to me was perfect and it sent uncomfortable chills down my spine as Roy grew closer to his ever mysterious destination. The movie has some really good action scenes including some very tense moments, but they are few and far between. This doesn't hurt the movie, though, as this films reveals itself as much more of a psychological story of personal measures and self discovery. This is a bleak, sad, and at times downright depressing watch but once the credits roll it feels fulfilling. Its something we haven't quite seen before and it is fresh in its delivery. This is an excellent vehicle for Brad Pitt as this may be one of his last roles where he plays a youngish character. 8 out of 10 stars, go watch it and feel",Ad Astra
250,peeedeee-94281,"Laughably bad, but you won't be laughing, most likely asleep",1,25 September 2019,"This movie starts off on the wrong foot, with Brad Pitt's character McBride falls from a tower that apparently extends from the ground into outer space (you only learn that as he's falling and the tower is still there). He falls through the atmosphere and lives to open a parachute (what astronaut would pack a parachute?) and survive. I mean, how stupid is that?
It's all down hill from there. Long drawn out, dull dialogue. A story line that seems like it was ripped out from a page of Apocalypse Now/Heart of Darkness, but with the execution of Roger Corman. Characters coming into the movie, seemingly significant, but really saying nothing you didn't already know or suspect.
The director decided to liven up the dullness with a few random action scenes that made absolutely no sense. Pirates on the moon? huh? Not many places to hide, they could have easily been destroyed by a military force. And evil monkeys that took over a Norwegian space station, another random event. Oh, lets put duct tape over a broken helmet and make things all better.
Then the terrible interaction between father and son, father saying he doesn't care, or never cared about his son, yet he communicated only when his son sent that message from Mars? He never sent any message to earth warning about the damaged antimatter generator, so earth believed he was trying to damage the Earth, 30 years later?
Then you have the hilarious flying in space in only a suit, using a flimsy piece of metal to shield from an asteroid belt, to go from one space station to his ship with just the power of a spinning antenna, aiming it perfectly, over a distance of probably further than that between the earth and moon. And to top it off, he uses the nuclear blast to propel his ship all way from the outer solar system back to earth, another junk science moment. When did they design ships for nuclear blasts? And how would that get him back all the way to earth?
Okay, at this point I know I'm rambling with point after point of bad moments, but that's what this movie is. When the movie was over, the audience was quiet or just laughing at the ridiculousness of this movie. Skip it.",Ad Astra

Sure it looks pretty, but so does a 30 second perfume ad, which this might as well have been. The science seems like it was thought out by a 10 year old kid. Didn't James Gray bother with any consultants to get it right? Or did he figure he could get away with it because of the pseudo-intellectual angle he was going for? For a while you start to believe Brad Pitt's character McBridge might actually have the same Jedi powers Leia used in The Last Jedi to get herself back to her ship from the middle of outer space. This movie is like a song out of Neptune, sounding more like Uranus. If you want to see space pirates and space baboons, then this is the movie for you.

254,topitimo-829-270459,Slow tempo alone does not guarantee substance.,6,15 June 2020,"When it comes to science-fiction, I'm a picky customer. I love some of the more entertaining variations, such as ""Star Trek"" (1966 - 2004) and ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968 - 2017), as well as some of the more serious versions like ""Solaris"" (1972), ""Stalker"" (1979) and ""Arrival"" (2016). However, recent attempts like ""Gravity"" (2013), ""Interstellar"" (2014) and ""First Man"" (2018) did nothing for me. I really liked director James Gray's previous film ""The Lost City of Z"" (2016), which was slightly nostalgic in style, a slow but rewarding viewing experience. Though I came to view ""Ad Astra"" (2019) with an open mind, this is nowhere near as good of a film.In-the-not-too-distant-future, Brad Pitt plays an astronaut named Roy, whose father (Tommy Lee Jones) has gone missing years ago while exploring the edges of our galaxy. Roy gets summoned for a mission to find his dad, who is thought to be alive. Along the way, secrets are revealed and Roy gets a better understanding of both the father, as well as himself.So this here is a ""journey"" narrative, just like ""Z"" was. The major difference between the films is, that ""Z"" got better towards the end: it gradually hooked you in, whereas this film has an interesting concept, but gradually loses your interest. The film is very slow, and the ones who enjoy it most likely do so for the visuals. True, this film looks impressive, but it doesn't really have much narrative meat around the technical bones. The story is focused around Roy, who is a quiet one, but in order to have at least some dialogue, the film often resorts to voice-over narration, which I hated.Throughout the film, Gray shows hints about the films that possibly have inspired him. This not being a block-buster, but a story of inner turmoil (in space), some quiet sequences brought to mind Tarkovski. Yet there are also more action-oriented sequences that resemble films like ""Gravity"". The film presents itself both as a conspiracy narrative and a mystery, but I didn't think the pay-off was nowhere near good enough.So in the end, the film has good visuals, but little substance. Watch ""The Lost City of Z"" instead.",Ad Astra

259,tigerfish50,3 Billion Miles to an Anti-Climax,1,20 September 2019,"'Ad Astra' has been marketed and reviewed as if it were highbrow Sci-Fi with a Freudian subtext. Unfortunately both science and psychology are paper thin - and worse yet, the story also has minimal substance. The film's set-up is that a mission to Neptune has gone missing - and a couple of decades later, power surges originating from the distant planet cause explosions and mass casualties on Earth. The authorities suspect the commander of the doomed mission, a legendary space veteran called McBride, may still be alive and responsible. As a result, another Neptune mission is hastily organized to prevent further mayhem - and McBride's astronaut son is drafted as a crew member.Junior is dispatched from Earth to Moon, and onward to a remote launch pad on Mars before setting off for Neptune. On the way he endures various trials as the story settles down to being a gloomy potboiler. The narrative arc has echoes of Bowman's quest in '2001' and Willard's journey to confront Kurtz in 'Apocalypse Now', but it lacks the imagination, intensity and credibility of these earlier films. Despite several dramatic episodes, Junior's odyssey feels plodding and monotonous as he trudges on toward his goal, periodically droning on about his fatherless youth in a voice-over.As the story arrives at its final act, the screenwriters appear to have exhausted their creative repertoire, and are clueless how to wrap it up. They fabricate a feeble climax, then add some inane space-suited antics, similar to those which sabotaged Sandra Bullock's adventures in 'Gravity'. None of it makes much sense - unless of course, it's all supposed to be a dream following the film's opening sequence.

265,arabnikita,A soul seeking adventure,8,21 September 2019,"This year's big space movie is quite different from Interstellar, Martian and Gravity. As a matter of fact it is less of an epic sci-fi adventure with a clear goal and more of an artistic soul searching quest that will be interpreted differently by all those who see it. Personally, I saw it as a portrayal of psychological problems that arise from isolation of humanity due to the progress of technology. Space is used simply to amplify the message of tragic solitude filled with chilling silence and endlessness of space.The entire film is about Brad Pitt's journey of emotional growth as he traverses not only the solar system but also his mind. The camera was on him the entire time and he took full advantage of it by delivering a mature and a heartfelt performance that brought out his acting range in different way than Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. He was not heroic but was willing to take on a challenge when he had to and while doing so demonstrated a crucial skill of being able to move on after making mistakes.When the camera wasn't on Brad, it was unravelling the gorgeous views of the cosmos thanks to spectacular cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema which was supported by beautiful music. Ad Astra is more of a Space Odyssey and Solaris than it is Martian and Gravity. It is a movie that speaks differently to each person in a language that not everyone will understand. Nevertheless, if you do decide to see it, it must be in IMAX in order to let the film absorb you in a way that a small screen simply wont be able to.",Ad Astra
266,hunter-friesen,"""Ad Astra"" tells human story on cosmic scale",8,22 September 2019,"You may not have noticed, but the 2010s have been a renaissance for space movies. It all started with ""Gravity"" in 2013, followed by ""Interstellar"", ""The Martian"", and ""First Man"". The one thing each of these great movies has in common is their ability to tell a story of perseverance and triumph on a universal scale with the bonus of mind-blowing visual effects. Another addition to that list, but not entirely for the same reasons, is James Gray's ""Ad Astra"".Set in the near future, a catastrophic power surge travels across the solar system and strikes the earth, killing thousands. SpaceCom (the new NASA) have tracked down the source and believe it to most likely be from Dr. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), who's last known location was near Neptune sixteen years ago. The doctor's son, Maj. Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) happens to be the most respected engineer/astronaut in the world. Realizing the personal and planetary stakes this mission will have, Roy is recruited by the higher-ups to travel to the surge's source and destroy it before our planet is wiped out.James Gray has always been a more high brow filmmaker that has been able to take big stars and concepts and use them for projects that reach beyond the tropes of the genre.Just like in his previous film ""The Lost City of Z"", Gray here centers the story on a man on a journey, ending with the protagonist discovering more about himself than the destination he set out for.But don't worry, the destination here is well worth your time as Gray makes full effect of the two things most scarce in space: light and sound. Hoyte Van Hoytema illuminates every vast beauty through his awe-inspiring photography and Max Richter's soothingly intimate score perfectly complements the most emotional moments.Despite centrally being a very emotional film, Gray does liven things up from time to time with a few action set pieces that are both extremely creative and tense. Each one encapsulates the perils of space and the feeling that we humans are way out of our element once we go beyond our atmosphere.The writing of ""Ad Astra"" is what makes this film unique. Having more in common with ""Solaris"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" than the films mentioned in the beginning, Ethan Gross and Gray's screenplay delivers an introspective and philosophical story that increasingly gets more human as the setting gets more cosmic.The story is centralized through McBride as we follow his POV through the dangerous mission. Narration by Pitt is used to convey his character's inner thoughts. Against all norms of narrative storytelling, the narration works for the betterment of the film as it gives us an in-depth view of his perception of the unfolding events.Gray's scripts have always had another layer to them. There is always a sense of something deeper underneath that's slowly coming to the surface throughout the film. ""Ad Astra"" is another example of this trend as each line of dialogue or new information learned tends to serve dual purposes and lead to something bigger down the road.There does end up being a few frayed storylines that don't get the attention they deserve, but the overall story makes up for that fault by ending up being more than the sum of its parts.Already having a banner year with ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood"", Brad Pitt possibly delivers his greatest performance here. While ""Hollywood"" used Pitt's movie star power to its full potential, here he is at his most subtle and whole. He carries the emotional weight of the film and never holds back or gives too much, leaving with just the right amount of characterization.Tommy Lee Jones is also great is his supporting role as the father, Clifford McBride. He's more haunting than Pitt as we see the full effects that decades of claustrophobic space travel can have on the human mind and spirit.Liv Tyler shows up as Roy's significant other in a small supporting role that, judging by the trailers, was supposed to be a lot more central to the story before being edited down. Reserved more to flashbacks, Tyler gives the more emotionally heavy performance that contrasts with Pitt.James Gray's ""Ad Astra"" is part of the space renaissance of this last decade. But instead of following in the footsteps of those films it has joined, it charges down its own path and tells a deeply humanistic story on a cosmic level. Make no mistake, this is one of the best films of the year.",Ad Astra

268,tkaine3,The biggest let down of the year.,4,21 September 2019,""" 4/10 🌠🌠🌠🌠 =
Awaiting ""Ad Astra"" for me was very lopsided because the previews didn't really give me enthusiasm as far as the content I was previewing but of course when a movie is starring Pitt & Lee Jones as astronauts and all the critics raving about it being this years gem you really have no choice but to feel as though the movie will be good, henceforth is the reason why I and most people hate critic reviews and rely on user reviews from IMDB such as what you are reading and after watching ""Ad Astra"" I hate the fact that my gut was right about this one we travel billions of miles watching this movie for a storyline that never gets off the ground. The pace of the movie was slow which isn't a bad factor outright but when it's low on the excitement end you have too beef it up with intrigue and revelations. The intrigue was there but the revelation and psychological drama was mute. It was more of an emotional quest and I'm not even against that but if your going for emotions then why am I not feeling anything. It wasn't really sad or heartwarming no real sense of achievement even on the end of ones self discovery meter was pretty lacking. I thought the previews were hiding key moments to be revealed later but that wasn't the case. All in all I know the majority will agree with my assessment even if they are B.Pitt fans like myself of course you should see the film but it's not on my recommendation list sorry to say.. Mediocre material here folks keep it moving there's nothing to see.",Ad Astra

It's pretty much the same plot except it's his father who is Kurtz. The film itself is a bit clunky, there is some bad science and physics issues as well as a confusing space travel time shortening, they make a big deal out of the father traveling so far into space yet the son seems to get to him in no time and comes back even quicker with just a small beard to show the passing of what seems like a few weeks. The absurd idea that they are so concerned about and constantly monitor his physical and psychological state but have no issue sending 84 year old Donald Sutherland to space seems odd.

He is to complete this assignment before the apparent impact of the mission exacts catastrophe on humanity's existence.If nothing else, this film's cinematography and art direction are absolutely sublime. I have not seen a film that looked better than this one in a long time. If visual presentation were the sole factor in evaluating a film, this would be a knockout. Even in scenes not taking place in space, this film looks and feels pristine and austere.Sadly, we turn to the woeful screenplay. At its core, this film has a resonant premise and a formidable roster of acting talent at work. Regrettably, what potential this idea had is promptly snuffed out by the film's excessive use of voiceover narration, which goes from nondescript to repetitive to downright cliche-ridden by the film's conclusion. It gets so bad in this regard that the viewer might be forgiven for briefly forgetting the stakes that the plot sets out. The simple choice to have voiceover narration spell out seemingly every single thought that passes through Brad Pitt's head, including the occasional trite epithet on fathers and sons, becomes oddly distracting and renders the film dramatically inert. You cannot load up cornball dialogue without it eventually hurting or killing the film's mojo.In most instances to be truly effective, a film's craft should not be that visible. It certainly shouldn't be conspicuous to the point of appearing amateurish. Notwithstanding exemplary visuals and a workmanlike effort by Pitt, this ends up as a misfire. Not recommended.",Ad Astra

279,bastille-852-731547,Somber and Visually Stunning--Albeit Uneven--Journey Through Space,6,20 September 2019,"I was looking forward to this film after its gripping trailers, which mixed taut suspense in space with a seemingly strong emotional core of an experienced astronaut (Brad Pitt) searching far and wide through our galaxy to try to find his father (Tommy Lee Jones.) The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival, and received very strong reviews. After having seen the film, I was unfortunately a bit let down. I was hoping that the film could be in the same tier of the recent sci-fi films that I really love, such as ""Arrival"" and ""Interstellar,"" but unfortunately its surprising emptiness ends up holding it back.The film's plot is unfortunately rather limited. While Pitt does criss-cross through space on his mission, there's not much of genuine significance to the plot between the film's first act and its final 20 or so minutes, sans one brief conversation between two characters. As a result, viewers end up feeling not fully satisfied despite witnessing astonishing visual effects and cinematography combined with a soulful and powerful score that effortlessly alternates between the despondent and the hopeful. If a film was to be only judged on its aesthetic qualities, ""Ad Astra"" would be a perfect one. While Brad Pitt gave a good performance in the film, he is unfortunately unable to show off much of his range here. I understand that his character is supposed to be stoic and quiet in a manner similar to how Ryan Gosling portrayed Neil Armstrong in last year's ""First Man,"" but this film is at least supposed to have more emotional depth than Chazelle's film did--and as a result, Pitt should have been able to provide multiple dimensions to his character in a way he unfortunately did not. The supporting cast is generally good, but generally underused. The film's tone is also erratic, bouncing between a conventionally entertaining space adventure, a very dark ""Apocalypse Now""-esque drama, and even an introspective character study. The ending is also abrupt and not fully satisfying.While the superb visual and sound qualities of this film are extremely commendable, the film's flaws unfortunately serve as a detriment to what could have been the film's holistic narrative. 6/10",Ad Astra

283,eelen-seth,"Visually striking and sonically mesmerising, yet narratively tone deaf.",6,18 September 2019,"From the start, Ad Astra had some post production issues, which resulted in seriously delaying the release of the film. It was delayed many times because James Gray (The Lost City of Z) wanted to perfect the VFX for the movie. Additionally, Disney acquired Fox and the previous release date coincided with Disney's Aladdin, so they had to move it one more time. Here it is, after premiering at Venice Film Festival last month, the general public can finally take a look at what seems to be the biggest space epic since Interstellar. But nothing is what it seems in space..The film opens with astronaut Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) working on a space station, still attached to the earth's surface. When some sort of space flare shuts down electrical equipment, he gets blasted down back to the ground in a very spectacular opening scene, which literally takes your breath away. Soon after, we find out, this event - now named ""The Surge"" - has caused massive power outages on the entire planet, causing the deaths of thousands. When McBride gets called into a super confidential meeting, his superiors confront him with classified material that belonged to his father (Tommy Lee Jones), who was once sent on a mission into outer space to look for signs of extraterrestrial life. Surprised he's still alive, and most likely knows more about the cause of The Surge, McBride takes on the mission to go look for his missing father on the other side of our solar system.Visually, Ad Astra is truly spectacular (thanks to Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography and the VFX-team). The vibrant colour palette of several celestial bodies and some genuinely inventive tracking shots, made me stare at the screen like I was in some sort of trance. Most of the space scenes are silent - since ""no one can hear you scream in space"" - accompanied by Max Richter's mellifluous score. The world building is also one of the more interesting aspects, which made me interested in seeing more of the ""near future"" as presented in Gray's mind. Applebee's on the moon? The story takes us to different places and has the ability to suck us in, but never quite manages to do so.That's where the story comes into place. Narratively, the synopsis sounds like a wild adventure beyond the Earth's atmosphere, but don't be fooled by all of that, this is a drama. McBride clearly got over the supposed death of his father, by becoming one of the best astronauts, hereby disregarding his wife (Liv Tyler fans - like myself - will be disappointed). Discovering his father wasn't dead after all, daddy issues arise and this is basically what the entire film is all about. We hear Pitt narrating his character's thoughts, sounding philosophical in a sometimes too comically serious way.The rest of the cast just comes and goes. Donald Sutherland (The Hunger Games) and Ruth Negga (Loving) have barely any screen time, and that's a total shame, because their characters are genuinely interesting. Besides them, we get some extras who's sole purpose is to pump up the bodycount. Pitt leading this entire film, does a decent job, but having seen him bring his A-game just recently in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, his McBride is clearly going to pass by this awards season, without a whimper.Ad Astra could've been another modern space classic, such as Gravity or Interstellar, but clearly has an identity crisis. Visually striking and sonically mesmerising, yet narratively tone deaf. Next time, reach for the stars, but don't crash into the first asteroid passing by, James Gray.",Ad Astra
284,hoernkeem,"Ad Astra review (2019, James Gray) Less science fiction and more contemplative self discovery",4,8 February 2021,"Ad Astra (2019, James Gray)
This is a science fiction mystery wrapped up in a psychological drama. It almost reminds me as if someone wanted to make a Terrence Malick movie so this winds up somewhat like that except not quite so meditative or inaccessible. Brad Pitt stars as Roy McBride who is a legacy astronaut. He is very focused and no nonsense and even keeled and this has served him well in a military structure. His father is a space faring legend. Clifford McBride is played by Tommy Lee Jones and he was leader of the first mission to head to the outer solar system. Contact was lost many years ago and he is presumed dead. The Earth has recently been set upon by odd electrical surge storms that are steadily intensifying and threaten the planet's very existence. Roy McBride is brought on to a secret mission in an attempt to stop these mysterious surges. He is told that his father is believed alive and stuck somewhere near Neptune. Pitt is on a collision course in both an attempt to save his planet as well as finally meet the father he has never really known yet patterned much of his existence after. Along the way he comes to terms with the man he is and ponders the man he should be. The premise sounds interesting enough but this film sort of meanders and there is never much payoff. The plot just slides along to support the inevitable goal and when the obvious climactic encounter is reached it is just sorta meh. The film starts grounded in very realistic science fiction but quickly devolves especially as far as time and space are concerned. The special effects are fine enough but not earth shattering. Ultimately they take an interesting premise and weave an utterly boring story around it that really goes nowhere. I didn't hate the film, but at the same time if I had never seen it I don't think I would've missed much. It tries to walk this line between meditative, psychological drama and science fiction mystery and ultimately falters at interweaving these two separate genre aspects into an interesting whole.

285,aliases-53334,Missing spine and bones,6,23 January 2020,"This film has heart, but no spine. The story is not well formed and incomplete, filled with expectations of no avail.
Sad Brad Pitt is a space astronaut, a lone crusader who suffers loneliness and bad marriage ending in a separation from being emotionally unavailable. The character is lost in a quiet misery. Despite being in his 50s, Brad's character cannot find peace of mind and is an absent lover because his father was a famous astronaut who left them to space and some years later disappeared and presumed dead.
The film revolves around his obsession with his father and as he learns he might be alive, his obsession with finding him to have some sort of closure. His quest evolves in shallow ways as the film unfolds and the premise of finding mysteries in space only lead to short teasers (man-eating monkeys in space with no explanation as for where they came from and what this was about, seems like a thriller with no purpose), and eventually he finds his father which is a bitter asshole who never loved him at all. This revelation apparently sets Brad free and his wife/ex wife comes back to him as he is now not so sad.
Liv Tyler appears in the film for a total of perhaps five minutes, as her part is merely for the purpose of being a background story to emphasize his loneliness.
In the end, the film leaves us with unfulfilled promises and an unsettling feeling of something we never quite had. Perhaps, this was the whole point.",Ad Astra
286,Condemned-Soul,A profound and existential piece of science fiction,10,10 September 2020,"Visually breathtaking and gorgeously filmed, 'Ad Astra' is a space epic that takes you on a thematically ambitious journey across the stars.It's about an astronaut who must embark on a daring personal mission to Neptune in order to uncover the truth surrounding his missing father...A relatively subdued but excellent Brad Pitt plays the fearless son, charting a course through the vast, bleak expanse of space. He's fearless and ruminative, and the frequent interspersing of introspection gets us in the head of this fully formed character. The writing is strong, and when paired with a stirring score, 'Ad Astra' soon suggests something memorable is on the horizon.The film is spectacular to look at, capturing awe-inspiring sights with stunning cinematography, lending this sci-fi drama an arthouse feel that seems appropriate given the scope of the story and beauty of the locations.It's slow moving, but it never feels a chore to sit through, with writer/director James Gray guiding us through this cosmic night with an assured hand. His story builds to a powerful conclusion - bond between father and son tested; themes treated with care.Overall, 'Ad Astra' is a great filmmaking achievement. Technically it's brilliant, and dramatically it engrosses. The attention to detail and overpowering sense of wonder force you to surrender to the experience; to the sights of glorious places almost unfathomable. It is mesmeric, poetic, powerful... a science fiction film filled with images and music simultaneously bleak and hopeful; a transcendent experience so profound that it fuels that desire, that ache, that need to be out there exploring across the stars, beyond the sun... it is a masterpiece that held my complete attention and never let go.10/10.",Ad Astra

Will there ever be a movie about outer-space exploration in which nothing, nothing at all, goes wrong?

296,theredsky,Ad Astra Review,8,22 September 2019,"Ad Astra has some of the best visual effects of the year and another strong performance from Brad Pitt. Even though the film is really strong in the technical category, it still has its issues. The film is definitely going for this deep psychological tone and it didn't work well for me, mainly because the film takes itself a little bit too seriously. Throughout the 2 hour runtime, Pitt smiles maybe once or twice. If the film wasn't trying to make itself this deep psychological film, it would have been better. The very basic concept of the film is very cliched. It is another save the universe story but it does enough that is unique that this isn't that big of an issue. Some of the side characters are pointless and are just there to dump exposition. The film also does start to feel a tad bit too long towards the end though. While these issues do hold the film down a little bit, the positives do outweigh the negatives. Brad Pitt gives a fantastic performance. Although I think his performance in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood was better, I still think he does a fantastic job. It's just the little things he does in this role that establish him as a great actor. Tommy Lee Jones did a good job in his role even though he was on screen for about 10-15 minutes. In my opinion, the biggest take away from the film is the visual effects. The film looks fantastic. Whenever we see a planet, it looks so real and it sucks you into the universe. Every little detail, every spaceship, every location just feels incredibly real. I strongly believe this film could win Best Visual Effects at the Oscars. The way the film uses lighting and its camera work just adds to the spectacle. I don't know a lot about the physics of space but from what I do know, this film abides by those rules most of the time. Do remember that this film takes place in the near future and technology has obviously improved in this universe so some of the physics may not make as much sense as they would today. I also really enjoyed the score by Max Richter for this film a lot. It has this spacey vibe to it that fits the atmosphere and the tone the film is going for. I thought the production design for this film was really good also. Overall, Ad Astra is a great film with a fantastic performance by Brad Pitt and amazing visual effects but is held back a little by a way too serious tone. I give Ad Astra a 7.5/10.",Ad Astra

298,pritol,Ad Astra: Boldly goes...where many have gone before.,7,29 September 2019,"Ad Astra is a slow but compelling sci-fi drama, with few moments of ""action"", and despite its relatively modest budget some spectacular visuals.It focuses on the strained relationship between a son living in his fathers shadow and that absent father being the potential cause of a threat to humanity.James Gray does a great job of creating a potential future which is all too believable, with attention to some really mundane details, such as how commercial flights to the moon would look and operate. (Subtle product placement for Virgin Galactic was a nice touch).The films use of colour is brilliant, reflecting somewhat the mood of Brad Pitt's main character Major Roy McBride.Brad Pitt puts out what I personally think is his strongest performance in a decade. Whilst his voiceover is relatively flat, which could be deliberate given his characters military demeanour, his work during the close-ups is excellent.The film starts strong, but does go a little flat in the second half. Had it been maybe 20mins shorter it would have packed more punch.Perhaps however those extra mins were there to build on the tension until father and son meet. When they do, it is a great examination of how ""the sons pay for the sins of their fathers"", in this case both psychologically and professionally. However they both get what they arguably deserve, which brings both joy and sadness in equal measure.The film feels like a blend of so many other sci-fi films: 2001: Space Odyssey, Moon, Gravity, and even partly Event Horizon. Whilst it is inspired by them no doubt, it doesn't try and replicate them. This film is very much its own creation, and if you are happy with the slower pace then it is well worth the time.",Ad Astra

It is a drama about a father and son who completely lost touch, woven into the SciFi story. The sci-fi aspect of the film is actually not the forefront and is more of an trasfered meaning of distance between father and son.The film is well done and at times quite spectacular. Worth a watch, but not for Transformer fans. This is a slow-paced film that requires the viewer to have empathy and connection with the character played by Brad Pitt. Fatherless sons would be much more understanding of the movie than someone living with their parents at 40.",Ad Astra
301,jaimemedina-36288,A movie about humanity not extraterrestrial life,8,21 June 2021,It took me two times to appreciate this movie. I can't say I loved it the first time around. I was anticipating a different kind of story. But there was enough there to make me watch it again - on its own terms (as movies should be judged.)At the heart of this story is a man perhaps more robot than human. He's drifting through life like a stranger. His hear and emotions are tightly in check. His singular focus is his mission. One that will take him to the very edge of our solar system.And it is there. In the very deepest part of absolutely nothing where he is able to confront the father that he never had and to find the thing that has been missing for so very long... his humanity.It's a beautiful movie.,Ad Astra
302,joshbarton15,Meditative sci-fi.,8,20 September 2019,"Science-fiction epics have made a bit of a comeback in recent years, A-listers left right and centre signing up to explore space with exciting filmmakers to deliver some pretty memorable films. In Brad Pitt, Ad Astra may have landed itself just about the biggest A-lister in Hollywood to take us on another journey into the unknown.When astronaut Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) embarks on a mission across space to find his missing father (Tommy Lee Jones), he uncovers a mystery that could threaten human existence on Earth.Opening with an explosively gripping sequence on the edge of Earth's atmosphere, Ad Astra meanders along almost in a trance-like state, taking us on a journey of discovery and showcasing some quite stunning shots along the way. It's a sci-fi epic but it's an understated one in its approach compared to something like Interstellar, the journey of one man travelling to the edge of our solar system for the sake of mankind feeling lowkey in James Gray's film.This works in the film's favour to a degree as Gray takes us on a journey through space that's more likely to leave you in a meditative state than on the edge of your seat, honing in on the personal mission Pitt's McBride is on to find his father. It wasn't what I was expecting at all and, if I'm honest, it left me a little cold when it reached its conclusion, but maybe that's because I went in expecting a major sci-fi epic of sorts.Brad Pitt is one of the last remaining true movie stars in Hollywood and he leads Ad Astra with a commanding performance, accompanied by Max Richter's beautifully haunting score, in what really is one of his best performances to date. This is very much Pitt's film as there isn't a supporting character around for long enough to make too much of an impression however, none of the supporting cast do the film a disservice.As sci-fi goes, Ad Astra does a sound job of exploring the unknown, Pitt holding the film together really well to keep you thinking throughout, even if some of his narration does get a little grating at times.",Ad Astra

304,taedirish,Pompous self-gratification,2,17 January 2021,"I put off watching this movie for quite a while, finally out of boredom I decided to suffer thru it, and that's exactly what I did, suffer!
The movie is essentially a Cat Stevens song, thinly disguised as a sci-fi flick. Pitt is a middle aged astronaut (basically a cell phone tower tech) with daddy issues who's sent on a ridiculous quest to contact his father, who somehow is causing massive power surges back on earth...never explained how, but still.
So Pitt flies to the moon's version of JFK, gets attacked by moon pirates, hops another flight to Mars, where he battles space baboons along the way. All so he can make a ridiculous venture to stow away on a suicide mission, where he accidentally kills everyone else.
Finally he gets to Jupiter, finds his dad, has a pity party, before making the most absurd venture back to earth since Sandra Bulloch in Gravity.
All along the way, there's countless narration inserted by Pitts character with all the verbal masturbation of a cologne commercial...
There is no deeper psychological meaning to this film, it's just pretentious nonsense serving as a black mark on the career of some very fine actors. I had to wonder if perhaps the script portrayed the movie as something very different to the actors and, when they saw the finished product, did they say to themselves ""WTF did I do????🤦🏻""
There's a reason this film got so many bad reviews, because ITS BAD!!! If you watched the trailer and thought ""this seems bad"" you were right! It's 2:04 of your life wasted, I highly recommend you spend that time doing ANYTHING besides watching this movie. Maybe watch YouTube videos on how to give yourself a haircut?

305,Camoo,"Failed attempt at lift-off, but still has some greatness to it.",5,9 December 2019,"If there is something in the ego of many a filmmaker who feel that sci-fi is a genre they must tackle at least once in their career, then James Gray's ego seems larger than most. This is not necessarily a bad thing when talking about sci-fi - exemplars of the genre are all audacious and full of outlandish ideas - but, like Interstellar, we have a film here with ideas are so ambitious and overwrought that it struggles to contain them all into one package.I have never been the biggest fan of James Gray, his 'Lost City of Z' was a film I thought suffered the same fate as Ad Astra - a great idea in theory, lost in the execution in the hands of somebody who thought a concept really really cool, but then failed to deliver it in a way that was realistic or well baked enough for me to suspend disbelief. Herzog James Gray is not, and neither is he Stanley Kubrick, nor Tarkovsky, nor even Cuaron (although there are some scenes here which are among the most exciting and thrilling Gray has ever directed, and which recall the opening of Gravity.)But I also must give props for filmmakers who even dare to try this sort of film, and especially within the intimate confines Ad Astra aspires to. In a way, this is a film simply about a father and son, amplified to IMAX proportions, and though I didn't really think it worked too well, I appreciate the chutzpah and ambition here.Brad Pitt is excellent as Roy McBride, and for long periods we can suspend our disbelief enough to buy his presence as a space traveller on his way to Neptune to find his father, H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones, grizzled as ever), but there becomes a point in which the 2001 homage become almost too much to bear.

Perhaps even worse, whether to try and spice it up a bit, or just to be able to claim it as a piece of real space opera, there are scenes which have nothing to do with the story, such as it is, and don't get me started on the bad science. The moon rovers, for instance, were not driving in moon gravity. This is obvious to anyone who is aware of such things. Worse, they were probably CGI rovers, so they could have fixed the gravity, but didn't know or didn't care.I only watched this because, with 3 of my all-time favourite actors, how could it not be good?

As hinted in the trailer brad pitts character is sent across the solar system to discover if he must save his father or execute him as its unknown if his work is destroying all life on earth. The protagonist, estranged from his father, should be going through a range of emotions but they scripted him as having buried his emotions instead so the movie follows a robot just barely showing signs of humanity through this films run time, think michael sheen in Apocalypse Now instead of Tom hanks in Apollo 13.

It's long, it contains parts that could easily be left on the cutting room floor and featured this constant monologue from Pitt about personal relationships that became vacuous and dull.There seemed to be this theme around psychological stability and a future where people's mental state is monitored ridiculously. If all this was supposed to add up to some deep insight, it never delivered to any degree and instead seemed to rehash an old concept of searching of intelligent life out in space compels a reflection on our own relationships and connections with others. Overall, this aspect of the film was constipated overall.The ending of the film was a total let down and completely unsatisfying.

314,unclesamsavage,Sensational Science Fiction Philosophy,7,22 September 2019,"Much akin to Interstellar, Ad Astra explores some of the deeper human questions behind space travel. Maybe the galaxy is empty and ""we are all we got."" When faced with that possibility, hope seems lost. Yet, looking inward may be the greatest reminder we have to save what we can while improving ourselves and our world.Maj. Roy McBride tries to reconcile with his lost father, a legendary astronaut and doctor sent to Neptune. Following a plot similar to 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad and its famous film adaptation 'Apocalypse Now', McBride faces numerous challenges along the way with many hard decisions. Along the way, he slowly loses himself. While the film took its liberty to abstract often, there were no stretches of philosophical questioning by the narrator that felt too long. The action and philosophy balance seemed just right for me and what I look for in an intellectual sci-fi film.I don't have much to complain about this film. It was enjoyable for the most part and what I expected it to be. Brad Pitt was tremendous and the shots were breathtaking. The only thing that bothered me was the music. Perhaps it is just me because I listen to a lot of classical music, but I have come to despise the emotional cues sent with some movie scores. Some scenes in this film felt like they were trying too hard to force sadness or suspense with the violins. I would have preferred scene by themselves with no generic music score. Of course, if a score like John Williams' Empire Strikes Back or Shore's Fellowship of the Ring were playing, I might be all the more engaged.All in all, Ad Astra is worth the watch. If you get a chance, see this on the big screen. It is not an instant classic for me, trailing in the wake of Interstellar and Gravity. However, I had a blast during it and only a short existential crisis afterwards. I would be surprised if this film does not get a look for some Oscars and Golden Globes.",Ad Astra

320,cappiethadog,Island in the sky,8,17 October 2019,"This is not the end for Roy McBride(Brad Pitt), a second-generation astronaut, a man of science, in James Gray's existential sci-fi drama ""Ad Astra"". During an emergency spacewalk, Clifford(Tommy Lee Jones), Roy's father, chooses death over life, after undergoing an odyssey of self-discovery that, ultimately, he is the alien life form which his Lima Project failed to procure. The son lets go. The father becomes the man who fell to Neptune. It's either Neptune or hell. ""Ad Astra"" uncannily recalls Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"". Clifford McBride, like Kurtz(Marlon Brando), has a heart of darkness that needs to be stopped. The tweak, of course, is that Willard(Martin Sheen) had no familial connection to the fallen colonel, but the assassination plot remains the same, which is why SpaceCom tries to sideline Roy after he makes contact with the decorated astronaut, who has gone completely insane, proving the old adage ""nobody can hear you scream"" to be true. This is not your father's ""Alien"", of course. A final transmission from an unidentified crew member reveals that it's a disgruntled astronaut, not a xenomorph, who refuses to come home until he finds some sort of alien life, even if its malevolent and H.R. Giger-like. SpaceCom wishes it was a colony of acid-mouthed xenomorph causing mayhem on the ship. But no, that's the sound of an American hero murdering his crewmates over the black box transmission. Clifford McBride, a mythic figure, just like his Vietnam War counterpart, went rogue, but instead of playing God, the astronaut transforms into a different sort of despot, an alien one, whose power over life and death comes deep from outer, not inner space. Instead of a flying saucer attack, it's a malfunctioning antimatter power source from the damaged spacecraft that threatens earth's existence. Clifford is a one-man ""War of the Worlds"", commandeering a de facto drone attack from Neptune, billions and billions of miles away. Antimatter-based emissions from across the universe are the cause of the deadly power surges that endangers the cosmos' survival. It's not so dissimilar to Kurtz's scribbled directive: ""Drop the bomb. Exterminate them all,"" that Willard finds in the colonel's poetry book. ""The End"", written by Jim Morrison, plays at the outset of ""Apocalypse Now"", as a row of trees gets napalmed, and it returns when Willard ends Kurtz's regime over the indigenous Central Highlanders. It's the end for Kurtz. The Doors song, however, is not used as a coda. Rock and roll is superseded by an orchestral maneuver, as Willard walks out of Kurtz's hut, and surveys the bowing Montagnards. He decides it's not the end for these Vietnamese aboriginals, or his own self, for that matter, and doesn't call in an airstrike. It's not the end for Roy McBride either. He grabs a floating door from his father's home away from home, deflecting meteoric debris against the backdrop of Neptune's rings. The nuclear reactor's blast aboard Lima propels Roy's ship back to earth, where there are many doors left to be opened or...Did Clifford McBride, and in general, his bosses at SpaceCom, have any business in space? By evoking Vietnam, that seems to be the question James Gray is asking? The United States did not belong in southeastern Asia. ""Ad Astra"", very subtly, tells a story in the vein of Joseph Conrad. Planet by planet, earth is taking over. The moon is a tourist trap. Mars is an important hub for the space program. If there were alien life forms inhabiting either orbital sphere, what would we do with them? It's manifest destiny on a global scale. ""Ad Astra"" lifts a key scene from the 1979 Francis Ford Coppola anti-war(and, subtextually, anti-colonization) spectacle. Against Willard's orders, George(Albert Hall), the boat captain, stops to inspect a sampan, a routine check for contraband that could bolster the Vietcong effort. A woman on the ""junk boat"" makes a sudden movement. ""Clean""(Lawrence Fishburne), the youngest soldier in their platoon, panics and open-fires on the apolitical fishermen. The suspicious woman was only worried about her puppy, hidden in a basket. She breathes, still, but Willard, with the coldest blood, shoots her, to prevent a detour from his secret mission. his futuristic stand-in, Roy, faces the same situation, when his space vehicle, en route to Mars, stops for a mayday signal on captain's orders, citing protocol and rank. Despite his protestations, Roy accompanies the Cepheus captain(Donnie Kershawarz) aboard the Norwegian biomedical research space station, and nearly becomes the baboons' second victim. Follow me, now. This is important. Primate and man appear contemporaneously unlike the match-cut that separates the apes and men in Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", because in ""Ad Astra"", the absence of alien life negates the potentiality of a go-between to perpetuate an evolutionary leap forward. The realization that there would be nothing even half as momentous as the Star Child destroyed Roy's father, a dreamer among pragmatists. The ""junk boat"" massacre in ""Apocalypse Now"" is evoked when same Cepheus crew deals with Roy again, this time as a security breach instead of a VIP. Roy McBride, in actuality, is an antihero, just like Willard, but ""Ad Astra"" obscures his true nature by making it clear that the astronaut kills his colleagues in self-defense. Because the audience identifies with Brad Pitt's character, the audience misconstrues the dead as villains. But how can they be the bad guys when saving the universe from total annihilation was their primary goal? Roy kills the heroes, albeit by default. For the son, his father usurps mankind as priority number one. Roy can't see his father for what he has become, a raving lunatic, as seen in Clifford McBride's last transmission aboard the Lima Project before sixteen years of radio silence. This is not the same man Roy knew as a child.""Solaris"", the classic science fiction film from Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky, is what makes ""Ad Astra"" a pastiche. From the Soviet-era film, James Gray borrows the idea of multiplicity, human duplicates. Based on the Stanislaw Lem novel, Kris Kelvin(Donatas Banionis), a cosmonaut, investigates the titular space station and planet, and encounters his late wife Hari(Natalya Bondarchuk). She is neither ghost nor alien, but instead, a psychical projection of the dead. Hari 2.0 kills herself, just like the original. Hari 3.0 replaces her. Conversely, when the astronaut's father decides on making outer space his graveyard, the original is restored, replacing this virtual stranger, an estranged copy, who would murder indiscriminately and without remorse.Will Kris ever learn that he never made it back home? The reunion with his father(Nikolai Grinko) at their English country house is another psychical projection, an island on Solaris' ocean. He remains in space, oblivious. So what about Roy McBride? A case can be made for his death. Ultimately, Roy's father, a man of science, reluctantly turns into a Christian Scientist, when he learns that mankind has no distant neighbors. This is proof of God. Man was made in God's image. The Holy Ghost did not make green little men. Clifford McBride looked and looked for them, but they were nowhere to be found. That's what caused him to break. Science was wrong.Clifford's spacecraft was four billion miles away, propelled by a cataclysmic nuclear blast, that survived reentry, and landed on water, not land. Those are some long odds.Arguably, it's not the hand of a man; it's the hand of an angel which reaches out to Roy when his capsule is opened. The conquering hero knows the truth. That's why he hesitates before grabbing that hand.He is dead.And maybe, earth.",Ad Astra
321,jonnytheshirt,Pensive simmer,6,19 February 2020,Ad Astra kind of stays with you as front and center is the leads relationship with his father and his fathers relationship with the rest of the universe. Pitt is in every scene and narrates throughout. Because of the root of the story is actually relationships the far flinging sci-fi would work as a play - this is because so much of the external is superfluous.

327,brianjohnson-20043,"Overall, too slow and stupid to make up for solid SFX",4,21 September 2019,"This struck me as mediocre fan-fiction-like science fiction trying to resemble serious adult science fiction by making the protagonist calm and mature and having nice special effects.What's good?:The acting was fine given the material and likely direction. The visuals are really great. Especially the very beginning.Why the good doesn't make the movie worth seeing?:This is 2019. A lot of movies look gorgeous and are competently acted.What usually separates the good movies from the bad movies (in my opinion) is the story and whether or not the director can convey the tone and keep it interesting through the duration of the film. When people talk about how fabulous a movie like this was, I usually have to remind the insane person(from my perspective) that feature movies are an 80 to 180 minute art form. And they tend to me narrative for a reason. Features aren't 5 minutes of intriguing abstract visuals followed by a 2 hour conversation about all the potential meanings or intentions of the 5 minutes of content. I was a studio art major in college. It's not as if I'd be against such an experience or the existence of 5 minute abstract movies followed by 2 hour long discussions and debates over the content. I'd probably enjoy it.But this movie seems to fit into the pretentious category of feature movies trying to be like an art movies, but also stuck trying to be a successful feature epic showing what should be addressed in Ted Talks.This movie In attempt of being many things struck me as appealing like a whole lot of nothing for a good chunk of the time.What makes the feature runtime worth the investment for a good feature film, for me, is the ability to be invested in the story. And the investment works when the tone is both appealing and consistent for the world or rules the story establishes. The tone for Ad Astra has some appealing parts. But it wasn't consistent. Sometimes it seemed like cheesy science fiction with the stunts and contrivances the story pulled. Other times is seemed like it was trying to be a real interesting human-struggle story for the future (kind of like the Martian).Whenever a film tries to make too many contradictory things work, they're inevitably going to have some of them compromising or crippling the impact of others. Ad Astra's story often felt silly as a space odyssey type movie. But it also felt far too mature and serious to be a fun popcorn movie. Which makes it a big bore.More than any other movie It seemed to me like it was trying to be like the film Gravity. But focus on a different type of internal struggle for the protagonist and be set in the future and consist of a space odyssey (see the problem yet).A movie like Gravity has a lot of intended metaphorical components to its story. But the genius of Gravity, which Ad Astra lacks, is that (if you can get over a few factual errors for some of the story elements for Gravity) the story is interesting and engaging, even if you don't pick-up the metaphors. Gravity also was never trying to be like 2001: a space odyssey in the pacing. It immediately had the viewer within the action and drama. And the action and drama sustained itself from the beginning till the end.Ad Astra had a lot of slow moments. And even the tense moments didn't feel too gripping because the main character's strength is that he's able to remain calm and composed. So we had no one to feel very emotional through.I wish they had consulted with someone like me who is similar to Brad Pitt's character in being calm and having a long fuse internally. Because even if someone like me can surprise themself by how calm they remain in crazy moments on the inside, we still can be funny or interesting to watch on the outside. Brad Pitt was portrayed as boring and it was often difficult to be sympathetic of his situation. And I can't think of any space movie that works if the main character isn't sympathetic or interesting. Even Sci Fi movies I don't personally like, such as 2001: a space Odyssey or Interstellar manage to make the main character mostly sympathetic. Brad Pitt's character had an end-mission which I was invested in. But he didn't set off with that appealing mission as a goal. So I wasn't invested in the character as a whole. He didn't seem to earn a hero's story. He stumbled into it ridiculously (which I'll address later) And that makes it hard to really get behind his character overall, and the movie overall.I'll go into some details on how some of the story elements seemed unrealistic from my understanding of space-travel and logic.I couldn't figure out why he parked his he had to go through Neptune's rings to get to the other ship? It seemed like a contrivance for dramatic interests. And I'll explain how we know this. Later on, he gets back to earth from a strange takeoff with priciest factored-in at the point of the launch? If the ship could correct itself to provide for a safe passage, why not correct itself when it heading toward the other ship near Neptune?Probably my biggest issue which I vaguely addressed earlier is: How did the head-of-Mars-lady (who we learned would be one of the people most interested to know of the conspiracy and motivated to divulge it to everyone) end up with video proof of the conspiracy? And why didn't she or couldn't she share the video to everyone everywhere? Did online video-sharing becoming impossible in the future? This is IMO an inexcusable plot-hole.Here's another thing the movie had to suggest for the sake of adding action. It suggests that in the future there are no background checks or restrictions on what person or weapons can be taken to the moon. And suggests that anyone can wander around on the surface of the moon like it's the old west? We can't even have people wandering around the skies around earth right now without air traffic control throwing a fit. Why would the surface of the moon have such terrible management and oversight?Also, don't people have to be pretty securely buckled-in when on a rocket that's taking off? Especially if it's supposed to go fast enough to get from Mars to Neptune in far less time than it takes today for a rocket to go from Earth to Mars when it's not transporting people ( human-passengers limit acceleration and deceleration possibilities unless you have something like inertial dampeners which things like Star Wars or Star Trek seem to have) But if they had that, they wouldn't need any buckling-in at all. And characters clearly buckle-in for the launches in the other circumstances. They also never indicate that the ships have an extra gear once in space to account for the rockets being able to travel faster. They make the rockets like modern rockets with the experience that they're way faster and don't have to deal with any of the problems which would be dealt with if they were much faster.I wouldn't knit-pick this in the movie if it weren't for all the people claiming the movie's depictions are realistic. Were we watching the same movie?!?!?",Ad Astra

329,jeannefrancoise,a so-so movie but it compels about what you expect,7,23 September 2019,"Ad Astra is one popular movie in my country Indonesia right now. It gives us story about the drama how a child pursue the career of his lost father and how later his journey, it makes a strong believe that his father still alive out there. I am trying to search whether the Lima Project is real or fake but it's not quite fascinating information on the Internet, perhaps you can search it also more academically on the library. But here I want to review the movie process. For me this is not a sci fi movie, it is a drama movie based on astronaut secret project. Here audience can expect some sad moments and crying scenes, but not at all explaining science just like sci fi did. This is a so-so movie, but it compels about what you expect. You can see closer to what happens if humans build strong manifestation in outer planets and yes there are some obstacles to fight for. Questioning other existence is quite popular as scriptwriting base line since 1950s movies, but how modern cinematography can explore it and how people could react after it, this is so important part for Ad Astra.

In reality there is only one character in this film and everything that happens is just his single perspective... While the Moon Base looked pretty cool, the production designs on this film are the most boring ever... I think they even reuse the same bottle shaped rocket to travel between planets most of the time... If you ask me where it stands among the new wave of space films, well it's the ""Outland"" of 2010's which was a boring Sean Connery space film ...

If its not doing it for you,
Then its not the movie for you.
But i want you to try that fifteen minutes.I have never thought any MODERN sci fi cinema can get inside my head.Most of them are pretty bad with jokes and action or thrilling vfx sequences,but Ad astra is really unique because showing a protagonist , his thoughts , his mental stability , his understanding of mission and to how much extend he can think of the mission despite battling his inner demons is clearly visible in it.This is not a horror movie or even a drama movie,its a journey about an astronaut who accepts his space mission while thinking about his whole life , his each and every decisions.
Like-Adding parental problems is a plus point ,Showing a fractured love life gets another point,equally interesting just as high tech space mission,if you can think it off.
Cause believe me a space mission is equally important just like an astronauts mentality.
Watch the trailer to see how beautiful the movie looks and you people already know Brad pitt s acting so i have nothing to write about these two.
Conclusion- its a powerful cinema for us old school cinema lovers.I so want more.

The movie doesn't do a good job explaining any of the sci fi subjects. It all resumes down to the father son relationship. I don't get it, waste of money and good actors.
Writing is not amazing, actors are good, pacing is so slow in the 2nd half it's hard to keep focus.

Young Mr. Gordon (a college football player with great speed; thus his name) is sent into space to thwart Mr. Ming.While Ad Astra owes something to 'Flash Gordon' it owes even more to Joseph Conrad's novella 'Heart of Darkness'. And even more to Coppola's film, 'Apocalypse Now'In place of Martin Sheen going up river to find, and subdue, Brando's Kurtz, here we get astronaut Brad Pitt going space-ward to find, and subdue, an equally mad Tommy Lee Jones.In place of Sheen's many riverside stops along the way - with each stop increasing the foreboding, the lunacy, the dramatic stakes - we get Brad Pitt first driving to the U.S. launch-pad, stopping over for a car-chase on The Moon, followed by a menacing visit to Mars, and then outward and onward to Neptune.Where Sheen had never met Kurtz, Pitt knows the Jones character all too well; he is going off to meet his father.If this sounds like a good recipe for a film, Go. Enjoy. For me, it failed. For me it seemed (for the most part) shot in slow motion. We are inside Pitt's mind for the entirety of the film and if his actions seem slow, his decision making seems slower still. I got bored. An astronaut alone in outermost space and I'm bored. Not good.But here's what bothered me most.
Mistakes.
1. The film's opening sequence says, 'In the near future' (or something akin to that). Well, it's not. It's a long, very long way from now. Cities on the Moon. Cities on Mars. Manned space ships hovering above Neptune.
2. Pitt and his father (Jones) used to watch old black-and-white musicals together when Pitt was a kid. Huh? If this film is set hundreds of years from now are we to believe that Astaire and Rogers are still going to be nostalgic entertainment? And when we meet up with his father, in fact that is precisely what he is viewing.
3. Paper. Computer Paper. Green and white computer paper. The kind used in companies back in the 1970s and 80s. It seems that Pitt's father has that paper with him. And if you say, Yes but he's been missing for fifteen years, I'ds say to you, This takes place in the far distant future. Nobody even remembers that kind of paper. Or remembers paper at all.These mistakes bothered me. A lot. But then I thought, Maybe they're not mistakes. Maybe there's meaning in this. And that bothered me even more. Distracted me even more.And before I knew it I was done with the film.",Ad Astra

The other famous actors were good but again not much opportunity to show us much. I did not walk out. I do not believe in doing that but my food was more interesting than the screen. It dragged. Visually some parts were good.

Unfortunately, the script abuses of the voice over, focusing a lot in internal conflict but not showing it. Instead, it keeps telling us Brad's thoughts throughout the movie. This is mostly how novels are written, with a main focus on internal conflict, but not scripts. And this is the reason why voice over is regarded as something that should be avoided, especially for beginning screenwriters. When abused, the story gets dull and the pace really slow.

Acting is good and for fans of Brad Pitt, this works perfect as he is in almost every scene.

357,WooderIce64,Hypnotic and Introspective,9,23 April 2020,"The best word to describe Ad Astra is hypnotic. It's a voyage through the Solar System that manages to be quiet, slow, and oddly calm despite the circumstances. Astronaut Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) must send a message to his father near Neptune, whose search for extraterrestrial life has endangered life as far away as Earth. What needs to be known is that Ad Astra is a psychological film first, a morality tale second, and a sci-fi movie third. The psychological themes recur throughout the movie, as Pitt's narration gives us updates on what he thinks and feels at the given moment, plus the constant stream of psychological tests he is faced with. We also see the toll that all this isolation has on him. It's very introspective, showing us the vastness of space and this mission against human capacity. The narration, despite the negativity and cynicism, is oddly relaxing. It's strange. Maybe it's the soft voice combined with images of the stars that give this feeling.The morality aspect is interesting because it covers the extent to which scientists are willing to go in the name of scientific progress, and what they are willing to sacrifice to meet that goal. The father went farther than anyone had before, but was it worth it? In that regard we see him in a way lose a piece of his humanity in order to bridge humans and extraterrestrials. And, finally, it is a science fiction film. It has advanced spaceships, human facilities on the Moon and Mars, and a search for extraterrestrial life. Some of the ideas are interesting, notably the commercialization and piracy on the moon.Visually, this film is incredible. The visual effects and cinematography are nearly perfect. The ships and facilities in space and on other planets look fantastic, and the scale, scope, and beauty of our solar system is put on full display. The camera work and the uses of color and light are excellent. The excellent score and periods of silence make this quite the experience.Worth noting: I saw this movie alone, in a very large theater at night, in an empty theater in an empty shopping center in a fairly rural area, so my circumstances amplified the effects of this movie.

As a result, he goes on a journey through space in hopes of finding him and bringing him back home and to reality.When I was going into this movie, I honestly thought it was going to be a science fiction movie. What we get in reality is an adventure/drama where the core is the relationship between the main character and his father. The trailers seemed to be very misleading in that regard. Despite this, I still had issues with the film's narrative.First off, the movie had some action scenes towards the beginning, but they generally went absolutely nowhere and barely had anything to do with the plot or the adventure. Second, we don't really learn much about the main character's relationship with his father. When we do learn something about it, it's through exposition. In a slow and simple story like this, I feel like flashbacks would be more effective here because they help to engage the audience over exposition. Finally, there were some plot points that I feel like were thrown to the wayside by the third act. Delving more into that leads into spoiler territory, however.This isn't to say that there isn't a lot to like however because there is a lot to like here. First off, I feel like the adventure aspect works pretty well, as we get to see the struggles the main character has to go through to get to his destination. I also found the visuals and the cinematography to be really good, you can tell that the budget went to creating the beautiful effects displayed on the silver screen. Finally, I can't forget to acknowledge Brad Pitt's performance. He's been a pretty busy man this years it seems as he gives off a calm, yet very convincing performance when compared to his more energetic one in Once Upon a Time.I am very mixed on this movie because there are a lot of things that it does right, but the narrative has a lot of faults that really keep me from liking it as much as I want to.5/10",Ad Astra

367,ernestsavesxmas,It's lack of a trick is kind of a trick,8,11 March 2020,"In a banner year for artful and/or weird space sci fi, Ad Astra works because it's lack of a trick is kind of a trick. Whereas other recent films set among the stars have been propelled by big issues like climate change, this takes the inconceivable vastness and distance and makes it insular. As a metaphor for a fractured relationship between a father and son, it literally can't get any bigger (or more obvious). When it's all said and done, the facts are laid bare. There's no Christopher Nolan mindscrew or ""too clever for its own good"" twist. But it's not all daddy issues and voiceover, there's some dystopian geopolitical stuff bubbling under the surface that is interesting, and feels somehow stronger in its vagueness (I'm looking at you moon pirates and, of course, vicious space baboons will always rule). Ultimately, though, it's about Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones. We can't save the world if we finally learn to understand our parents and the motivation behind their life choices. It just feels that way.",Ad Astra
368,JRmf,Disappointing,6,2 February 2020,"Great sci-fi visual2 and some excitement do not make up for vague storytelling, maddening plot holes (what happened to the other 25 souls on the Mayday ship?), and a story which descends into navel gazing. ET mysteries are not expounded, never mind the threat to Earth.",Ad Astra
369,seige-hound,Surprisingly fun and engaging,8,23 September 2019,"I wasn't too sure what this movie was going to be. It sort of looked like a semi-realistic hard sci-fi movie ala Interstellar, and it kind of is. But I think it does something a bit more interesting.I don't think the movie was going for full realism here. Some of the reviews I've seen were nitpicking certain elements of the science of the plot, which, sure. I don't know much about astrophysics so I can't really speak to whether you need to travel all the way to Mars to send a message, but it needs be remarked that scientific accuracy isn't the end-all be-all when it comes to sci-fi, and that most writers prioritize making a good compelling story.What I really liked about this movie was the worldbuilding. It wasn't quite Star-Trek levels of futurism, but it wasn't set in modern times either. In this world, there's several colonies on the Moon that fight each other, a colony on Mars, and a fairly well established space travel infrastructure that is able to support commercial flights to the Moon, which I found really cool. This vision of the future is something, I think, could be explored further.Thinking about it, I think that's the main flaw with the film. Ad Astra creates this really cool, interesting world with different colonies, but it also tries to tell a more limited character drama about a man reconciling with his father's legacy and moving on. Yes, with films like Her that tell intricate character dramas in larger fantasy/sci-fi worlds, it's doable, but I think you really need a good story to match. Ad Astra falls a little short of that goal, I found Brad Pitt's character to be mostly boring, being subdued and emotionless throughout the majority of the story. There were other characters that were more interesting, but they were quickly killed off in an almost off-handed manner before Pitt gets passed on to the next group of people, who then are also killed or otherwise disposed of.I definitely liked it though. I'm not a big sci-fi guy (unless you consider superhero movies sci-fi) and I went into this movie relatively blind (think I only saw one trailer) but it was fun. I would say it's a middle ground between hard sci-fi and more fantasy sci-fi, if that makes sense. Give it a go.(Also, the audience score on RT is at 48% for some reason. I really don't understand why. Maybe I'm missing something)",Ad Astra
370,garethwooduk,Brad Pitt on form,8,30 September 2019,"Very much enjoyed the movie, a space voyage across the universe.It kind of reminded me of Gravity, The Martian and strangely Blade Runner 2049, I liked the simplicity of the story with our main lead 'Roy McBride' looking for an answer to his past.Beautifully shot, delightful set pieces, captivating plot and Brad Pitt totally on point, great movie!",Ad Astra
371,AlbertCinefilu,There is a Fall that makes this movie both down-lifting and up-lifting,7,26 January 2021,"I know it's not the most talked about part but there was one scene in the beginning of ""Ad Astra"" where Brad Pitt's character, Roy, fell from the upper side of a space elevator for like 100 km through Earth's atmosphere. That scene and his symbolical fall to Earth made me feel both really frightened (I might have rediscovered my fear of heights) and eased at the same time, since I noticed his parachute.I felt eased because I thought that if you land successfully, one day you'll certainly fall again, maybe from a wall or a roof, but you might not have enough time to experience that shock or terror. Perhaps someone will also distract your attention from the fall. The symmetry between the beginning and the end will become more obvious in the end but I won't spoil anything here.Other than a message that I personally thought about but many people might not enjoy hearing, what is there left to praise? Well, the colour scheme serves its purpose and creates some pleasant-to-the-eye images and the cinematography is a journey in itself.
A limited amount of decent drama. Oh, and Brad Pitt's performance. That's most if not all, maybe I've missed some details.A 7,35 out of 10 from me.",Ad Astra
372,monberger,One man's mission...,9,29 October 2019,"First of all, let me say this, I was very skeptical about seeing this movie after reading all the bad reviews from the public. I can't see why a lot of people were dissatisfied with this film. This is not a movie for someone that loves action, and space gadgets. This is not for someone that wants more character development (several characters). This is definitely not for someone that is looking to be exceptionally thrilled with action and an enthralling storyline. I know and I get it. It's ok!!! However, this film has so many beautiful things! First of all, I want to say Brad Pitt's performance is one of the best I saw him perform. He is definitely the focus of this film. One man's redemption and coming in terms of unfinished relationship with his father and become at peace within himself for him to be able to care for people close to him. That was the beauty of this film. See Brad Pitt's performance in closed camera facial expressions and retelling of how he is feeling, sadness and sorrow on a mission to outer space. Beautiful cinematography and special effects are top-notch. The musical score is just perfect, beautifully encompassed with the film. I personally loved it! If you're a person that profoundly reflects on yourself and the purpose of life. This movie is for you!
One of the best films in 2019!",Ad Astra

374,helenbassett,Ad Astra Film Review - Director James Gray Directs Brad Pitt's Deep Philosophy Beyond The Dark Side Of The Moon And Towards The Stars,8,30 September 2019,"James Gray explored the Amazon in The Lost City Of Z and here in Ad Astra we explore Outer Space with Brad Pitt in command. But this is no galaxy far, far away, because in the near future outer space is only a ladder away, just above our heads, as Major Roy McBride is repairing a very long antenna on a space station. Just as a power surge sends his colleagues tumbling to earth. With vertiginous views Roy calmly shuts down the power and then is free falling himself as another surge hits. But as our heart rate increases, Roy stays very calm. And at just the right height he coolly releases his parachute, to land back on terra firma.When recovered Roy's debrief focuses on just how cool he is under pressure, his psychological evaluations are always perfect. Roy is committed to his career to the point he pushed his wife played by Liv Tyler away. So his life is not that perfect. And by the way we think your father is still alive. The same father who is a hero of Space Command and died 16 years ago. Clifford McBride, played by Tommy Lee Jones, was on the Lima mission to Neptune 30 years ago, to search for intelligent life. But Command believe he is actually still alive, and he is the one sending out the surges from the Neptune area. To destroy the Earth. That would be some story.Roy is the poster boy of space command with his Dad a big influence in his life. But a missing influence over the years, and with his attention piqued he is game to reconnect with him. James Gray imagines a journey to the Moon that is like a budget airline trip, Virgin Galactic but no Upper Class for our hero. Moon dust and pillows are extra. And the moon now colonised is like a Las Vegas weekend. A must visit. Donald Sutherland's Colonel Pruitt is waiting for him moon side, along for the ride as Clifford's old colleague.And space is beautiful, holding such a fascination for us, plus the recent excitement of the Moon landing anniversary. But outside the shining Strip are marauding pirates that attack the heavily armoured security detail, headed for the dark side of the moon. And shaking them off, our cool under pressure spaceman careers into the command base.Hitching a ride on his mission to Mars, Roy is a hero to the crew, and his Dad is legendary. Midway a distress call diverts them to a research ship with catastrophic results, but they eventually (almost) crash land on Mars, just as it is hit by another surge. Here Roy will send out his messages to Clifford, Command hoping he will respond to his son.Ruth Negga's Helen Lantos runs the base on Mars. A native martian, born there when her parents served with Clifford on the Lima Project, she needs to have a conversation with Roy about that! Not everything he has been told is correct, but maybe bent a little for appearance sake. And when Roy goes off script with his last message, his normally perfect psychological evaluation is rejected, and he is barred from taking the ship to Neptune. But Helen can get him on board. Although through no fault of his own, except coming on board I suppose, Roy creates a like father like son situation. It's all in the log he tells Command! And it is, but is Roy destined to follow his father?And for all that space is beautiful, it can also be a lonely place. A great place for introspection, but alone, and a bit boring, and with a very long journey ahead to search for Dad. I felt Roy's pain, and looking into Brad Pitt's eyes no one could feel any differently. The brightest star in the galaxy at the moment. Who and what is Roy flying towards? He gives us the voice over; his feelings and thoughts. What if there's nothing out there? Although Neptune is stunning, I didn't realise how beautiful this outer planet is, totally worth the ride, and there's a homecoming of sorts. But with all the time spent navel-gazing, is it time to focus on what is really here? There's no place like home. Instead of what might be out there.With startling cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema and Kevin Thompson, James Gray goes deep, Ad Astra isn't really a boy, or girls, own sci-fi adventure story, but it was Roy's story. Stripped bare. And through those lonely miles the Boy can shake off the lost years and finally become the Man.",Ad Astra
375,DunkelheitVZ,Not saying that this is a bad movie....,4,1 April 2020,".... because obviously a lot of effort went into creating it, but it is not my taste even though I like slow SF movies (Arrival and Interstellar are examples for movies that recently made my Top10).
On a realism level, there are too many mistakes and unrealistic events, on a story level, it is not interesting enough (it did not resonate with me), on a character level, this was way too surreal (for me).Beause of the surreal filming and events, because of the lack of realism, the movie never ever really immersed me.
Remember that all reviews reflect your own personal point of view. I think there are not ""bad"" or ""good"" movies, only movies who will resonate with a lot of people and movies who will only catch very few people.Unless you are in an experimental mood, do not try this movie, because most likely you won't enjoy it, but if you like artsy movies about father-son issues, check it out. It might very well be that I missed something.",Ad Astra
376,RolloTomasi,It works but...,3,27 March 2020,"...only if you watch it as a comedy. Seriously this would have worked as a space sort-of dramedy. I just had difficulty with so much about it. It made such an effort to set itself apart, to be different, that it just ended up being weird. Like a really nice looking Sci-Fi B-movie. The visuals are nice. That's all this thing has going for it. Pitt's character Roy McBride is only interesting because you're surprised at how Pitt would play such an uninteresting character. Some might say the character is ""nuanced."" I say ""boring.""What other film features a rover chase on the moon featuring laser guns? The last time we saw anything close to this was in Moonraker (Space Force?). And a psychotic, man-eating baboon on a spaceship. And what even was the point of that?The ending is even more bonkers. He floats back to his ship using a piece of hull from the Lima Project as a shield from the tiny meteors that make up Neptune's ring. And what was propelling him exactly? How was he able to control his trajectory? How did he steer? Of course he'd use the nuclear explosion to propel the ship away from Neptune.Who read this script and said: Let's do it! And why would Pitt want to do it? It certainly wasn't to show more of his acting range. Emotions barely register here, which was admittedly part and parcel to his character. But still. This thing was gonzo expensive to make. But hey it did seem to make money, at $85m against $132m in receipts worldwide.Good thing movie tickets are expensive these days.",Ad Astra

However, it did not, and the fact that the movie still had not established a compelling story and an objective, it felt extremely boring and predictable. The movie failed in all aspects regarding the story and the characters. It simply was another one of those philosophical dilemmas disguised as ""characters"" and ""relationships"" with the often accompanied abstract colourful scenes - this time with a space theme. The acting was abysmal except for the main character and despite its couple of attempts at dramatic and emotional moments - none of them were successful.It is extremely boring, meaningless, predictable and non-thrilling experience.",Ad Astra

The last sequence will draw chuckles it's so poorly contrived.Not the worst film by any means, just tries to come off as something not---realistic and thought provoking.

Several times throughout this fillem I said to myself, ""Epic."" Supersized cinema screen absolutely nailed the spectacle of big space.
SMALL SPOILERS BEGIN
The first and second acts lean more toward the science than the fiction. I'm not talking factual minutiae but concepts of where the human race might be with regard to space in the distant but not-too-distant future.

381,Mike_O_Dwyer,Stars Shine In Slight Story,7,20 September 2019,"James Gray's movies often feel like mood boards brought to life rather than something compelling, and while always watchable, if not just for the lush visuals, they can feel like a series of storyboarded highlights linked by look-at-me scene setting postcards.Pitt plays it cool in an if-this-then-that pragmatic way where emotions are sidelined in place of cold logic, which is understandable if not wholly relatable. Stuff goes wrong, Pitt deals with everything and his heartbeat rarely registers any variation. If the lead character doesn't feel threatened by dangerous situations then how does that register with the audience? Pitt's ponderous voice over suggests depth but mostly come across as too much navel-gazing.The story is slight, but Pitt's Roy McBride carries it with the assurance of someone who has the right stuff about him. He looks the part, as does Tommy Lee Jones as his absent father, Clifford, who sacrificed much for his work. For the majority of the movie we follow McBride as he makes his way from Earth to Neptune, but way of the Moon and Mars, to find out what's causing anti-matter surges that are affecting Earth. The greatest dangers on the journey are not so much travelling hundreds of millions of miles through space in a tin can, but other humans and their distrust, greed, paranoia, ineptitude. So, much like the idiots we have to deal with in the here and now.My son (14) summed it up best when he said there were bits he'd give 10/10 and other bits 1/10 and other bits 7/10, he really didn't know what to make of it but overall he enjoyed it.I don't think he's far off. It's enjoyable, with some thrills and good actors doing the business. It's just missing a spark of originality that would push it to the next level.",Ad Astra
382,Exiled_Universe,An amazing space adventure!,8,21 February 2020,"Well before seeing this movie i knew it was going to be similar to gravity but not to expect much from this. Well now after seeing it i can say that all the good parts happened in the first 30 mins and after that its all just Brad Pit on his own trying to find his father. So the story is very simple yet can be very complicated at times, for example, he does some pretty dangerous things to try to find his father like sneaking onto a ship and killing everyone on it and even fighting someone whilst doing it which was pretty cool and it was the first time i ever saw someone fight in space. Now i personally liked the story and i thought it was basic and it was OK. There really is no characters other than Brad Pit, i mean there is a few other characters that pop up here and there but for the most part its just him on his adventure to find his dad and getting into all these messes on the way of doing it. The cinematography is another thing which i liked but i thought it could have been better at times. See when it comes to movies like this, one of the big things is the way space is portrayed and captured and also the shots of it. This movie does an ok job at doing this, now the genre for the movie changes i feel like at times. Sometimes it feels scary, then its action, then its suspense, its a pretty cool thing the way it all blends in together. The overall acting by Brad Pit and some other characters are good as well. Now like i said after the first 30 mins there really is no other good parts after that i mean there is maybe 2 or 3 other short little parts that happened here and there after that but like i said other than that its just Brad Pit by his lone. Some cuts were really cool like at one point instead of a cut the camera just shifted over which was something new yet also very very cool. SO overall i really liked this movie and its not like and action movie like most of us thought in the trailer but in the end it really pays off! 💕😊👌",Ad Astra

Don't get me wrong, it's a movie that feels long on purpose and expects you to be patient. I went in prepared, so to me it felt almost medidative.This is owed first and foremost to the great soundtrack, the grandious visuals and the brilliant cinematography. It's obvious a lot of passionate and visually gifted people were at work here, as this movie is simply beautiful to look at. The atmosphere of space, emptiness, coldness and loneliness has seldomely been better put to film.But space is only an allegory for the emptiness, coldness and loneliness of the main character Roy McBride played by Brat Pitt. The story depicts him dealing with his emotional void and his trip to find his father as a desperate attempt to reignite his own humanity. Pitt does a great subtle job portraying a technical mind seperated from his emotions.There are some goofy scenes, the screenplay doesn't quite hit the mark it's aiming for and it takes almost as many liberties with physics as ""Gravity"". As such it falls short of compareable movies like ""Odyssey 2001"" and ""Interstellar"". I still enjoyed it for what it is: A beautiful movie.",Ad Astra

Early on we learn that the whole solar system is at risk from these incredible waves of energy that emanate from Neptune. What's causing them? Well, evidently the mystery will be explained somewhere in the movie (it will won't it?).I'm imagining that whatever is going on up there on Neptune is going to be pretty god damn special. Some kind of MASSIVE BASE with huge particle accelerators the size of a planet. Some kind of gigantic black-hole machine that Tommy Lee Jones has hijacked and is using to create a intergalactic portal. Must be right?Nope. Just Tommy floating in orbit in a tiny ship. Do we at least see him dabbling on this tiny ship with some source of unimaginable power. Nah. He's just watching old movies and talking about aliens. What the heck were the screen-writers thinking?! Apparently they decided by that point that the ""power surge"" plotline was just too difficult to explain. Better just pretend that it was never introduced. Maybe try and focus on the father-son relationship and hope the audience doesn't notice.All we see on the side of the ship is some blue sparkly thing. Is this paltry blue sparkle the source of solar-system-destroying power? Was Tommy doing it on purpose? Was it some weird accident? Who knows. Best not to ask.

But, having the core elements of masterpiece stories doesn't make the movie perfect: there were at least 2 outer space shots that I found weren't really appropriate for an ambitious space movie and the anti-climactic ending that is completely non-sense especially for scientists; physicists; astronauts; science and space enthusiasts; and sci-fi fans all over the world.

The plot actually progresses at a brisk pace with many tense moments, while still slowing down at times to take in certain situations or information we hear, as well as to allow as to consider the underlying emotions experienced. It is thus definitely not a mindless adventure as it explores deep topics of family and abandonment in a very real and accessible way.The visual effects are stunning, showing us a world that is at time gorgeous and at times disgusting, just like a human civilization in space would probably look like.While the script might not be the best ever, Pitt pulls it off with his charisma and immense presence with one of his career best performances.Another strong point is the world building, as civilization here seems just like you would imagine it to be, a logical extension of the world we live in, with very familiar issues.The biggest criticism I see is regarding the science of it. As someone who generally doesn't loss much sleep thinking about radio waves and how one would send a message to the far side of Neptune, I don't see this as a problem, especially considering the things we accepted in previous epic sci-fi outings, so I don't see this as a problem.

Nevertheless, no one (and nothing) in the movie explained why that cause makes such phenomenon. The drama part of the story is even much worse and it was treated with exactly the same bizarre and unprofessional way, but there is not even a clue why the drama ended like the way it did. Simply put: it is a meaningless struggle between a father and a son both of which suffer from severe degree of social phobia.

Brad Pitt does a fine job portraying a depressed man, Roy McBride, who is grappling with his failed marriage and the absence of his father, a legendary space explorer played by Tommy Lee Jones, for most of his life. But the character is written as someone so emotionally detached and distant from everyone in the universe-supposedly a requirement for his risky occupation as an astronaut-that it is a detriment to the movie's ability to tell a compelling story. Why they bothered to cast an actress as famous as Liv Tyler as his estranged wife is beyond me, as she is barely seen or heard. Tyler has had more screen time in Aerosmith videos. Ruth Negga and Donald Sutherland are also only in one or two scenes, so two more good actors seem wasted in near-cameos. The film might have spent more time showing McBride in his wrecked marriage or work relationships to explore his emotional and psychological damage, and less on the space action thriller scenes that everyone chatters about. But what annoyed me the most about this film was the director's decision to use so much voice-over throughout; he feels the need to hammer all the social and philosophical ""messages"" he wants you, poor, stupid, thick-headed audience member, to get, because you are not capable of realizing the point through subtle characterization or compelling narrative (which this movie doesn't have). One does get the feeling that the director watched ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" over and over when he was growing up, but this movie doesn't compare.",Ad Astra

What makes this movie different is how intimate it is. Most of this movie is just Brad Pitt's character and his emotional journey. It isn't an epic movie about humans reaching the next level of evolution; it's a movie about a guy confronting his pain and his isolation from the world.This movie also has incredible cinematography and special effects, and it deserves to be seen on the absolute biggest screen possible with the highest picture quality possible. Brad Pitt also gives one of the best performances of his career, and Tommy Lee Jones is great in the small part that he is in. With that being said, I will refrain from giving this movie a score until I see it again.",Ad Astra
397,benjaminweber,Good intentions do not equal good execution,4,21 September 2019,"I was disappointed by this movie. It fails to deliver a coherent character arc for the protagonist despite being a character based film. It attempts to have multiple subplots that end in simplistic and mutually contradictory ways. If you can't write an ending that ties up all subplots in a satisfactory manner, drop some of the subplots.The visual effects and overall visual presentation in this movie are good, but there are also scenes that feel like they're there so the film can be falsely presented as an action blockbuster in marketing. There are overlooked details, like the gravity on the Moon, so obvious that they ruin the immersion in the movie.Overall, this film had potential, and credit has to be given for trying to create a more complex film in today's age of mass-market reboots and sequels. However, it failed to do so, and several scenes scream studio interference (not a surprise in hindsight, given the Mouse delaying the release of the movie after a hostile takeover of 20th Century Fox).",Ad Astra

Then he begins to act on pure emotion to come face to face with his father. And for a little extra ambiance both men must have spent copious amounts of time in isolation in reflection of who they have become. Throw in one whacked out monkey, some cardboard cutout astronauts and start your long journey to the outer solar system. BTW both men end up with kinda, but not really, large body counts on their hands.
You say: That's okay, I want to see sprawling views of the vastness of space with awesome SFX...no such luck, you mostly see glimpses of space in the background and a constant close up of Brad Pitt. If Brad Pitt isn't in the shot, it got left on the cutting room floor. Now it gets 5 stars for not pandering to the audience, a good performance by Pitt, who only seems to pick quieter characters nowadays .
anyway., an interesting take on where humanity is at this time and what it thinks about, and I liked the fact that the Solar system has some, not a lot, but some activity going on. I can't imagine watching this after putting the kids to bed, because it will put you in a deep sleep for sure. The overall tone and activity of the characters reminds me so much of Solaris its palpable. I know Science Fiction isn't cheap, but I don't see how 200 millon dollars was spent on this film, and even more perplexing is WHO greenlit that budget...just the premise alone would nullify that expenditure.

410,Metaflix,Drastically Lower Your Expectations (And I.Q.) - Metaflix Review,5,21 September 2019,"""Below the surface, there was nothing.""This quote from the movie pretty much sums it all up. To say that 'Ad Astra' failed to meet our astronomically high expectations would be a cosmically vast understatement. Let's put it this way: you know there's a massive problem with the film when serious action sequences are drawing laughter from the audience. We couldn't laugh. We were too offended by the ridiculousness of it all.To put it plainly, 'Ad Astra' has some of the most absurdly unrealistic scenes of any space movie we've seen. If you know anything about physics, botany, nutrition, astronomy, or just about any other branch of science, 'Ad Astra' will make your brain hurt.Add to this the fact that the plot, production design, and cinematography are all quite horrid, and we've got ourselves a classic Razzie situation on our hands, people. Oh, and just one more thing: several media outlets have labelled the film ""one of the best space movies in years."" Saying as much is a gross injustice to last years criminally underrated 'First Man' (where apparently there are space pirates with Star Wars blasters roaming around)!",Ad Astra
411,LUIS,With impossible things.,7,13 September 2020,There are two things impossible in this sci-fi space travel movie where Brad Pitt saves the world. The first is how he is able to travel quietly through space only with his spacesuit and without a ship. The second is how after traveling to and even Neptune he keeps his hair totally clean.,Ad Astra
412,Lost_In_Translation_,"Visually Stellar, Story muddled by pointless beats",6,20 September 2019,"I was extremely excited for this movie mostly due to the cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema. I've been a fan of his since he blew me away with the visuals in Spike Jones' Her. Spectre was a mess of a movie, but the cinematography was amazing. He then became Nolan's man after Wally Pfister left and he was a perfect replacement for him.The director of this is one I wasn't familiar with, but the cinematographer and Brad Pitt had me intrigued. Sadly those two are the best aspects of the movie.I did enjoy the world building of an Earth where commercial space travel to the Moon and Mars. The space travel was well realized.Visually it is top notch. I rarely ever thought anything was CG as it looked phenomenal. The mood of being in space was captured like what I imagine the feeling is. Hoytema does what he does well and his visuals really are the star of the show.Brad Pitt does well with the material and elevates it from the mediocrity it is. This movie is about isolation and he plays it well. The narration of his did drone a little. It's good at times, then others its just weird whispering. It reminds me of the tacked on original Blade Runner theatrical narration that just added nothing.What really brings the movie down is the story beats they decide to add to the plot. It's a simple plot. Brad Pitt's character is sent ona mission to send a message to his father who has been missing for 30 years. On the way there are little bits of story added that try to add more going on, but they really just feel like filler. Especially a scene where during the flight to Mars they stop to attend to a distress signal of a research vessel with animals on board. It adds nothing to the plot and just felt like a filler.Donald Sutherland's character felt like he was supposed to be more important, but he exits the movie 15 mins in, only giving Pitt a small bit of intel that was obvious to the viewer anyways.Gravity did a fantastic job of making a simple story interesting and complex. Ad Astra seems like it's trying to do that, but they just add filler scenes to add more depth to the story that doesn't need it.The ending just felt so rushed and really didn't get it's message across very well either. It's got a moment where you should have big emotions, but it just happens so quickly that there is no time to take it in.This one was overall a disappointment. It's worth seeing for the visuals alone and a solid Pitt. The story just gets too convoluted for what should have been a simple story about a father and son with a lost relationship separated by light-years. Not an awful movie, just a misguided one that could have been so much better. I'm still a fan of Hoytema and I hope he keeps making movies as good looking as this, maybe hopefully just something on the level of Her or Dunkirk.",Ad Astra

More than many science fiction films, Ad Astra feels like it really is taking place in the vastness of the solar system. The film is always engaging as it takes viewers farther away from Earth.

But Ad Astra just couldn't be told in two hours...and it wasn't. The problem began with the writer and the director being the same person: there's no one around to say, ""Uh, Jim, this isn't working."" Then there is the problem of the first person narrative. If the protagonist is the storyteller, then every bit of his narrative must be included, or we won't understand, much less appreciate, his story. In Ad Astra, Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) - a cool, analytical individual - has a lot to say - to himself if not anyone else. Unfortunately, two hours just wasn't long enough to say it, so the audience is denied a lot of what has compelled him to accept his mission. A good third-party director would have raised the questions. It may have resulted in a longer script, but, on balance, it would have been a better one.",Ad Astra
416,FabledGentleman,"This is not how ""Space Works""",5,25 September 2019,"This movie was a massive disappointment. If you know anything about how ""space works"", you might not want to see this film. If you see this movie as pure sci-fi and ignore all the physics and science in it, well then i guess a lot of the stuff that happens can be ignored. But this movie tries very hard to seem real, to be plausible, and it does not come off as a pure sci-fi where anything goes.For example G-forces seem to be completely eliminated in this film. Not even in Nolans ""Interstellar"" were G-forces ignored, and the physics in his movie was pushed to the utter extreme.But it's not only physics that is ignore in Ad Astra, it's a lot more.For example. The chance that Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus were aligned so that Roy could make a close pass on his way to Neptun, is near zero. Yes you could pick a year in the future where these four planets would be perfect for such a flight, but the odds that they are when this story needs to happen, is near zero. Roy passes the planet's just because it says so in the script, and the script is written by someone who does not know how space works.To be fair, this movie starts really well. The scene with the Space Antenna is really awesome. But the antenna itself is useless, radio waves does not stop in space, so we don't need to build a massive antenna like this to listen for alien life. Even if we did, building satellites would be insanely cheaper. They should have had a Space elevator instead.And using A nuclear + Antimatter explosion as propellant.. Yes this is stuff that does happen in Star Trek movies, but i could not stop shaking my head as i saw these things, as this movie does not seem to know if it's sci-fi or if it wants to come off as plausible.What about entering a rocket during launch?Flying through an asteroid belt around a planet with a small shield?Stopping and starting rockets in space? They even know how much fuel is needed to regain the speed they had before stopping? Hint: You need insane amounts of fuel.Matter Anti-Matter chain reaction? NO, that is not how anti-matter works. When anti-matter hits matter, they are both annihilated and they explode with enormous force, but they do not multiply like a nuclear bomb. It was painful that the entire plot of this movie rely in this huge mistake from the writers. The plot of the movie is that the entire universe could be wiped out in a chain reaction from this explosion, that is why they send a nuclear bomb to Neptun, to blow Project Lima up. So blowing up matter and antimatter is safe, but if it's not blown up it will cause chain reaction and wipe out the entire solar system?Ehm.. ok..I could go on about mistakes really, there are plenty more. And it just kept me from enjoying the underlying message. This movie does have good tension all the way through accompanied with some really atmospheric music. A lot of the acting is very good, the cinematography is beautiful, and the cgi is great.But the science and physics completely fails in this movie. And it makes it impossible for me to enjoy it. It might be a lot better for those that completely ignore all the mistakes, or for those that don't know how ""space works"".",Ad Astra

I do love movies set in the near-future, though, and the space stuff was great, with commercial rockets to the Moon, with a giant base with a DHL and Subway, and then a rocket to Mars, all presented in a believable manner. But I never really cared about the characters or their journey, and the entire thing heaved with a gravity I think was too artificially cerebral for me to care much about or become too invested in.

Existential or moralising? Immediate reaction after seeing the movie was more inclined towards the latter ones, thought I might review this judgement after sleeping over it.
Definitely, for being a movie which position itself as ""hard sci-fi"", Ad Astra contains a significant number of scientific imprecisions: travelling to Mars in 19 days and to Neptune in 79 days won't happen in the ""near future"" (as stated at the beginning of the movie).

The only suspension of disbelieves you need are the ""surge"", the use of antimatter, and that Neptune is in fact well within the Heliopause so the scientific claim of escaping the influence of solar wind does not hold.We follow the journey of Brad Pitt the protagonist, where everywhere he goes he encounters the greatest mishaps and gets to save the day. The greatest disappointments come toward the end, when you realise the deep morale this movie alludes to convey all along is as simple as ""love your family more"". While it is an important message, but for a 100 million production, this is supremely underwhelming and shallow.

Unfortunately the story is so bad that ""Bill and Ted"" writers could have made the science more realistic. Until science fiction films are directed by people who love science, we will suffer more instances of films in which ""science fiction"" is confused with ""fictional science"".

I was put off by some of the ill-considered special effects, for example, a chase scene on the lunar surface, kicking up moon dust all over the place. Moon dust is like shards of glass and razors, you would not want this stuff fouling up your machinery. That said, and similarly to many others, I'm a fan of Brad Pitt, but he is not playing a character you will recognize here. The film is based almost entirely on inner dialogue, and it is slow moving and painfully deliberative. So things proceed slowly, and we're mostly listening in on the main character's conflicted and indecisive thoughts. I could just barely stand to watch it to the unsatisfying and (to me) incomprehensible finish. This, sadly, is a really bad movie.",Ad Astra

We should forget all our singlemindedness to look out for that special friendship or that unique utopia where we hope to find happiness. There is no one out there looking out for us or anyone calling out for us, dying to make contact. We are all alone perched in this cold place called Universe. Deal with it.We are stranded on this big (or rather small) blue marble floating in space with no intelligent life forms for light-years away. Rather than building a wall around us, between our family members, between nations and diversions that divide us, we should concentrate on building bridges.This science-fiction adventure film is supposed to be set in the new future, but my guess is that it is not going to be that close. The movie is set at a time when space tourism is mainstream. Travelling to the Moon is akin to flying on a low-cost flight - passengers pay for their face towels!Major Roy McBride is an astronaut who lives in a world troubled with frequent power surges. The Space Command (Aeronautical Agency) thinks it is related to an abandoned space mission which is stranded in planet Neptune. The said spacecraft was led by McBride's father. Even though he is hailed as a hero, his whereabouts are unknown. McBride is sent on a secret mission to Neptune to explore the 'empty' capsule. Insider information reveals that McBride Sr may still be alive.Roy, a loner throughout his life, grew up in the shadows of his father's laurels but without his presence. Perhaps of the longing for father issues and his single-heartedness in excel in space exploration, Roy was never close his now estranged wife.
The journey is a soul searching expedition of sorts for Major Roy McBride, especially now that he is a passenger. He looks at the 'world' around him, the life that he had led and about life generally.After slashing and mutilating all the resources on Earth, humans had already turned Moon into another touristy spot. With so development and concrete buildings, it just looks like another colony in the Wild West, even complete with moon mobile highway robbers, just like how the trains were robbed during the Californian gold rush era.In the movie, religiosity seems to have made a comeback. The question of the dead, being stranded in space, being part of the cosmos, like going back to the Maker, if the Maker was indeed out there, is accepted in everyday life.The answers, as the protagonist soon discovers, are all here on Earth. It lies with us and amongst our loved ones. We are all that we got, for each other.",Ad Astra

443,babybuletgani,As McBride is told in the debriefing session,10,25 October 2019,"As McBride is told in the debriefing session, the explosion came as part of a worldwide power surge caused by cosmic ray bursts arriving from Neptune. But this is seemingly no accident; 29 years earlier, a mission called the Lima Project - led by our hero's own astronaut father, Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) - set off for the same planet on an exploratory trip to seek out new life.
Described by Roy as a ""pioneer"", McBride Sr. was the first man to reach Jupiter and Saturn, but has not been heard from in years and was presumed dead. Now, the government is convinced he's behind the power surges. McBride Jr.'s mission is to head to Mars, the last manned outpost in our solar system, where he can reach a secure transmission facility in an attempt to send his dad a message. Initially, McBride must travel on a commercial flight to the Moon. Joining him is Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), who will chaperone him to a rocket bound for Mars. Amusingly, their flight is operated by Virgin - it seems Richard Branson's desire for space travel came true after all, although McBride is charged $125 for a ""blanket-and-pillow pack"" to make his trip more comfortable.
When they make it to the Moon - which has been grossly commercialised, t-shirt vendors and all - Pruitt and McBride head to the Mars rocket. In buggies, they're chased down by pirates in a staggering sequence that fully takes into account the physics of the Moon's gravity. Yet there is much more to come as McBride travels to the Red Planet, beautifully visualised by Gray and his DoP, Hoyte Van Hoytema (Dunkirk). Pitt's voiceover interjects throughout, as he muses on his troubled relationship with his father, absent for all of his adult life, and on his wife Eve (Liv Tyler), who shimmers in his memories. The obvious forebear is apocalypse now, with Tommy Lee Jones' ""legend"" the out-of-this-world equivalent to Marlon Brando's Kurtz.
After a potent mid-film turn from Ruth Negga as McBride's contact on Mars, who has her own personal interest in the Lima Project, the emotional chords are struck deeply in the final act, where Gray lays bare the old adage about the son suffering the sins of the father. Best of all, following his fine work in once upon a time, Pitt is on sensational form with the most mature performance of his career. Could it be time for his first acting Oscar?",Ad Astra

It also neatly ends the myth of American exceptionalism, by example of the horrid and plain - plain and horrid existence of the ""military elite"" of the US Space force here.Roy is a perfect corporate citizen of a spacefaring civilisation, his life is also perfectly hollow and meaningless, as the lives of the people he's surrounded with, - which is why a lot of viewers complained about how they ""couldn't emotionally connect"" with the protagonist.Roy's father is a secret service G-man, who always are a character mix of opportunists, idealists and children in the same person - he is someone who was sent on the mission of ""glory"" on behalf of a government which has forgottent the meaning of the said mission, and has transformed itself during; or even before his mission into a shell company for the corporations mismanaging the earth.Not a lot of realistic prose or movies were made about the three-letter-agency G-men - no, no movies actually show that the influence of all secret services worldwide is 100% negative - there was literally never anything good to come out of the three letter agencies of the whole world - but the profiteers of the endless war want you to believe otherwise. This is probably the first movie among the
3000 or so movies I have seen, to deal with the issue head on and realistically and portray people for who they really are (and who they are, in real life is very ugly 100% of the time).The movie, unfortunately, is too subtle for most to be understood, most people, again unfortunately, need unambigous morality tales to understand a message out in the open.

The setting of the three respective stories only lends atmosphere, emotion, and a sense of impending danger to the real story: a younger man on a quest to find an older man who may be dangerous, and who may be mad, but who compels and inspires and intrigues the hero. The similarities continue, but the differences are significant enough to make this a completely new film.While it has its share of action, it's not an action flick, nor is it really an adventure film (although adventure is had). It is rather the journey of a man from the solitude of his own heart through actual solitude and into... well, no spoilers here.Visually it is beautiful. The monologue in the voiceovers contains some wonderful philosophical nuggets. Each character that comes and goes in the life of the hero is well acted and poignant and meaningful, but essentially it is a solo act and Brad Pitt caries it magnificently.Sadly, it may not be a film that all will enjoy, but those who do enjoy it will enjoy it immensely.",Ad Astra

Ignore those who trashed the movie. They were looking for something else, like an Ocean's 11 or a Thelma and Louise.

It seems to be... Don't go anywhere; just come back. Nowhere to go but back in the womb to wait out these new dark ages where audiences can be assumed to know not even the basics of science and space travel... a dark twenty first century world where we don't need to bother giving the audience some kind of actual message, or reason for watching.No, really: After we read all the very bad reviews here and a couple of good ones from Ebert and the Times we decided it may be worth watching and making up our own minds. Throughout the movie we were both fighting to make the movie work for us, figuring out where this can be going... we even thought, because the rockets and space travel and such details were totally infantile, maybe the whole thing was a hallucination of the protagonist... maybe in the end Brad was not really an astronaut but an inmate in the funny farm and he was dreaming this thing-up, but no. He really was supposed to be an astronaut and it is in fact, according to this movie, quite easy to stow away on a rocket during blast-off.My wife was relieved that I was the first, when the end credits rolled, to use the scientific definition, in Latin, for this Latin-titled opera: Bool Sheettus Maximus.What's the point of praising the acting and the effects and visuals? Didn't the actors, and the technicians, have a hint, a clue, that they were making a whole lot of nothing? A space opera empty-as-space of any meaning, message or thoughts.

Then there's a discussion about outposts on the moon and mars. These two items alone tell the audience that we're way into the future.Roy's job outside on the spacecraft type antennae tower gets interrupted by a power surge from space, they believe near the planet Neptune, causing part of the antenna to collapse, killing someone, and sending Roy falling from space back to Earth. Entering the more massive atmosphere his parachute finally opens. However, the chute gets punctured from pieces of the collapsing antenna and McBride cashes to the ground.A theme throughout the film is McBride's mental and physical state. His heart rate never goes above 80 bpm, even during the fall, and his responses to the questions about his psychological state are monitored by a machine. Approval by the machine voice is required for him to continue his missions. We see him sit down with the computer multiple times. Because he's the only one we see takes these tests, I wondered if others had to take these tests as well.After the initial accident, which was there to prove his mental, physical, and mettle to solve problems and that he has real guts, he heals and is called into a meeting with senior NASA and government officials.In this meeting, we learn that the government believes that the Lima Project, which was headed to Neptune and led by Roy's father H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), may be causing the power surges and destroying Earth. They also believe that the senior McBride is still alive although, in Roy's mind, his father is dead.They want Roy to help them locate his father or the ship they were using so that they can send another ship, near Neptune, and destroy what is sending the power surges back towards Earth.This is the premise of the story: Will Roy find his father alive? Is Clifford creating the power surges? Will Roy and his father make amends for all of the senior McBride's absence in Roy's life? Will the team be able to stop the power surges that are threatening Earth's existence?Roy wants to be an integral part of the final mission to Neptune, but he's not given a chance so he steals aboard the ship to Neptune and will confront his ever-absent father.However, the film has multiple events and circumstances that do not make sense. One such set of facts is while on the moon and being transported from one base to a rocket launch base, Roy and Pruitt (Donald Sutherland) are attacked by pirates in other moon rovers. My question is where did these pirates come from? Where did they live? And, why was this scene needed? It seemed like they needed some action in the middle of the film so this is what the story used.Pitt was great. There's an integrated quality he brings to the character that made me believe, he loved what he did and was able to do it expertly and dispassionately. Ruth Negga (as Helen Lantos) was excellent as someone who supports Pitt on his journey. Sutherland as Thomas Pruitt, a friend of Clifford McBride and Roy's guardian during part of the trip, was okay, but I'm not sure the role was needed. Jones was engaging and entertaining in this role as someone who only cared about his mission and learning if there is life beyond our solar system. James Gray and Ethan Gross wrote, and script that languished while hoping the philosophical concepts the story proposes will make the story engaging. Unfortunately, it doesn't entirely fill the bill. Gray also directed this film, and although it seems he borrowed heavily from some of the pictures presented in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it fell short of being as engaging.Overall: This movie was entertaining enough to keep me present, but lacked enough depth to make me really want more.",Ad Astra

470,mbrahms26,Ad Astra Per Nausea,2,9 October 2019,"I knew right away that this film was going off the rails when in order to save the Solar System Brad Pitt had to go to Mars via the Moon so he can send a laser directed message to his deranged father in orbit around Neptune. Then he arrives on the Moon in what appears to be an airline terminal with people walking around in Earth, not lunar, gravity. Then he has to travel to the Dark Side of the Moon to get to the Mars rocket, but not before space pirates (?) attack his escort and kill everyone save him and the old geezer who for some unexplained reason needs to be his companion. The old geezer then drops dead from a coronary, so Brad goes to Mars without him. He gets there, but not before he encounters a ferocious beast while he and the captain answer a distress call. The captain is mauled to death, so Brad has to land the rocket himself when the co-pilot panics. BTW, a trip from the Moon to Mars would take weeks, not a few days. Then on Mars there is more Earth gravity and he sends Daddy the message. Brad learns that a ""deep space"" mission is about to launch from Mars to kill his Dad and destroy his orbiting lab, which is shooting anti-matter cosmic rays (?) all over the Solar System, which are causing massive power outages on Earth and elsewhere. In actuality, anti-matter cosmic rays hitting the atmosphere would cause massive nuclear explosions that would wipe out life on Earth. But I digress. Brad sneaks on board the ship as it is launching (!) and quickly kills all three crew members in self-defense. Even if the ship were traveling a million miles an hour, it would take over four months to get from Mars to Neptune, but once again Brad does it in a few days, since of course time is of the essence with the survival of humanity at stake! No spoilers for a bit, except that what goes on at Neptune violates plot coherence and, of course, the laws of nature. Brad comes home, his ship propelled out of orbit around Neptune by a huge explosion elsewhere that would only shower his vessel with photons and pieces of the destroyed object that would probably wreck the ship! Of course, the 2.7 billion mile trip home takes no more time than would be required for Brad to need a shave. The only saving grace to this insult to the intelligence of intelligent people are the special effects and cinematography.",Ad Astra
471,yada2121,"PER ASPERA AD ASTRA...aka through hardships, to the stars",8,16 November 2020,"Today, I observed Ad Astra on a sign on the wall of the suit-up room at Kennedy Soace Center while watching the SpaceX Crew 1 launch. That reminded me that I had marked this film on HBO Max for watching at a later date. So I decided to watch it today. It turned out to be exactly what I had predetermined it to be though, a movie long on special effects and not very intellectually interesting. One of those films that leaves way too much to the viewers' imagination as to the theme being portrayed. Only after watching a couple of critical reviews online, did I start to understand this movie. I found it interesting enough to want to figure out the story I had just seen. So I watch several critical review videos. One critic points out concept of what I also believe to be one of the seminal science fiction movies, 2001: A Space Odyssey. That what E.T. looks like is not as important as the description of the human experience hat takes place during the search. Or, space exploration without any preconceived notions about what you may find.Too many sci-if stories are about ""the search for extraterrestrial life"". Life that could be either friendly or very unfriendly. I've always considered antagonistic alien depictions to be more about scaring the viewer or reader of the story, kind of like horror stories. The very best scI-fi stories, in my opinion, leaves the concept of what alien life is and what it is about completely up to ones' imagination. Because I happen to believe that if there really is extraterrestrial life out there, then it likely will not be bi-pedal, or humanoid, or mammalian, or even lizard-like. Even Little Green Men are most likely too humanistic a concept to be realistic.Instead, I agree with those who interpret this movie to be about considering the human psychological analysis of the question of extraterrestrial life. How finding, or alternatively not finding it could affect humanity. What would such a profound discovery, or the realization that we are truly alone in this universe mean for humanity? Like most movies, I tend to think of its impact as a study of the affect the experience has on us, or the way it changes our thinking about things. Instead of a movie or it's backstory being purposed to scare us, they should make us think. To think about the unthinkable. Or, open our minds to previously unconsidered possibilities. And not just about finding new ways to scare us, as most of the horror genre seems to be about.AD ASTRA THEN, can be seen as a exploration of the consequences that such contemplations have one us. How our lives might be changed by an encounter with extraterrestrial life. Or, alternatively, by reaching the conclusion that there is nothing else out there in the universe. Again, the special effects are interesting, the characters, as vaguely defined as they are, both present an air of mystery for the viewer that is more thoughtfully provocative than shocking or awe-inspiring. So, in that regard this is a good movie. Not great, but good enough to watch. Had I written the crypt though, I would have explored the renewed personal relationship between the Brad Pitt and Liv Tyler characters to create a less mysterious ending to the story line.",Ad Astra
472,pranay_misra,Underrated movie,7,10 December 2019,"People are slamming as they did not get great action scenes or anything nearer to Gravity or Armageddon. But this movie is more about a Son going on a journey to connect with his long lost father in outer space. Movie makes u feel for him as he slowly descends on his journey and comes to know about the truth about his father. Not a person to debate on science but few scenes looked bit illogical. Also after great first half, expected more from proceedings from second half but felt little let down. But still it is a better effort then many other space movies.

473,uroshnor54,If only it was as deep as it is beautiful,6,13 October 2019,"Ad Astra is a good looking movie but I don't think it really says anything interesting or new. All the stuff about humans perpetually fighting over resources and letting their drive to make new discoveries make them lose sight of what they already have is already in other movies. The question of what the motivations of Tommy Lee Jones's character are is what will keep the viewer interested, but when they're revealed they just aren't compelling enough, or at least, I didn't think they were.I will say, I like that there wasn't any forced humor in this. I like that it took itself seriously. So many movies these days have unnecessary humor these days, maybe because that makes critics and audiences pull their punches.Ad Astra was kind of a disappointment. As someone who thinks superhero movies are for children and dislikes how a greater percentage of blockbuster movies these days are superhero movies, I'm inclined to give big budget, adult, non-superhero sci-fi movies a watch because I want more to be made. (My favorite movie is Blade Runner, just so you know where I'm coming from.) But they need to be a better than this. I've read reviews comparing Ad Astra to 2001: A Space Odyssey and Solaris, but those are far superior. If you're a sci-fi fan, you'll have seen those already. If you're not and you haven't, and you don't mind movies that require a bit of patience, give them a shot.",Ad Astra

476,BestBenedikt,The psychology of exploration,9,24 September 2019,"""Now we know we're all we've got.""Aaand there we go! Finally a truly magnificent film in the cinematic year of 2019. James Gray doesn't only provide us with some of the most beautiful shots lately, but also with a masterful and thoughtful entry in the sci-fi genre that broadens the scope of its conventions.The main story evolves around astronaut Roy McBride and the classified search for his father somewhere around Neptune. Gray explores the human urge for discovery in a way we've rarely seen it before and strikes out on new paths with his portrayal of a man emotionally estranged from humanity because of his distanced, determined and always professional acting father.Though I thoroughly enjoyed INTERSTELLAR, AD ASTRA prevails where Nolan's sci-fi blockbuster fails: the protagonist's characterisation. While McConaughey's Cooper was definitely a character written for the screen with some heavy-handed emotions, Roy McBride feels like a totally real person - and Brad Pitt plays the role in such a credible and subdued way it was a joy to watch and probably his best acting to date. There seems to be a surprising amount of people though, who call the film emotionless and stale - something I absolutely disagree on. I would even go as far as saying that some viewers simply didn't get the film or at least went in with wrong expectations.AD ASTRA deals with the human impulse to explore in such a psychological and emotional way, it might even be a modern sci-fi masterpiece. Now I definitely need to watch THE LOST CITY OF Z and James Gray's previous films.",Ad Astra

478,TruView,"Emphasizes the importance of Human Connection in the loneliest of places, SPACE",7,19 March 2021,"...is a deeply moving cinematic experience about an astronaut whose arrested development as a man finally continues after reconnecting with his father who was thought to have been lost on a deep space mission decades ago.Five minutes in, the movie shifts into high gear as a global power surge threatens Humanity. Major Roy McBride, following in his father's footsteps, is now an astronaut aboard the International Space Antennae somewhere in the upper atmosphere. He is affecting routine checks and repairs when the unthinkable happens. It establishes him as a decisive and very capable asset/member displaying a presence of mind unparalleled.Many thought the film itself was too slow-paced, but I think this was due to the grandiose score that accompanied a rich spread of breathtaking footage of our little blue planet along with a couple of others. It teases what outbound human colonization might look like on both the moon and Mars. Anyone who (like me) is intimately familiar with vast sums of astronomy articles, facts, and figures will appreciate the true value of this film; which was so richly fortified with pertinent details and information. You begin to gain a sense of the kind of people it will take to traverse the void between the stars.Throughout the whole experience of viewing this picture, it dawns on you just how fortunate we really are to be THE single breathe of consciousness in terms of cosmological timescales; that as we venture upward and outward, the ties that bind us become ever more important.

Moon surface, Mars surface, rockets and otherwise spatial equipment are visually credible and realistic. Not so much about physics though, but one can accept this nonsense as mere scifi/dramatization.
Now the story. What story? It is more of a opiniated lecture about how space exploration is allegedly pointless and only perpetuating human flaws at a larger scale.
This movie clearly shows how little imagination those filmmakers have. Who cares if there is no extraterrestrial life? How does that make space exploration less interesting or valuable?
Those guys went to great length just to explain they prefer to stay at home with the wife and kids.

It was unpredictable - which is something that I really like, and which is something really rare on the modern films. Acting wasn't bad, camera work wasn't bad, special effects were good.The thing I didn't liked - there was not enough drama, not even during the father-son meeting after 30 years of absence. I'm pointing at the drama, because obviously the idea behind this film was the human race and it's own survival, the human nature and emotions, the things we have for granted and the meaning of everything.Instead - the story was more accenting on weird and illogical things as pirates on the Moon, space killer-monkeys, underground Mars lakes, nuclear explosion causing acceleration in space, humans surviving 30 years on stationary ship deep in space....Yes, I know this is not a sci-fi, but still... there was too many illogical moments - which obviously led to all the negative reviews coming from keyboard-astronauts and cosmic-experts (which probably rate all Marvel movies with high 10/10).If you're not an ""expert"", there's a good chance to be entertained by this space fantasy adventure, and to think about the things you have in your life.",Ad Astra

I agree with the message even if I didn't care for the delivery. However, my personal appreciation for the film does not excuse its shortcomings. I will highlight a few:1. Far too much narration. Entirely too much.
2. Purposelessness. There's really nothing accomplished in the film. Though, yes, the actual mission is carried out, it doesn't really gel with what the majority of the movie actually spent it's runtime doing.
3. Waxing poetic. I don't mind a good philosophy. I love it. But, when an entire movie that was marketed as a medium action space movie actually becomes one that spends most of its time stroking its beard in thought, an effective movie was not made.In summary, there's nothing inherently wrong with a ponderous film. The problem lies in the movie marketing itself one way, sort of executing that, and spending the rest of the time narrating. It didn't do either story well.",Ad Astra

Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) and perfect psychological balance. , never reaching a heart rate per minute higher than 80, not even when falling from a super antenna reaching the stratosphere.This perfectionism makes this official proud to accept all missions assigned to him without question and without allowing the wishes of her wife Eve (Liv Tyler) to interfere with her professional life, making only logical decisions.After recovering from the antenna crash, Roy discovers that the cause of the tower's unstable operation was a series of power surges caused by an antimatter device parked near the planet Neptune. According to the scientists, this lightning source could be the ship of the historic Project Lima that, 30 years ago, led a team of researchers to that location to investigate the existence of extraterrestrial life in the universe, captained precisely by McBride senior.The new mission of the ever-balanced military is to travel to planet Mars to convey a message to trace the whereabouts of his father, whom he thought had been dead for many years. On the way to the red planet, some setbacks happen (such as attacking space pirates on the moon) that seem introduced to attract fans of galactic battles or only to break the monotony of the movie, although exceptionally well done.When Roy finds himself in a position of being used as a bait to attract the attention of his father, who is supposed to be involved in an attack on Earth, his emotional and psychological balance is put to the test.

504,fbmike,About as Realistic as Buck Rogers,2,4 December 2019,"Where do I start with this. I am a space buff and like Sci Fi movies. Sci Fi can go from entertaining to pretty ludicrous and it can do it pretty quickly. This movie fits in there someplace but not exactly sure where. I like Brad Pitt but not in this movie. Liked him in Once Upon a time in Hollywood, that role fit him. This one didn't. It looked an unnatural fit. Sometimes really good actors will appear in weird movies that leaves you scratching you head thinking, ""why is this dude in this movie"". That was one of those. His narrating throughout the movie was dole, boring and dreadful. Everyone he did one, I would go, ""shut up Brad, jeez"". Science and physics were all wrong in this movie. Writers and Director apparently didn't do much research. Starts off all wrong. What at first looks somewhat like a space station, but after a minute you realize something is not right and see this is supposed to be a structure that is connected to the ground. I don't think so dudes. Then we go to the Moon to go to Mars. Moon base looks like a City but we can only manage 1970s rovers to travel to Mars launch Site. Then we are traveling on the Rovers and thennnnnn, wait for it, Space Pirates appear out of nowhere in multiple Rovers that were apparently all bought from the same Rovers Lot. Then a Rover shoot out occurs that looks completely ludicrous. I don't think so dudes! Then on Mars there is actually a receptionist drumming her fingers that has like a 5 second part. Must have been a Director's niece or something. Then we go to sending a message, from a sound proof room no less, to Neptune to talk to his Dad in real time (it would take over 4 hours to send a signal to Neptune, one way). So unless the Director knew something Einstein didn't know, I don't think so dudes! Then there is a part where space ship Brad makes his was to a ship launching to Neptune as it is launching. Somehow there is a hatch at the bottom of the rocket right where the engines are. Of course he opens the hatch as the Rockets light and casually makes his way to another hatch as they are blasting off. Yeah right, I don't think so dudes! The they have a shooting battle right there (cause of course you don't go on a space voyage without your space blasters) as they are launching as he tells everyone to chill and they start shooting at him. Jeez. Then we somehow get to Neptune where he leaves his ship, has terrible boring dialog with good ole dad Tommy Lee, tells him we got to go Dad, sets a bomb and off they go on a spacewalk. Of course Dad isn't having any part of this so blasts off from his son and go off drifting into space. Son then goes back to Dads ship, tears off a piece, puts it in front of him, pushes off going through the rings of Neptune as pieces are bouncing off him, back to his ship and makes a perfect entrance to the hatch to his ship. Turns ship around, using blast of the bomb on Dads spaceship to propel him back to Earth. Next scene shows ship coming back through the Earth's atmosphere and Brad is asleep. I don't think so dudes!

The most dull, self indulgent boring film of this century",2,7 December 2019,"Wow! does this thing drag out. with the narrative provided by Brad seemingly self indulgent vanity writing of the worst dialogue writer in the world. Its like a 1950s dectective noir, set in space. you could almost hear the words pumped from a terrible pulp fiction novel where the writer tries to be deep and metaphorical in almost everything down to his cup of coffee..""a coffee so dark, it could shake the shadow off a windswept moonless evening""...adlib, but that kind of terrible, terrible writing. the fact iit was written and directed by the same guy once would assume he also had funding in it. To say it's boring is the excite people into redefining their previous expecations of tedium. As for the film itself, well Brad pit would never qualify as a space pilot thats for sure, well he wouldnt get insurance cover. He crashed onto something more times than Mr Magoo! it was like re-watching Armageddon without the cool soundtrack or the thrill of caring about a character, let alone the earth. The plot was dijointed, we struggled to work out why anybody did anything..so the direction was as bad as the writing. No word of a lie, you could take out all the scenes in editing room, throw the snippets up in the air, splice them where they fell and still end up with the same film.

507,JoshuaMLosapio,Mesmerizing But Flawed,6,26 September 2019,"""Ad Astra"" is one of the best directed science-fiction movies ever made - its stunning visuals reminded me of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Interstellar."" Nearly every single shot is a sight to behold. The bold colors and innovative framing are unlike anything I've ever seen outside of Kubrick, Nolan, or Ridley Scott. Brad Pitt gives a standout performance in the leading role, and the usage of haunting, ambient music is used to powerful effect throughout the film - making for a truly unique viewing experience.But as good as the movie is on an aesthetic level, ""Ad Astra"" has a very flawed narrative with largely shallow characters and a disappointing third act. Since the movie is still in theaters I won't spoil anything for those who haven't seen it. But the movie suffers from obvious plot holes and the climax fails to deliver on nearly two hours of sluggish build-up. The movie's pacing is uneven: despite a thrilling beginning and end the rest of the film drags at a snail's pace. This isn't helped by the fact that the characters of ""Ad Astra"" are mostly undeveloped and uninteresting. As the film's leading man Pitt is able to give the protagonist great emotional depth, but his fellow stars are wasted on characters with little screen time. The fact is that ""Ad Astra"" is often boring as a result, making it hard for me to fully recommend it. I loved the visuals, but the story and characters just don't hold water. 6/10.",Ad Astra

511,kmjnhh123,"Good Story, Appreciate What It's About",9,26 September 2019,"I will start off by saying that i don't normally like a film with not much action in it, like this film, BUT it didn't need loads of action, it has a great story along with incredible visuals & it gives you that edgy feeling throughout the whole film.The film keeps you wondering throughout the entire film, why, because it is set in space, anything to do with space always has that question mark over it, will there be enough oxygen, will there be a mechanical failure, enough fuel, what's around the next corner or simply will we even survive & that's what i think people missed after reading the bad reviews, you have got to appreciate the vastness of what actually is happening in this film, Roy (Brad Pitt) had no idea what he was gonna find out there, is his dad still alive, will he make it back?The whole film kept me hooked on them reasons, you can tell Roy is very calm from his heart beat throughout the film, but you can see in his face & in his head that you know he has no idea what to expect, look at the bigger picture.Even the baboon scene, there going through space and they receive a SOS call from another ship, they have to seek it out, but the crew question what do to, is it worth it, what could it be, the eeriness of making the life or death situation, millions of miles in space with no one to help you or save you, no one to hear you shout or scream. It's not just an irrelevant scene as some people are making out, it adds to the ""Anything is possible at any time in space that can mean life or death"", THAT is what you have got to realise with this film.When they reach Neptune & Roy's dad mentions that all the years he has been out there, he has scanned hundreds of planets from unimaginable distances, yet not an ounce of life, it just adds to the gold question, are we truly the only ones here?Another point is i also read some of the bad reviews about the inaccuracy of the film, i will admit there was some silly moments like Roy climbing into the rocket when its taking off, flying through Neptunes rock field with some metal & a few other things but i didn't go into this film expecting 100% accuracy, if your going to moan about accuracy go and watch 2012 or Interstellar.Yes i saw this film in 2D iMAX & it was beautiful along with the amazing clean simple sounds while in space to add to the vastness of space.Age: 25 - Cinema: Cineworld Stevenage 2D iMAX - Watch, Avoid, Consider: Deffo watch if your going to appreciate a story, don't watch if you want full blown space action.",Ad Astra

It doesn't do a very good job at explaining things as you go so you're left wondering if it was even important, which most if the time it isn't.

514,thetyvonlesure,A Character Study in Space,7,4 October 2019,"Ad Astra is a contemporary space odyssey that serves as a character study first and foremost. It's a slow burn movie that is the privileged, but not equivalent, love child of both 2001: A Space Odyssey and Apocalypse Now.The protagonist of the film is Brad Pitt's character, Roy McBride. The characterization of Roy is great, because it presents him as multifaceted and vulnerable. Brad Pitt's portrayal of Roy is really good. Pitt manages to be emotional without exhibiting a great range of emotion. The character Roy is a depressed man who is held back by his occupation's requirement for his emotional levity. Pitt encompasses this obstacle very well in his portrayal of Roy. Through his facial expressions, we can see his disdain for life within Roy. His body language gives off a lack of confidence and a yearn for love. Pitt accurately portrays a man with depression. Despite be very calm and confident, Roy is a vulnerable character who reminds the audience that despite being a professional first and foremost, he's still human and imperfect.The visuals for the movie are really good. The journey through Space is one that is shown to be incredibly dark in the absence of planets. The journey is manic and incredibly moody. The mood of each planet is exhibited through fine color use. The lighting on Mars is red, setting up the tone for the planet and the following act. The set pieces within the moon and planetary bases are atmospheric. They are akin to a galactic therapy room. They are very comfortable and relaxing. This serves as a juxtaposition to the conflict within the story and the character.One major flaw of the movie is the third act. The third act drags, and tries to be something that it's not. It tries to be similar to the confrontation at the end of Apocalypse Now, however it ends in a predictable manner that makes the entire journey seem like a waste of time. The character study takes a backseat to Roy's yearn for his Dad's approval. The ending was anticlimactic and seems forced and contradicts the intrapersonal conflict.Overall, Ad Astra is a solid film despite a dry third act. The pace of the story is slow, reaffirming it's place in the realm of space exploration dramas. Brad Pitt does an incredible job of portraying Roy McBride. This is a strong character study with commentary on life outside of our occupation, and a commentary on life in the unknown.",Ad Astra

I'm tired of the space operas and comic book fantasies that come out masquerading as science fiction today. I really wanted Ad Astra to be different, but it just wasn't. If you consider an ultra-slow burn, boring story, hard science fiction, maybe this one is for you.Don't get me wrong, it had its moments, but they were few and far between. Oh, and the story was basically Apocalypse Now set in space, but a whole lot less interesting or exciting.I blame the story itself. It just wasn't there. I think because of that, the script and acting seemed flat and bland as well. This is a movie to go to sleep by.It was so boring and predictable and felt like it was drawn out way too long. The only thing that kept me watching was the thought that there would be some surprise or revelation just around the corner, and there wasn't.I gave it 5 stars but only because of the production value.",Ad Astra

518,SouthernViews,"Beautiful Visuals, Horrible Script",2,8 June 2020,"The fact that the movie cost $90m to make and the worldwide gross was $136m should be red flag number one.

As others have stated, this is a movie about a man with daddy and intimacy issues. It just happens to be set in space.
Pros: The visuals are stunning. I also loved the reimagination of the future, with the lunar moon base as well as a colony on Mars. That's where it ends.
Cons: The basic premise is horrible, as is the science. I could list a dozen laughable moments that make absolutely no sense and do nothing to move the story forward.
The 2-star rating is for the VFX and lunar and Mars colonies, as well as the ship designs. Otherwise, watch at your own risk. If you love a movie that's a deep character study...no, never mind. I honestly never bought Pitt's character arc, and that's the entire reason the movie exists.",Ad Astra
519,mwrwazed,Don't know why I liked it!,6,8 September 2020,"Suddenly the whole human race is in danger. And the danger is that a mysterious power surge can strike in Earth's solar system and destroy the entire planet at any time. The space command unit has already located the source of the power surge at a station near the planet Neptune. The space command unit called Roy Macbride. Because the only person whose BPM never rises above 80. Also, a strong emotion from Roy's past associated with the planet.29 years ago Roy's father, Clifford Macbride, visited the planet Neptune on a famous mission named The Lima Project. And after 16 years, no signal has come to Earth from Neptune. Is Clifford alive or lost in the emptiness of space? No-one Knows. But the space command unit believes that may be Clifford alive. So, hearing the word Neptune, Roy's chest throbbed. He misses his father badly. So, he takes the risk. If there's a chance or luck to meet his father's again.Roy Macbride agrees to the Neptune mission on behalf of the space command unit, hoping to ""Get Dad Back."" With Roy, we crossed the boundaries of the Earth's sky and ran into space. From space to the Moon. From the moon to Mars. It's like a son's desperate journey to the unknown in the hoping of getting his father back.Do the father and son meet in the end? Or do they both choose a life of loneliness in the emptiness of space? Is the story just a reunion of a father and a son? Or is there something else deep down in it? Is the story just a Science Fiction? Or a cinematic pattern of existentialism?While the concept may seem conventional, the difference is due to director James Gray. The screenplay by James Gray and Ethan Gross reveals a great philosophical explanation of existentialism as well as science fiction. Hoyte van Hoytema was the Cinematographer; who worked in Nolan's masterwork Interstellar and Dunkirk. And that's why some scenes of space travel, moon, mars or Neptunes seem real and alive.I appreciated Brad Pitt for his role as Roy Macbride. I got the feeling of very fine acting skills in every moment. Most of the science fiction movies usually based on the secrets behind the creation of human beings Or the future journey towards the unknown. At the same time, through the world of the future, the real picture of the present time also emerges. I found all this in the movie Ad Astra.For example, the war on Mars reminds us in the context of Modern Day Politics; the settlements on Mars reminds us people are constantly moving towards the future. Who am I? Where did I come from? Or where is my end? In the movie, there is a philosophical depth of this kind of question. When did I turn myself into the character of Roy, I don't know.Some negative sides also found me. Like it has made everything much easier. By focusing on the journey of Neptune, the story became one-sided. Though there were many opportunities to make the story heavies. But they take it one-sided. Some scenes in space seemed fake. Like Hollywood type. Anyway, I love space exploration and adventures. And also sci-fi is my kind of thing. So, I liked the movie very much.Remember my choice and taste will not be like yours. So don't depend on my choices. Depends on your own. Have a good day.",Ad Astra
520,napchier,Good - could have been great - should have really...,7,18 September 2019,"Saw this in IMAX - Didn't quite pay off in IMAX, which really surprised me. This is kind of a 7.5/10 star movie for me, which would be a Roger Ebert score of 3/4. It's good in lots of ways, but not a lot really happens. Rounded it down to 7 though, because...The spectacle, space, and elements of human planetary migration seemed a little muted really, the general story giving us very little to tie ourselves to. The visuals were great in places, but each solar landmark (initially anyway) was little more than a pitstop, planetary diners, as far as landing opportunities go, without really doing anything to flesh that out. Some might not need much more in that regard (the person I went with didn't seem to), but for me it lacked a little in terms of the bigger picture. For example, there's a moment on the Moon that's reminiscent of Mad Max, it appearing to set up some additional potential in that regard, the story however going on to float away into the wide open space, and a couple of additional, somewhat limp, confrontations.I think some adjustments to the score, and a different approach to editing might have made aspects that should have been riveting riveting. Brad Pitt's also a little one note in this. He's good, but the character seems a little empty, aside from one strop, and a single tear - however that's most likely what they were after. I liked that they didn't go too far to over spec the technology - it seeming somewhat more realistic. Something I would have liked to have seen in the most recent Alien/Prometheus movies, as prequels to Alien - I realise that steers away from this movie, but I highlight that simply to emphasise a technology profile in this movie that seemed entirely plausible.",Ad Astra

The adage 'Never meet your heroes' is certainly affirmed. However, in substance, this is a cautionary tale of human space exploration and the accompanying stupidity, madness, greed, and pride that follow such grandiose ambitions. I am certainly even more convinced humankind should focus on saving our existing spaceship, Earth, before we try to walk the stars. Some of the science also tends to stretch physics, where energy levels of phenomena defy logic. Visually mesmerizing, the film absolutely warrants an Imax viewing - the images of serene blue Neptune, in particular, haunt me.

It was the first one, apparently.There is an undertow of real menace that builds throughout this movie, and the sense of growth, of struggled new understanding, that Pitt evokes is enchanting - this is one of Pitt's best roles, and the best thing about the film is that everyone involved seems to know it, and gives him time on screen to show it. It is wholly worth watching, just for Pitt.The staggering drop in interest is something I can't wholly account for - some accumulation of small foibles, little inconsistencies, too strong suggestions of the ultimate, I felt uninteresting finish. I simply knew I was done with the movie. Oddly, I was so pleased with the journey to that point, I didn't really *mind*; it was just so strongly telegraphing a finish I couldn't care less about.

536,doxxman5,Just about Perfect,10,6 July 2020,"Ad Astra is a wonder to watch and it's a movie that tells you it's intensions right from the start, then fulfills them in a genius way. For me personally, it was the first new movie I saw after a long hiatus from being able to go to a theater and watch a movie, and I'll admit it was still a relativily physically painful experience to sit in a chair and watch it, so it meant everything to me that was worth my time and THEN some! It is the kind of movie the theaters were made for, a beautiful mix of what came before from the fantastical journeys of Apocalypse Now and Intersteller to the personal relationtionship family dramas of director James Grey himself. Its like Grey had been leading up to this movie his entire career.
Brad Pitt has had quite a year, for an actor of 55 years of age. He also had an amazing Quentin Tarantino movie several months prior to this one. His muted but focused performance here is a culmination of his whole career, something quite different for him but also very natural. His quest to find his father (played by Tommy Lee Jones) leads him to make decisions that endanger lives and the fate of planet Earth itself. It begs the question, are we destined to become what we fear the most? How much of our life is pre-determined and how much is purely genetics? Are we driven mainly by fear or by the design to do what is right?
I'm not sure why some people have had an adverse reaction to Ad Astra, but Ifound it the perfect mix of contemplative and mesmerizing. It enthralled me the entire time and I was never bored. I was experiencing the aftermath of a painful surgery when I saw it in theaters, so maybe that made me appreciate Pitt's character's yearning to cross the galaxy to find his father even more? For whatever reason, the journey to Neptune and beyond made me think about my entire life and existence, and there are so many layers and surprises in this movie I will not discuss the plot more. But , I cannot wait to watch this movie a second time because I know for a fact (I watch wayyyy to many movies for sure) that few movies get things this perfect.

Brad Pitt in the lead is an outstanding astronaut, who has achieved this recognition by focusing everything on mission outcomes, and nothing else. At a cost of his marriage, and any real close personal contacts. While this may sound a bit cheesy, the film does not gloss over this, but instead makes it the central premise. With Pitt embarking on the most dangerous of missions to the edge of the solar system, wrestling with his choices and a possible resolution with his father, who he has modelled his own life and career on. Set against the majestic bleakness of space, there is a wonderful counterbalance between the infinite of the galaxy, and the personal, of making a connection with just one person and holding onto that. A lifeline that is just as important as the tether to a spacecraft. While there is spectacle, and some action, this is very much a film of thought and reflection of what it is that matters most.",Ad Astra
538,baharuka,Great movie with a basic story but a genuine character and a welcome touch of mundanity,8,29 July 2020,"This movie has all the elements you could expect from a space movie (classified missions, stunning visuals, things going wrong in space...) but uses a unique, calm main character and a script and soundtrack that gives a sense of reality and mundanity. Some people didn't like the realism but I think this is how things could have actually gone in a story like this. Astronauts and others involved in missions are humans.
Brad Pitt played the character perfectly. I could feel his depressed side in my bones, together with his love for life. The ending was one of the best I've seen in a space movie, giving the feeling that you ate at a classy restaurant, if you imagine your usual space movie ending is a hamburger.
The story is extremely basic. You could have written it after taking a single course on American movie plots, and there are quite many scenes that make you say, come on, that couldn't have physically happened, but overall, I'm touched. Great portrayal of a range of emotions and human relations.",Ad Astra
539,Rushiera,Psychological Space Thriller,3,1 January 2020,"Yep the title of this review says it, its a new psychological space thriller, same vein as Moon, Sunshine, except those movies were infinitely better, why?. Well its because its the guy's quest to find his dad. Thats why, even if the movie was well written, expertly filmed and very economical with its surroundings despite the budget. It gives you that feeling you are truely alone in this empty vacuum you call space.
A good depiction of life in outer space taking its toll on the human psyche is there too. But it did not ring any new bell for me, but the same old. This has been done before, and this one felt tediously longer for some reason.3/10",Ad Astra

Unfortunately it is extremely pretentious, seriously ponderous, and nothing short of tedious. Yes it has some beautiful shots in it, but its still not Gravity, The story is rather predictable, and is such a disappointing follow up performance from Pitt, after his extremely enjoyable role in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. I have seen someone describe it as stylish ...... but for e a movie should be entertaining and enjoyable before anything else, and this is far from that.",Ad Astra
542,Shaun_of_the_Dude,"Great first two acts, reasonable third. A 2019 apocalypse, now!",7,21 September 2019,"What's not to like about Brad Pitt rocking up in space with the occasional Tyler Durden-like mannerism thrown in there for good measure.I have read quite a few other reviews and can't add much of any depth as to the potential psychological and/or mental affects of space travel. The symbolism in this film is rife - there's not much subtlety and yet the story is so simple, you wouldn't have to sit there and churn out theories with friends.It's just another good Brad Pitt film that has a much-welcomed return of the great Tommy Lee Jones who has (to my mind) been away from mainstream film for far too long. He plays Brad Pitt's auld man, and Brad is sent to retrieve him and save the universe.Under the hood, it has all the elements a Brad Pitt vehicle would need and this film feels a bit like World War Z in another shell. Both good films, they're character-centric caricatures of the brooding alpha male. A lot of males relate to that, a lot of females are attracted to that.Ad Astra is Brad Pitt being the dawg and I think it is of no coincidence that you can take two letters off of Brad's name, add a d for good measure and jiggle in the title, you get Bad B*****d.I'm not sure of the writing history of this film... but if you liked any of the following: Interstellar, Apocalypse Now, Blown Away (1990ish?), WWZ, The Martian, Star Wars (I am your father! Let me go, Noooooooo.... ), then you will like aspects of this film as it is a very emotional film which draws you in on a familial level.Old Pitt does a boss job on the lens and you can't knock him - he pretty much pulls off almost everything he's done on screen. And with that I can already hear many other leading males of his generation following suit with a 'hard' sci-fi epic.It isn't drooped in theory of physics and philosophy, as is Interstellar, but it shares one or two elements with the production obviously inspired by Christopher Nolan's recursive spin on space epics.There is, as in WWZ, a massive portion of unneeded flutter to act as a filler scene or backstory. Brad Pitt's characters just generally tend to get to the point and answer the problem in one or two sentences. In this, he actions his point in one or two sentences and it has as much practical acting as static acting.I mean... There's always something happening yet when there isn't... there isn't. There's a lot of movement in scenes, and then there isn't... It's a truly interesting dynamic within the subtext of the film and if you do watch - think about the vast distances at-play here.But I gave this 7 out of 10. I'd have probably not gave it 7 if it weren't for Brad Pitt. He elevates this film, but there really isn't much of an ensemble, as characters come and go forth.Definitely worth a watch and one for a family gathering at Christmas on ITV methinks.",Ad Astra
543,brainsmasher-66,Well done scifi,8,21 September 2019,If you like really good science fiction with lots of drama and action then you will like this movie. It's like they took the plot from 2001: A Space Odyssey changed a few details and added a few. If you have seen 2001 then you will agree. The movie soundtrack is not as good; but it is hard to beat the classical classics. The space scenes and moon scenes are as good as 2001. It's kind of overly long and I found myself yawning a few times; but I didn't want to miss anything. Instead of the ship's computer Hal being crazy it is the character played by Tommy Lee Jones. The movie could have used a little bit more of Tommy Lee and cut out some other stuff like the rabid apes; but it was good for shock effect.,Ad Astra
544,Silfiriel,4 for effort,4,24 January 2020,"The movie does not live up to the grandeur of its name. Family drama, a father - son relationship, needlessly set across the solar system and few action sequences. I can't imagine that anyone with similar emotional situation would relate due to the background setting.
Event the story behind the emotional drama is unclear and badly written, no substance to rely on, random events that engage you for about five minutes total.
Again, it does not deserve the name, totally wasted.
Shame for the cast, Live Tyler gets about less then minute screen time, Tomy Lee Jones, maybe two.",Ad Astra
545,sadak7599,Beautiful images and interesting psychological drama ruined by plot holes and bad Sci-Fi,6,22 September 2019,"I loved and hated Ad Astra at the same time. I loved it because I think I understand what story is telling, and it is not a sci-fi movie. I think I get the motivations and feelings of the main characters (father and son), the feeling of vastness of the space, which highlight the loneliness of the human beings as a species and as individuals. Also, the movie presents the strong inner clash that most scientist feel between the overwhelming frustration that their explorations and struggles produces, and the joy of the path and addiction to the exploration, which let them to even abandon families and mundane life. The feeling that even a place not meant to be a home (in the movie is the father's spaceship, but it is perfectly extrapolable to any laboratory) is your real home, a place you do not want to left, because you feel you are losing your opportunity to gain a bit of knowledge.
As a scientist, I think I grasp the contradiction of the father, who does not want to give up the project of his life, even feeling it is a failure. A scientist that is unable to see to what he achieved, because anything achieved (explained by the son, in the form of all the planets examined by the project) is nothing compared with the infinitude that is behind his eyes and the questions this infinitude raises.In my opinion, As Astra is just the story of a son abandoned by a father, who spent his entire life in the biggest quest of humanity and who went too far in his search. And it is the story of the reencounter and the realization of the father, who discovered what he lost in his pathway to knowledge. In my opinion, the true protagonist of the story is the father. Like Kurtz, in the main reference of this movie.
Overall, this movies is a mixture of elements and situations taken from Apocalypse Now (more than the original novel of Joseph Conrad), Interstellar, 2001 A Space Odyssey, Event Horizon, Soderbergh's Solaris, and Gravity. If you have watched all these movies, you will feel that you have already watched Ad Astra, and even you will see some ""tributes"" to some of these.What I really hate is the contempt with which the movie treats the Science. The movie takes a lot of imagery taken from Nasa missions (Voyager, Cassini, Mars rovers,...) to create great environments, just to insult the viewer with things like the following:
-The BIG hole: why they sent the Brad Pitt to Mars? just to call to his father at Neptune? why he didn't make the call from Earth, or Moon?
Radiation does not increase its energy with the distance to the emitter. On the contrary. It is ridiculous when, during the briefing, they explain to Brad Pitt that the energy of the radiation burst reach its maximum on Earth.Gravity on Moon or Mars looks like Earth's gravity, except at specific moments. Ok, I get it: keeping the characters moving like they are at Mars gravity could be difficult and tiresome for the viewer.Nuclear blasts in space does not work like that.Neptune rings are not that dense and does not look like thatWhat the heck is going on with the ""antimatter""? not a clue on why the radiation bursts are produced and how Lima project is working. Ok, as I told you THIS IS NOT REALLY A SCI-FI MOVIE.The original crew of the spacecraft sent to Neptune with a very delicate and dangerous mission, is actually stupid and unprepared, and practically they killed themselves. Why??? It was necessary to use that embarrassing characters?Anyway, if you consider that this is not SCI-FI, but (like Interstellar) a drama of a broken family...you will see it with different eyes.",Ad Astra

550,novacasa42,A nuanced story.,8,5 December 2019,"Ad Astra is a daring story of exploration, not only space but our very self, this film deals with a deep-seated urge humans always had, a question that lingered in the back of our minds, are we alone?
Coming into a genre well represented in the last decade by many great films, Ad Astra doesn't necessarily overwhelm but it managed to tell a well written and executed narrative in a very minimalistic approach, as you watch the film, you notice that it doesn't focus on the scientific details, it strives to address a higher meaning and that's the very core of the movie, it succeeded to make me invest myself into the story, granted, it is very easy for me to do so as I find the idea of the exploration of the universe extremely fascinating.
Pitt's performance here is amazing, his rendition of a stoic astronaut that represses so much of his problems gives an unparalleled grip to the story, his scenes with the great Lee Jones are proof of that.
Contrary to what might this film leads you to believe, Ad Astra is not about the exploration of space, it explores human nature and our reaction to hardships and pain, I very much loved it.",Ad Astra

There are billions of stars in a galaxy and billions of galaxies, the odds against life are as close to zero as you can get.You expect something to actually happen in a movie about the search for extra terrestrial life. Pretty much nothing happened in this. Sure there are a few space action scenes and fighting action scenes but it's nothing new and it's nothing good.Are we supposed to be wow'd by the thought of commercialism and pirates on the moon? Are we supposed to walk away thinking we should appreciate what we have at home and love and all that?

552,WillsFilms,Ad Astra Blasts Off,8,28 September 2019,"As Astra is a phenomenal experience that is one of the best movies I've seen this year. Brad Pitt is amazing as Roy McBride and delivers an oscar worthy performance. His journey is very well written as he's sent to discover more about his father and the lessons he learns throughout the runtime are extremly compelling. What's eventually revealed about Clifford McBride is beautiful writing and makes you conflicted on your opinions of the character. This movie also features some incredibly stunning visuals. Almost every shot is perfect and gorgeously filmed. As Astra is one of the best directed movies I've ever seen. The shot compositions and camera angles are all perfect thoroughout. The only problems I have with the movie is the pacing is rather slow and, because of that, it's not a movie for everyone. Also, halfway through the film, there is a scene involving baboons that is genuinely awful, especially thanks to the unconvincing CGI in that one scene.

558,deandsouza15892,Such a slogfest,6,20 September 2019,"How much Brad Pitt acting do you really need to sell you on this movie?
I'm gonna start with a compliment, before I dive into what I feel are my major flaws with this film.The visual aesthetic is incredible! This project simply looks beautiful; every few minutes there will be amazing wide-angle space shots, exquisite astral images and gorgeous planets. Even the directive choices are pretty clever - they add a few front-angle jump scenes,and first-person perspective shots, that gives you this really cool video-game vibe; Kinda like you're playing Halo. I saw it IMAX, so I was spellbound the entire time. But thats really all I can say about it.The rest of this film is a real slog-fest. After a very enticing first act, this movie get sloooowww. By the 60 minute mark, you'll feel the dip; 90 minutes in,and I was just waiting for it to end. Thats not entirely a bad thing - if slow films are your vibe, you won't mind this. But for me, I just got so bored.The plot also didn't interest me. The key focus is a father-son relationship, which is fine, but not what I was promised.
The sub-plots in this story would've made for much stronger content. There's a mission on the far side of the moon,where they're ambushed by lunar space pirates (which lasts 2 minutes). There's a rescue mission, stylized as horror, where experimental primates take over a space shuttle (this is about 10 minutes). There's an entire mini-segment about humans living on mars that is literally 20 minutes. The rest of the story is just dedicated towards his father, which is a let down. You're teasing me with a full course meal and then delivering a salad?!This eventually led to a very underwhelming, unsatisfying climax, which had me going, 'Just end it. Say what you need to say,and finish it already. I don't care anymore'. Honestly, towards the end, I didn't even want to know what happens, because anything I found interesting was brushed off.Its really not as horrible as I'm making it sound; its just underused and wasted potential. I, personally, would not recommend it, unless you have access to your phone for easy distractions.",Ad Astra

Or, perhaps you are on death row, this movie might make you look forward to what's coming in your future, even wish it were sooner.The first reviewer to use the term ""Ad Nauseum"" in their review of this movie, kudos to you. The others, still very appropriate.This movie literally makes no sense. It isn't science fiction because it has no fidelity to either science or fiction. They could call it Alice in Wonderspace, except it isn't amusing. The plotline is ridiculous and nonsensical. All the available technology and they send him on the mission to deliver a message? Without getting into spoiler territory, this is a long, boring diatribe about nothing.I don't think it qualifies as drama because it doesn't appear serious, at any point, even though it deals with very serious issues. It is almost comical, as if they are playing a joke on the viewer. Any minute now the real movie will start...Casting Pitt as a reflective crybaby was sheer genius. His public comment about the movie's character not being masculine is on-target. Those are the kind of people we send on space missions? Mentally and emotionally damaged individuals who might do bad things. Like kill other astronauts and take their spacecraft. His father was crazy, let's send him, too.The girding reason for the ""movie"" is that, somehow, a spacecraft we sent up decades ago is now sending out some type of energy wave that threatens the universe. The universe? Really? Global warming much?While loosely ripping off old Star Trek movies is safe territory (VGER), the concept of anything manmade destroying the entire universe is ludicrous on its face. They might as well claim a baby, minutes after birth, killed all the hospital staff and other humans over the age of one-day. Then started his own gang of one-day old babies who then killed all the people on Earth except themselves. On the baby's first birthday, he wished his mother was there, but she could not because he killed her 364 days ago.

However, Brad Pitt, as always, gives an excellent performance with emotional weight. Elements such as cinematography and visual effects are absolutely superb, this is demonstrated through one shot in particular, where Brad Pitt is standing in a corridor, this shot is quite magnificent and features cool visuals of various planets and of the Earth itself. This movie also explores some intriguing concepts about mankind's potential future injunction with the advancement of technology.But with most movies there are some critiques and Ad Astra does have a couple of nagging issues within it. There are definitely some events near the end of the film that do have you scratching your head a little, however it is an enjoyable scene to watch. This movie though is not for everyone, this may be because, after an excellent nerve racking opening scene the film slows down it's pace for the rest of the first act and doesn't pick up again until the middle of the film. It personally didn't bother me too much as a lot of space movies are made like this, as they are always building up to something.I would recommend watching it at a cinema, to enhance the amazing visuals and experience.

It is a visually stunning space opera that's chock full of Oscar winning actors giving very creditable performances. The talents of ILM and WETA help to digitally sculpt a future universe that is entirely believable. Even though the movie spans literally the entire solar system, the heart of the film is really about the longing of a son for his father.In the future that Ad Astra portrays, commercial space travel is commonplace. There are settlements on the Moon and Mars. Lunar Subway sandwich shops and Vegas style hotels cater to visitors. Interestingly, there are also roving bands of lunar pirates who battle for contested resources and will plunder your moon buggy without a second thought.Major Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) is a hotshot member of the US Armed Forces Space Force. The film opens with him showing us his characteristic grace under pressure in a spectacular upper atmosphere catastrophe. While there's plenty of action here, it's really the inner astronaut that's being explored. Called to a top secret meeting, he's told that his father might be alive after all. He's given the mission to find out and connect with Colonel Cliff McBride (Tommy Lee Jones). His last encounter was at 16 when his Dad left for Neptune.Lots of secrecy, plot twists and full-on action adventure sequences ensue. The score by Max Richter was brilliant and its sound got an Oscar nomination. While Pitt's performance was nuanced, I didn't find it emotionally believable. From my perspective, this was the single greatest failure of this film. Its heartbeat couldn't be heard by the audience.In fact, it led me to wonder whether this might have been just as good a story if it took place in the 19th century instead of the 22nd. A sea captain searching for his heroic father stranded for decades on a tropical island could have been just as compelling. Still, it is a beautifully made film that immerses you in a future world where human relationships still matter.

It started off slow and stayed that way, the story line could have been much much better, the acting was robotic, and the whole things was dim and dreary.I am most disappointed that Brad Pitt would even accept a part in this movie, it made him look bad. But, I guess Hollywood has hit rock-bottom on ideas and being creative thus making Brad desperate to act.I truly wasted my time and money on this one... hope Hollywood can find some new
stuff that's worth paying to see; this one was not!",Ad Astra
577,sonicheze8,Sci-fi spectacle into the psyche,9,4 December 2019,"Ad Astra or Into the Stars is excitingly intriguing. I completely adulate the ideas and cinematography brought forth by the film. The first scene itself of Brad Pitt falling from the tower might be the most absorbing and metaphorical action shots ever sequenced.I'm completely biased here I'll admit. I love science fiction and long-drawn ambigious movies. Luckilly, Ad Astra has taken multiple inspirations from the greats, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Apocalyse Now, Blade Runner 2049, Tree of Life. It's a hybrid between action blockbuster and arthouse ruminations and it worked incredibly well for me. It gains the benefit of both well-paced story beats and the ability to explore deeper and fragmented ideas.Brad Pitt's nuanced performance sold the deal here, coupled with the cinematography from Hoyte van Hoytema, a mesmerizing and subtle film was created. Particularly the use of colour and setting, to convey mood, emotion, and the troubling infinite. One of the faults of the film I will point out is that there was a lack of focus on the themes such as the father and son dynamic, the constant conflict of human nature, and loneliness. Rather most of the ideas were touched upon but not built, while the overarching message seems to bind the it all together, it's also rather pronounced. Yet, I personally have no problems with this as it fits into the mold of exploration and being lost.It's masked veil of philosophy and detachment hides a beautiful and entertaining film. Together with a riveting, atmospheric score, it conveys an enigmatic and painful world inhabited by the characters. The deeply troubling aspect is the realism that helps to convey the possibility in ours. The personal viewpoint of Roy Mcbride sets up an emphatetic character marked by the plight of his upbringing. The emphasis on the doomed relationship between father and son, explores it's thematic ideas with dubious precision. The camerawork is exceptional, with a comfortable straighforward storyline. Ad Astra is perhaps my favourite Sci Fi movie of 2019.",Ad Astra

What's the meaning? it is just a stunt.2. the character acted by actor Donald Sutherland, he appears at the beginning and then disappears, never to be seen again. What was he for? why not use his talent for a more lengthy cross-webbing of storytelling?3. The scene of a monkey eating human flesh, isn't that kitsch? it sure has that shock factor. Why put it there? It really doesn't help much on the overall narrative. What purpose does it have in the overall narrative?4. The science, physics, and math to support that stunt at the end of him catapulting from the rotating antenna of one spaceship, to get back to his spaceship, and flying in space through a Saturn belt of orbiting rocks, all this while protecting himself with a metal shield, conveniently retrieved from the antenna's cover, is just laughable on the ridiculous. The probability of targeting the mother ship, on a 0.000001 arc sec maximum tolerance, is infinitesimally small.Woke up the next day and had nothing good to tell or say about it.

Chalk it up to a misleading trailer cutting all of the action scenes together, but this movie is far from a high-octane space adventure. Rather it's a contemplative character study that happens to be set in space. If that alone doesn't sound appealing to you, then it is unlikely that the A+ visuals and top-notch acting will make a difference (even though this movie has both in spades). However, if you are willing to set aside expectations of mile-a-minute thrills to watch a true artist weave a touching and thematically deep story, then boy are you in for a treat. This was my first James Gray movie but it certainly won't be my last. The writing is very understated - it's often about what isn't said - but ultimately comes together to tell a beautiful story of family and letting go of the past. The directing is PHENOMENAL. Full stop. Many will complain that it's too slow, or that the physics were unrealistic (I never realized how many IMDb reviewers had degrees in astrophysics, golly!), and to them that may be a deal breaker, but for me it was well worth the price of a ticket.

Yes, it cannot be as simple as recording a message on Earth to then beam to Neptune...
To do all this he has to single handedly fight off moon pirates (yes really), space rabid monkeys (Yes!), sneaking into a rocket in the last 10 seconds of the lift off countdown after swimming in a Mars lake before killing the whole crew.

Once you accept that, then you can sit back and enjoy the spectacle as it plays out before you.Having said that, using outer space to explore the inner space is nothing new. The movie I was most reminded of in this respect is 'Contact'. 'Solaris', too, comes to mind. I don't think this movie brings anything new to the idea, either. And I have to say that, by the end, I wasn't entirely convinced that the idea worked here. I wasn't persuaded by any sense of change in the central character. In fact, I wondered if it was really worth his while to go that far - whether the billions of miles across space, or the billions of miles of neurons inside his head - to reach the point that he did at the end. Did he go all that way to get to know the father he never knew before, only to find him not really worth knowing after all? My personal jury is still out - but I only left the cinema an hour ago. Maybe in the days to come, when I've allowed it to settle in a bit more, I'll change my mind. It may actually be worth another viewing soon, to see if there's something I may have missed.So... 8 out of 10 for cinematography and performances (even though Tommy Lee Jones pretty much phoned his in!) and 6 out of 10 for story.

Depressed astronaut Major Roy McBride is working on a space tower in a space suit when Earth is hit by cosmic rays and he falls off. Parachuting to safety he is informed by SpaceCom that they think that Dr Clifford McBride his dad who went missing twenty years before on a mission to the outer solar system to search the galaxy for life with a special antimatter powered telescope on the Lima spacecraft is still alive near Neptune and has turned the telescope into a death ray and is using it to destroy Earth.He flies commercial to the Moon to catch the Cepheus SpaceCom spacecraft to Mars but lands miles away from the launch pad and has to drive there through space pirates. On the way to Mars they answer a distress call from a biomedical research space station and the captain of the Cepheus is killed by baboons.On Mars Roy sends some messages to his dad asking him to stop but then fails his computer-controlled psych evaluation and gets locked up in what looks like a children's creche. The Mars base boss shows him a recording of his dad's last transmission twenty years before saying his crew all got homesick and mutinied so he killed them, then she breaks him out and drives him to the launchpad where the Cepheus is preparing to launch for Neptune without him to nuke Lima. He swims through an underground Martian lake and climbs aboard through an airlock just as it blasts off but the crew panic. There then follows a series of unfortunate events involving a space gun, a knife, sudden acceleration and a cylinder of poison gas that accidentally kills the entire crew one by one in less than a minute, so Roy carries on to Neptune alone.He finds the Lima with, sure enough, what looks like a death ray blasting off on top, so he parks the Cepheus and flies over in a shuttle, which he then loses. Aboard the Lima he finds the entire crew dead except for his dad Cliff, who explains that twenty years ago not all the crew mutinied and that those that didn't accidentally set the telescope to destroy Earth before they died, and that he has been trying to switch it off ever since. He also explains that while they were all still doing their jobs they discovered loads of lovely planets everywhere, but no life of any kind, and it made them depressed.Roy grabs the Lima data, sets the self-destruct and tries to spacewalk back to Cepheus with his dad, but Cliff gets depressed and jets off into the void.

There is a really good film inside this film, if you cut out about 30 minutes of the dumb stuff and cut all of the voiceover, psychology evaluations, exposition dumps and the wife backstory.

And all I could see was a handsome 55-year-old trying to look 35. That does not equal a 45 year old (which is about what the character's age is supposed to be). He's supposed to be an astronaut who buries himself in his job, but he looks like an older guy absolutely obsessed with his appearance. There are more physically-appropriate actors out there. Brad's entering a Real Housewives phase in his appearance - he may want to lay-off the botox and hair dye for awhile.The movie itself is slow, moody art-house sci-fi, like Solaris and others. It's just not deep enough for that. It does however, move along at a decent clip, and never feels boring despite its pace. Probably because it's action scenes are well-executed.In the end however, it's not only kind of shallow, it's kind of dumb. The space antenna is dumb (satellites work just fine for this stuff). There is earth-like gravity on the moon and mars. you don't report panicky pilots who nearly crash a rocket because..., you park your rocket miles away from the space station instead of just going under the rings. you don't face consequences for disobeying orders, killing three astronauts, because you completed a mission they would have probably completed themselves just fine. you allow yourself to get surprised and killed by a psycho baboon. you hire live tyler to do nothing.like I said, it's actually ok as a mediocre Sunday Afternoon space movie, but it thinks it's smart and it's so not.",Ad Astra

Electrical storms in space cause astronaut son to be sent to find out if daddy is alive. Turns out deadbeat dad abandoned son and killed off the crew, all because he couldn't find any aliens. Son decides he'll be different, returns to earth to reconnect with wife.Why this is silly:
1) it's 3 months from Mars to Neptune, and no one bothers to send a rescue mission in the DECADE that dad is presumed rogue?
2) orbit ain't stationary and given the huge distance, hitting Earth from Neptune must be a planned attack. So the catalyst for reunion is fake.
3) bland, zero character building. None of them are heroic, so why should the audience care?
4) the big ""reveal"" is that we're all alone in the universe. Come on, even with full crew, basic science will tell you that 16 years isn't enough name, much less conclude that all the planets in the universe are barren.In conclusion, space and the mission are HUGE MacGuffins.

637,sophaljonesy,Jawdropping visual space epic with excellent cinematography and brilliant performances by Brad Pitt,9,21 September 2019,"Science fiction is where you expand your imagination by exploring how a certain science idea could play out however in movies it is synonymous with space travel, so even Marvel movies could qualify as sci fi, even though they are essentially not. However Ad Astra is a true science fiction movie in spirit. Starring Brad Pitt as an astronaut in search of his father, played bu Tommy Lee Jones, the movie manages to bring the sense of awe and dread in space travel not captured by other movies. In here, every mission can go wrong, and even Brad Pitt can be in danger. The space scenes were beautifully shot and actually took my breath away. The shots were also immersive, making you see space from the point of view of the characters. It actually makes you feel you are part of the crew and tagging alonh with Brad Pitt. Needless to say, Pitt was excellent. This movie reminds us of how he can express subtle emotions, making him a stoic but vulnerable hero. I am glad Pitt chooses his roles well and you never know what to expect from him. As for Tommy Lee Jones, his short screen time was rivetting and he commanded as much presence as Pitt. His character is enigmatic and complex, making Pitt's character's journey to find Jones all the more compelling. The movie is smart and grounded. The characters, landscape, and technology feel real. Space crafts are not the slick high tech inventions of Star Wars or Marvel. They look realistic and claustrophobic. The score adds to the epic scope of the adventure, and is reminiscent of Stanley Kubric's unforgettable score in Space Oddyssey. But being an intelligent film, people who are expecting action packed adventures like in superhero movies are bound to be disappointed. Yet the trailers are honest in that they do not market the movie as an action film like Star Wars or Star Trek, but a space epic starring the immense talents of Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones. But whatever they say, I really enjoyed this movie and have never felt so enthralled since a long time so I highly recommend this science fiction masterpiece.",Ad Astra

639,Carrzinho,A plot that journeyed through Neptune's rings.,6,3 October 2019,"Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) is an Astronaut who works on massive antennae that stretch from Earth to the edge of our atmosphere. Following a space born anomaly hitting his antenna (and causing deaths throughout Earth), Roy is invited to a debrief. Instead of a debrief, it is revealed to Roy that his Dad Clifford (Tommy Lee Jones), who was accepted to have died near Neptune, on a mission, is now suspected alive and may be responsible for the ""surges"" as these anomaly are called.
Roy is needed to set forth into space in an attempt to make contact with his father. However, as this is classified a cover trip to the moon as a tourist is proposed and our first of many homages to 2001 A Space Odyssey.
Like with Kubrick, the movie attempts a fact based imaginable near future. Conceivable tech, shares screen time with concepts like disputed territories on the moon. The ""near future"" timeline caused some friction with me as Clifford hangs on a wall beside Buzz Aldrin and implies this near future is occurring more sooner than the 150 years is suspect it might. It does provide some realism and perhaps there's an alternate reality is being toyed with but it also jars.
There are numerous holes to a plot that doesn't survive much scrutiny. It's thin and anti-climatic and some scenes such as that, that takes place in space on an unnecessarily remote animal research facility, beggar belief.
Brad Pitt's character is supposed to be even tempered and can compartmentalise any troubling thoughts. This results in a performance lacking in...anything really. His brilliant at everything fascade begins to grate and he is hard to care about. Donald Sutherland, cameo's as an old man. Tommy Lee Jones, who is limited anyway, is given little screen time. Liv Tyler plays Roy's wife and barely utters a word. Only Ruth Negga shines but even her character doesn't seem fully formed.
At times it's pretty enough to look at, but often it has some of the grain of Blade Runner 2049 that felt compromising. The score is fair and seems recycled. Others have commented of the ""Father Issues"" between Roy and Clifford but they're so matter of fact and short on interaction that it was a by-the-by for me.
It left too many loose ends, in a movie lacking in tension or pathos. I'd find to hard to argue that the this is potentially my favourite setting for a movie and maybe it is why it was so disappointing for me. SIX",Ad Astra
640,peterwcohen-300-947200,"Bad science, pointless characters, turgid dialog and evil baboons",1,8 October 2019,"The first thing you find out in this movie is that the inverse square law does not apply. Yes, that's right. Someone is sending some kind of force from out near Neptune all the way to Earth, and, I kid you not, it gets stronger as it travels. Nothing in the universe does that. Nothing. And we're off to the races with total, monumental scientific illiteracy. A structure that reaches from the surface of the Earth into space serves as an antenna. On the moon, the transition from the near side to the far side of the moon is a sharp line between sunlight and darkness. Guess what: The far side is commonly called ""the dark side"" because it's not visible from the Earth, not because it doesn't get sunlight. A lunar rover goes flying over the edge of a crater, spinning, and lands on its wheels and keeps on going. It takes 19 days to get to Mars. It takes a further 79 days to go to Neptune. Yet, at what must be monumentally high speeds, they can still slow down, stop along the way to battle evil baboons, and get going again.But all that is not half as bad as the monumental boringness and pointlessness of the story. The dialog (and Pitt voiceover monologues) are very pedestrian blather about things that we are supposed to care about except that there is no context or world-building that might make it matter to an audience. The climactic conversation between mopey son and loony father must have been written by a 9th grade creative writing student.There are so many things wrong, I can only pick a few at random -- Why is this Earth-saving mission being entrusted to a crew of freight jockeys? Why does Pitt have to go to Mars in order to record and send a (laser) message to Daddy? Can't do that from Earth? Or the moon? Why go to the moon at all? Or Mars? No reason that I can discern. What are pirates doing on the moon? USA forces can't manage to get from one moon base to another without protecting themselves from pirates? Huh? Really? Why is Donald Sutherland in this movie? His character does exactly one thing (besides giving Pitt old man speeches) -- he gives Pitt his secret passkey for something or other. Oy.",Ad Astra

650,shabanavdulaj,Cold and heartwarming at the same time.,9,21 May 2020,"I have seen only The Lost City of Z and Two Lovers from James Gray's filmography and those are both decent films. You can see that the director has a very powerful and rare style of filmmaking. He likes to take his time in his films, he uses long shots, he doesn't like telling you what is going on, he challenges you on figuring that out on your own. But although his prior two films are very well made films I think that with Ad Astra he has outdone himself. Movies like Ad Astra require a bold vision that can come only from the director and I think that Gray had that vision in this film and executed it perfectly. In my opinion this is the best directed film of the year.
What I'm most impressed other than directing, is the cinematography. This movie is gorgeous. The shots are amazing to look at. People are saying that they borrowed a lot from A Space Odyssey and I agree that some shots are very similar, but that's beside the point.
Brad Pitt gave a very good performance. I liked him here even more than in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. Along side the director he carried out this film. I am not quite sure but I think that there isn't a scene that he is not at during the movie. He got a lot of screening time and he managed it very well.
Overall this is a very well made film, it's definitely one of the best of the year and Gray's masterpiece.",Ad Astra
651,michaeltong-29180,To Nowhere,1,7 December 2019,"Ad Astra commits the biggest Sin in the book: it's boring. That is not to be confused with a 'slow burn.' At no point does this film 'burn.'I also gave The Wandering Earth 1 out of 10 stars, but at least it was entertaining in how terrible it was; I laughed, I jeered, and my jaw hit the floor. But with Ad Astra, I yawned.Some people are defending the film by saying it ""isn't sci-fi,"" and that it's a ""character driven film"" more about the internal struggle of the character rather than the external spectacle of Astronautics. Although true, this is a poor excuse. Gravity (2013) already did that, and much better.Thematically, the film is about a man's relationship to his emotionally distant father, but all of that is told to the audience in the least interesting way: Brad Pitt's monotone narration. It's all just people talking about much more interesting-sounding things that we don't see. The plot itself is just the flimsiest excuse to get Pitt's character from one place to another.There are a couple of 'Set-Pieces,' but none of them move the plot forward or change the character. They feel more like things chosen from a checklist of 'space stuff'. There is car chase on the moon that seems to have been made specifically for the commercials; to trick people into thinking the film has action. It's completely useless and adds nothing.Even the soundtrack is bored. It's the dullest minimal/ambient soundtrack I've ever heard. Rather than help bring the film to life, it sets it into a lull that is likely to induce sleep.If you like films like Gravity, Interstellar, and Space Odyssey, then just re-watch those because everything in Ad Astra has already been done better.",Ad Astra

653,cinema_lover97,I liked this movie and will see it again in future,9,10 December 2019,"I may be a little biased in favor of this movie but at least I am admitting it openly. Now the question arises why am I biased? It's cause it is the film which the real filmmakers would like or would have liked, certainly the ones who defined cinema with visual and thought-provoking storytelling. They didn't believe or cared for our tastes, they just wanted to express themselves regardless of what people thought. A story to tell for the soul, not for the financial goal. James Gray knows this and he is respecting the art form and not surrendering to the audience's demands. Yes, the trailer publicized the movie as something entirely different but I believe that was the studio's decision who wanted to market it as some space-action sci-fi movie to make a profit on box-office.The movie is flawed, I know that. The science is flawed and many things in the movie don't make sense from a scientific point of view. The timeline is inconsistent. The technology doesn't fall in line with the period. This may be because they didn't consult a scientist or a physicist and so on. Or maybe that the director didn't want his movie to be bound by the science, thus restricting his vision and the things he wanted to achieve or portray in the movie. The second issue is the pacing of the movie. We all must know or at least the people who are aware of the director's work is that almost all his movies are a slow burn. So, why did you expected it to be something different? Believe me when I say that I have watched more slow films than this, and this was as fast-paced and engaging as they come. The same self-made critics regard 2001: A Space Odyssey as the greatest sci-fi movie ever made, but it was also a slow burn, slower than this movie in fact. I am not attacking the greatness of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is a 10/10 for me, but at least people should try to appreciate an original vision in the slew of remakes and reboots. As far as the ending is concerned, I do not hate the anticlimactic ending, it respected the narrative of the first two acts. I was satisfied with it, and the hopeful closure it gave to Brad Pitt's character dilemma.There are many things that I liked about this movie. The direction, James Gray communicated the vastness and emptiness of space with such wonder and coldness that I felt it reaching towards me. I having an immense interest in astronomy and the cosmos, in general, found it transcending. The cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema was outstanding and nothing short of jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The editing was amazing, the transition between shots was smooth, long cuts were used which I was happy to see. Music by Max Richter was sublime. The mix between ambient music and industrial-rock inspired noises were pleasing to the ears. Production design and costume design were top-notch. The acting by Brad Pitt was him proving that he can restrain his natural acting instincts and give a performance that hides his face and shows a character.The reason I am giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is because I thought that Brad Pitt's monologues went on for too long and could have been used less frequently. Some gripes with the movie logic and how some somethings couldn't have happened but happened anyway. This is a slow movie and if you can't handle a slow burn then don't watch it, it is as simple as that.",Ad Astra

Speaking of the cast, Brad Pitt, this guy ladies and gentlemen is the main reason why this movie gets a 7/10 rating, he was so breathtaking and you feel for him every time he speaks, well done Legend, what a great year for you.",Ad Astra
659,sd-forum,It should have been longer.,7,18 September 2019,This was ok and fair. It could have been easily 30 minutes longer. It should have been longer. It's rushed and everything happens so fast that you don't get the necessary time to absorb the environment and the story. I was not transported. The entire time I felt I was on Earth and exactly where I was.,Ad Astra
660,Hamlet61982,I bet brad pitt drove this movie...,4,19 January 2020,"This movie wants to be more than it is. Pitt has an ability to pick books or projects that should be great, and puts himself in them and lessens them on and off screen in the process.
It's not that he's bad, his acting persona just doesn't fit the gravitas of the stories he produces/ picks.
Example: astra zenica. It could have been much better but for the fact that the pitch meeting went as follows:
"" -Think apocalypse now meets interstellar with a little gravity sprinkled in.
nice. What's the plot?daddy issues.what do you mean?daddy issues. That's the glue that drives the reason this guy leaves the planet to look for his dad whom has huge shoes to fill.that's it?yeah, it's all we need. Then we use epic cinematography shots with an inspirational/ menacing score and people will love it!are you sure brad?im brad pitt....here's $100 million.""That simple. Hollywood heard 2 things: big name actors. Popcorn visuals. Expect nothing less (and nothing more).
If you really really squint and try hard, you may be able to assign psychological metaphors and allegories regarding finding oneself in the stormy sea created by our childhoods and our search to escape. Sometimes at al costs.... but that's the movie it could have been. This one is too sloppy to be that.

661,The_Film_Auditor,Original and Captivating Movie!,8,25 September 2019,"I have always been a fan of space exploration, so when I heard this film's premise, I was sold on going to the theatre opening weekend. With that being said, I had high expectations. The trailers made the movie look so unique, and after watching it, it surpassed my expectations. Ad Astra tells the fully original, thrilling, emotional, and thought provoking story of a man who has to face himself, his father, and the galaxy as he travels to the outer depths of the solar system to confront his father and save the earth. Through Roy McBride's journey, the film explores themes of isolation, determination, and being grateful for what one has. The film also portrays a wide variety of moods throughout. There are many great scenes that are full of tension and suspense, and there are others that are emotionally powerful and memorizing. Despite the variety of themes and tones, it still feels like a very cohesive narrative with a thought-provoking message.On a technical level, two aspects that stood out were the cinematography and score. Each shot in the film seemed to have a great deal of thought and effort put into its composition. The use of reflections was a tool often used to create some really beautiful and interesting looking shots. Along with the reflections, the color choices really elevated the mood in some of the scenes. As for the score, I thought it was simple, but appropriately used to help evoke an emotional response from the audience. Both of these technical aspects were used to construct a beautiful viewing experience.All praise aside, there were a few things I did not care for in this film. Some of the scenes felt a bit out of place and did not really add to the overall story. These felt like things the studio insisted on being in the film to make it more accessible. Some of the science jargon could have been turned down a bit as well. I think it would have been more mysterious if they didn't try and explain a few things in a rather silly manner.Regardless of a few faults, I think this was one of the best movies of 2019 thus far. I had a lot of fun watching the film and felt absorbed by it the entire runtime. I would not have predicted this, but I think Brad Pitt has starred in my two favorite movies this year thus far. I really hope people go out and take a chance on this film because it desires some attention.",Ad Astra
662,web-534-393830,A linear trip from sons to fathers to gods,10,20 September 2019,"Brad Pitt fits well with Roy, the story of an introverted hero looking for reconciliation with himself, his father and what's greater than ourselves. With an epic soundtrack and meticulously set, the film moves from bright Earth to dim Neptune and each planet on the journey presents a linear series of encounters that mirror Roy's inner aspects to unfold. Ad Astra deserves a better ending and some Christian allegories lacerated the narrative, but I was left with the urge to watch it again, which is a good sign.",Ad Astra

665,inkwarp,this is GOOD. and a welcome change from the slew of superhero flicks...,6,22 September 2019,"I can understand some of the negative reviews. i can understand some finding this boring.. what i do not understand is the venom in some of these reviews.
This is the film Interstellar wanted to be.
it's visually gorgeous and brad pitt performence is a master class in sublety and nuance. the film is a journey where a man who thinks he is master of his emotions a facade that cracks as his journey progresses to the point that when emotion comes to the surface it has an emotional punch. this is what was missing in interstellar. i just could not care about the lead in that film.
the attention to detail is amazing, the action set pieces are wonderfully crafted. ( a 'gunfight between moon rovers is particularly memorable).
i feel this is a film to be watched again to fully absorb the wonder of it all, like a kubrick movie i think repeat viewings will make the viewer more appreciative of how good this movie actually is. no superhero antics here, just beautifully crafted scifi drama. and possibly brad pitt's finest moment.",Ad Astra

I liked this movie, except for one thing: I watched it on DVD, and I feel the pain of average movie sitters during this ambient adventure! Hard to swallow Ad Astra in cinema, but it goes well with your wife and cat on the coach. Some people say that there is lack of science near the end. Yes,it's true, but I think it was done on purpose. When you are closer to the End, in front of the Anti matter, staring at the ultimate void of your mind and soul- there comes a moment when Science doesn't matter.

668,DeusWar,When the Void Stares back: Ad Astra,8,10 August 2021,"A slow-moving film with some seemingly strong insight into the reality of humanity, Ad Astra, is a rare gem of a sci-fi movie. Throughout the film we are introduced to the future of a space-traveling mankind complete with a fully developed American space program, a developed and commercialized yet politically unstable moon, and mysterious mars settlement seemingly almost out of touch with humanity.Throughout the film we are introduced to some strong themes; the role of psychology in the future, corruption and evil always present in mankind, hero worship, and the ""reality"" of space-travel. Our main character played by Brad Pitt is a complex character who by suppressing his humanity is able to be for a time an emotionless soldier who is able to get any job done until he breaks down and reveals his humanity at the end. His dad, played by an aged Tommy Lee Jones, was a pioneer space traveler who in his strong desire to find life in the galaxy went to extreme lengths including abandoning his family, going on an extreme mission to Neptune, and eventually killing his crew after a breakdown and rebellion. The further he went away from earth, the further he went away from humanity, until his eventual death.Some hard questions are really pondered when watching this movie. Is the future of space travel worth it? Is there life outside of earth? What is most important in life? What is the extent of our humanity? Does science really have all the answers?We find by watching this movie that the psychological system can be abandoned (scene where main character fails psych test, yet completes the long-term mission). That human beings and science have definite limits (symbolized by the death of the Norway space crew, rebellion on the moon, and the killing of the Neptune crew by the main characters dad.) That after exploring the depths of space with our ambitious science projects, the end result is that there is no life elsewhere, that we are special creations of God, and that our home is earth. That human relations are important (at the end the main character desires one thing: to end his solitary existence, both by returning home to earth and being present in his relationship with his ex-wife.) That forgiveness is powerful (the main character knows his dad broke down mentally, but forgives him, and tries to take him back home despite the evils that his dad did.) Finally, the failure of atheism/scientism as portraited by the main characters father refusing to come to grips with the fact that life does not exist outside of earth, his breakdown and ultimate madness in this quest to find new life leading to the death of his own crew, and refusal to acknowledge God and return to earth leading to his own suicide. Through this we learn that even though in the scientific community the main characters dad is portrayed as a hero, in reality he is a flawed human, showing that the best of humanity is flawed. Hero worship is therefore folly, the real man is far different from the propaganda portraying him as a hero. The most powerful symbolism was shown in the way that as the film moved further away from earth, it seemed that the characters got further away from humanity. Fortunately, it ended with a powerful scene of forgiveness, acknowledging God, and desiring to return back to earth, I. E.-- back to humanity.Overall, this complex film deals with some heavy topics in an excellent way. It is likely not popular because it goes against the standard Sci-Fi dogma that has been fed to us for our whole lives -- that mankind can evolve and overcome his faults, that he is destined for the stars, and that life exists outside of earth. For those reasons, this movie will not sit well with many.",Ad Astra
669,gnc6971,Reminded me of Solaris,7,25 September 2019,"Good Syfy movie. I enjoyed it and will most likely buy it later but the ending was a little anti-climactic to me. What I was hoping might happen never actually happened lol, but still worth a see!",Ad Astra

Let's throw in some ray guns, fist fights, car chases, missiles, military uniforms, killer apes, and a nuclear explosion for good measure! That will keep a modern audience entertained!""What was the point of this movie? Perhaps they were trying to explore the psychological stresses of space travel or the place of humanity in the universe or the relationship between a father and son. I suppose we will never know because none of those themes are developed coherently or to completion.What was the plot? The crew of a near-future-SETI mission in orbit around Neptune (for whatever reason) is kept in isolation for such a prolonged period (for whatever reason) that they decide to mutiny to get home and a legendary battle ensues with the commander resulting in the release of magic antimatter ""pulses"" from a machine they had on board (for whatever reason) and these somehow impact Earth and affect the electrical grid (for whatever reason) and kill a few thousand people at a time (for whatever reason). Space Command decide the only course of action is to send Brad Pitt on a tour of the solar system where he gets to walk through a war zone, fight some space chimps, and hijack a rocket ship for our entertainment just so he can send a laser transmission to his dad in the off chance that he's still alive? He makes it back to Earth from Neptune by himself in a non-stop flight in the same ship he used to get from Mars to Neptune and you're telling me the only reason they didn't send him round trip from the get go was to save face because his dad is some big hero? Tens of thousands of people are dying and they know the magic pulses are coming from Lima and they're concerned about saving face which prevents them from launching from Earth or sending a signal from Earth? And why doesn't the Lima crew take rotations like every other isolated research base on Earth today including the ISS? And why is Lima station orbiting Neptune? Contrary to what Tommy Lee Jones tells us in one scene, Neptune is inside the heliosphere. Let's face it, this is all just an excuse to loosely follow the plot of 2001: A Space Odyssey but with more mindless action sequences.And what in the ever loving Christ was that dialogue? The exchanges between characters and the little clips we hear from the computers are at a level I would expect from a  modern RPG video game. Who wrote this tripe? Brad Pitt really tries his best to sell it with his subtle facial expressions and I have to give him credit, but holy cow is the writing pathetic.This movie is proof that a few planet renderings over spacemusic isn't enough to make a film deep and insightful. It may have been inspired by 2001 but it reminds me more of Armageddon.",Ad Astra

So much so, that it appeared to me that the lunar rover ""car chase"" scene and the psychotic baboons in space scene although very well done and exciting were just there to ""fill in"" are rather flat story line. Once those scenes were over, we got back to Major McBride's journey and it wasn't as interesting. One point id like to make is the final scene where Brad Pitt's ship was careering back to earth it was not dissimilar to the ship Taylor and his crew when they splash landed at the start of the 1968 Planet of The Apes.

You know you're in trouble when the music is crescendo-ing and you don't know why.The accuracy of the depiction of space is a mixed bag. It's clear that they put some thought into it, just not enough. For example, the lack of sound in the exterior shots contrasted with sound heard when conducted through bulkheads or through the ground was well done in many places. On the other hand, it looked like the spacecraft spent a lot of time accelerating through space, yet inside the astronauts remained weightless, which would not be the case. There are similar lapses in thinkingthrough the use of technology (and physical law) throughout the film.The plot, takes us through a tremendous amount of effort to examine a father and son relationship. Oh yes, and save the planet. The setup for requiring the Brad Pitt character to go to Mars makes no sense. Sending a manned mission to destroy the offending experiment orbiting Neptune makes no sense. We are very good these days at blowing things up from a distance. In the future depicted in the film, we would be much better at it. And then, in between Mars and Neptune. . . . baboons? Really?I suppose you can take the whole thing metaphorically.

699,digigod-738-671527,Ad Astra: Best Space movie Since '2001'?,9,5 December 2019,"I used this title because a lot of the scenes in this movie reminded me of Kubrick's masterpiece.
I don't get all the negative reviews. Maybe they were expecting a swashbuckling space opera with 'goodies vs. baddies' and loads of massive explosions.
This is definitely NOT that movie. It's not even 'traditional' SF, it's more of a slow burn, complex psychological drama set in space. I NEVER thought I'd write those words in praise, as that synopsis is the usual drivel that millennial amateurs with one digital camera, churn out.
There are definitely some adrenaline boosting action scenes, jump scares, tension abounds, everything one desires in a 'serious' movie.
So, like I say, what's with the haters? What do they want?
Somebody else said this could be Brad Pitt's career best, so far. I'm not sure about that, but it would have to be right up there.
This movie is awards material, no doubt. If only for the space effects.
I gave it 9 stars, partly to counter the negative reviews, but I would have definitely given it an 8 anyway.
Watch it, suspend your disbelief and enjoy an SF thrill ride and a psychological story of father and son estrangement. Best of two worlds (at least)!",Ad Astra

Second I didn't like brads lifeless character that mumbles and whispers the entire narration of the movie. You don't care about the characters except for how implausible and illogical they are. I also hate Tommy Lee Jones he's the same character in every movie pretty much and to me looked more like a washed up actor than an astronaut of any capacity. Its too long slow and it's one of those ones you keep watching hoping it might get better and then its over and that part never comes. This literally could have been a 1 hour outer limits or black mirror episode if you took out all the pointless and uneventful parts.You can watch it if you like but don't say you weren't warned.

I understand it is science fiction, but the scenes in microgravity, and the lack of any reference to how real physics works, just made me cringe. The moon does have lower gravity, but the characters were walking around as if it did not. Mars also has lower gravity, but again the characters just walked around like normal. So many other plot holes and inconsistencies made this movie feel like it was put together by people without any science knowledge at all. The majority of the dialogue was voice over by Brad Pitt.

The voice overs throughout the film works really well for it explains the character a lot better. I do not want to spoil any information but this movie has an emotional story that escalades the story a lot further than what you would expect. The visuals and the cinematography are great.

I like slow burn films and I like thought provoking and dialogue driven movies, but this is so boring it feels like a very dull job to just watch it. What is it's big problem? Where to begin? Here goes...1) 90% of the time not much happens.2) When things do happen to add drama it's just stupid stuff that makes no sense. I mean Moon Pirates? How did they get there? What are they pirating on an empty rock in space? Why are they trying to kill people when their only possible motive could be to kidnap them for ransoms? Now on to the killer baboons on a space ship sending out a distress signal, just ridiculous given that there is absolutely no follow up or explanation of the scene after it happens. Don't even start on how he hitchhiked on to the Neptune bound space ship, Douglas Adams did it more believably.3) Space travel never looked so slow yet fast, either that or the solar system never looked so small.4) Why do gigantic planets like Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune look so small?5) Why is the ending so dull, I mean they could've had an interesting, existential twist at the end whereby Tommy Lee Jones HAD discovered intelligent life on the outskirts of the solar system that was using him as a vessel to threaten mankind, but no, instead we get Brad saying a belated hello and goodbye to his dad then, after the most absurd scene of him flying through the (very small) ring around Neptune back to his space ship using a shield of some kind, he just rides a nuclear explosion or something back home ha ha.5) Finally I noticed we saw Earth, the Moon, Mars , Jupiter and Saturn on the short trip to Neptune but they totally avoided Uranus...surprising as they made a total arse of a film.",Ad Astra
718,Victreebong,The Horror of... Space...,10,22 September 2019,"A lot of reviews have hit the nail on the head already for this one. Sins of the father, journey to the underworld, pragmatism, isolation, bleak futures, Apocalypse Now, all of these describe Ad Astra quite well.Enter Roy; an A-list pragmatic and stoic Captain tasked with convincing a rogue astronaut to end a militant quest for extraterrestrial life at the outer rim of the solar system. If Gravity and The Martian are stories about the lengths it takes to get back safely to Earth and survival, Ad Astra is the antithesis on how far someone will go putting themselves in the path of the cosmos for a goal. Brad is on a mission, and the revelation on what he's saving is no where near as grand as what he has to do to get there. Space is quiet, cold, unforgiving, and in a very real way, the same reality we have already on Earth. Ad Astra takes a page from Elysium and The Expanse, examining dystopia in space. Whether it's vandalism, advertising, profiteering, social strife or politics, it winds up following humanity no matter where people wind up.Brad's the real draw here, but don't dismiss the supporting cast during this film. Between being plot devices and obstacles, most are there as stepping stones on Pitt's quest, but almost every one of them has a revelation whether spoken or quietly demonstrated in jest. That being said, my boy just cannot get enough screen time in. Every shot of Pitt is a new side that we haven't seen before. This isn't the arrogant Tyler Durdem or the alcoholic Mickie. No sad Benjamin Button, no worrisome Louis, no vengeful Agent Mills. This is Brad Pitt in weaponized form. Always one step ahead, always cool and collected. Plot armor for days, and yet completely vulnerable to a self-destructing chaos around him. His wife can not penetrate him, his colleagues cannot control him, the ****ing solar system cannot impede his conquest. Brad Pitt, aka Captain Roy McBride is the astronaut on fire. There's one scene where he's stoneface to the point of catatonia and a single tear roles down his right cheek. Be on the lookout during award season...The visuals are somewhere between Gravity and Apocalypse Now. I know that's been said a couple of times, but it's the truth. Long sequence shots are taken of Brad in vulnerable states whether succumbing to internal struggles, dealing with isolation anxiety, or any number of intense psychological symptoms catastrophe instills. A lot of shots are blink and you'll miss it, or forewarnings of what lies seconds ahead; empty satellite corridors and pod doors with telltale signs of psychotic breaks. Most of the film is slow paced and mixed with exposition, but the action sequences between are dynamic. I think every sequence with conflict was a new trope that hadn't been fully explored yet. One in particular involving lab test animals is so (graphically) accurate with real world accounts, it almost sickens viewers. And for those who want to argue about explosions or sounds in the vacuum of space, just remember that our sun explodes 24/7 and makes LOTS of background noise.Ad Astra isn't for everyone. There's no silver lining. No comedy, except for cynical social satire. The plot is simple and the narrative straightforward. But if you can get around those Ad Astra is the closest movie in 40 years to capturing the harrowing reality of where our species is going and why it's ultimately the same dreary consequences. It will bring you down at the same time that it lifts you into the heavens.",Ad Astra
719,cathalokane,"Beautiful, but meandering, dull, and incoherent. Spoilers.",5,30 September 2019,"Really disappointing. This viewer found himself struggling to stay awake about a third of the way through this picture. I had to jump around the seat a bit to stop myself getting a bit too comfortable and drifting off.If a film is going to deliberately sacrifice excitement and drama for scientific accuracy and a sense of foreboding, it really shouldn't only go half way. Ad Astra is at pains to emphasise the sluggish silence of space, and the tortured introspections of an emotionally stunted protagonist and his connection to his father, which is good, but it is all horribly undermined when you have Brad Pitt clambering into a rocket through a hatch as it's taking off, and succeeding.For every glorious expansive shot of planets and space travel, or interesting psych evaluation, there is a baffling plot contrivance that feels artificially implanted into the film to add some sense of excitement or tension. The most obvious culprits are the space monkeys, the moon pirates and the race to sneak onto the rocket already mentioned. Without these bits shoehorned in, the film would be really dull, but possibly more consistent. With them, it feels terribly incoherent.There are some interesting elements in this story. Space is what this story is sold on, but it's really a human story about men and obsession. Unfortunately, this really interesting thematic isn't given time to breath. Brad Pitt follows his father into space and, like his father, ends up killing people he regards as inferior in pursuit of a larger goal. This could be read as a story about family, legacy and the fact that all of us, to some extent, are tied to the paths of our parents. If the director had focused on this and not been sidelined trying to make it more ""cinema-friendly"", we might have had a winner. Instead it falls a bit flat and while you're trying to mull over the implications of Pitt's psychological state and deep connection to his father, you have rabid unexplained space monkeys tearing someone's face off. It's a little bit jarring.A confused film that could have done with identifying what it wanted to be, before it was made. As it has turned out it's a bit of a mist mash and unsatisfying. Add in a fairly unconvincing main plot line and it's all a bit of a let down.",Ad Astra

The director says ""...""the most realistic depiction of space travel that's been put in a movie."" Umm, I don't think so. In fact, I know very little about space travel, but the effects looked like 10 years ago.
By the way, what space agency would allow an 80 year old retired astronaut to fly from the Earth to the Moon?? How is that realistic?? Also, what about the Baboons on the marooned space ship. How did they survive?? And what about that car chase scene on the Moon? What did that accomplish?? Nothing and another waste of time. Sorry, but this movie either needed a complete re-shoot or just put on the shelf.
Don't bother spending your hard earned money and seeing this on the big screen, it's not worth it. Just wait for it to show up on any cable or streaming service. And then don't watch it unless you need to fall asleep.
By the way, except for Brad Pitt, all the other ""A"" list actors spent about 10 minutes (or less) on screen. Not even sure why Liv Tyler was cast as his wife. What a waste of a character. We are not invested in their relationship at all, so why even have the scenes. This movie is about 2 hours and should have been about 80 minutes. But that would NOT have made it better, only shorter.

I really want to be see the writing team coming up with this. What were they thinking?When Pitt gets to Mars, he sneaks onto a spaceship blasting off to Neptune, seconds before it takes off.

728,utdaxiao,"Good graphics, bad story and delivery",6,10 December 2019,"The movie has just been released in China, for some reason three months later than the west. No idea why. So I just went to see it over the weekend.First, the graphics look AMAZING. The space travel, the moon, the lunar rovers, Mars, the space bomb explosions, all look amazingly designed to the very detail. The beginning of the movie with the space travel is also well presented. In this case, the details matter most because you can imagine yourself in going to spaceport to travel to the moon, in the same way we do nowadays to catch a plane. You feel that it is a world of conflict such as our society is nowadays.The plot itself is where the movie fails BADLY. I think the director wanted the focus the movie to be about the psychological aspects of the main character, but the development of the story was not so well polished. They don't explain the motivation nor back story of the characters, they leave many things without closure, the behaviours don't make sense. And many questions unanswered: What's the conflict in system? What's up with that unnecessary trip to Mars? Why Brad Pitt had to do everything? Couldn't it be someone else? It is not explained and the pieces of the movie are not well attached. The movie seems lazy in developing the story.And, of course, the scientific part. The are many problems with it. Gravity on the moon and Mars should be less than on Earth, but the movie seems to ignore inside the stations and in other convenient parts. Also, they couldn't just stop that ship on its way to Mars. I don't how they found so much water in Mars that you can swim on it with a heavy astronaut suit. And no idea how space pirates have so much resources to live on the moon spotless. And the biggest of them all, how the hell do you prove there is no other life form in the UNIVERSE, by travelling to Neptune?

734,NotTheOne000,Minimalist and profound,9,6 July 2020,"Ad Astra is a difficult film to pin down. The plot is simple, the story linear, the central relationship narrowly defined. There are no great emotional highs and lows. Everything is restrained and contained, the performances are low-key, the music is low-fi. The scenery is beautiful, yet stark. Desolate even. Yet there is, within the film, something important.The film projects us around a century into the future. We are searching for life beyond our own world. We have become obsessed with it, even. There are hints that this is because we feel trapped within our own limited existence. Fighting over resources, no different from our primate ancestors. Unable to break out of our limitations, so seeking something beyond ourselves to help us evolve. To help us be successful in this future, we undergo continual emotional analysis smooths out our destructive and self-destructive nature and keeps us balanced. We are judged to be stable or judged to be in need of support. No value judgement is made, though, we are simply observed for the sake of practicality. There is merely the recognition of what we are and that we must improve ourselves. If we do not improve ourselves, we do not achieve.Our hero, Roy McBride, is the ultimate product of this future. He is incapable of emotion and his life is devoid of meaning. This makes him a success in this future. But the film does not state this is wrong in of itself. In fact, his father is the opposite - full of passion and drive - but is a killer. His passion is grand, lofty, for the betterment of humankind. His passion takes him to the edge of the solar system to pursue extra terrestrial life. But that passion kills and kills ruthlessly. His passion is as inhuman as his son's lack of emotion. Roy's father is the embodiment of what is wrong with humanity; a self-deluded megalomaniac and ideologue. He is what we are trying to no longer be. But he is also what drives us onwards.As Roy journeys towards his father, people die in an almost incidental way. But people die all the time. Thus is life. Our hero accepts his role in their deaths, when appropriate, but does not allow himself to feel guilt. Guilt is for history to judge. Is he a murderer like his father? Yes, but only in the sense that events happen and he is part of those events and that people die because of them. That is, for every one of us, at least a partial truth. A shared criminality for all of us, for to be part of humanity is to be part of a society that kills.When Roy reaches his father, he finds he still has love for him. He has recognised he is capable of rage, but he has extinguished it along with all his other emotions. But his emotions are in rebellion and he has found one that matters to him more than the need to be emotion-free. He has love for an impotent old man, his father, a killer and a monster and possible mass murderer, yet still his father. When his father admits that he has never cared for people, only for his cause, Roy forgives him. But his father cannot live with that forgiveness, and would rather die lonely. Sinners do not always want to be forgiven, because it can be a terrible punishment for them. To be judged inferior and yet still be offered love, that is something many humans find deeply problematic. It is the antithesis of our current social media lifestyle. The humility we need to accept that kind of love is often absent, because it requires us to admit to our sins.Unlike most sci-fi, Ad Astra isn't asking us what happens when we meet alien beings, or what happens to us when society starts to collapse, or what happens when we take warfare into space. It doesn't throw Big Ideas and Grand Themes in our face like some wondrous puzzle to be figured out. Instead, it gently asks us to consider what our response will be when we realise that it's pointless to continually look beyond ourselves in an effort to fix the human condition. And how do we find a way to accept that we are truly alone? No God, no aliens, no AI father / mother figures to make everything better. No external demons to fight against, no great causes to pursue, no grand mysteries to unravel and no great evil to overcome. Just us, with all our flaws, keeping on going... because? If there is genuinely nothing beyond us to fight for, then why fight?If the film has a message, it's that it's time we stopped believing that humanity is a bigger deal than it actually is, that we're so smart and so gifted and so amazing that we deserve something more than what we already have. Reaching for the stars will take us nowhere new because we will always take ourselves with us. So, lets stop worrying so much about the great achievements we think we should attain, and instead allow ourselves to simply enjoy our lives together.",Ad Astra

Of course, in the movie, Tommy Lee Jones chose the latter, puts work first. Puts career and human society first, over and above his son and wife. The son is not a total failure. The movie is told from the son's POV. It is entirely and consistently. The son, Brad Pitt, is there is every scene. He is there on screen almost continously.The son has done his best (in life), but there is a gaping hole in his heart because of which his relationship with his wife is also flawed in the same manner. He puts his work above his wife. His father is his ideal, his source of meaning to life.He can feel his father and slowly he finds the hole in his heart is too big to fill without finding his dad, whereupon the mission becomes a personal quest, more than duty.Now watch the movie with just this premise and you will find how deeply meaningful this movie is. There is ugliness in equal measure as there are clear depictions of ugliness in beautiful backdrops. Only failing of the movie is the distracting technological backdrop. There is a reason for this as scientism and positivism is taking hold in our society despite Nietzsche's warning.This is a must watch.Thanks for reading.",Ad Astra
738,nja89,"Horrible, boring & scientifically impossible!",1,23 September 2019,"First - The beginning sequence was the most fast paced part of the entire movie, but was a complete scientifically impossibility. There is no way that you can fall from earths orbit back down to earth by falling off a ladder on a space station. Its not possible! The only way that could happen is if they were still in earths stratosphere, but it was clear they were not!I guess the writers forgot that there is zero gravity in earths orbit & its impossible to fall without gravity. Thats how astronauts do space walks regularly.2nd. Theres no fire or explosions in space. There is no oxygen for fire to burn! An explosion is impossible. And an explosion causing an astronaut to fall down to earth from orbit is just RIDICULOUS! You've got to be so ignorant of basic science to believe that.3. The whole movie was SLOW AS HELL except for the very beginning!. I kept hoping it would get better but it did not!.HATED THIS MOVIE. Waste of time.

739,poewilson,Koyaanisqatsi with a plot,8,6 December 2019,Ad Astra is a gorgeous contemplative film marketed as action sci-fi film which it is most certainly not. It is closer to being a cross between Koyaanisqatsi and 2001: A Space Odyssey. You are watching this film to be lost in its beauty and to sit in that darkness contemplating humanity and its very existence. If that is not what you are looking for this film was never meant for you and I feel bad that some marketing team manipulated you.,Ad Astra

The movie was slow boring and failed to connect, next time leave the drama on earth and dedicate more plot on science like life on other planets it teased the audience with it and left us in the dark, be more like interstellar, you will always have the human drama in space movies but not too much of it, make it more an action sci fi space movie.",Ad Astra
741,glenn_gallagher,Mixed feelings on this....,7,4 December 2019,"This is not 'Gravity', 'The Martian' or 'Interstellar'.
I will admit my expectations were not met when I first saw this movie but probably because I was expecting a space flick. After the 2nd time around I appreciated it much more as I had shed the expectations of a popcorn, space blockbuster and watched it for what it is. I really enjoyed and identified with the main characters struggle to maintain neutral emotions in a job and voyage that would require a massive amount of training, knowledge and confidence despite the personal connection to the mission on hand.
The science could and should have been much more solid. Unfortunately several basic laws of physics and astronomy were ignored to guide the story along the yellow brick road from earth, to the moon, onto Mars and then the edge of our solar system.
I would recommend people ignore the negative reviews and give 'Ad Astra' a watch as the positives far out ways the negatives on an entertainment platform.",Ad Astra

A supposed emotional discourse, without emotion, a result without transcendence and above all zero originality. The film 2010 (not to mention the great legends of the genre that it doesn't even touch) contains itself in one minute more accuracy about the trips to space that is in all this footage. Moon vehicles that run at over 100 kilometers per hour! Raising dust on their trajectory! People falling from a space station (initial antenna scene) to Earth by parachute! Astronauts moving through space and going from one ship to another unattached and without the aid of devices and landing exactly where they wanted to go! What a complete nonsense. Why would they do this? Who are they trying to fool?

Many of the plot points are ridiculous and have been mentioned in other reviews so I won't repeat them. The science is wrong and inconsistent. Somehow they magically control gravity and don't control gravity. They need some sort of anti-mater propulsion to get to the outer planets and they don't.There are also bunch of loosely tied random scenes that don't advance the plot, don't provide background, or further the understanding of anything.

I really liked the philosophy behind the story and that was really amazing to me!In my opinion, there should be great teaching points in movies along side their visual attractions and those which are more popular due to younger people's desires, are going a bit too much to a ""pointless just for fun way"" nowadays...",Ad Astra

751,listofnames,A spiritual journey or a sci-fi adventure?,8,23 September 2019,"Ok, so I won't be able to do this review justice because this feels like a film I would need to see again in order to fully digest. I did not realise the ambition and scope of the film until half way through when I finally figured out what the film is about. This is NOT a science fiction film or an adventure film or film about daddy issues. This is meditation on the human condition, on ultimate meaning, on the self. Do not expect a linear film that will make easy sense. It does not, and for its purposes cannot.Most of the things that happen in this film are an allegory for something much deeper. The journey into space is a journey into the self in order to discover something that it feels is missing. Pitt goes looking for the meaning he thinks he will receive if he gets his dad back. His dad went into space looking for meaning in the search for extra terrestrials. Both thought their careers as astronauts would fulfil them also. When each realises that this meaning is not there, when they are faced with the vast emptiness and infinity of space (the self), then they either lose it completely and become suicidal or they find ultimate peace in it.Brad Pitt's character throughout the beginning and middle of the film is struggling with appearances. He is concerned with how he appears to others (constant psychological evaluations to make sure he is normal/fit for space flight) because others are also concerned/place value on appearance, rather than truth. Pitt gradually becomes able to let himself see who he really is/how he really feels throughout the film. He opens up to himself. By seeing how he really is he is able to deconstruct who he thinks he should be. He finally loses his constructed sense of self. His dad is the last vestige of meaning in his life that he must shed. If his dad cannot help him then no one can. And thus the great truth is realised. We are all on our own and are completely without meaning and the self is completely empty of all content. But this is a great liberation. This is the ancient truth of the human condition that spiritual traditions have been teaching for millennia.I love science fiction and I am very interested in spirtuality so this film naturally appeals to me. The blend of the two is quite unique. Its quite unique that spirituality is even a topic for a film especially something that appears to a big Hollywood blockbuster. If you go into this film thinking that this is an allegory for spiritual enlightenment then you will enjoy it for what it is and marvel at the inventiveness of the allegory and the spectacle. If you go in thinking it is going to be a linear sci-fi adventure you will be sorely disappointed.Perhaps it could be criticised for trying to play both sides of that equation rather than being firmly on one side or the other. It tries to blend sci-fi action with something much deeper and so alienates/dilutes each of those sides. I like both sci-fi action and deeper stuff so I was happy enough but perhaps its telling that it took me to half way through the film when I sensed a shift from it being a sci-fi flim to something much deeper. Perhaps it should have been more true to itself from the start.",Ad Astra
752,kshehzad,A Slow Burner but Still an Exciting Space Adventure,7,21 September 2019,"Once Sir Arthur C. Clarke said, ""two possibilities exist: either we are alone in the Universe or we are not. Both are equally terrifying.""Sir Clarke mentions two extreme ends but there are plenty of things in the middle which can only be viewed when you understand the difference of being probabilistic and realist. Brad Pitt starer ""Ad Astra"" is all about revitalizing the faith in what is lying in the middle. ""Ad Astra"" is a Latin phrase which means ""to the stars"" directed by James Gray who previously directed films like ""Lost City of Z"" and ""We Own the Night"". Gray has directed ""Ad Astra"" in similar fashion as Stanley Kubrick and Christopher Nolan but aims different objective. The kind of treatment Gray has given to ""Ad Astra"" it seems he has valued the aesthetics of modern day viewers who are willing to accept the combination of both commercial as well as art house cinema. By adding commentary in Brad Pitt's voice throughout the film he has not left everything to viewers' own understanding which makes narrative different in its own way but gripping. Unlike Nolan, James Gray has not left every riddle for common denominators to solve but unravel every mystery which makes him creating his own signature style in film-making. One can say Gray's story-telling is similar to Nolan but with no abstract ending.
This year belongs to no one but Brad Pitt. First with Tarantino's ""Once Upon A Time in Hollywood..."" and now in ""Ad Astra"" he has surprised critics with his subtle but highly attractive acting. In both the movies he has seemingly played tough guy but not without natural vulnerability of a common human being. Psychological dilemma of being a son of highly decorated astronaut father who has gone to historical space mission and same time as a failing husband, Pitt beautifully performs a role of a person who is getting empty from inside but unexpected news about his missing father creates a surge in him to find more about his father's secret space mission called Project Lima which was now threatening whole solar system. Though Brad Pitt is a trained army man with the rank of a major in ""Ad Astra"" but carries extreme vulnerability of as a son who is worried about his father who lost in deep space mission. Pitt nails this role with an ease due to calm and collected demeanor he possess. In many scenes, Pitt does not speak a single word but with his expressions explain all. So far this is Brad Pitt's best performance. Two space cowboys Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland are seasoned actors and have performed their assigned roles with their known exuberance.The other noteworthy aspect of ""Ad Astra"" is its technical department. Cinematography is jaw dropping which was expected because astute James Gray has acquired the services of 'Hoyte Van Hoytema' who has also shot ""Interstellar"" for Nolan. There is lots of influence of Alfonso Cuaron's ""Gravity"" on sound department. There is no doubt ""Ad Astra"" will be an automatic selection for next year's Oscars in both cinematography and sound design categories.On the whole, ""Ad Astra"" is a slow burner but still an exciting space adventure wrapped in Kubrick's style psychological layers and presented in Nolan's way. With the heavy influence of other legendary film makers still James Gray has successfully carved out his own compelling style of storytelling which makes ""Ad Astra"" one of the best films of this year.",Ad Astra

I'm a big fan of these kind of space movies and although I didnt love it as much as I loved Interstellar, it didn't hurt my brain with too much thinking either.
I loved the way Brad Pitts Character ended up doing similar actions as his dad on his travels through space (killing off his crew mates) though unintentionally done like his father. , I thought it was a interesting choice.
The scene on the moon and my heart racing, the baboon scene made me jump and I was getting tearful near the end when Pitts character was touching his dad for the first time...and then again at the ""let me go,son"" scene.

Perhaps this is out of his range. High tech, astrophysics, space travel.
I actually thought of stopping the video midway through the film.
In the films 2001 and the first Star Wars the special effects are just as much fun as the story.

It's more about Pitt following his dad's career path as an astronaut at the cost of a healthy, normal life, having difficulty forming relations because of his dad abandoning them for his grand mission. Behind the good acting and fancy cinematography (almost painfully trying too hard) is full of issues:-Pitt's fate: guess being a murderer like his dad will be brushed off and he'll pay more attention to his wife?
-Earth's and the moon's conflicts over resources will continue on I guess. Weird, since the settings on Earth seem pretty much like a modern day first world place. And what's with the pirates on the moon? Makes no sense what they were going for. They carried no gear/supplies. Hostages? Not when they were shooting and killing them.
-Top secret flight to Mars of such importance in a commercial ship that stops for a random SOS, which was taken over by monkeys. Ok.
-Top secret flight of even greater importance to Neptune to stop the Ima Project that would destabilize the earth and other planets entrusted to 3-4 crew with 1 gun on board.
-Lady who helped Pitt board the rocket could've simply let the existing crew go up and end the Lima Project. Instead she helped him take over the ship where he killed the crew. Wouldn't she know the crew will KILL him once he boards? Whatever, she's now his accomplice.
-There's no sense of awe and isolation of space. You just keep watching Pitt deal with his emotions on his way to his dad, like riding in a bus but not looking out the window in a new place.

774,ArtistGrl,Good but not for everyone,7,25 September 2019,"Honestly, I'm on the fence about grading this film. As a big space exploration enthusiast, I'm tempted to give it the highest possible score. A production of this calibre comes only once in a few years (I'm talking Interstellar / The Martian / Contact / 2001 A Space Odyssey magnitude). I wish more films like this were being produced. At the same time, this film fails on an important note where the aforementioned others have succeeded, to follow the breathtaking space endeavor visuals with an equally thrilling plot, appealing to the general audience as well as to space buffs such as myself. Granted, it is a very rare goal to reach in a world tainted by the mediocrity of appealing to too wide an audience, by dumbing down potentially decent films (The likes of Armageddon, where Lyv Tyler played a similar role). Choosing between the two possibilities, I prefer films to fail on account of aiming too high over setting too low a bar.Similarly to Contact and to Interstellar, Ad Astra sets to explore the personal themes of a father / child bond over the vast distances of space. Intertwining ingenuity, bravery and advanced technology (grounded to a believable level that seems like it could be just within reach), with the most basic human instincts of loving our family and wanting to protect them.Yes, this could have been faster paced. The psych evaluation monologues were a bit much. Some scenes we could do without (lunar pirates). But it was such a delight to watch the beautifully and realistically rendered space scenes on the big screen. I am grateful to all the creators for pulling this off and appreciate the obvious effort that went into this. Thank you.",Ad Astra

Astronauts aren't supermen. They can't fly, and change direction in a vacuum. There were many instances of this. So many, in fact, that I almost stopped watching. For example, spinning away from a rotating RADAR it is highly unlikely that you'll return to your spacecraft thousands of kilometers away. If Neptune's rings were that dense, we could see them from earth. Going through that much gravel would slow anyone down, but not Brad.
And that's just a tiny fraction of impossibilities that this movie is laced with.
McBride, tracking down his father Clifford, in the orbit of Neptune makes no sense. All his superiors assume Cliff is dead. Then they decide they can't trust him to make the trip. With all that going on, Roy should not have made it.

What really kills Ad Astra is the score, the lack of compelling dialogue and a really poorly written monologue. This is no Interstellar or The Martian.

783,antonydwhitehead,"Humourless, dull, depressing trope . . .",2,11 December 2019,"I'm a sci-fi fan and had high hopes of Ad Astra despite the mixed reviews. Sadly though Ad Astra is a dud. A big dud.
Positives: it looks fantastic and posits some interesting ideas. Cinematography editing and music all good. Tick. Tick. Tick.
Negatives: where to start. Looks very much like the Director's vision was badly compromised. The storyline is deeply flawed. There are shoe-ins of Apocalypse Now / quest to find rogue astronaut father. A smattering of Blade Runner / commercialised lunar colonies (one of the film's best ideas tho undeveloped). Shades of 2001 / Interstellar / Gravity (a touch of Alien (with crazed ape rather than creature)). But smeared messily together. Images of chaotic script conferences with the Director pulling his hair out!
Some of the set pieces are ludicrous: the Mayday / ghost space ship schtick. What was that about ?! Crazed apes in space! And the buggy riding pirates on the Moon. Brilliantly envisioned but where did they come from?!
And absolutely no humour. At all. Compared to Ad Astra 2001 is like Marx Brothers Comedy. Kubrick overflowing with intelligence and wit. Ad Astra has the least humour of any film in the observable universe. It is as dry of wit as the Moon is dry of water.
But the worst part of this film by far is it's lead actor. Brad Pitt is relentlessly, depressingly dull. His interior monologue made me want to head for the nearest airlock. Quickly! And the endless psych evaluations! Why?? And the fact his character oscillates from moody self-obsessive to gung-ho action hero when the script requires it. ""Quick surf through the rings of Neptune, anyone?"" With token female characters who are woefully underwritten. Tho Ruth Nagga's character breathes pure oxygen into this turgid mess. Please. Please. Take her to Neptune Brad.
And as the film (to everyone's relief) grinds to a conclusion we discover Brad's character has discovered emo in Space. Do we believe this? Do we care?
Finally the science. For a film purporting to be realistic ""hard"" sci-fi there are simply too many glaring inconsistencies. Orbital mechanics thrown out the porthole (spaceships stopping and starting like buses). No evidence of reduced gravity inside the lunar base. Chemical, electrical and nuclear derived explosions manifested in the vacuum of space. Abundant liquid water under the surface of Mars. Fantastical propulsion systems that get you to the outer planets in a few angst-ridden days. And guns. Guns everywhere. Parts of this film portrays Pitt as some kind of latter day lantern-jawed taciturn space cowboy. At times the militarisation of Space looks like a sop to Trump's Space Force. More like Spent Force!
And whatever happened to climate change? Issue ignored. Completely.
So to sum up: if you are looking to watch hard sci-fi that is exciting, character driven, well-plotted and reasonably scientifically consistent then watch The Expanse. Avoid Ad Astra. At all costs.",Ad Astra
784,lambgary444,Apocalyse Now this isn't,1,29 September 2021,"I am 1 hour into this movie first let me say I hope that Brad got paid a lot of money to put his name on the piece of crap. I mentioned Apocalsye Now because so far that's what their stealing from. One guy talking to himself while ""alleged"" danger is going on. One big problem Apocalsye Now had a ton of actions in between the talking this movie has almost none. I honestly don't want to watch the end its that boring. Instead I will watch the end and come back and let you know if it picks up in the second half or if you should ignore this movie altogther. The movie never got better my god is was boring and the writing got worse. I clicked on a spoiler only to say this in the end he leaves the Lima project. He uses a panel to sheild himself as he hurtles towards the ship he came in. One big thing they left out this ship which he flew over 2 billion miles back to earth was broken. I am not talking about the damage that wouldn't let him dock. The electrical system was fried when he got there that means this ship was beyond useless. At best he had oxygen for a little while but not to last to earth. There would be no way to navigate the shi p with the CPU fired etc.. Not to mention he took 2 ships to just get to Mars how would one damage one make it all the way back when 1 ship in perfect shape could't make it there ? This is a mind numbing boring film with bad writing and yes bad acting as i said from the begining the tried to steal from films like Apocalsye Now but there was nothing at all intresting to make you want to watch this. If you get one thing out of this review its Don't waste your time watching this movie thats what the title should have been ""waste of time"" !",Ad Astra

787,hp-33729,Not as clever as you think,3,6 December 2019,"The current top review says this movie is a ""masterful psychological drama disguised as a gorgeous sci-fi epic"".No, it's not.Some people feel very proud of themselves that they were able to find some kind of ""deep meaning"" in this movie and the rest of us sheep just ""don't get it"" and should go back to Marvel movies. I'd hate to burst their bubble, but that deep meaning is spelled out for the viewer pretty clearly by the protagonist, it's not like you're left wondering about the meaning of this movie for weeks, banging your head in the wall in frustration. And it's a very simple idea too, you'd probably expect more complicated thoughts from something that has the facade of a ""sci-fi epic"".The drama is OK though. What probably wasn't a good idea is that they decided to wrap this story in sci-fi instead of a low budget TV drama set in a big city. They clearly didn't have enough interesting stuff for the protagonist to do on his journey, and in a desperate attempt to fill the 2 hours, everything he has to do to get from point A to point B is extremely convoluted and stupid, and you realize this pretty quickly, even if you are not looking for mistakes. Unfortunately there's so much nonsense in this movie that you just can't take it seriously as a proper sci-fi.One thing I agree with is that the visuals are gorgeous, the movie definitely has the look of a sci-fi epic, but it's very very far from one.",Ad Astra
788,karmazyn,"Ad Astra...movie about empty space, harshness of long space travel and how to survive encounter with a space monkey !",5,24 October 2019,"What do you know about Lima project? I ask you WHAT DO YOU KNOW ? Nothing, fear not I am here to tell you. So Team of Astronauts is sent to the edge of the solar system, to Neptune so they could look for extraterrestrial life. With no interference from the other planets they would have clear view of the empty blackness. Mission is led by Brad Pitt's father played by Tommy Lee Jones, the most distinguished astronaut in a history of space program....Mission Control loses contact with the crew and 16 years later massive, extinction level event is triggered. It is linked with the mission and Brad Pitt, now older and resilient astronaut is sent on the secret mission to Mars to try to establish line of communication with Lima project.Opening scene of the movie was really well done and it is a shame that the whole movie could not be like this. Most of the movie is about Brad Pitt's journey to the edge of the solar system. Everything in space is so dead. Humans are fragile and can easily die or lost sanity in space. We are limited by our own physicality and it does not take a lot to break us. We are not ready to travel through space in search for answers, why would we anyway if everything we need is here on Earth. No matter where we go we take world's problems with us. We commercialized moon, we commercialized Mars, we lie to each other. We still wage war on our planet and newly colonized moon. We desperately want to find extraterrestrial life, maybe to learn from it and find our saviors ? This movie however gives us less satisfying finale but at the same time a lot to think about.In all this mix we have Brad Pitt who wants to reconnect with his father, find answer to why he abandoned him and what happened to him. Love can bind us for life and can make us unimaginable things for the people we love but at the same time fear of responsibility and lack of feelings might work the opposite way. This movie is more about humanity and feeling of isolation.The cinematography was great, space and planet looked like straight taken from a NASA documentary. The technology is believable and you can see that it might as well be vision of the future. Is that where we are heading? Judge it for yourself but fair warning. This movie is a really slow burner and not a lot is happening. The pacing is odd and mysterious encounter with space monkey was totally unnecessary. You might feel exhausted when watching this movie but I think it was intentional and I liked it. I saw it at the cinema and cant imagine that watching at home would have the same impact, therefore I cannot recommend this movie to anyone other than die hard s-f fans.",Ad Astra

Saying things like that it is unscientific, too slow and in the end the takeaway is ''we should all just love each other''. I fully get it, but I think those people weren't actually paying attentionPersonally, I had to watch it twice because I wasn't focused at the start the first time, the movie just didn't quite make sense to me. Here is what Brad Pitt says in the opening scenes ''I am calm and steady. I am ready to do my job to the best of my abilities. I am focused only on the essential to the exclusion of all else. I will not allow myself to be distracted, I will not allow my mind to linger on that which is unimportant. I will not rely on anyone or anything. I will not be vulnerable to mistakes."" During this monologue there are scenes of his wife is leaving him at some earlier point in time.While he is alone on the ship heading to Neptune, there is this scene where his ex-wife says ''You seem preoccupied with work. I just feel like I'm on my own all the time. I don't know what we are doing. You are so distant, I mean even when you are here I don't know where you are. I feel like I'm looking for you all the time, trying to connect to you, be close to you and it sucks. You know I have my own life, I'm my own person and I can't just wait for you.'' It surely paints a picture of an emotionally distant person, disengaged etc.Brad Pitt never really smiles until the final few minutes. Here is what he says in the psych evaluation at the end ''I am steady, calm. I am active and engaged. I am aware of my surroundings and those in my immediate sphere. I'm attentive''. In addition we see scenes of him meeting his ex-wife while he says still during the evaluation ''I am focused on the essential to the exclusion of all else'', implying that the 'essential' changed for him. Also ''I will rely on those closest to me and I will share their burdens as they share mine. I will live and love.''Hopefully, my review helps someone out there connect with the movie just as much as I did. It is really subdued and you have to ''get lost in it'', not checking your phone, and not thinking of what your going to eat for dinner. It's multilayered and complex, and you might have to watch it more than once.I didn't even mention the relationship between Roy his dad who abandoned him to look for ''bigger ideas'' like finding alien life.

794,registers-944-48791,Weak plot breaks the whole movie,2,29 February 2020,"I understand director's intent was to show a realistic space travel. But that didn't mean its plot had to be so bad and boring. Take in example Interstellar, which was fully supported by our knowledge of physics and had huge effort to make its worlds plausible, and has an awesome plot.During most of the movie we're presented to this odd situation, of a space crew who went on the most challenging endeavor of its time and remained so decades to come, and then just lost communication, to decades later start throwing anti-matter beams directly into Earth. We figure that something's wrong, and the only way to find out the truth would be to travel there.We have this son-father situation, which is the deepest the movie can get. We're told that for some odd reason the authorities are trying to communicate with the father and has no response. Instead of considering some malfunction, for some reason they believe he's denying communication and hiding, and that maybe if he receive messages from his son he'll answer.Then all of a sudden the messages are aborted and Roy, the son, is meant to be sent back to Earth. During that crisis, added to the common pirates, I kept wondering why any travel between Earth, Moon and Mars would be happening. We're then told that the ship's captain simply had available with her a top secret video, of the father communicating that part of his crew had mutined and he'd killed them and the innocent together, just before he cut communication. We're never explained what happened for them stopping sending messages, did the father replied? how did they find him afterall?Then another implausible security breach, Roy just manages to get inside the ship just during its launch! How could the security be so bad, even more with pirates around?! And why did the captain help him get there, what was she expecting to achieve? And how could be possible a single action, even by accident, kill the whole crew? Didn't control have any means of taking control of the ship and stop it?Anyway, Roy was on the travel and I expected to have most of the questions answered when he got there. But only thing we're given is that the anti-matter beams were due to some malfunction on the ship and the father claimed to be trying to fix it. And that's it. Oh yeah, and that he had found no sign of life, which led to crew wanting to go back to Earth, and this was the ""mutiny"" that made him kill them all, because he didn't wanna go back.And finally the father accepted allow Roy destroy the ship and go back, with no resistance. All he decided to do was to not go back with him, and instead go drift on Neptune's orbit.The ship is destroyed, Roy gets back to Earth, he's greeted by some military, who seems to not arrest him after all he had done, and then the movie ends, like that. WTF. The few answers we get are flat and with no creativity, and most are just left gone, no effort at all to explain anything.Don't waste your time, not even the special effects are worth it.",Ad Astra

First of all, it has no business being called a Science Fiction. It was a long, drawn out, painful psycho-drama. You will basically spend 2 hrs watching Brad's character psychoanalyze himself in slo mo only to finally find his dad (honestly wasn't sure we were ever gonna get there) and realize his dad is an a-hole and he should be more present in the now. May I suggest mindful meditation next, it would have had a similar effect without having to spend the money on filming the movie.

807,yv_es,A dumbed-down version of better films,4,20 June 2020,"The most charitable thing I can say about Ad Astra is that it draws inspiration from many great films. The problem is that instead of standing on the shoulders of these giants, Ad Astra takes the all too predictable Hollywood path and instead dumbs them down for mass appeal.To begin, the plot of Ad Astra is similar to Heart of Darkness (or Apocalypse Now). Someone has lost it out beyond the farthest reaches of civilization and one man must track them down to deliver some ""extreme prejudice"". And look: I'm a complete sucker for Heart of Darkness style plots, doubly so if they are set in space!The problem is, Ad Astra is like stupid Heart of Darkness. Brad Pitt has to make this whole convoluted journey for stupid reasons. As in, let's drive buggies to the dark side of the moon to avoid detection stupid reasons. As in, we can only send secure messages from Mars because stupid reasons. I mean the entire driver of the plot is ""antimatter"", which I guess they just threw there in hoping no one would care enough to question. I mean just how antimatter is supposed to be causing electromagnetic storms that intensify as they head towards earth? And why did the earth even need to be in danger in the first place? Stupid reasons are why. Hollywood is why.If the moon buggy combat and last minute saves are all too complex for you though, thankful Brad Pitt narrates much of the film. Now Apocalypse Now has a narrator as well, but the narration in Ad Astra is no Captain Willard waxing poetic about dear ol' Charlie. The narration here is half a description of the main character's inner state and half a description of the plot. It's just lazy storytelling. Even the psychological evaluations that occur throughout the film feel like a stupid version of the ones from Blade Runner 2049.Although the clunky screenplay doesn't give Brad Pitt much room to work with, he does a fair enough job given that his character is poorly written and underdeveloped. Tommy Lee Jones on the other hand should have stuck to being a Space Cowboy. His character has little of the depth of a Colonel Kurtz type, and just rambles a few uninspired lines. It was sad to see him like that.Ad Astra is strongest visually. It seems to draw from Interstellar and Gravity, and there are a few shots that stuck with me. It may even surpass Interstellar in the visual department-except for that excellent Saturn V style launch shot from Interstellar-because many scene in Ad Astra are full of colors (albeit often muted ones).However for every nice shot, the plot would come along and poke me in the eyes again with its stupid stick. I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but the longer you watch the film the more you start the question just how and why they shoved all these Hollywood tropes in there. This film did not need the love subplot. This film did not need moon buggy battles. This film did not need fist fights in space. In fact, all these things make the film far worse than it should have been because they feel artificial and emotionally manipulative. Again, it is a lazy way to tell a story.And while I'm generally no stickler for scientific accuracy in my space films (hello dear Moonraker), Ad Astra plays things far too loose even for me. For example, at one point they magically stop their rocket on a dime while on route to Mars. On the moon, the gravity is sometimes like earth's and sometimes like the real moon's. And that's just a few random examples. I mean the climax of the film is an absolute fridge nuking in which Brad Pitt literally jumps through Neptune's rings with a shield for space rocks and somehow hits his spaceship on the other side. Which is wrong on so many levels that I can't even begin. Ad Astra is stupid person's idea of how space works, which I'd be fine with if the film didn't take itself so damn seriously.If you are looking for a better space film on the action side of things, checkout Sunshine (2007). It also has some pretty sketch science-and certainly is no 2001-but it's a far more entertaining and rewarding ride than Ad Astra.",Ad Astra

And I was also left wondering what genre they wanted this film to be. Drama, sci-fi thriller/horror, or action?I caught the message in 'Roy's' narration. 'We're world eaters.' And I can appreciate Pitt's extremely nuanced performances of the character's emotional, psychological battles.But Lordy, if this movie couldn't decide what it was about and led me on a very dissatisfying cinematic journey. The problem isn't a capacity for appreciating what they did right, it's the film's inability to tell a strong thematic tale.And while this has no bearing on the rating for me, I felt the space scenery was nothing to scream about. The graphics were sophisticated, but someone compared it to Interstellar and that's honestly absurd. Nothing captivating about it, just a convincing visual representation of space.There was an excessive overuse of slow motion. So much so it was glaringly evident how much storytelling was wasted and abandoned in place of it. In addition to slow motion, the extremely slow pacing also hindered the ability to fill the film with sufficient story. So instead we got things like a short, reoccurring nondescript clip of a child staring in the distance, nothing to reveal or further along the narrative or the plot. Just a kid we assume is Roy from context. I kept expecting something more to unfold with each showing of the clip, but the clip was the same nothingness every time. They legit paid this kid's parents and some unidentifiable woman to hold this kid for this shot. They did so much nothing in this clip, it could have just been a photo.
I don't honestly understand why they paid to have Liv Tyler play a role that could have easily been performed by another capable non-A List actress. Her part in the film was extremely lackluster. She did her part with aplomb, but maybe if they'd saved what they spent on her check, as well as Donald Sutherland's, they could have put more towards better story-driven efforts. Donald Sutherland's character had even less to do with the tale and he eventually disappears from the film leaving me to question why was he even there to begin with, and why there was any focus on his character at all. Why not just be a supporting character, performed by someone less expensive, with less central focus, who escorts our leading man, offers a little glimpse into the mystery, and provides dialogue to build on the leading man's arc? Also he was supposed to be protecting Roy, but he was an old and unhealthy man, who did nothing close to protecting him. How'd he get the job??Essentially, so much of this film could have been done away with...the space pirates had nothing to do with the mission to send a message and even less to do with the mission to stop Roy's father. They're mostly silent, action-oriented attack, didn't present a hindrance at all to the Roy's mission. Everyone else around him died by the end of the attack, but he still made his destination with no delay in his arrival. No injury or something to affect the events that followed. Not even the puncture in his suit.
The mayday mission was also pointless. They responded and found nothing but some savage wild animals. Captain was killed in what fit more into a sci-fi horror genre. Captain/Captain's death bore no importance to the story, animal bore no weight to the story, that whole scene came and went with me asking, 'why'?
The best I can surmise with these scenes is they wanted us to see how well our leading man could handle harried situations. But they took too much time with floating and internal lamenting and slow-paced space scenery. This could have been succinctly done in less time with more thematically connected scenarios.
The animal attack did not speak to the destructive tendencies of man, or our leading man's emotional/psychological struggles, nor the plot.Then this random new character spills the mystery behind his father in a very unceremonious/uneventful way. It felt forced. Again a character who was given either too much focus or not enough. It didn't make sense for her to tell him the top-secret information behind his father, when her feelings about the man aligned with the government's. They were planning to do exactly what she asked him to do. So why involve him at all? Her character also came and went.
All of the supporting characters in this film were treated as props and so it felt disjointed and convenient.It made no sense for the mission team to attempt to kill Roy when he stowed away. Attempt to detain him, yes. But they were legit trying to kill him and, while he was stowing away, he was being peaceable and non-aggressive. So their deaths were honestly a head-scratcher, and quite frankly a bit too convenient.I think the more powerful moments were indeed when Roy found his father and lost his father. That closure/non-closure experience was very relatable to me. He didn't get to have the interaction he planned to have, but the interaction still gave him something to move on from.I had a hard time believing that Roy would return home after disobeying orders, inadvertently but definitely causing the deaths of those three people on the ship he was unauthorized to board, and face zero consequences. Maybe they would have lessened the consequences since he did stop the surge that was killing earth, but no consequences whatsoever?If the movie was meant to tell the story about a man lost and incapable of living and loving, that's what it should have been about. And it didn't need to be in the future, let alone in space, or have anything to do with stopping a psychotic space dad, with space pirates and killer space monkeys. It was just all over the place and unjustifiably slow.The pacing and aesthetic of this film was reminiscent of Arrival and Gravity, but those movies are proof that this style and pacing doesn't have to come at the sacrifice of story.Brad Pitt was excellent, Tommy Lee Jones was excellent, Liv Tyler and Donald Sutherland were solid, if not left with very little to contribute.
But they each have an incredible catalog of films under their belts that showcase their abilities with a far more substantive degree of impact and entertainment.So yea...super boring.",Ad Astra
816,Major_Fletcher,Is there anybody out there?,8,2 January 2020,"That is the real question which will be answered at the end of this movie.Curious? Keep going...Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) always wanted to be an astronaut. But why? Because his father Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) did the same? - He disappeared on a space expedition 30 years ago. Because he want's to do something important for mankind? Seems he doesn't really know why.Meanwhile in the near future, earth is in real danger. The source seems to be somewhere far away in cosmos and Roy is one of the most experienced astronauts on earth. So he's asked to join a top secret mission to probe the causes of danger.If you want to see a slow paced, kind of depressed and for the most part realistic sci-fi movies, shown in superb pictures you love to think about and discuss afterwards, be very welcome to join this space trip. I loved the performance from Pitt, Sutherland & especially Jones.If you're looking out for some funny alien movie with lot of action, space battles or something similar, avoid it - you will for sure fall asleep after a while ;)Cheers,

Given hostilities, how one so easily approached and accessed the Mars launcher. The unstrapping of crew members during the launch and the ensuing battle and obvious deaths which resulted...

Having seen several glowing reviews, I kept expecting it to get better, but...it never did.First of all, it was science fiction without science. Numerous laws of physics, space, and time were violated throughout. The violations weren't subtle, and they were continual. One didn't know whether to laugh out loud or just gaze in amazement. Things kept happening that any high school student should know just could not happen.Second, there wasn't the slightest bit of dramatic tension after the opening scene. It was incredibly boring. I found myself watching the seconds and minutes count down on my watch.Third, several key elements in the plot made absolutely no dramatic or logical sense.I could justify these opinions with extensive analyses of the film's dramatic and scientific failings, but such analyses might lead to spoilers, so I'll just stop and say that this is a truly, atrociously bad waste of time.",Ad Astra

836,SomeUselessGeek,Max humanism; max stupidity; min filmmaking effectiveness,1,29 June 2020,"Six bucks (rental) and two hours of my irretrievable time down the drain. Stupidity abounds in this mess as science gets tossed out the airlock in favor of artsy-fartsyness. The moon subplot made absolutely no sense whatsoever, and totally ignored basic physics than any grade school kid could tell you would make all that trouble impossible. Lag time in the speed of light makes instant comms between Mars and Uranus not possible, either, but don't tell the film makers that. Did anybody involved in this mess graduate high school? If they had they'd realize that the basic concept of a ""power surge"" from the outer planets would never make it back to the inner worlds against the solar wind, eh? Even if it did it would be a candle against the sun, a butterfly fart in a hurricane. So much for the driving force of the plot.The monotone voice-over exposition is maddening, but the pacing of all the interactions between such characters as made any difference was even slower, sad to say. However, the Space Force High (as in doped up) Command had an answer to that -- have your main character talk slowly and with great exposition into a machine that will determine if he can continue the mission based on its psychological profile analysis. Wow.No -- this thing had no redeeming qualities to recommend it, sadly. Headliners like Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, and Liv Tyler made little difference to the plot line or character interactions. They could have made this flick with a bunch of cardboard cutouts as stand-ins and nobody would have noticed the diff.

The MacGuffin of the antimatter device was throughly useless and made no sense (blow this dangerous device up with a nuclear weapon... yeah, that's the ticket). BTW all energy effects like heat/radiation etc abide by some form of the 1/r^2 rule which is to say that the farther away you are the less effect it will have but if the device was devastating electronics on earth, billions of miles away, it would have fried to a crisp anything within a mile or so (much less people in the transmission point).No logic in this movie and the emotional aspect makes about the same amount of sense.

841,khaktus,"Visually impressive, touchingly sad, but somewhat empty and shallow.",7,7 October 2019,"First of all, I have nothing against science-fiction diverting into moody psychological drama. The best science-fiction pieces of the recent decade might be Arrival or Blade Runner 2048 - wistful, hopeless, resigned. The mood of Ad Astra goes into this direction quite clearly. I found the astronaut's rumbling on loneliness in the parallel of the outer space and the inner space of his soul - quite easy to relate to. Point made, now what?Even if I kept hesitating, whether this is a metaphor for the average humankind feeling - the civilization tired by its own history, the environmental collapse and creepy addiction to technology gadgets - or a rather ridiculous portrait of an old-fashioned straight guy unable to share feelings, unable to get in touch with his own feelings, unable to feel - what? Technical, compartmentalized, rational thinking - check - but on behalf of emotional intelligence of 10-year-old boy. This ""human"" is a product of expectations of traditional masculinity - a soldier, an astronaut, a scientist, a hero, a plumber - being quite good in his field - but unable to relate to the other human beings. Living robot, executing instructions, doing ""what needs to be done"" (by habit, by hierarchy, by artificial values) - with no feelings. It's nothing new, it's not described for what it is - but just showing it on screen, in its raw purity - felt brave. Still a long way to go.But maybe I might have been cheated. ""Make a cool science-fiction movie - some stunts, some shooting, some explosions, let it have rockets and planets and villains ... and add a bit of pretense ruminating, because it is hipsterically fashionable nowadays."" I wonder where did the ruminating go or what was its point. Just being mostly silent, staring into the space, blank face, ""doing the thinking eyes"", ""humm, ehm, errrm"" - so many people find it already ""so deep"" (i.e. their shallow grasp of ""deep"") - and that's quite a commentary on contemporary humans! I find it archetypally male - inability to express/feel/relate disguised as a philosophical depth. So transparent as the universe.I saw quite a lot of potential in a commentary on the planetary affairs, wars, creepy nature of commerce, corporations intertwined with governments, humankind unable to learn from its past, repeating the same old patterns - resource competition, wars, locust mentality - in an enlarged space of neighboring planets and moons. Never mind that the commentary is subjective - but here it is presented in somewhat detached manner, brief/sketchy almost shallow and at the end it makes no emotional impact on the viewer. Blade Runner 2048 was much more ominous in that regard, while Arrival provided even some hope and The Expanse felt indeed politically ccurate and acute.Last but not least is the sci-fi dimension. I liked the exploration of middle ground between the contemporary reality and the imaginary tomorrow. This really felt like our near future, the extrapolation of today, with some technological progress, a bit expanded scale, but still on the course of recent development - it feels more familiar than most of the science-fiction fantasies. The bases on the Moon and Mars and not beyond, well known rockets taking fairly limited number of passengers into space, living in claustrophobic barrel-size modules, spacesuits, gasping for air, assimilating the familiar air-travel culture. It's nice to see a fiction attempting for a subtle balance between realistic and visionary - even if it is enacting it in the well-drawn sets of The Martian or The Expanse.When the movie fails, it is in the moments when it introduces the odd cliches of the comic and superhero movies that have de facto annihilated the traditional ""serious"" space-travel science-fiction. Free fall from the giant antenna through the whole of atmosphere? Surfing through the Neptune's ring (ice and rocks that may be kilometer wide?) with an improvised shield - in a course of seconds? Nuclear explosion push? Creeping into the rocket through the running exhaust? Coming to call the Neptune from Mars?The remaining impression evolves along the storyline - that used to be a key element of a movie. What's the story here? A journey through sad worlds of the expanding human race? Saving the planet on a linear course? I somehow missed a motivation in the momentary decisions of the main character (or any of the characters at all) - throughout whole movie. They just go on on their trajectory, like an ejected spacecraft, without any emotional background. I felt like on the amusement-park scary-castle train ride, where the route is pre-written by the script, whatever random, non-sensical or even pointless the turns to be. This film feels almost resigned on its own dramatic arch. Whatever... If it must be...Despite the interesting technological point of view, despite the moody vibe, despite the trace-like attempt to make a gloval/social comments - I ended up asking: why? Why was this made? Why have I seen it? Did not hurt. Did not bless.",Ad Astra
842,bob_james9397,The setting should have been on Uranus. Because that's where this belongs!,1,6 December 2019,"Ad Astra spelled backwards. ""Art sad a?"" YEP! You're breaking my heart Brad. What happened to you?",Ad Astra
843,Nhirscher,Dumb Interstellar,5,21 September 2019,"The core of Interstellar is the father-daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph. This relationship drives the conflict, it drives the characters, it drives the plot almost in its entirety. Similarly, Ad Astra uses a father-child relationship to push the characters along, just far more confusedly.Throughout the film, Roy (Pitt) encounters lots of hurdles to his solar-system-sized goal of seeing his father again. However, this motivation of ""seeing his father"" is often muddled. At first, Roy just kind of wants to see his dad, as he is more driven by duty to his job. Then, after he gets info from a 15 minute performance by Donald Sutherland, he decides he wants to see his dad because he misses him. Then, he sees rage in a space monkey's eyes and is reminded of the rage (a rage we never actually see) of his father, and wants to see his father more because he wants to escape this rage (?). Then, he misses his dad again, and sends a heartfelt message to him. Then, Ruth Negga explains that his dad is a murderer and has gone insane out in deep space, prompting Roy to want to see his dad out of a sense of bringing him to justice. Out of this sense of justice Roy inserts himself onto a space craft, asserts that he must guide the ship to bring his dad to justice, and kills its captain and crew members. You know, out of a sense of getting justice.Throughout the film, two things are entirely unclear: 1) why he wants to see his dad and 2) what his force of antagonism is. I've already discussed his motivation, so I'll briefly speak on the fact that there is no clear form of antagonism in the film. No, a film does not need a big bad Sauron type, but there must be some definition to what our protagonist is struggling against. Is he fighting against himself? his dad? the system? moon pirates? This question is never concretely answered and no, the title card saying that Ad Astra's world is one of ""Conflict and Hope"" is not enough. We are never given a clear glimpse into what the conflict is of the world nor of the character.Thematically speaking, this movie never bakes an idea fully; which is why I believe the film to be Dumb Interstellar. Throughout its runtime, Ad Astra introduces themes of exploration, sacrifice, fatherhood, duty, boredom, and emotional suppression. Except, none of these themes are ever realized, as much of the film hops from one to the other without ever fully focusing on one. Moreover, these themes are merely faded copies of better science-fiction/space films of recent years. Interstellar with fatherhood, sacrifice, exploration, duty; Moon with boredom; First Man with emotional suppression, duty; Blade Runner 2049 with duty, emotional suppression. Disregarding the unoriginality of the themes, the way these themes are communicated are almost exclusively through voice over. I am not of the camp that voice over is inherently weak writing, but in this case it is and I can say why. Lester Burnham, in American Beauty, is a great character with the addition of voice over, but would still be a damn good one even if he doesn't have that voice over. Here, Roy is not a character without voice over, as every conflict and thought is communicated exclusively through voice over. Similarly, the themes almost do not exist without the utilization of voice over.Because I no longer care enough to write out my thoughts for this boring film in paragraph form, here are some bullet pointed pros and cons:Pros:
Pitt gives a great performance, trying his best to give his shell of a character some semblance of humanityproduction design is, at times, immersivecinematography-- Hoyt van Hoytema creates some of the best looking shots of the yearRichterTommy Lee JonesMixed bag:
Coloring: at times the usage of color is breathtaking and enhances the mood of the scene; at times it is pointless, existing for the only purpose of looking coolSound design: sometimes it doesn't make sense (the age old gripe of sound in space), sometimes it draws the viewer in quite wellCons:
Dialogue: on the nose to the point where it hurts, yet, somehow, indicative of nothing deeper than surface levelCharacters: there are none other than Roy and potentially Lantos (Negga) (a name that I just had to look up because she is only given 10 minutes of screen time)Unoriginality: much of the film's visual style draws heavily from its contemporaries like First Man, Interstellar, Blade Runner 2049 without adding anything new. The Jupiter shot is almost directly pulled out of Interstellar.Space monkeys and Moon Pirates and tone: I don't know what the director was trying to do with these scenes. They felt shoehorned in and totally unmotivated by the plot or character choices. The tone is serious, somber and it clashes heavily with the cowboy-esque space battle on the moon. Also, I think I laughed out loud in the theater when I saw the space monkeys.Space logic: I hate to be this guy, but, come on, I don't think the physics add up with Roy's little atomic bomb ploy to get back to earth nor the rings of Neptune thing. If a film doesn't make so much of a deal with realism, then I don't have a problem with these issues; but this filmOverall, I think this film is far dumber than it puts on to be.

As a matter of fact, the film is not just a science fiction film with its own integrity, so the emotions (especially if this feeling is sadness) must pass to the audience. Brad pitt has never performed so badly in his own acting history. A no name star would have played better. There are very few exciting scenes in the film, these scenes are not well rendered and have made the film from bad to mediocre. Especially in one scene-where Brad Pitt finds out the truth about his father - the actor can't seem to show his frustration so much that I'm more disappointed when my dad doesn't make me tea. There's nothing to say in the film except that Brad Pitt actually took the film down. Because there's really nothing in the film. there was no moment to be surprised and either emotions would rise. My expectations for this film were really high, because of the production, Brad Pitt and the fact that it was a space movie. I'd say this movie taught me that space movies can be bad, too.

852,lincolnhawk-87377,"Looks Pretty, But Flawed Under all the Makeup",2,18 July 2020,"Many of the positive reviews like to suggest that anyone who didn't enjoy this must not have researched it properly, expecting something else, such as a ""blockbuster space action movie"" and that this is more of a ""deep, psychological story"". I researched this movie, reading some critic reviews, good and not so good and decided to try it. I do not require ""blockbuster action"", I can enjoy a slow-moving, understated movie if it is done well. I did not find this to be particularly deep or psychological - having a basic father-son abandonment issue dealt with in the form of voice-over, in one of the many spot-psych evaluations and then finally with a brief chit-chat when Junior finally drops in on daddy just outside of Neptune doesn't qualify as such. This is the angle that the positive reviewers take, suggesting that anyone who cannot appreciate this should not have watched the movie. Even the director makes this argument, apparently very upset at the criticism of the many flaws in the science, also suggesting that viewers missed the point of the movie. I'm no scientist, but even I found it hard not to laugh at the Captain America shield through the rings of Neptune scene, the Mars sewer-swim to hop on a launching rocket mid-countdown scene, using an anti-matter nuclear space blast to kick-start the old rocket for the trip home, to name but a few. It's hard to take a director like this seriously; he wants you to ignore such liberties and appreciate his father-son relationship story, but that story is not particularly interesting or well-addressed and he ALSO tries to slip in some action sequences that are comical at best - space pirates/drive-by gangsters, rabid baboons - these scenes really felt pasted in purely to make for a seductive trailer, which I hear was highly deceptive. Pitt's acting was fine, considering what he was given to work with. He was probably told to play the entire role as if he was trying to pass a psych test, much like taking a lie detector test, slow, calm, controlled speech with little emotion - this doesn't make for gripping viewing. The movie does LOOK pretty, but that does not cover up all the issues with it, neither does the standard haunting space soundtrack - just filler to hide the lack of real content. There were other tactics used to try and make the film seem deeper, cleverer and more insightful than it was, such as the commercialization of the moon, suggesting that humans will ruin every square inch of anything they land on, like the virus we are. Not particularly clever or groundbreaking, but it would've been fine in a movie without all the major flaws that this one has. As far as a recommendation, I'd almost say watch it purely BECAUSE of the flaws, they were that jarring and entertaining as a result, but I cannot give it much of a positive review, the two stars being for the cinematography and the killer space baboons. Spoiler Alert: Pitt kicks major baboon-ass.",Ad Astra

I wish I had read the reviews though to prepare myself.I love space movies and I like Brad Pitt as an actor but I'm afraid it didn't work here.It was kind of dark and gloomy in plot and filming, so it had a very depressing feel to it, kind of like Interstellar. But with all the space filming and effects it was kind of like Gravity. So imagine those two films merged together, but with all the good plot lines, acting, and realism completely removed. And you have Ad Astra.From about an hour in I was looking at my watch constantly, willing it to end. And to be honest, looking at my watch was the best thing I saw during the whole film.
I know you have to ignore some of the realities of space travel when making a sci fi film in order to make it work as a film, but this was ridiculous. I found myself laughing out loud at a few parts towards the end as it was just a complete joke.I really can't believe that they did some good filming, used good special effects, and had some otherwise excellent actors and made such a terrible movie.
I suppose it's like taking an entire 3 course meal from the finest restaurant on earth, then putting all three courses together in a blender and expecting the resultant gloop to taste amazing. It won't, and will no doubt make you hurl.Don't waste your money. It'll no doubt be on Netflix in 3 or 4 months time anyway, before being confined to the digital bin.",Ad Astra
856,DanPH77,Don't waste your life looking for something that's not there...,8,24 September 2019,"The premise of the movie is the protagonist's father went on a mission trying to find extraterrestrial life...life beyond what we know. Something happened on the craft that caused problems back on earth. So the protagonist is sent to fix the problem. When he arrived he found his father had basically gone insane. 30+ years of solitude will do that. He killed his crew in his insanity because they wanted to go back home...the crew had come to terms of the reality of the situation...that nothing was out there. The protagonist's father was dead set though on validating his life's pursuit...he didn't want to accept the reality...the facts...the truth. So when the protagonist's father saw his son again I think he subliminally finally realized he spent his entire life searching for something that was never there. He left what was tangible and real behind....his family. And he just couldn't come to terms with this and essentially committed suicide; his son tried to stop him but he told him to let him go. The son finally let go and let his father drift off into space.It's sad when you think about it. You can spend a lifetime searching for something that isn't there and lose sight of what is right in front of you. His father found tons of data on all these vast and beautiful worlds....but there was no life on any of them.The only thing that disappointed me is when Roy returned home there wasn't a better ending to kind of wrap it all up. The movie is so deep most people won't see the point. That is why I think a good ending would help everyone understand the underlying meaning of the film so it doesn't get bad ratings from people who think it's just rambling on with no point. It's a film that requires you to think and interpret the underlying point of the film.All in all a great film, great visuals, great acting. The main point to take home from the film is this...don't waste your entire life searching for something that is right in front of you. Cherish the life you have been given and love your family and fellow humans.",Ad Astra
857,aaalllrrraaammm,A simple story stretched forever,6,18 December 2019,"You have to be a space junkie to like this movie. Even then, you have to be patient and expect one of those endings with many unanswered questions.Ad Astra is a movie about humanity, the questions of God and whether we are alone in the universe. It is told through a cold and distant relationship between a father and a son.I like the premise, but I have some serious doubts about the execution. It is excruciatingly and needlessly slow. It tries to capture the reality of space travel and living off Earth, kind of like Space Odyssey 2001, and it does that well to some extent but there is too much of it. There are elements of Gravity and Interstellar in it, but that was to be expected. Ad Astra feels like it is constantly trying to find itself, and its biggest problem is that it does not answer its own questions. There are elements of the story that just get abandoned or forgotten, which could have been developed to breathe some dynamic and excitement into it.Of course, there are some major problems with physics, which can ordinarily be forgiven, but for that Ad Astra needed to deliver in other important areas, which it does not, so the physics problems add to the pile.In essence I would like the legacy of Ad Astra to be -- enough! Enough of these super-slow psychological space dramas. We get it, things in space move kind of slow and people have a lot of time to think and ponder, but good space movies are rare, and too many get wasted on watching astronauts do nothing for days and weeks.",Ad Astra
858,csheff3,A beautiful space epic about the true journey of depression,9,15 June 2020,"'Ad Astra' was a film I knew nothing about going in, and i'm glad I went in blind. It was visually gorgeous with nail biting set pieces, but the story hit me in just the right spot. It takes a good script for you to hear voice over in lieu of dialogue and not feel like you're being cheated, and this script was, in my mind, excellent. It's a vibe-y film that spends a lot of time in silence, and if you're like me you'll really appreciate the time it takes to develop the emotional and visual severity. On its surface it's a space epic, but in its heart it will speak to victims of depression, as well as anyone who's ever spent years feeling like they didn't belong. It takes a journey greater than most are wiling to take to find your deepest demons and confront them. Absolutely loved it.",Ad Astra

862,TheUserIDYouEnteredHasAlready,"Did somebody misplace my script for the movie about Neptune? Yes, check Uranus.",6,21 September 2019,"OK, so I was a bit harsh with the title. But there were indeed several plot and story elements straight from the planet Uranus. Did all of this come straight from the novel? I don't know, but they were totally unnecessary and only served to add about 40 additional minutes to the running time. At this point I've just got a list of things that I thought were dumb added filler or otherwise made no sense at all, in no particular order.1. Why even cast Liv Tyler? She doesn't speak more than 5 words in the entire film. She's only on screen about a total of 2 minutes, max. That was clearly a ploy for selling tickets. That is *not* a role that deserves top billing. The role of Eve could easily have been filled by any random up and coming actress. No acting chops needed. Seriously.2. You never and I mean NEVER heed a distress call in deep space. C'mon!! Haven't you watched ""Alien""? ""Event Horizon""? ""Supernova""? Anyway, McBride (Brad Pitt's character) was given the choice to override their mandatory distress response but didn't so that he didn't have to divulge the nature of his secret mission, which - given the scenario billions of miles from Earth - one would assume is because he doesn't want to assume any criminal liability for doing so. Simply telling the rest of the crew what was really up wouldn't have had any immediate ramifications on the success or failure of his primary mission. Long-term for him? Maybe, but one doesn't get the impression that anyone on that leg of the trip would have done much more than say ""Oh crap, really?!"" and then shrug their shoulders. OK, but keep that in the back of your mind. Meanwhile Pitt and his compatriot board the drifting ship and of course they find a disaster. Savvy viewers will recall being told several times prior that the wounded ship was an *animal* research station....cough cough....hint hint...that information was a ba'd boon that they should have heeded as even a casual viewer of Sci-Fi could have told them.3. McBride previously decided not to risk criminal liability for divulging the nature of his secret mission, but not too long afer, on another (unapproved) leg of his mission, he has no problem dispatching 3 or 4 fellow astronauts...recall that there was no reason - besides the desire not to piss off his superiors and get prosecuted for revealing state secrets - to care whether .... OH never mind!! This is just so stupid.4. On Mars they use enclosed land roving craft but on the Moon all landgoing vehicles are convertibles? Why?! I thought someone said this was the most realistic space travel movie ever. Does the surface of the Moon count? Besides what was the point - AT ALL - of the pirate attack on the Moon? None. It literally served zero purpose other than to keep Donald Sutherland's character from joining McBride. But let's face it, the character is at least 80 years old. Totally unfit for inter-solar system travel. So was that a bad writing/directing decision or a bad casting decision? Who knows? But anyway, why wouldn't they be using enclosed vehicles on the Moon in a known hotbed of piracy - OR - have MUCH better armed escorts with much better preparation and planning? I suppose the last question could be asked of just about any single aspect of any main story element in the film.5. Way too many instances of guy-in-spacesuit-escapes-certain-death or guy-in-spacesuit-manages-miraculous-trip back to his craft or Earth - which is to say at least three such instances. Only one was necessary in ""Gravity"" - so why press the issue?6. Isn't space VERY cold in Neptune's orbit? Yet this guy is wearing a standard issue 1985-era Space Shuttle Program suit and he's able to function normally in the ultra-cold vacuum for as long as he needs to with no signs of ice appearing in his helmet or otherwise?7. The backpack he was wearing in the aforementioned scene - I didn't see any jet or pressure nozzles for propulsion on it and there were several clear shots of the bottom. Just general science-y type stuff. How's the guy gonna push through a field of floating ice rocks and end up right back exactly on course for his space ship? LOL8. The woman who is in charge of the Mars base personnel. What's up with that little room she takes him to in order to tell McBride that she doesn't care what happens to his dad just after she clearly demonstrates otherwise when she tells him the story of how his father killed her own parents? So I guess I have two questions. What's up with her and what's up with the room?9. What the heck was this underwater lake McBride uses to get to the bottom of the final rocket's launch pad? I mean, we are talking Mars here. Seriously what was that? Is there a big amount of sub-surface water on Mars that I'm not aware of or is this intended to portray some kind of system typical of Earth based rocket launches being duplicated on Mars? Either way, totally unbelievable how he uses it to get to the rocket, which he then climbs, breaks airlock in mid ascent (with massive g-forces in play) and, with a little bit of luck and skill, manages to de-commission the entire crew so that he can take over the entire mission to travel billions of miles to Neptune.All of the above wouldn't even be things I'd be thinking about if the rest of the movie was engrossing and coherent enough to keep me interested. As it was, I give ""Ad Astra"" 6 stars for the amazing camera and effects work alone. This film rivaled Gravity in near- and mid-orbit scenery and disaster cinematography. The rest of the space travel stuff was also very nicely shot and rendered. The effect was a seamless integration of CGI and actual camera-shot footage according to the clearest intent of the word ""seamless"" - there was no point in this film at which I thought that I thought to myself that whatever I was seeing wasn't actually being shot on video rather than being generated by a computer. Perfecto! Soundtrack was also wonderful. Just enough, not too much, never overbearing, very fitting. Good job - Would not be surprised if both cinematography and soundtrack were nominated for Academy Awards.I've seen some reviews with the ridiculous premise that people don't or won't like this film because it's not some shallow sci-fi effects and popcorn adventure flick. That's not relevant to my take on it. ""Ad Astra"" is a shallow space-based daddy issue flick with too many close up shots of Brad Pitt's face, too many plot holes, too many overtly stupid decisions by characters who are supposed to be the best and the brightest, and a bunch of other bad decisions by the director. Worth a watch, but in all honesty pushing the lower bounds of a 6.0-star review.",Ad Astra

If you can ignore scientifically wrong mistakes and the Hollywood exaggeration, you should give it a shot.I've always thought that the idea of having colonies in Mars and other planets is optimistic at best. Religions and beliefs, the idea of collecting money, the habit of humiliating anyone who is different... These are our characteristics in this planet. When all of these come together, it's really hard to think that we can live on any other planet.Ad Astra questions these ideas with its story. That's why it was enjoyable for me.7/10",Ad Astra
864,DrunkenDeGroot,The bad reviews to this movie sadden me to be honest.,8,23 September 2019,"Ad Astra uses the unlimited potential of sci-fi films, a genre, that can basically be used to develop themes about any psychological, or phylosophical problem there is. All the themes are very rich, and even though it's a space epic set in a world where traveling to the moon is not a very unusual thing to do, it all feels very real and personal.This is a cinematic masterpiece in directing, sound and cinematography. It resembles 2001: A Space Odyssey in a few ways, mainly the lighting, and the colours of some scenes, a few angles too.It always follows the main character's perspective, so the voiceover kind of makes sense, it's always the things that he thinks, or the stuff that's in his mind.The music compliments the events of the story very well, the sounds were pretty realistic and jaw-dropping, and almost every frame is just beautiful.The acting is mostly good. There weren't a lot of people in the film, but Brad Pitt and Tommy-Lee Jones are knocking it out of the park.I only have a few little issues with the movie.There was a scene with a CGI monkey, (you all know what I am talking about), which just came out of nowhere. It was really odd, and out of place. Also, the CG on it was the weakest in all of the movie.My second issue was with the scene on the moon, with other vehicles. It was foreshadowed, but it really didn't need to be there, and while it was made very well and effectively, the events themselves are too unrealistic because of how convenient some things are.Also, there are sequences where milimeters could matter, lives could be at stake if someone makes a mistake, and sometimes they are lucky enough to conveiniently survive.But overall, this is something I'd like to see again. It shows how much ambition Sci-fi has, but it also shows what could go wrong with it.",Ad Astra
865,heyitskeane,"Visually beautiful, even if it doesn't do much",7,8 December 2019,"You know, I really tried to like this movie. But in the end, it didn't work out too well for me.Ad Astra is directed by James Gray and stars Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones and Liv Tyler to name a few. I took a quick look at the reviews for this one and safe to say, everyone definitely has their own opinion. Personally, I thought it was alright. I had a rather higher-than-usual expectation of the movie beforehand as I heard a lot of praise for it from the people around me. Probably wasn't the best thing.Anyways, I will say the directing and cinematography was brilliant. There's no denying that. James Gray and the great Hoyte Van Hoytema did an amazing job in this movie and it is breathtaking. Some shots were reminiscent of Kubrick's 2001 which was quite a joy to see.The score by Max Richter was subtle, minimalistic and perfect for the movie. Brad Pitt's more subdued performance also carried the movie, and it really suited his character.The narrative itself was...fine. It was fine. It feels more grounded than the usual space movie. I liked that the main focus was the character and not the whole save-the-world thing. Not many movies do that these days. But, it's not to say an exciting or thrilling prospect, it's more calm and melancholic. And I suppose that's a good thing.Probably my main ""disappointment"" with Ad Astra is the lack of connection between the audience and the main character. Now, some people will disagree on this. Some people thought the connection was perfect. And that's okay. I just personally feel that the movie could've been a lot better if we got to know the characters a bit more in depth and maybe get a better understanding of the choices they make.Another thing that bugged me a little was the dialogue. Most of it was fine, normal. But some of it was just...a bit much. It didn't feel natural. Felt like those one-liners you'd hear out of a superhero movie.Other than that, Ad Astra was fine. It looked great, sounded great, just didn't feel that great. Guess I was just hoping for more. But it was still fine.",Ad Astra

It's more about portraying an emotion than a story line.Could have been a good movie, it is very slow paced but that can sometimes be a good thing. But there were some random action scenes added to the movie, which felt completely out of place and did not contribute to the movie in any way. It felt a bit forced.Same with the over casting. There were a lot of familiar faces that were randomly added to the movie, which made it a bit gimmicky. They had the role of extra's but were giving a few lines to make up for the fact that they had no reason being there.And then the final did not really work, all above could have been forgiven if the confrontation with the father was really good.

877,buckybit,Heart of Space Suit Dullness,4,19 July 2020,"Is this ""Apocalypse Now"" in Space Suits?... to squeeze your high hopes space suit drinking bag back to reality ""no, not as good"" ... or 'good' at all. It just seems so obvious what the premise or pitch of this movie was, when they came up with the story?It also tries to be philosophical about humanity and life and bonding (it does so from the beginning of the movie to it's end as an underlying arc) but way less pretentious than Nolan's ""Interstellar"" (hence - a better movie, in my book).Captain Kurtz gone mad is now played by Tommy Lee Jones and Martin Sheen's character is now played by Brad Pitt. To add to the drama, Pitt playes Lee Jones'es son - who was left by his father and there is some unsolved, mainstream psychological 'business'.We follow Brad, from Earth to the Moon, to Mars and beyond on his journey to find his father (""They said he was dead""). It is completely up to you, if you want to read into it some Christian motive (""Is God dead"", ""Has he abandoned us?"" - God/Jesus, God/Abraham, God/...) or even just faint reflections of Tarkovsky's Solaris Father-Son story (bonus points for you!). But, you do not have to. It is just film script story stellar background noise.Brad Pitt gives a good performance, as some sort of detached U.S Space Force spaceman Albert Camus character(!), but what makes his performance watchable (especially, if you like 'the silent hero' - who still narrates through the movie, though), is also the reason why - as a viewer - you may feel detached from everything that happens. As if the space suit you are walking in through the eye of the camera is a condom, wrapped around the movie. You just do not 'feel' anything. You observe, without any care what will happen next. Or maybe your heart rate is just in sync with Roy's (Brad Pitt)?The movie is shot well. Moon looks good. Mars too. CGI is fine. Surround sound is okay. The movie floats it's course. Nothing annoying or bad to report.In the ""Best Sci-Fi Movies of all time"" it will not make my Top 100 list (but neither will ""Interstellar""). Yet, the most important question is, does it entertain for 2 hours? Sure. Once.",Ad Astra

It, again, tries to do so through amazing direction, cinematography, photography and sets. A true feast for the eyes. Though it's undoubtedly marvelous to look at, the scenes signify close to nothing at all. The moments where introspection is portrayed, don't incite reciprocal action on the viewers part, because Ad Astra offers almost no content to be digested. Whom is to blame? Out of place action scenes indicate a great contradiction to the main plot of the story, though it might be a conscious choice (to have grandiosity overshadowed by common, intrinsic human nature and need), it wasn't neatly tied together. Therefore, the pieces of the script ended up loose, hanging only by a thread, a thread named Brad Pitt. A stunning performance hindered only by the aforementioned lack on content. It's a simple conflict the movie offers, with intertwined sub-plots that never reach any semblance of conclusion or real connection to the main plot. In conclusion, the movie comes through as a lazy adaptation of a deeply complex novel. A very sumptuous one, nonetheless. A Space Odyssey wanna-be, if you will.",Ad Astra

887,ivanpetricevic-88877,Boring father/son drama set in space. Avoid,5,21 September 2019,"I expected a lot, but I came out very dissapointed. It looked well on paper, SF genre, Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, big budget, what can go wrong?
Unfortunately, this movie is very dull, boring and just plain bad.
In few words, it's a father/son drama with their stupid relationship, thats also set in space. If you're expecting some new ""Interstellar"", oh boy, you're wrong.
I will say that first 20 - 30 mins are decent.
1. Orbiter antenna on Earth - good idea
2. Commercial flight to Moon - very well executed, interesting.
But from that point, in all goes downhill.
3. Scene with ""Moon pirates"" is stupid, unimportant and has no sense at all. We are supposed to believe there are some pirates on the Moon? What do they eat, where do they live, where are their resources? How are they hiding on a Moon? What do they want to achieve with attacking other lunar veichles? What kind of weapons do they have, it looked childish, like it was taken away from Star Wars set (70's Star Wars)
4. Scene with stranded Norwegian ship is well done, but it has no purpose, nothing related to it before or after, no backstory. It is just there to be something different compared to Brads endless and boring monologues.
5. Whole Mars scene is plain stupid. He needed to come to Mars to send a message? Really? He couldn't do it from Earth or Moon?
And after he does that, he just casually strools away, set up some smalle ""Resistance organisation"" and comes close to the rocket. There is no security, no control. He walks inside the rocket like it is supermarket. 2000 degrees, hot rocket engines, anything?
6. He kills 3 people, ok. It happened, but I don't get which gas instantly killed the whole crew? One single canister and they are all dead? Far fetched
7. He find his father who basicly tells him ""I don't like you, I never did, go away"". Oh, and he tells him there are no aliens...
8. Later, he picks up some metal part and flies through an asteroid belt like it is walk in the park. Just imagine that? Asteroid belt in Neptun orbite?
9. Then he detonates nuclear bomb which he uses for a ""push""? He should be destroyed in a milisecond.
10. He flies directly from Neptune to Earth? How? He has no steps along the way this time?
11. He killed 3 people, broke all the rules, ignored orders. He should be in jail back on Earth.
12. We never got the explanation how can something close to Neptune cause some electric storms? Some device that is not working properly, I guess? But that on Neptne? Just a quick explanation at the beginning...nothing later. Nothing.
Seriously, avoid this film. Waste of time...",Ad Astra

Tommy Lee Jones is in it as well doing a great job filling a role that is talked about a lot but is not shown on screen until the last fifth or so.This movie is clearly not a flash bang action movie nad some will be bored about all the introspection but I found it illuminating and suggestive of our real future.,Ad Astra

I'll admit I'm getting up there and it was bad enough to see an old Pitt but the decrepit old actors Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland really pushed it home.

When it does touch on science fiction elements, these are executed so badly, with such a complete lack of logic, that they feel ridiculous.This film wants so desperately to be Solaris.

Other reviewers have mentioned the story and acting so I won't, I suffered it thinking there would be at least an interesting payoff at the end. This movie is disappointing and lowers the bar further in the ""nothing there"" genre of sci fi.

My biggest complaint was how thick the family stuff was overlaid on this ostensibly sci-fi piece. It was never established why we should care about this stuff.The Brad Pitt character was interesting.

With Clifford dead, ""God"" is dead.Religion doesn't allow the existence of extraterrestrial brings, because fundamentally it stands with dualism, which means there is another world, and there is truth out there with transcendence.Science denies aliens as well, because science can't prove their existence, no matter how accurate Fermi paradox is. Intelligence is a creation of humanity. Humans are here on Earth. Human won't be found somewhere else. Even if we found something out there. It would be completely, categorically different. It wouldn't be intelligence, but it might be evolvement, even uniformity, even discipline, even evolution, or even technology, but never intelligence. I think we are defining the wrong thing.Intelligence is about right and wrong. Morality. But the universe doesn't have that. There is no right rock or right water. The universe doesn't give a rat's ass about that. No feelings involved. We will probably never find something else out there except different rocks.But yeah I wish this movie told a different story other than that old ""oh this is what we got so far, there is nothing out there, we are what we have"" dialogue.. just bring something new for Christ sake, like come on movies are for boredom after all.

This one is in the latter category. In spite of all the bad reviews, I liked it. It's worth watching just to see Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones exercising their chops at the top of their games, and boy do they ever deliver. They show what disappearing into a character really looks like. That terminology is thrown around with respect to others but I almost always see the actor more than the character. Not here. This film is an allegory and not to be taken literally. The physics is laughable and the plot is surreal. It's themes of loneliness, abandonment, and emotional isolation are depressing. At least those issues are somewhat resolved at the end. If you can avoid pre-judging, suspend disbelief and just go with the fantasy, the production beauty and the exquisite acting, maybe you'll be captivated like I was. I'll watch again.",Ad Astra

934,magnusmax,To the Stars and Back Again: A Brad Pitt Tale,8,22 September 2019,"The somewhat obscured nature of the film is reflected by its title - the first half of an phrase that runs, ""Ad astra per aspera"", or ""to the stars through difficulties"". And indeed Ad Astra presents such a tale - an intergalactic mission through the stars and through adversities; a mission doomed finally to result in loss of one or another kind. Certainly there are great stakes at play here; yet it is Brad Pitt's character, Roy McBride, whose ultimate fate is of paramount concern here. Ad Astra presents us with an intense character study, parceled out with some flavorful trimmings of ruminations on subjects such as humanity's place in the universe; man's tendency to turn all to profit and novelty, while simultaneously automating society's action to become nothing more than an ever-expanding complex of heartless machinery; the importance of living and sharing our lives; and the dangers of obsession with a career-driven life.Any action glimped in trailers constituted only the leanest part of the package, as this is anything but an action flick, and it has been mostly marketed as such. Audiences have not responded positively for the most part in reaction to this film, and it is true that it will only appeal to a fairly select few. Never has the term ""slow-burn"" applied more aptly - or at least hardly since 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is certainly an inspiration here. I found it tedious at times, and have heard many reports of snores among cinema audiences! Cuts come slowly, close-ups linger and hesitate, and events of any remarkable violence are few and far between. For me, at any rate, the thoughts of the film-makers; the grandeur and beauty of the outlandish landscapes and distant voids of space; Max Richter's instrumental pieces; Brad Pitt's fascinating performance, and Hoyte Van Hoytema's smooth and atmospheric cinematography make it all worthwhile - and indeed a great success!Without spoiling the end of this engrossing odyssey (outwardly) through space and (inwardly) through the troubled feelings and conscience of a decorated yet conflicted astronaut, I shall simply recommend supporting this well-crafted, original film by supporting it in cinemas the first chance you get. I thought it was moody, depressing (not always a bad thing!) and thoughtful. Its final message can be taken different ways, but in essence I was happily surprised and pleased by the last reveal, as it was not something I am used to seeing in movies. It makes a commentary on some aspects of society very close to my heart. And although heavy, intense and sad, there is light at the end of the tunnel.
There is much more to be said yet about Ad Astra. Thank you for reading.",Ad Astra

939,phredator,"Save yourself, run away from this movie",2,25 September 2019,"Where to begin?
At the start the movie tells us that ""Ad Astra"" means to the Stars. But no one goes to any stars in this movie.
they mention the search for extraterrestrial life. But there are no aliens in this movie.
What there is in this movie is Brad Pitt flying through space. Flying and flying and flying, through space, deep space, outer space.
Honestly I'd rather just sit and look at my foot for 2 hours.
Okay from here on spoilers
******The movie starts with Brad Pitt working on some kind of space antenna which I guess is looking for aliens which we will never ever see.
A big bad surge of magical electricity blows up the antenna and Brad Pitt scarcely survives.
Cut to the Army general types who explain to Brad that his father Tommy Lee Jones who is of course a space hero in the space force in outer space is not lost in space like Brad was led to believe but in fact hanging out around Neptune in sort of a mad scientist's lair where he naturally is working on a big kaboom gun which is blasting the Earth with these energy surges which are going to grow from the nuisance that almost killed Brad into the end of the world.
So they want Brad to send a message to Tommy saying ""hey Dad I'm your son so maybe please don't destroy the world okay?""
So naturally Brad picks up a tape recorder and record the message then and there which they transmit. No. Not even close.
For magical reasons the message has to be transmitted from Mars. So do they send the message to Mars and beam it out from there? Of course not. They decide that the only way to do this is to send Brad to Mars. And naturally because this movie is stupid Beyond imagining, the only way to get to Mars is to go to the Moon first. And you know what's on the moon? Space pirates. From space. And they should have a car chase on the moon because space pirates from space like to attack people like Brad Pitt whenever they are on the moon. But Brad is brave and he shoots the space pirates.
And then he flies to Mars. Through space. In a spaceship. Flying. And flying. Through space. At this point ritual suicide seems attractive to the audience.
Anyway he gets to Mars and he sits in the little radio room and issues a heartfelt plea to his father to please not blow up the world. Neptune is far far away so it should take about four hours for the message to reach Neptune and another four for a reply to come back, but they managed to figure out in a couple of minutes that Tommy Lee has said ""no he will not stop destroying the Earth"".
So obviously the only course of action possible is for Brad Pitt to take a suitcase-sized atomic bomb to Neptune and blow the hell out of his father's spaceship. Because you know no one could fire a missile or anyting. Missiles don't work in space. Only Brad Pitt can carry nuclear weapons.
So Brad gets on another rocket ship to fly in space. And he flies. In space. Through space. Outer space. Deep space. All the way to Neptune.
And there on Neptune he finds his father. And he says hey Dad please don't destroy the world. But Tommy says no. So Brad nukes Neptune or whatever. And then he comes home. And everyone is very happy. And Brad's wife who wouldn't talk to him before is nice and happy now because I guess when you save the world that makes up for being a crappy husband or something. And although the movie is now over you still feel like you're drifting in space. Deep space. Outer space.For the love of God save yourself and don't ever see this movie.",Ad Astra

The story is taut, finely cut edge by edge with scalpel precision, and, thankfully, there is no hamfisted ""twist"" in the very satisfying ending.

943,anunknownfred,An Interesting Suprise,8,22 September 2019,Ad Astra is a good movie but definitely not what I expected. It had a rather simple story but it was enjoyable because of the great visuals and even though it was slow I felt it was very useful being slow as it gave you time to think about the film and understand what's going on and make theories about the rest of the film as it is going on. And when there was action scenes they made sense in the story and definitely added to Roy's character who is very different to most main characters.I'm going to say this again though the visuals where absolutely stunning and I especially loved the shots of planets.I wouldn't watch this film if you are not a fan of slow paced simple stories though or if you are going to nitpick every bit of science that doesn't make perfect sense.,Ad Astra

I enjoyed the slow burn build up to the climax. It had enough thrills and suspense to keep you engaged throughout the movie until it hit its peak. Brad Pitt is mesmerizing and does a stellar job as Roy McBride. He's a man that is solely focused on the job but clearly has a soft spot for his absent father. I wish the film would have ventured further into his personal life such as his life with Eve, but I can understand why it didn't. The only complaint that I would have about this film is that the climax feels somewhat underwhelming. We spend about two hours following Roy's journey to find his absent father, only for their interaction to last less than 20-30 minutes. It was probably less than that. I wish their interaction had lasted longer. Other than that, this film was a fun watch and enjoyable for those that enjoy a suspenseful film with a slow burn.",Ad Astra

Once the crew realise this, why didn't they contact back home and say that their Captain was insane and a rescue ship would have been there in 79 days?These are just the ones that spring to mind- I'm sure there are more!Also, the narration was awful. The characters were bland- I don't think being focused on space at the expense of everything else is a character trait, it is specifically the lack of ANY character traits! Why should I care about this guy and his Dad when they are indifferent to anyone and everything that isn't an Alien?

What initially impressed me is the screenplay itself.What appears to be a simple story is beautifully depicted through a storytelling that flashes through past and present events now and then in order to perfectly present the mental state of the protagonist,astronaut Roy here.The background score fits in beautifully as the director cleverly presented some outer space scenes in inaudible voices with just the music.Holding onto the mystery of the plot was also quite appreciating as it kept the viewers guessing till the very end.Given that it's a typical Brad Pitt film,other members of the cast played their parts pretty well.There were some good dialogues as well presenting a good example of script writing.

Dir: James Gray
Runtime: 2hr 3mins
Rated: PG-13Synopsis: Astronaut Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) travels to the outer edges of the solar system to find his missing father and unravel a mystery that threatens the survival of our planet. His journey will uncover secrets that challenge the nature of human existence and our place in the cosmos.It's been a while. I guess it kind of takes a movie that really moves me in such a way that I fall back into the love I have for cinema. I love love sci-fi space films. In most recent years Interstellar is probably the best in terms of cerebral, mind bending type of space film. Films like these are the ones that really make you question our existence in the universe. Is there a bigger picture? Or is the universe indifferent?Okay onto the film; as much as I try to keep these reviews spoiler free a few may slip out in an attempt to make this comprehensive. To start Brad Pitt narrating throughout the film a little here and there helps you stay with the film and keeps you engaged while the cinematography is capturing mesmerizing shots. The cinematography itself is very very reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey in which was ground breaking in terms of film making. Some of the camera work was clearly inspired by The Godfather of space films.The cast is perfect while it's been a while since I've seen a film with Brad Pitt acting on such a dramatic level with so much emotion it's like he fit perfectly into this film. Oscar worthy maybe? Tommy Lee Jones has almost a villain aura to him and given the narrative it's perfect to set the tone.The film is set ""in the not too distance future"" which gives you a general idea but at this point we've colonized the moon and have a base on Mars. Ironically enough all while we always have this idea that we look to the stars to escape the life on Earth. The moon is depicted as a tourist attraction with hotels and the restaurants that we've franchised here on Earth. No matter where we go humans will manipulate their surroundings to fit what we already know. Flaw with the science of the film while being in the ""future"" as much traveling across the solar system Roy does the problem of how much fuel his spacecraft is carrying. But oh well it's a movie it works for the narrative lol.The term ""Ad Astra"" is a shortened Latin phrase translated to ""to the stars"" which is what the basis of H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) work ethic is built upon, work ethic that his son has subconsciously inherited. The idea that the mission comes before everything. ""Work conquers all"" is what made Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) to become the type of person that lacks the ability to have personal relationships or human connection, all for the success of his missions. This type of work ethic is what leaves Roy isolated trying to cope with his loneliness pieced together by his narration of the film. By the end of the film we see our main character Roy, have to confront all these feeling and ultimately completely transcend on an internal level and cure himself of what his father's legacy has become. Oddly enough all while the setting is absolutely Sci-Fi you could almost say that the film itself isn't Sci-Fi at all.5/5 love this movie.",Ad Astra

Hilariously idiotic premises abound throughout from fundamental errors about how orbits work and just getting worse from there till it culminates in the kind of space-based explosion you'd expect from a 1950s adventure serial.
What passes for a plot is a series of completely nonsensical random things-that-happen. None of them have any reason to happen and the people doing them have no motivations or objectives. It's just ""stupid thing happens for no reason"" followed by ""stupid thing happens for no reason"".
Everyone in the film seems to take psychological evaluations every 10 minutes for no reason at all and yet every single one of them is suicidally depressed and this is never picked up on.
Brad Pitt's entire performance is dull, flat and annoying. Much like the entire film.
Even the style and cinematography are terrible.

972,Propagandist,A Poor Man's Space Odyssey or the Astronaut's New Cloth.,4,20 February 2020,"For me there is no doubt that Ad Astra is - I wouldn't say: rip-off but - widely ""inspired"" by ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Both plots feature a man with family issues who embark on a long space journey. Both men are in search of answers to big questions and finally return to earth in odd ways. On the trip both lose their comrades. And yes - no surprise - as the name says: it's an Odyssey.
Unfortunately, the comparison stops here. While the 1968 original features stunning visuals, a compelling story, some mysticism, accurate physics, and an inner logic, the later falls short in all of these fields.
The first thing that annoyed me was the plain Christian propaganda, where 2001 features religious ideas, Ad Astra slaps them in the face. Than the visuals, while many critics cherished them, I found them bland, slightly above average. Several shots were blurry and most too dark and greyish. While this could be seen as an artistic choice, my impression was the style should distract from sloppy rendering.
However, while the latter issues were annoying, accuracy, story, and inner logic were off-putting.
In general, the story tried to exude deepness but simply was only pretentious. Even worse, it contained several action parts that were obviously added to keep the audience from being to annoyed, but did not add a single bit to the plot. I found myself betting, when and how gracious nudity would be squeezed in - and was not disappointed.
Likewise, while 2001 aspired and achieved inner logic and scientific accuracy, Ad Astra more or less kicked all rules of logic, space travel, or physics so many times in the crotch, that time and space probably folded itself in a way opening a window of opportunity to travel to Proxima Centaury in no time.
I will not spoiler the movie, therefore I recommend other user reviews that accurately list all plot holes and scientific inaccuracies.
Having said this, I have to admit it is difficult to give a rating for the film. All the previously painted aspects would point to one star. However, the performance of Brad Pitt was distinguished and most of the supporting actors did a good job. In addition, the visuals were not that bad. So probably three or four stars are in order.",Ad Astra

974,bwkolbuck,Best Film of the Year (as of now),8,7 October 2019,"I walked into this movie thinking it would be a standard Hollywood blockbuster action movie and I'm pleasantly surprised with what I got.There are many good things in this film, first thing coming to mind being Brad Pitt. Brad Pitt says barley anything in this movie besides his mental narration which was very effective. Considering the role he is playing he has to do a lot of SHOW not TELL, which is a good thing. Considering all of this Brad delivers an excellent performance. Another thing this film does well is lighting and cinematography. Each shot has a purpose or conveys something. For example: whenever Pitt's character, Ray McBride, is describing his sadness or is feeling alone his reflection from the astronaut helmet fades away and all you see is a black void. The lighting is some of the most interesting lighting I've ever seen. There's a lot of natural lighting and different colors used for lighting. For instance: On Earth there's lots of greens and grays, on the moon it's very similar to earth which I'll get to in a minute, on mars there's lots of reds, oranges and yellows and on Neptune there's lot's of blues. And the actual color palette is beautiful. The palette really shines when Ray McBride is in space, which leads me into the next good thing. The CGI and VFX are outstanding, very beautiful and real looking. The chase scene on the moon was awesome, the CGI monkeys were awesome, McBride falling from space onto earth was awesome I loved the CGI. The social commentary for society is a nice touch. The moon is very similar looking to earth because it's commercialized and there's war and we are all fighting for resources. And SpaceCom hiding the fact that Tommy Lee Jones was a murderer was also social commentary. Of course there are also themes of; depression, fatherhood, responsibility, being in the moment, and storing anger inside and not letting go.BUT. This movie falls short from being perfect. Some of the science doesn't make sense, like why was the spaceship Tommy Lee Jones was on send serges in the first place. I know it's just a framework for the actual plot but still. A few weird editing choices, nothing too bad. I thought whenever Ray McBride had a flashback it was kind of dumb. You could just trust the audience to fill in the blanks or have a character say it. When his ex-wife shows up at the café it's cheesy and would have been just as effective if she didn't show up. Finally, characters just show up... and then leave as soon as they give out exposition. For Reference: Donald Southerland (I think that's how you spell his name) show up to acompany Brad Pitt on the mission, then he tells him about his father and has a heart attack and we never see him again. Same thing with the captain of the ship Pitt is on for some of the movie and the lady he met on mars.Overall though despite it's flaws Ad Astra was entertaining and subverted my expectations and I can see myself watching this again in the future. As of now this film is an 8/10 but it might bump up to a 9/10 in the future",Ad Astra

977,ayaa1977,What happens When James Gray Direct a Space Film,8,20 September 2019,"If you are coming to this film expecting an action packed space opera, then it is safe to assume that you have never seen a James Gray film before. This movie is a one man journey, so even though he is literally drawing on the biggest canavas that a director can get, and the stake here is the survivor of all living things, Gray is ultimately still telling an intimate story.The performance of Brad Pitt in my opinion is one of his best ever, and more the reason to see the film. There are no showy scenes, he is not busy eating something as he does in many films, or doing a funny accent. It is all in his face in one of his quieter more subdued performances, yet still emotional and expressive. Everyone else in the film is disposable two sometimes one dimensional probe or stepping stone. That is one of the thing I didn't like about the film, along with the predictable story itself. That said, it is a well paced, beautifully shot, and competently directed movie, with some excellent set pieces like the opening and a portion set on the moon that should only be experienced in the biggest screen possible.
Overall, I liked this movie a lot, but I would not recommend it for someone who likes a fast paced action film or conventional sci-fi drama. I am still wrestling with my thoughts, but I do think this might be appearing in my best of the year list.",Ad Astra

982,cjdnewall,"A slow-burn sad drama with angry space monkeys, not a fun space adventure with fun space monkeys.",3,15 January 2020,"Ad Astra is a slow burn drama full of slow voice overs and panning shots. There are plenty of plots holes and science that just doesn't match up.The tone is a serious existential type, really a loner goes looking for his loner father and when he ends up finding him, they both discover that they really just want to be left alone to be loners... point of the movie, really, we are alone in the universe - as they find none.Throw in some political and religious agendas, and forget to use tether cords except for safety but use at the end for danger. And a metal shield will protect you from space rocks after jumping from a rotating object. Don't use reverse thrusters to slow down as you approach the rocket, but speed up and slam into the hull (made of stainless steel; doesn't bend, brake or scratch), parachute roll and grab onto the last ladder rung. The space suit will stop your arms from being ripped off, then ride a nuclear blast wave larger than Neptune home.Also we have to assume the characters close airlocks behind them, and the real reason to stop for the space monkey ship was to retrieve the plot device the angry space monkeys had stolen because they weren't given voice actors.""Well, look, it's almost a full moon. so a large stretch of the Far Side's real black so let's suit up."" -said the black guy at the moon base... A full moon, on the moon somehow determines how dark and light it is or which side they are on. Perhaps the moon people forgot to set their moon clocks to moon time after building a moon city on the moon.With all it's silliness this movie would have worked so much better as a fun action space adventure instead of a slow, sad dead-pan drama. Daddy abandonment issues play out better with a female lead actor.

989,louis_southwood,A complete flatline,4,19 September 2019,"Ad Astra was a movie that I had no intention of seeing. The trailer didn't look particularly interesting and nothing really seemed like it was unique or groundbreaking. Seemed like the type of movie Id skip in cinema and just watch on Blu-ray. However then the movie started to play at film festivals and critics and audiences alike loved it. So with this in mind I decided to give Ad Astra a chance, and boy was that a mistake. Ad Astra is one of the most unengaging, poorly paced, cliched and pretentious movies that I have seen all year.
In the movie we follow Roy Mcbride (played by Brad Pitt), an astronaut in the near future who is sent on a secret mission to try and find his father (Played by Tommy Lee jones) who's believed to be involved in some way with a threat to the universe, and I couldn't have cared less if I tried. This movie does absolutely nothing to engage us in the story or the world these characters inhabit. Throughout the film will get glimpses of the world and the kind of society that these people live in, Space pirates, people born and raised on different planets etc. But it doesn't do anything with these ideas. Things just kind of happen, the moon shootout scene from the trailer for example feels so out of place with the rest of the film, and throughout there are scenes that feel this exact way. There is also a voice over ""Narration"" from Brad Pitt's character, this is the films attempt at making you believe that this film is a thinking people's movie and that there is more going on here than meets the eye. However the voiceover ends up serving no purpose what so ever and half of it is just philosophical nonsense - the narration is honestly terrible and blatantly pretentious.In terms of filmmaking this movie also doesn't really serve anything fresh. The score for the movie felt uninspired and didn't really stand out from any sci-fi movie ever. There were no new ideas about space travel and the future, nothing new or exciting. The production design was fine but again nothing that hasn't already been done. The script kind of meh. Characters will show up and seem like they are going to play a part in the story but then are just kind of forgotten about, Ruth Neggas character for example is set up with quite an interesting back story that I was sure the film was going to develop, but Nope nothing comes of it. There are also some moments that honestly belong in a so bad it's good type movie- no spoilers but a scene involving a flight take off on Mars was so ridiculous that I could only enjoy it for how silly it is. The movie is Also terribly paced. I have no problem with slow moving movies, as long as they keep me interested in one way or another. I fail to understand why I should care about the story when the film is giving me absolutely no reason to.
One thing that did interest me initially was the casting of Brad Pitt. Having watched him earlier this year in tarantinos once upon a time in hollywood, and seeing how great he was in that movie. I was eager to see some more from him this year. Unfortunately however this may be the worst I have seen him in a very long time. Pitt is undeniably a great actor. However here he is so held back in his performance that it makes it really difficult to care about his character. Narratively there are reasons as to why he may seem so held back, however it doesent excuse the fact that when the script does give him material that would allow him to show some emotion, he doesent, instead he just looks bored and like he just wants to go home. I also just couldn't shake the feeling that this character was written for someone much younger than Pitt, no amount of make up can hide the fact that Brad is not that young anymore. And so when you characters main motivation is to find his dad, I just feel it would have benefitted the script alot more if they cast someone a little younger in the role.I love syfy movies, I love movies that leave you thinking about the deeper meaning behind what you just experienced and make you questions your own morals, I also love movies with interesting characters with clear motivations that make sense. Ad Astra did not provide me with any of those things. Critically this movie is doing extremely well so maybe some may find something in this. But me personally. I would have forgotten this movie exsited within a month.4/10",Ad Astra
990,BiggusD,"Boring and sentimental story, cool visuals",4,20 September 2019,"The plot is like an episode of ""Long Lost Family"" or similar sentimental daytime reality TV... but set in space for some reason.They must have used most of the budget on the visuals, which were very good, but it all feels wasted because they could have done the exact same story on Earth for a fraction of the budget without losing anything.The point of the movie, the main character's mission to find his father (and himself), is not as much a grueling confrontation with his own failures in life as it is with the filmmakers' need to have random action scenes interrupt the long and mind-numbing introspection scenes.If you're looking for a suspenseful story about the dangers of space exploration and the limits of human knowledge and capabilities, or the great unknown outside our little blue pebble, this is not a movie for you.

The drama nevertheless, remains at the steady, cerebral pace dictated by our commanding, melancholic hero Major McBride. Brad Pitt plays his role with consummate presence, as does his nemesis Tommy Lee Jones as his maximally distant father.And this is of course the essence of the film - the particularly male archetype of denial and disassociation from feeling and vulnerability - ultimately this turns out to be all that is most important in a life - connection and intimacy. Thus the film is about finding integrity between professional and personal commitment and relationship.We are given to note that no freakishly cataclysmic event or any authority seems able to shift Major McBride's presence of mind or steadiness of heart-beat from its resting state ...except, the one fear that requires attention for true growth potential and ultimate wisdom and maturity. Thus, if you want pop sci-fi - this will not be for you.Only in the end then, when truly alone in the cosmos, does the Major find himself.

Brad Pitt was great and should have got an Oscar. The themes were Universal: alienation of fathers from sons, the ridiculous work ethic imposed on fathers - we've all experienced that.

Must have been an easy way to make money for him because its not like he had to memorize a lot of lines. Not a story that needed to be told and not even very entertaining. The worst thing was the crappy music. Now this is just strictly my opinion but I'm tired of the crap music in lots of new movies lately. They play a single electronic note for like a minute straight and then slowly fade it out, or its like two notes on a piano being slowly repeated back and forth.

1013,nickrichardson-16919,POPCORN EMPIRE: AD ASTRA - MOVIE REVIEW,9,28 September 2019,"""Ad Astra... is a masterfully crafted film, with stunning visuals, profound drama, and a brilliant lead performance from Pitt... 9.5/10""Ad Astra is a sci-fi drama directed by James Gray and starring Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, Liv Tyler, and Donald Sutherland. It's a masterfully crafted film, with stunning visuals, profound drama, and a brilliant lead performance from Pitt.WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD!In the near future, Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) is an astronaut working for the U.S Space Command (SpaceCom), following in the footsteps on his father Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones). Clifford had lead a mission dubbed the Lima Project to seek out evidence of intelligent life, but was pronounced dead many years ago after communications ceased. Devastating power surges suddenly start to hit Earth and other planets, causing thousands of deaths. After being nearly killed by one of these surges, Roy is informed by SpaceCom that the surges are originating from the Lima Project, and it's possible his father is still alive. Roy accepts a mission to Mars to make an attempt at communicating with his father.This film contains a surplus of beautiful cinematography. With its breathtaking shots of space, and it's stylized use of color, Ad Astra is a feast for the eyes. The film also has one of the most memorable scores of this year, with its subtle ambience and electronic elements that compliment the film both in both its visuals and its emotional themes. It doesn't have a lot of ""action"", but it's always well staged and shot, and the rover chase on the moon is one of the coolest action scenes in a film this year.The film is partly a character study of Roy McBride. SpaceCom requires astronauts to remain psychologically calm and focused at all times, so Roy suffers from a lot of repressed emotions. We see that this all but ruined his relationship with his wife Eve (Liv Tyler), who feels that he is a stranger to her. Roy does his best to put this aside for the sake of his work, but it's clear that it still upsets him deep down.Roy's also under a lot of pressure due to the legacy of his father. Clifford is hailed as a hero by the general public, but Roy's personal relationship with him isn't in good shape. Without revealing many details, you get a sense that Clifford was neglectful of Roy growing up. On top of all this, The success of Roy's mission determines the fate of humanity. If SpaceCom fails to stop the surges, they could wipe out all life in the galaxy.Roy witnesses the deaths of several people throughout the mission, some of which he inadvertently causes when he decides to sabotage SpaceCom's mission. These deaths take a toll on his mind, and his sanity begins to slowly slip away while en route to find his father, until he eventually redeems himself and becomes more optimistic and resolved in the end. After meeting with his father one last time, he finds closure both in that relationship and also within himself. Clifford's data shows no evidence of extra-terrestrial life, and this allows Roy to realize that he should focus on his life at home and not make the same mistakes his father did.Brad Pitt does a fantastic job selling the internal conflicts of Roy. His subtle facial expressions and body language communicate much more than the dialogue. It's an understated and nuanced performance, and a highlight for Pitt's career. The film is a little heavy on voice-over narration, and it took me out of the movie a couple times (although this is more of an issue with writing and editing than the performance).While the film revolves around this father-son drama, it also introduces some smart, even urgent ideas about humanity's future at large. Humans have begun to colonize the moon and build space stations on other planets. Travel to and from the moon has become akin to traveling by plane, with space flights taking a fraction of the time that they once did. There are ""space ports"" on the moon that are nearly identical to airports on Earth. You can even catch a glimpse of Applebee's and Subway signs, as well as other stores and businesses. This has strong implications about humanity's future, and it's implied that we will continue our capitalistic, consumerist behavior even away from Earth. We may have reached new worlds physically, but we are still stuck with the same ideas and behaviors.The discovery that intelligent life most likely doesn't exist outside of humans is an interesting subversion of sci-fi tropes, and it's also a terrifying answer to a question that has only become more and more relevant. Ad Astra tells us that maybe we should focus on growing as a species and look for answers amongst each other, rather than getting lost in the stars.Ad Astra is a poignant, beautiful, and emotionally affecting film. It excels at storytelling on both the macro and micro level. It's challenging to tell a story with such a large scope, taking place across billions of miles, and still maintain humanity at its core, but Ad Astra sticks the landing and blows you away. It's one of the greatest achievements in the cinema you'll witness all year.9.5/10",Ad Astra

It's good but doesn't really do much.Watch it for the cinematography but the rest is just pointless fluff.,Ad Astra
1015,liamtbrown,10/10 cinematography with a slow story,6,2 December 2020,"Ad Astra is one of the most visually striking Sci-Fi films I've ever seen, however it definitely does not tick everyones boxes when it comes to a sci-fi blockbuster.It takes its time to tell it's story, the plot isn't completely unique however it is an interesting take an a long lost father and son bond.",Ad Astra
1016,Vishboy,A Space Odyssey Lost Within The Conflicts Of The Human Mind,6,20 September 2019,"Space, Time and Universe are frontiers that us gravity bound humans on Earth find truly fascinating because most of us will never be able to take a journey into the vast Cosmos. And hence the huge appetite and curiosity for big budget and well made Space themed movies as they attempt to transcend our imaginations on celluloid through the best Scientific knowledge of present day.Ad Astra, directed by James Gray and starring Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones depicts a near future where humans have been able to colonise the Inner Solar System (Including Moon and Mars) and space travel has become considerably faster and less daunting.Tommy Lee Jones plays the character of Clifford McBride- a pioneer of Space Com agency who headed the LIMA project in search for signs of intelligent life in our Solar System and beyond. Brad Pitt plays the son-Roy McBride who grew up thinking that his father was killed during the LIMA mission. However, when the Solar System and Earth start getting struck with mysterious power surges of unknown origin which are threatening the future of human life, the origin of these surges need to be investigated and Space Com agency wants Roy McBride to establish communication with the LIMA project as they believe his father might be alive.While watching Ad Astra, I definitely felt that the movie had the soul of arguably the greatest space movie of all time-2001: A Space Odyssey. However, what hampers the narrative of Ad Astra is that it never unshackles itself from the complexity of the conflicts going through the human mind. Space is fundamental to the movie however it never elevates to the level of 2001 :A Space Odyssey or even Interstellar. Another aspect which pulled the movie down was the typical Hollywood cliche of the super human lead actor- Brad Pitt's character somehow always manages to escape any mishaps while others around him end up dead!The visuals are amazing and the movie sets itself up in that aspect from the start. The visualisation of Neptune is on another level. In all, a good movie but nowhere in the category of a masterpiece. Brad Pitt's acting is surely Oscar worthy. My takeaway from the movie were that should humans become truly space faring species, we still would carry all our baggage and more and create the same filth to the stars and that no matter what depths of the cosmos we travel to, the conflicts of our mind and the human relationships that we form would always pull us back to Earth.",Ad Astra
1017,S_Unit713,Realistic Outer Space Movie ever,8,26 September 2019,"The first thing you'll notice about this movie - is the details. This movie gives enough time for the audience to breath and soak in each and every scene. Its more of drama scifi movie than just a Scifi movie. It is little less technical if you compare it to interstellar but has much more emotional core attached to it.
The most amazing thing about this movie (which is the reason you should watch this movie in IMAX) is Cinematography. Score given by Max Ritcher feels little repetitive but suits the scenes perfectly. In the acting department - it is all about Brad Pitt. One of my favorite role of his after Moneyball, Fight club and Twelve monkey.If you have already seen any of James gray movie - which you should in case you don't want to get disappointment.

By this I mean that some of the shots were a little longer than was needed. I understand that if you have beautiful cinematography you want to keep as much in the final cut as possible. This film evidently hasn't awesome cinematography. The result of this type of edit is that it throws off the pace of the film. It's a damn shame as I feel if it had a slightly tighter edit I would have enjoyed the movie much more. It's hard for any filmmaker to edit out work you've poorer so much love into, I get it! Save it for a directors cut though and think more about engaging you audience.

Also severely depressing on multiple existential fronts, which seemed quite contradictory and unforgiving for a science fiction film that devotes and searches exhaustively for the deeper meaning of relationships and our place in this vast universe. He cuts those possibilities abruptly off at the knees without even a glimpse at what could have been. Numerous scenes at the end may no sense at all scientifically or on an emotional human level. My brother-in-law is an experienced astronaut (SpaceX trip to ISS is next mission) and this film couldn't be further from the real and inspiring science, optimism, and personal interactions he lives and breathes every day.

1029,bn229,Per ardua ad astra ... but so what?,6,7 July 2020,"This is the kind of film that separates moviegoers into two camps: those who want action (action!!!!) and those who want a film to take them on a journey of the mind, into the depths of the human experience. If you don't want or don't like films of the second category, then you will not like this film.There is a problem with this film, though, (and hence my 6-star rating) which is that it tries to take us on this inner journey but ultimately gets lost in irrelevancy along the way.We follow Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) along his journey from earth to the moon and then on to Mars. He is being sent there on a kind of mission, it's all top secret. He follows orders, does what's expected of him, doesn't ask questions. Along the way, he has this (random) encounter and then that one and then another one. And while we do get to see snippets of memory about both his childhood and his relationship with a woman (played by Liv Tyler), we never really see him in what could be real life, in his daily private life. As a result, we come to see him as some kind of ultra-dutiful astronaut who puts the Space Program first but we never get any understanding of who McBride is. We don't get to bond with him as a character, grow to care about him or his life or his fate.The part of the film where he is ultimately reunited with his father (and we all knew it was coming eventually) is equally disappointing for the same reasons. The terse interactions with his father at first seem to promise some kind of drama because there is tension in the camera angles and in the senior McBride's (played by Tommy Lee Jones) slightly crazy demeanour. But this does not lead anywhere, does not develop into anything.Watching this film, I couldn't help but think about the short stories of Ray Bradbury and how so many of them were only ostensibly about the stars and about man turning his vision toward the heavens and his (ulimtately) great future. ""Ad Astra"" is set in space, but the real story is in the mind of Roy McBride.Those who have rated it with 1 star or 2 stars were far too harsh. It is not, as they have said, the worst movie. It certainly isn't the worst space movie.But then, those who have rated it with 9 stars or 10 stars were far too laudatory. An art house film? Perhaps. But you still have to have character development. The story still has to lead somewhere, deliver some sort of pay-off.Ultimately, it doesn't.",Ad Astra

1031,gsaxon,"Boring, unbelievable, and, frankly, stupid.",2,20 January 2020,"Other critical reviewers have stated what I would say, so I won't repeat much. My main thoughts:
*A lot of people died unnecessarily.
*Brad Pitt's character yearned for his dad all his life only to kill him at the end. Well, he didn't outright kill him, like he did to others earlier in the film, but released his dad to float out into deep space without a hope of rescue.
*A person living alone for 15 years will joyfully babble on unceasingly when finally joined by another person. Not in in this movie. The reunion between dad and son is unbelievably boring.
*Despite Brad's character killing several people, no prison - nothing happened to him after returning to earth.
*He was reunited to his wife at a bar - how romantic.
*It took many months to get to Neptune but the return was quicker based on the little growth of beard on his face.

It's really bad when you introduce other concepts in the movie that are not the main focus, but I feel like would have made a better movie. Moon pirates and super apes in a space lab? Nah, forget that crap, let's focus on Brad Pitt's unresolved daddy issues instead (no, I don't remember the character's name, because I don't care).

Reminds me of the scene in Galaxy Quest where they had the giant choppers in the engine room for no apparent reason (at least that was a joke). Climbing onto a rocket during liftoff...g-force much? Was it a suicide mission? Why is a nuclear explosion necessary for the craft to return to earth? Was that the original plan all along?

Yes, it has many of the tropes of the sci-fi genre, but that aspect is merely a vehicle for it's message.
Perhaps yes it is Apocalypse Now in space; our protagonist meanders through space in search of a rogue mission, to seek and destroy. But in the midst of all the drama, Brad Pitt moves ever distant from Earth and his connectivity to people drifts further and further. In the search for his father and alien life, he in turn becomes alienated. The symbolic imagery is throughout captures this perfectly. With each planet, the colour pallette and design serves to remind us how deeply detached he is becoming.

Later, i have checked again, and the blame is on me: I was an idiot, and should have paid more attention to the category under the title, so blame is on me.
Still, this was one depressing film...the 2 leads were actually great, but because of the (for me, at least) silly settings I just couldn't get to emphasise with their characters much, beacuse I couldn't shake that ""drama over nothing"" feeling. The visuals are excellent (one of the few feats made that long 2 hours bearable for me), music is also fitting the bill (and bolsters the overall depressing mood of the movie, as intended i guess), so technically, it is a very well executed feature.
And yet, I was glad once it was over, and it didn't leave me with much thought either. So, in my opinion, this is for drama-seekers, who wouldn't care much abouth logical background setting, but would focus instead on feelings of the characters and how different events would affect those feelings...and in that regard, this move delivers.",Ad Astra

Sadly this is what happened.Anyone giving this more than a 5 ought to look hard in the mirror. This is not a science fiction movie. At all. That was the backdrop chosen to ride on the wave of popularity.The plot is basic Hollywood drama revolving around a father and son. The father is sent out for some oft-glossed over reason, the son (who never had a brilliant relationship with his father - gasp! how new) is somehow the only person that can get to his father and save the...universe? Not really sure what was supposed to be going on since the science fiction part takes a very far back seat to the drama within these two people that somehow are so important we need to only concentrate on them.The flimsy plot, that answers little, and asks more, never really stays on the rails. But they throw in some asinine moon chases, crazy action that is barely laughable, to divert our attention from the Swiss cheese storyline.I'd say the acting was good, but brooding and barely speaking isn't really acting.

1074,Filip-Kolakowski,The loss of subtle,6,9 October 2021,"Firstly I would like to disclaim that this review is very focused on one aspect of the movie in particular. The star rating is the reason of contrasting what I'm going to write about with the emotional story, and development of the character which I found to be much better.Space is beautiful, its vastness is hard to capture, Kubrick comes to mind, also to some extent the alien movies. When thinking of how unhuman space is, it resonates with the main character. However this movie failed to capture the true, terrifying, unimaginable beauty of what we call space, just how small we are in it. To conclude, what I mean by all this is that this movie brings everything in space, to an earthly size, asteroids are the size of a man, their strikes mean nothing, not to mention the fact that they should be in harmony with the spacecraft in said scene (the finale). With the interplanetary rockets, being smaller than moon-rockets from apollo the scale is really not there. To counteract this general fail of the movie constantly forgetting about the literal weight of the objects portrayed, the movie uses explosions and guns, with no weight to them either, the whole world built in this way feels hollow, and fake.We need more movies that can show, how space would actually feel like. Science fiction does not mean disregarding the current sometimes basic knowledge, but expanding on it with imagination, and this must be very hard if it usually ends like this.There are many better aspects to this movie, that is why the star rating does not correspond to what I wrote, this review is just about the essential issue of many science fiction movies.",Ad Astra

1077,MarsFKA,So Bad It's Not Even Laughable,1,15 November 2020,"I watched this clunker last night - I found the DVD in a bin that was labelled ""We'll pay *you* to take this rubbish off our hands"".Well, not quite, but the price was so cheap that, having suffered through it, I can throw the wretched thing away without so much as a twitch. My wife, who likes a good science fiction movie as much as I do, gave up on it after about thirty minutes, but I decided to sweat it out. It was not one of my better decisions.What I know about spaceflight I have learned by listening to the experts, which is something that the people who made this...thing...clearly never did. Other reviewers have already discussed the multitude of points on which this masterpiece falls flat on its face, so I'll just add that if you are going to send a manned spaceship out to Neptune, you are going to need something better designed than an Earth/Mars shuttle that uses solar panels as a power source for the onboard systems. The sunlight at Mars orbit averages 44 percent of that at Earth, so the panels the ship carried were undersized even for the designed purpose. Out at Neptune, however, the sunlight is down to 0.1 percent of the level at Earth's orbit, so each panel that the ship carried would need to be the size of Dodger Stadium, and even then would be useless.One more for the mix: having successfully entered a spaceship that was actually launching, our hero gets into a fight with the crew, one of whom gets plastered against the after hatch under the apparently tremendous acceleration while our hero is in a zero gravity fight with one of the other crew. The ship's commander then fires a pistol, inside the ship, which breaks open a canister of some gas so lethal that both surviving crew members almost immediately cease surviving,And so on and so on.This DVD is going into the wheelie bin - I would not inflict it on anyone by even thinking of giving it away to them.What was Brad Pitt *thinking* when he signed up for this?",Ad Astra
1078,afcn,Missed Opportunity,4,22 January 2020,"While much slower - which would allow to tell a story and establish background on characters - than most recent movies, there is a chain of events which reminds me of ""San Andreas"": The protagonist is always at the wrong place at the wrong time and miraculously the only one surviving the situation. I could accept this for drama, but much of the action doesn't make sense, such asa) The moon is borderless and a warzone. For some reason unknown, they head through a very dangerous area with small arms only. The so-called pirates just shoot at everything - They would need some loot (moon rovers) or hostages, but their actions are purely destructive. So, what's their motivation? What's the gain of their actions? Just to kill and be evil? Given it's probably expensive to travel to and live on the moon, rather weird.b) Elderly Colonel sent to accompany him? What for? Heart attack or whatever disables him just in time to give an important USB stick (!) to the protagonist.c) Why does he need to travel to Mars in the first place? Are there no communication relays?d) Why is he part of a boarding party when they respond to the distress call? Minutes prior, the Captain didn't follow his recommended course of action, as he was considered merely a passenger.e) Two escaped monkeys killed an entire crew of > 20. And they killed the captain by biting off his noise and fingers. OK, blood loss could account for the death. Or maybe the duct tape wasn't a proper seal and he died during transfer.f) Why exactly do they need him on Mars? To read a pre-printed (!) text. And then send him home again? And they build a secret radio studio on Mars, just in case?g) He climbs a starting rocket, after being hidden in a lake (so there is water on Mars after all) underneath the launch pad. This is completely against the pace of the movie, more ""fast and furious"" like.h) The space craft headed for Neptune/Saturn carries some poisonous gas container in the crew compartment. If punctured, the whole crew - except the one fortunate enough to wear a space suit - dies almost instantly. That's what I call a good spacecraft design. Think of micro-meteorites puncturing it.i) His father killed his entire crew. Quite an act, being an old man. But the crew was, despite the constant psych evals, obviously not fit for the mission anyway. And bodies are not decomposing in zero gravity, apparently (but monkeys explode, when exposed to vacuum).j) Father agrees to return, but then decides to commit suicide. But, after being capable to kill all his crew members, cannot unhook himself for a reason unknown.k) What's the matter with the anti-matter? Meltdown? Power surge? Saved by nuclear explosion?I could go on about the points i.e. plot holes. And I wasn't especially found about the sublime message of god vs. Extra-terrestrial life. That, however, might just be me.
I didn't enjoy the story told, but I enjoyed the pace, photography and score. Films such as ""Sunshine"" or ""Solaris"" I consider by far better, if you enjoy a slower pace. ""Gravity ""is a good working example of a faster pace. And there are many movies from the 70ies/80ies worth a try i.e. watch, before you spend your time on this film.",Ad Astra

1083,dudemisra,"Strong sc-fi fim, not the strongest",7,20 November 2019,"Ad Astra really pulls off the sophisticated sc-fi look but doesn't deliver in plot. The trailers for the film for me misinterpreted the overall vibe and theme of the film, one of the trailers consisted of actions scenes accompanied a mildly aggressive score in the background. However upon viewing the film, the atmosphere is completely different.Brad Pitt's whole premise in the movie is to uncover the truth and fate about his long lost father. It is a bit confusing at times and the film is quite slow in general. Pitt's character is stoic and depressed, finding himself under strict parameters to keep his heartrate below 80 while in space, otherwise he will be deemed unfit to carry on his mission.In terms of acting, this film does quite a good job, Pitt keeps breaking boundaries and extending his acting repertoire with a veteran-like professionalism rare in films nowadays. Tommy Lee Jones is also gives a solid performance, playing the aloof yet extremely-focused father committed to finding life outside Earth.The music and scenery for me is the best aspect of this film. Its absolutely stunning, images such as Neptune and the Mars surface look way too real and I was thoroughly impressed with the detail and colour implemented. The music was also appropriate with the overall premise of the film, it was conspicuously uninvolved one moment and the next moment was raging with curiosity and fear. Overall, I think these aspects were well-done and portrayed the loneliness and emptiness of space in general.The ending is up for interpretation. I personally was a little baffled and confused, considering what went done leading up to the scene. Its my only issue with the film really, so many questions are raised in the ending sequence and I can't seem to generate a appropriate response to them all.

The screenplay is good enough, although it falls apart in the third act. There is almost no climax. Nothing really happens. The interaction between father and son is incredibly underwhelming.

I am convinced that someone paid someone under the table at Rotten Tomatoes to rate this piece of garbage over 80 percent fresh, which led me to decide to go see it. Yeah.. it's not even close.. It's bad, a really bad movie.
It reminds me of the slow, lethargic, melancholy, and absolute depressing production, acting, writing and horrific directing that went into First Man (2018) which was the absolute WORST portrayal of a great American hero in Neil Armstrong (played by a melancholy, over-rated 'Canadian' actor ---which should have been my first warning sign it would be bad).
This movie has exactly that same feel, almost a rip-off of that same lethargic, close-up-face scenes and SLOW and quasi-claustrophobic and absolutely BORING style.. that some MORON once decided was a good way to make a movie, and a series of MORONS have followed since, right off that cliff.
What is happening in movie making? This one had no cast with any significant roles (except Pitt, who I like..especially in his previous movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood).

Zero rationale or explanation to the opening space tower scenes, magical flying space suits, an underwater scene on Mars that fits like a mafia godfather at Catholic confession, logic defying Road Warrior Moon bandits, hundred year space voyages reduced to days, utterly impossible use of a nuclear explosion to propel Pitt back to sanity and an ending straight off the New Age recipe for life pulpit...what's not to like about this movie?As a hard core scifi movie junkie, this film had me crawling to the multiplex toilets on my hands and knees and retching loudly into my rescue commode.",Ad Astra
1100,mg-soikkeli,An astronomical misfire,3,11 October 2019,"""Ad Astra"" is the worst science fiction movie that I've ever seen in cinema. There are lot of cheap genre productions going straight to dvd, but with Brad Pitt as star-bonus ""Ad Astra"" was frozen until it was time to exploit the fame of new Tarantino-movie and the marketing of Pitt-stardom. Maybe the actor himself thought he might have a proper artistic role as an astronaut with plenty of inner soliloquy, but it's definitely not one of Pitt's memorable roles. And the performance of Tommy Lee Jones (as a crazy scientist) is something to share the sense of shame.After ""Lost City of Z"" this film is really an astronomical misfire from director (and writer) James Grey. Without proper plot and serious character building ""Ad Astra"" is a vain and deeply failed venture to use outer space and astronauts as last signs of metaphysics. The car chase -action on the Moon and the spectacular intro feel like late attachments to prove something commercially stable for marketing (and for trailer). With extremely childish voice over and silly family drama ""Ad Astra"" is even worse than Claire Denis's ""High Life"" (2018).",Ad Astra

1120,simonwoodwrites,So much of Ad Astra just doesn't add up,5,22 July 2020,"Ad Astra, while enjoyable, just doesn't add up under mild scrutiny. Let's aknowledge that this is a riff on HEARTS OF DARKNESS/APOCALYPSE NOW and get that out of the way. The big problem is this is a 20 minute story. Man flies to Neptune to rescue him and come home. That's why the film is packed with pointless things like the trip to the moon, moon bandits, the SOS call, the trip to Mars, and the radio calls that serve only to pad the story. There are loads of logic issues...mainly with time. If it only took 79 days to get to Neptune why bother with Brad Pitt trying to call his dad? Just send a ship to Neptune to kill Tommy Lee Jones. If everyone knew Tommy Lee Jones was alive & nuts, why didn't they send a ship years ago to stop him and why bother with Brad Pitt sending a message? If the journey is only 79 days, then why was Brad Pitt losing his mind alone on the ship when astronauts have done much longer jags on space stations for yrs? How come the crew Brad Pitt traveled with went from space rubes to assassins? And in a lot of case, I don't think the astro science held up. Now, I admit I may have misinterpreted some of the details but it's how I read it.I guess I am not sure what this film wanted to be. It might be a space movie but it doesn't seem interested in those facets.

So I got thinking that these killer monkeys would become a plot line and premise of the movie. Nope.

If you're going to have a family drama where estranged family members connect then advertise it as such and set a perfectly serviceable one on Earth. Goodness knows, they had access to an amazing cast. If you want some suspense, chuck in some crime. If you want to appeal to the artsy crowd - some of whom I'm sure liked this plodding mess - then there are plenty of remote areas - with gravity - where characters can have deep and meaningful conversations.But why space? And why get the astronomy and orbital mechanics so wrong without ignoring the science altogether and going full space opera?This is a reflective soulful journey in a setting that invites meeting danger with ingenuity, not moping. Twists and conflict are set up but never pay off. Supporting characters played by amazing actors slough away before developing, which is odd in a film with a message about isolation.Better character drama and better science could be found in the Martian and Interstellar. Heck, even in Event Horizon.Of all the things it tries for: realism, metaphor, excitement, suspense, it gets none right.

God, Freud, fear, madness, loss, early childhood disturbance... in addition again and again crude disturbing scenes... keep the movie in a dreamlike, dissociative float without beeing trippy nonsese.Audiovisually up to date and brilliantly cast with Jones and Pitt, the film is an interesting example of how much art Hollywood allows.",Ad Astra

Haven't a clue.The worst thing is that's just the tip of the iceberg, you also have to contend with wondering why moon pirates are hunting a random buggy convey, how that same buggy can launch at full speed into a gigantic crater and not even topple to the side on landing and how Brad Pitts character seemingly has the ability to simply will himself across space whenever he fancies it. Why he felt the need for a nuclear explosion to propel him back to earth is beyond me, five minutes earlier he found himself stranded away from his nearby vessel and simply decided that's where he should be and boom, just like that he floated back to it.If you like cinematography and the (admittedly) beautiful effects used in this film, you might find a glimmer of joy somewhere in it.

This movie has very complicated highbrow concepts but they come off as pretentious very dull and boring. The love interest character is not very interesting and her name is not a knowledge. The movie has a very nihilistic approach to scientific discovery and this is very disappointing especially in today's world where people often accuse science cannot be important. It's a waste of Donald Sutherland's acting talent. The constant narration and psychological tests in the film are very grading at least you feeling like you neuropsychological test after you saw. Viewers keep expecting there to be an interesting plot twist or something exciting but nothing ever happens. I would not recommend seeing this movie.

There was never enough substance to really think about what if. So if I want interesting pictures of space I'll go to hubblesite.And while the acting was good there wasn't enough substance in the characters or their 'tragic' plights to become emotionally invested in them or their purpose. It was rather blah. It felt more like, 'oh hey I need to go save the world from/with/in stead of my dad I'll be back after lunch.' Even the, 'hey your dad killed my family' didn't have enough staging and climactic build up to elicit any emotion. And the personal narrative throughout the film didn't really contribute much towards emotional investment during the film. I guess because of how it was done there just wasn't enough substance or presentation of the plight of the planet to elicit any emotion either.And there was plenty of confusion. In the beginning the plot seemed simple enough. But some things were just whacked. Like how did the main character launch himself off of a whirling antenna array through space, through an astroid field with his 'Captain America shield' which would've stopped his progress. Only to perfectly land on his spaceship some hundreds of thousands of kilometers away? His suit jets? Also if you knew that your father so completely believed that what he was doing was right then you would've known he wouldn't have just suited up to go home with you. And when they were outside of the ship did he jettison himself away from his son or was he knocked away by some part of the ship? That part was confusing. Because if he had totally believed that his purpose was to find intelligent life elsewhere then he wouldn't have just gone outside of the ship and then committed suicide. He was pretty emphatic that he only cared about the mission and this purpose.Overall I didn't leave the movie with a sense of awe for space, with a feeling a renewed faith in humanity, or even that I had spent my money well.

1138,logos1,2001 Meets Apocalypse Now,7,30 September 2019,"Let me start by saying I was not sorry that I saw this movie. Going for it has attractive visuals, some genuinely tense moments, and it still holds your attention to the end. Against those strengths lies an often plodding pace, bad science to the point of incredulity, characters whom we only get glimpses of and are left wanting more (even, I would say, Brad Pitt's Roy McBride).The two films that came immediately to mind while watching it were 2001 - A Space Odyssey and Apocalypse Now. 2001 because of the unsubtle commercialization of space shown (here even more over the top) and the mystery lying in the outskirts of the solar system.Apocalypse Now for the constant references to an unseen character whose intentions are uncertain (Col. Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, Tommy Lee Jones' Clifford McBride here) and who believes himself to be right in the face of all who say otherwise. That character is only truly revealed at the end of the movie. A further parallel, the main character is on a mission to end his life.The movie is frustrating in many ways because it clearly has the potential to be more - hence a 7 instead of an 8 or a 9.

As Astra tries too hard to be the next Gravity or Interstellar, that it ignores the potential of it's own premise.

1140,michalgill,Anticlimactic Disaster,3,27 September 2019,"If I were to summarize this film in one sentence, it would be ""a devastating loss on all fronts."" I always repeat the same thing: screenplay is what makes a movie; the rest can help but will never save it if the screenplay is this bad, full of holes and most anticlimactic I've seen in years.There are three fight scenes in this film, none of them anywhere towards the end. It started quite well, the visuals were great, but you can't slowly build a drama and then just stop halfway through. You might want to go for an artistic effect but it surely isn't what most of the public will expect and they'll be very disappointed. I certainly felt like I lost two hours of my life in one of the most meaningless ways possible and judging by the absolute quiet when the end titles rolled, so did the rest of the nearly empty IMAX cinema. And trust me, the Academy won't give out Oscars for this kind of ""artistic effect"" either.Now, to some of the plot holes I mentioned: Why the hell does a trip from Moon to Mars take 20 days and the following one from Mars to Neptune just some 80 days? If there is some reason behind it it surely wasn't explained. Earth is 1 AU from the Sun, Mars is 1,5 AU from the Sun and Neptune is bloody 30 AU from the Sun!And that's just one instance of the crazy timeframe and bent laws of physics. Also light seems to travel at very different speeds in this film when needed. You send a message from Mars to Neptune at a speed of light and expect answer within seconds? How? It will take over four hours for any beam to get there and the same for the response. How does an astronaut expect a reply within seconds and then, lo and behold, gets it?!After this, I feel that mentioning the Pitt's magic body, that can withstand G forces nobody else can so the plot can send him floating through space and be unharmed by stuff moving at very different speeds, from spaceships to rocks, is nearly a waste of time.Anyway, final verdict: good intentioned sci-fi with a great hype build around it deflated by incompetence of those in charge of making it. Two hours of my life lost, some ten dollars as well and I probably have to go see Downton soon to keep staying open to the prospect of wasting money by going to movies. 3/10",Ad Astra

1145,darrengabbe,Mr Robot in space,3,1 January 2020,Seriously. We went to the local cinemas to actually see this when it came out. Well we couldn't get in because it was full. So we went and saw Tarantinos Once Apon A Time. I am so glad we couldn't get in. Once Apon A Time had me in stitches (during times when the rest of the cinema was silent at times). When we watched Ad Astra a few days back in bed on night I found it hard to keep myself entertained by this drivel. What a snore fest. I seriously beleived this to be a B-Grade film. If it wasn't for the big names I doubt this would have made the big screen. Brad Pitt reminded me so much of a Rami Malek in Mr Robot rip-off in his portrayal of the character. I actually expected him to start talking to the viewers at stages. If this gets any nominations at the Oscars someone must have been bribed. Sorry people but I really wasn't entained. If you want to watch a great Brat Pitt film watch Once Apon a Time. If you are knowledgable on the Manson Killings and other actors from that Golden Age you will keep it on a shelf to watch over and over again. This space film isn't even as good as an episode of Star Trek Discovery.,Ad Astra

Thoight-provoking father-son film and one of Brad Pitt's best performances as an outwardly disciplined, but inwardly troubled astronaut living in his father's shadow.

OOOh OOh Ahh Ahhh
Bingo Bango......Now after that excitement time for the reality check review.Ad Astra is hugely disappointing. Billed with the big names:
Brad Pitt. Donald Sutherland. Tommy Lee JonesLets be honest most of us wanted to see Brad Pitt in a space movie to see if he could bring some magic to the solar system - well he doesn't.Both Donald Sutherland & Tommy Lee Jones are bit parts at best with Tommy lee Jones looking ready for the retirement home.The aesthetic of the film did maintain a 80'sish vibe as the film is set somewhere in the near future some of the technology looked plausible mergeing the old space junk with the new. But showing scenes on the moonwhere they have created mega underground concrete tunnels and on mars where there are unexplained watery lakes was puzzling.There were many, many, many parts in the film however which were utterly ridiculous and denied any possible logic thus the narrative in the film had to explain the most obvious mistakes to us, like a fumbled resemblance of a plot, or how people were feeling.
The directors clearly though this film was boring as they had to add in extra forced excitement such as:
1. Brad pitts vessel stopping to aid in a Mayday call for a biological craft. Two of them, 'Tanner' and Pitt, flew across space to force entry to this vessel where there were just a few empty chambers. They separate whilst searching for survivors only for Tanner to not respond to a radio call and Pit to find him mauled by a space Ape. - So many holes here but the most obvious is - if they are on voice communication why didn't we at least hear a scream?! This whole sequence lasted about 6 minutes...
2. Brad pitt jumps off the Lima (the final spaceship) propelling himself at the perfect angle and speed, with a sheet of 3mm aluminium that he uses as a shield to defend against an asteroid belt, once hes left the belt he suddenly stops losing any speed at all and has to use the jetpacks on his kit.He then crash lands on his own spacecraft tumbling down the length of the shuttle only to land perfectly on the door which seems to be thinner that the shield he had just used.
3. Pitts shuttles uses the nuclear detonation from the 'Lima' to propel his spacecraft back to earth.If anybody has seen Chernobyl your mind should be working overtime...I am amazed at some of the reviews this film has got, but I think back to films like Solaris and event horizon and can only think this film is trying to get an award as its just poncy critics that will give this a rating over 7 or 6....
for 99.999% of the people it will be a bore fest film that ignores physics and logic whilst trying to pass itself of as a plausible film.",Ad Astra

I feel like you'll enjoy Ad Astra if you liked the Space Odyssey - it's not as slow, but the stillness and pacing are kind of similar. In fact, many of the space themes have been explored before, although Ad Astra adds some ideas of its own, and that alone makes it worth a casual watch.If anything, the best thing I took from the film was the awesome sense of loneliness out in space.

As Astra is in that vein, asking the questions ""what are we doing?"" and ""what are we looking for?"" To that end, it succeeds wonderfully and the acting is solid, with characters portraying people who have emotionally adapted to their space based lives and adaptation is not always attractive. 2001 may be the only science fiction movie to get the science right, so the posted goofs and flaws are all correct.

This is not sci fi, action, quick wit, melodrama.. just a study of the journey of self discovery, peeling back the layers of an onion to reveal the true motives behind ones intentions.Forget the scientific and mathematical accuracies and embrace the subtle yet amazing repertoire of acting skills that Pitt delivers. There is so much that ties in with a man who has reached a certain stage in his life, marriage, fatherhood, divorce, gain, loss, loneliness, and the big question... who am I, what is my purpose? reflection, anger, sadness, desperation, loneliness..discovery, love and acceptance.

Pitt played his part magnificently and I'm not sure if he pulled some of his mental anguish from his recent personal crises or if he's simply that good at his craft, but it was superb and I got the message loud and clear about what this movie was all about.

I dont understand the incredibly low reviews, yes the film can be a little introspective through Pitts character. After all the story pivots on his story and the feeling he encounters through the story. The space scenes are flawless and beautiful especially the cinematography on the the Earth (highlighting our beautiful planet). The physics of the story are complex but as we are dealing with the far flung outer limits we can't know exactly what effect the vacuum of deep space will have.
The people complaining about the movie are the people who probably prefer a spoon fed drop of plot and storyline while missing the value of the storylines philosophy. It is Apocalypse Now in space is the best way I can describe this movie and it is no lesser of a movie for being set in space but equal in vision.",Ad Astra
1166,richmond-clements,Made Life and Gravity look technically good,3,1 September 2020,"Obviously very influenced by Hearts of Darkness with the father as Kurtz and Brad Pitt undergoing the journey of discovery travelling the space equivalent of the Congo river. As far as it goes was an interesting idea. Throw in additional influences from Solaris and 2001 you could have had a decent film. But if you thought Life, Gravity or parts of The Martian gave a big middle finger to scientific accuracy, logic, and believable character behaviour, Ad Astra took it to another level.
The film looks great and the effects are stunning, but anyone with a basic knowledge of science and space travel will spend the whole film seething at the stupidity of the plot. Coupled with weak unbelievable supporting characters who behave absurdly you end up with a completely moronic story.
Have liked other films by James Grey, but he needs to keep away from anything to do with space.",Ad Astra

Somewhere along the line though, physics went out the window, and we ended up with a fantastic adventure in ""what the?!?""Gravity had some very average physics, but it is a superlative study in orbital mechanics by comparison.On the drama front it delivered, and the acting is first rate, but by the end I expected and received a Deus ex machina moment, and on that turn alone, I knocked off five stars.It's worth a watch if you don't approach it from a hard science perspective, and if you want to explore the moral and spiritual implications of the storyline.In that respect the movie has parallels with the likes of Jose-Farmer and peers, but it missed the point for me as a sci-fi vehicle.",Ad Astra

First, if there's an antenna array almost until space, then technology for space elevator would exist as well, taking most cost away from getting material and people into space (to the Moon they go the same way as first time in the sixties, with hot towel though).
If there are pirates on the moon, they must have been some employees that took over some moon station - wouldn't owner/country organise a military reclaim of that base? Where would pirates go then? Sleep in a moon buggy?
Moon rovers chase was nice though, at least one accompanied soldier could have survived also, besides the main two characters.
His spacesuit got damaged, yet he didn't have time to change it before flying to Mars (all dirty). Then he did spacewalk to the ship with monkeys.. You'd imagine they'd have some instant repair kit on suit, that could repair leaks on the fly (=SUGGESTION FOR NASA)..
If material is scarce (even if not - it's expensive to rebuild and fossil fuel lift it!), why would with such advancements still be engines that detach after lift-off (shown on flight Moon-Mars). If SpaceX can reuse already today..
I can't believe a spacesuit would withstand such heat next to a rocket, that is lifting out of a silos..
What exactly was causing power surges that could reach Earth? Why wasn't his father and his station damaged?
That was some superman aiming to jump from station and reach ship. Wouldn't hitting all that debris influence momentum and direction?
So close to (ok a small) atomic bomb, yet ship isn't destroyed, not even by an EMP? (idea of riding the wave isn't idiotic, since scientists suggested already continuing very small atomic explosions behind the spaceships to propel forward..

While BRad Pitt's acting was very good the film itself was truly disappointing. Forget it's merely set in space not really about space or science at all, forget the lack of characters. Forget everything else lacking and just imagine an entire film dedicated to one character's Daddy issues and his constant whining about it. And the premise that a space agency of any sort would put that madman out there in the first place is ludicrous. And at no point does anyone bother to explain how this potentially solar system ending catastrophe happened nor how it could be ended with a mere bomb or why it was ok for our hero to kill an entire crew to get what he wanted - a face to face with dear old dad.

I like this plot becauses it gives purpose to the entire movie, and gives the story the opportunity to show Brad Pitt going through the adventure of going to Mars. From travelling commercially to the moon, to dodging pirates, finding a derelict vessel. I was continously wondering what would come next.+ Character developmentThere are interesting moral dillema's in this movie. I can't go into these without spoiling anything, but I was drawn into the movie, thinking what I would do in Bradd Pitt's place. I found the characters of Pitt and Jones interesting.+ Beautiful visualsIn any space movie, there should be beautiful visuals. And oh boy, this movie didn't disappoint. This was one of the highlights for me.+ Great soundtrackJust like the visuals, a space movie should have a beautiful ambient zen-inducing soundtrack. And the movie did deliver on this point as well.+ Action scenesWithout spoiling anything, there are some surprising action scenes that I found very original. I think they were shot well, and the sound also really added to these scenes.+ Acting workThe nature of the movie required Pitt to be very calm and perhaps a bit emotionless here and there. He has to pass psychological tests, having a low hearthbeat. Naturally this will put a strain on the acting potential, but I still believe that the acting work was great. Especially towards the end.Slow movieI personally can really enjoy slow productions. Consider tv shows like Breaking Bad, to movies like your average Tarantino movie. But I can understand that some found Ad Astra a bit too slow. I would recommend to get into the flow of the movie. For me the soundtrack and visuals put me in a zen like state where the slow pace wouldn't bother me.Scientific accuracy (hearsay)I personally don't know much about the specifics of space travel. And to be quite frank, I couldn't care less whether this movie is scientific accurate. There was nothing in the movie which bothered me as a layperson. In the other reviews I saw mostly people complaining about this, so I guess there are many armchair astronauts that are vocal about this movie. But in my movie theatre I didn't hear any laughing, nor did I see people walking out of the cinema. People seemed to be in the similar zen state that I was, enjoying the movie.There are subjects where I'm an expert in. For instance, drumming (which was absolutely terribly portrayed in Whiplash), and being a programmer (which is generally TERRIBLY portrayed in movies and tv shows).

The sci-fi in this is just a backdrop and no more than that. No explanation whatsoever about anything sci-fi or some focus on something extraordinarily sci-fi happening in this.But if you expect to see a drama about relationship of father and son and how far someone would do or go to find closure with beautiful scenery as background then this movie is worth to watch although they could make it shorter but it's not a big deal.

There is mumbled techno-babble where science should be. There are mumbled clichés where emotional heft should be. And the plot rolls like a lunar rover with square wheels.In an attempt to obscure the skimpy plot - essentially a long night's journey into an epic family crisis - the hero's vast commute has arbitrary if exciting mishaps jammed into it, some featuring Moon-pirates and face-eating mutant baboons. Truly.The visual effects are worth the ticket price because they are extraordinary. What lingers, however, is the sense of a missed opportunity.In the sci-fi pantheon, The Martian and Gravity - with some poetic licence - gave us thrilling drama with a credible grasp of science. Event Horizon and Alien (et al) stared into the void and went boldly and joyously off the deep end.Ad Astra is weak tea by comparison, neither bold enough to shock or thrill, nor clever enough to satisfy real sci-fi buffs that it knows its Mars from its wormhole. It also lacks the emotional intelligence to pull off the family drama at its core.A final gripe - the script has Pitt's astronaut referred to as the 'best astronaut in the galaxy' (or words to that effect).

I was talked into watchdog the film by the directors claim that this movie has the most realistic space scenes to date. Maybe for a movie in the late 1990s. The CGI was average at best and does not make up for the lack of story and silly science. Pass on this one, watch Interstellar again instead.",Ad Astra
1189,ElectrifiedToast,No glue,4,9 December 2019,"The movie lacks anything to cement it together. There are a number of scenes in the movie that feel like have just been added to attract audiences and (try) to keep them in their seats; most notably the lunar buggy chase that the trailer was hinged on. Maybe without the action scenes this movie would have worked a lot better as with them it feels a bit schizophrenic.There are some fantastic space shots and it feels like the movie makers wanted to do a 2001: A Space Odyssey movie as Ad Astra plods along in a very monotone way showing slightly lengthy space scenes.However that's where it stops, I do wonder if this is a film that's fallen foul to being too heavily cut. Poignant scenes or lines are short or muttered and as a result there doesn't feel like any real energy or suspense built. Coupled by the monotone delivery and pace; by the time things start to come to a-head you don't much care.There are some fantastic actors in this movie yet they are not properly used and not given a decent script. Shame, I wanted to like it.",Ad Astra
1190,daneelo,An ecquisitely crafted yet very flawed movie,3,20 September 2019,"This movie has superb acting, superb special effects, and superbly directed scenes. Still, it annoyed me for a lot of reasons, which I can condense into three fields.First, what exactly is the message of this film? We witness the journey of a man to outer space and back on one level, and from an ambition to explore back to his home and estranged wife on another level, with the negative example of his father as motivator. So are we to conclude that explorers are bound to become heartless monsters and should turn back to be with their family?... There is an argument to be made that all the tech billionaires dreaming of colonising Mars could spend their money on several more pressing issues back at home, and the film's segments on the Moon and (to a lesser extent) on Mars could serve that narrative, but not the over-the-top main story about an explorer gone mad. Or, was this truly a story about a father-son relationship? I doubt it, an the expensive sci-fi is way too overblown as a mere backdrop for that.This brings me to my second issue: a couple of in-your-face religious references which stood out didn't move the story forward in any way. What was all that about? The least bad explanation I can think of is that these lines were added in at the behest of producers hoping to draw Christian conservative crowds into the theatres. The worst I can think of is that the whole convoluted ""going for the stars makes you inhuman, your focus should be family"" message of the main story was itself concocted up as a variation on the Christian conservative theme.My third gripe was that, after a couple of good sci-fis with ambition to be as scientifically accurate as possible, this film is a throwback. To be fair, there were SOME instances of laudable attention to detail: for example, Moon dust staying afloat for a long time, or the dim sunlight at Neptune. On the other hand, no attempt was made to show the reduced gravity at the Moon and Mars bases (recent TV shows like The Expanse were much better at that). The Moon bases were designed without taking into account the problems of radiation shielding and Moon dust, resulting in extremely bright cities on the dark side of the Moon. Parking a spaceship under a planet's ring may seem spectacular, but in reality, it wouldn't stay static, it would pass through the ring twice during each orbit. The rings themselves didn't look anything like Neptune's actual rings (a few narrow, discrete rings mostly composed of dust-sized particles). To give moviegoers a sense of depth, I estimate Neptune was reduced to about 1/10,000th of its true size, like in old Star Trek movies. Finally, a trip to the heliopause, barely past the planets (a thousandth of the distance to the nearest star) was presented as an interstellar search for extraterrestrial life.",Ad Astra
1191,Olivian_Breda,"Great atmosphere, but that was all.",8,5 November 2019,"On the positive part, I connected well with the characters. I enjoyed their emotions. It's just a single positive thing I want to say about the movie - this one -, but it is an important one.
It was just for children, almost nothing for adults. Very simple script, very simple jokes, very simple emotions. A cartoon can be made to also have some things which are more profound/complicated. This was just for kids, in my opinion.
There was almost no background plot - everything was in the first plot. In most movies, a character goes through an obvious quest, while also working on a deeper, more profound, plot. There was a second plot in the movie, but very poorly developed.
Lots of clichés.
I've watched the trailer. It had all the good ingredients - the main quest, good graphics. I saw that the makers of the movie also made ""How to train your dragon"" series. Good ingredients. The result from these two ingredients was disappointing, though.
At some point in the movie, some obstacles occurred. Generally, I say of a movie that it isn't creative enough, by solving problems merely by insisting, not by creativity and good thinking. In here, it wasn't even insisting. There is a wall in front of you - an obstacle. Suddenly, the obstacle isn't there. I exaggerate a bit, but this is pretty much how I've felt through the movie. What can you learn from an obstacle that just disappears? Not my kind of magic.
I don't like cartoons which have poor graphics. This one had very good graphics, but I didn't like the movie that much. 8/10 seems like a high grade, it's mostly due to the fact that I connected nicely with the characters.",Ad Astra

There are ways to deliver messages that are mentally stimulating and emotionally gratifying. Obviously this screenwriter is incapable of doing that.Why is this film insulting? You can tell the script adds intentionally pointless, unexplained, unmotivated action/thrill sequences intermittently just to keep viewers awake. And 100% those sequences are pointless to the plot. It's amazing because the plot itself has to be so empty and void of any merit for it to have to fabricate conflict/action out of thin air.This writer also does not respect the premise he built his movie in, because he can't even get the basics of space right. What happens when something falls through the Earth's atmosphere? Any takers?Whatever personal development/journey the protagonist was on was also poorly paced, poorly explained, and utterly vacuous.

This is not a science fiction movie, at all. Yes, it is in space. Yes, there are some planets. And yes, there are some spaceships. Oh, yes, there are some space pirrates, AND a bunch of killer monkeys.
Wait, what?! Why?
Oh, no reason whatsoever. They are not important for the plot, they are just there. Maybe becouse pirrates are cool these days, and monkey eating astronauts are something new and fresh, I dont know. Or care...
Just forget about logic in this one.

1208,dirty_chords,This is not the annual sci-fi blockbuster you were looking for. Thankfully.,9,17 September 2019,"Disclaimer: Ad Astra is a masterful psychological drama disguised as a gorgeous sci-fi epic. This is not the next popcorn space adventure flick some were desperately waiting for. In fact, it is way more than that.Driven by some of the greatest acting Brad Pitt has ever produced, James Gray's most ambitious film to date is a total treat for the eyes. Here, cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema is reaching new heights of creativity in his artistic vision, which easily differentiates his present work from the likes of Interstellar (especially those scenes with Ruth Negga are spectacular). Special reference must be made to the beautifully generated special effects, which really make this movie a contender for the most realistic depiction of space (as Gray himself had in mind). Camera doesn't shy away from taking a closer look at its protagonist, using angles that elevate every aspect of his skillfuly understated performance. As the story moves deeper in space (and Roy plunges deeper into the hidden wounds of his psyche), Pitt's exceptionally well-executed facial expressions, eye movements and mannerisms reveal fragments of instability to an almost frightening extent, given how much of a calculated, calm and disciplined person the leading character seemed to be on the outside. You can virtually see Roy's deconstruction and recontruction throughout this epic journey into the abyss (of outer space and human soul).Questions are raised, and answers are not always easy to digest. A life devoted to achieving a ""greater"" professional/scientific (but not necessarily noble) goal can lead to alienation and eventually abstaining from life itself. And it's not like it's always a rewarding journey. It often just leaves behind severely traumatized souls, as Gray's depressive, introspective space drama depicts in the most touching way.If there are any negatives to be pointed out: Perhaps a little too many references to Apocalypse Now (at least I found them a bit distracting).p.s.: Many haters will desperately try to discredit this film. The easiest path is to rant about the screenplay and overly focus on supposed ""plot holes"", taking the plot at face value despite the movie's metaphorical approach. Sadly, they are missing the main themes along with every point it tries to make. It's actually very absurd, since most of the scepticists are obviously fans of Interstellar, whose ending is a plot hole the size of a... black hole!

And here's the rub: if we've seen these space adventures before, then bring some snap to it, some humor, some unrelenting unpredictability. Take some of the major themes: A father in mortal battle with his son who either invites or rejects his progeny all the while chasing an impossible dream (Star Wars). A character, who like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, seek life beyond the rainbow because he either can't appreciate a real rainbow or can't tolerate the multicolored knottiness of human day-to-day drama back home. To pull off this themes with some life in them, unfortunately the director can't see the galaxy for the stars, and gets pulled instead into the gravity of plodding, unrelentless, and highly predictable dramatic arcs. There are also incomprehensible plot turns that defy explanation, such as the reasons for mayday on a seemingly abandoned space craft or why a whole crew would turn on its captain. Finally, any human intimacy, such as the Astronaut Pitt's marriage is so shallowly depicted, it has no emotional payoff. In the end, the film's elements--its dramatic highlights, set designs, CGI effects--are flattened out by a repetitive pulsing score, which creates one unified ponderously depressing tone that persists throughout the movie and after one departs the theater.

1215,riesel72,Don't waste your time on this nonsensical crap,2,26 June 2020,"Here's a spoiler right off the bat concerning the GENRE:
If you go in thinking this is a sci-fi film, you will be sorely disappointed.
This is a out-right DRAMA -- that has a few non-essential action scenes thrown in that could've been completely deleted & not missed or affect the plot/story or characters in any way -- that happens to be set mostly in space. Yep the setting ids space, that's about as sci-fi as it gets.The PLOT starts out intriguing but only if you ignore what everyone says so when you find out what's actually happening you won't be disappointed that everyone who guessed at what is probably happening had it right during the first 20 minutes & there are NO surprises whatsoever.
The plot only serves Brad Pitt's character to simply BE there. There is NO reason for his character to exist otherwise and he serves NO purpose other than to inject him into the plot.... which creates more issues & turns what was a fairly realistic drama into a ""turn off your mind & enjoy what we tell you to enjoy because it will make no sense if you think about it for even a second""So my spoiler-happy thoughts: there is no security whatsoever in the future with these places as anyone can waltz into any high-security area or read classified material.And, Brad Pitts character can't make up his mind what he wants, so he simply injects himself into the action. where he inadvertently gets the entire crew killed because HE wants to do what they are assigned to do.... which he literally does, even though he didn't want to? Or maybe he did? He can't make up his mind due to his daddy issues, even when daddy flat out says he doesn't care about anyone or anything other than his mission. Absolutely no events would have played out differently had Pitt's character stayed back & the ship's crew went ahead: destroy the anti-matter engine & kill the the old scientist/dad. Well, the old scientist commits suicide even with Pitt's pleads & intervention, so everything worked out exactly as the original crew was ordered to do.
The ending: this is the most depressing ""optimistic"" ending ever, even if every scientific theory says we can't possibly be the ONLY living life in the universe. but y'know, we got to Neptune so that's the truth now, I guess.But the most insane part of the movie is: apparently Pitt is now the hero that saved the solar system so his wife who left him NOW wants him back.. because.. y'know... he's a celebrity now I guess. But wait. Think back on all the rules he broke & deaths he caused while he forced himself to be the one to tag along/take over the mission. The moment he was rescued, he should have been dragged to a jail cell and put on trial for all the crimes he committed. But.. we have to have a depressing-happy ending so let's ignore all the realities of his actions.
Do yourself and go watch ""Gravity"" instead. It's not a great movie, but it's a 1000 times better than this nonsensical mess.Positives: It DOES have fairly decent special effects & sets (with a lot of lens flares that block your view).

I got, a few times, the sense of unbearable immensity that only space can give - and this is a huge compliment.However, the writing was just not good enough. Pitt was amazing but his character was just too weak. Or, better yet, too strong - straight from the start there is no reason to suspect that this dude that kicks so much ass is going to achieve whatever mission he stumbles upon. In both ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Heart of Darkness"" the main characters have transparent problems and weaknesses right from the start. Also, as Willard/Marlow go up the Mekong/Congo rivers all the circumstances around them start to collapse - civilization and contact become thinner and thinner, giving a bone chilling feeling of solitude and impossibility to fulfill any task or mission.Ad Astra's wild westish Moon is interesting, but it's Mars is too solid. There is too much order, too much command, things are too polished. The guy is flying to Uranus but we have the feeling he is late to catch the train home after work.

1228,whitestar_man,Major Tom has daddy issues,6,6 October 2019,"I really wanted to like this movie more, a supposedly cerebral science movie. But to be honest it was just ok.
First of all the pacing is just wrong. It like being on Prozac. Ok you don't need excitement all the time but even the ""action"" bits are lacking. Then there are the scenes that don't really need to be.
Rather than go straight to the missing ship we go to the moon for some silly reason, then to Mars and then finally the ship.
On the moon the Major moans that the moon was just another mall now, which could have been interesting take if investigated in some way but really it just becomes a boring long product placement ad. So in itself the scene is just about paying for the movie so therefore lacks depth or sincerity.
Then we have some pointless drive to the other side of the moon to disguise what they are doing so what do they do they have these moon buggies in full sight heading off to the dark side of the moon, hardly discrete. Then we get told about moon pirates and how moon prospecting had led to a dark side of moon exploration and possible foreign government involvement but again this is just mentioned and not investigated. Then there is this pointless boring fight scene between pirate and good guy buggies that is just meh other than the old guy accompanying Pitt gets shot so can't go. So why bother? Just to give memory stick to say be careful they want to kill your dad. Then he gets on ship to Mars but they have to stop for an SOS. Ok this is a set up right? No it's a station that has lost power from the pulses and it has rabid baboons that have killed everyone on the ship and the captain of Pitts new ship. Again it tantilises an issue of wild west in space and space science gone mad but then drops it with no investigation.
We arrive on Mars with all the anticipation that there is some government conspiracy going on. Pitt reaches out to his dad, now the government types know where his dad is so send in ship with nuke to take out this big secret thing.
Putt escapes with the help of one of the few interesting characters in the movie. Boards the ship but through mix of accidents kills the crew. WTF?
Then he finally finds his dad.
Except that's about it. His dad gone mad from being so far out in space and the failure of his life work. But again rather than investigate these potentially interesting issues they are merely stated and we move on.
Oh yeah and the potential big government cover up? Nope. Just dad gone mad.
There was potential here to investigate some interesting issues of space flight and exploration, of being at the edge of space and of what if your life's work was for naught but nope just a light brush and then move on.
Pitt is very good but the movie is not.
Oh yeah he goes home, his daddy abandonment and hero complex dealt with and all is good. He gets back with his girlfriend as he can now be human.

1229,lord_orsum,Boring and nonsensical,2,1 October 2019,"Without a doubt the worst movie that I have seen this year,
I get the impression that James Gray (writer, director, producer) saw 2001, The Martian, Gravity and Interstellar and thought ""I want to make a movie like that!"".
However, what we get is a slow moving series of situations that make no sense, where characters act in a completely implausible manner and, worst of all, does not hold up to the most basic of scientific scrutiny.
Why (or even how) are there pirates on the moon? Where were the bodies on the Norwegian space station? Why did Roy suddenly start baring his soul in his psych evaluation after years of hiding his feelings? How did a space program with psych evaluations every five minutes fail to pick up on his crushing daddy abandonment issues? Why does nuking the anti-matter that spacecom is so afraid of not cause the surge that they are trying to stop? Roy has a jet-pack so why does he have to land so hard on his spaceship?

McBride Jr's (Pitt) gruelling quest to find his long-lost Papa would have been MUCH better served by a less fiddly Earth-bound narrative. The significant moment of realisation that McBride Sr (Jones) is not the heroic explorer popular history has cast him as is passed by at warp speed, with but a brief choke from Pitt. The important understanding that McBride Jr finds (he has spent much of his life trying to be the man his father was supposed to be, when he should have been the man Dad was NOT) is briefly dispatched almost at the final credits. The emergent issue (the difficulty and pain of letting go), which is REALLY what the whole story seems to be about, is fatally condensed into a few seconds of cinematic neutron star material during a brief father-and-son space walk in orbit around Neptune.
The rest is all comic-book sci-fi tropes: besting stroppy pirates in a buggy-battle on the Moon (yes, really!), plucky Roy Starr -sorry, McBride, taking manual control of a stricken spaceship and safely landing it on Mars, that sort of thing, and a good deal of not very science-based uhm...science. Cosmic ray bursts from a wee bit of anti-matter? I dunno, you tell me -anyway, it all has a very 'OK; we're movie makers not physicists here, so don't look too closely at this bit...' which is nowhere near good enough nowadays.

As it is with James Grey's aesthetically beautiful Ad Astra.The cinematics are stunning, the sound design intense and pressing. For the sense this movie is a wow. Rarely can a film, though such limited means, convey to us the expanse of not just space, but the endless wastes of moon deserts, the harshness of bleakness of mars, and the isolation of humanity within the universe. All at the same time providing a perfect counter point in how close and bundled together we all are.With seeking to praise this movie many would stop at its artistic qualities, but in truth the worth of Ad Astra runs much deeper. This is not a genre movie, it is not sci-fi, it is not an action movie, nor an adventure movie, it is an introspective look at the human element of solitude, disconnection and isolation. Is there action scenes? Yes, well timed and fantastically passed set pieces give us the audience a reason to raise our heart beats: a moon-buggy chance upon the surface of Luna; a mysterious wreckage floating in space; the rush to stowaway upon a departing rocket; all cut through the patient story of Major McBride on his mission to meet his father.Brad Pitt holds the story on his own. For two hours it is his actions, his introspective thoughts that lead the way through a plot that is - much to the ire of many - as straight as coursing arrow. There are no real twists, no under handed deceptions by way of the writers. We are party to the dilemmas and decisions of Major McBride for good and for bad, but with elation I can report that Pitt has the talent to keep us with him the whole way through.Backed up by cameos from Liv Tyler, Ruth Negga and Tommy Lee Jones, Ad Astra is very much the brilliance of director James Grey rendered palatable by the smooth talents of Brad Pitt.I entered this movie weighted down by poor reviews and harsh criticisms, I left awed by a beauty I did not see coming.",Ad Astra

Oh wait, sorry - you needed him to be there in person, just in case the dad responds?

1258,MouazHajBakri,Per Aspera Ad Astra,9,28 September 2019,"Fatherhood, solitude, longitude for salvation, the dream of eternity, humanity's basic savage bestiality, and our eternal struggle to understand and be understood, all these themes are brilliantly explored by James Gray, Brad Pitt, and Tommy Lee Jones's last project, Ad Astra. The abstract is a world advanced and capable of exploring and populating our closest neighbors, our sole moon and our red neighbor, Mars, with efforts to explore what is beyond the borders of our solar system. Thirty years prior to the protagonist's timeline, Tommy Lee Jones who played Brad Pitt's father, lead ""the Lima project"", the most ambitious and dangerous of human expeditions, a trip towards Neptune, the farthest humanity had ever reached, in a desperate yet an optimistic mission to search, find, and connect with the inevitable extraterrestrial intelligence. The crew of Lima project and their mission have been lost in the void of space and time and all that is left of it is a monumental shadow that resembles humanity's hardships to reach the stars. What is also left from the mission is Brad Pitt's convoluted and deformed relationship of a father figure so enlarged and so vague, that it covered his own qualities with loneliness, darkness, and anger. These qualities had shaped him to be a great pioneer, pragmatic, effortless, yet cursed him with a concrete soul that distanced him from any meaningful or sustained human connection. With time, the failed project had turned to be a destructive source of ""anti-matter"" that raged and started to threat all life. The movie starts with the necessary mission of Brad Pitt to explore his father's past and find his lost base to undo this existentially catastrophic mistake.Ad Astra is made as a visual poem told by masterful minimalistic cinematography and poignant performances of its few actors. The movie is full of allegories that are explored through two major parts. The first, acts as a rough journey to reach the father, an odyssey that starts with a mockery of humanity's occupation of the moon, which should have been a land that unifies all, only to turn into a small pathetic reproduction of capitalism, greed, and our same old eternal conflicts to control and acquire more resources. The moon has different and distant bases that are separated by ""no man"" lands that had drown by piracy and war defined as ""a wild west out there"".The journey continues to another void between existences, the path between Moon and Mars, with further wilderness and lonesomeness, portrayed by a Mayday signal sent from a Norwegian ship that the crew of Pitt's ship responds to. This side journey ends with catastrophe when the captain dies by wild apes that killed and devoured the original Norwegian crew after breaking free from their cages inside the ship. The apes were angry and terrifying, attacking with no mercy or boundaries, something that Pitt's character identified with as a ""rage that I can understand"". We reach Mars, stepping further away from beauty and life. Mars's base is as barren as its planet. Lifeless, red, dusty, devoid of soul, and utterly depressing. The base is controlled by a ruthless military leadership that used the protagonist to communicate with his father without informing him of the true purpose nor the real response. Piece by piece, our protagonist touches the reasons for his hatred of humanity's lies and deceit. What follows is the shock that Pitt had sensed all his life, his father's legacy as the greatest pioneer in human history is but of a murderer who slew the other crew members of the Lima project after they were defeated by their fright of solitude and intended to go back to earth, something that the father disdains and halts with absolute brutality. And thus ends the first long part of this odyssey.The second part starts with a cruel action of the protagonist that affirms the fact that he is as ruthless and ""mission-focused"" as his father was. He attempts to control the ship heading towards Neptune and ""accidentally"" kills all the other crew members. He acknowledges his acts and takes responsibility for them in a failed attempt to distinguish himself from his father. His long and dreary final journey towards his father's base starts. He achieves the absolute solitude away from any human touch, something he sought for decades. But the experience wasn't as he had craved, the abyss was utterly dark, entirely emotionless which drove him to the brink of insanity. The eternal silence of space had forced him to see his true self, lonely and selfish; He repeated these words, "" I am alone, I am alone, I am alone"" ""I am so selfish, I am so selfish, I am a selfish person"" again and again, things he truly were but never really understood. Solitude turned to be dangerous rather than intimate, insane and torturous rather than safe. Through this eternal void, he was going through an unimaginable agony, slowly and unknowingly stepping further towards salvation. He reaches his father's base, enters the old forgotten dungeon of the mad man, sees the bodies that his father murdered decades ago as shrines of his achievements, and breathes the toxic air that Pitt's legacy was.Then starts my favorite part of the movie, ""Roy?"" shouts the father, Brad Pitt looks up to find him standing on a ladder above him, a perspective that resembles the father shape that he worshiped for so long. The father quickly and without an ounce of shame affirms his true self, ""I never cared about you or your mother's or any of your small ideas"". The confrontation shifts from intimidation towards pity, beautifully captured by the ascendance of the protagonist to stand face to face against his dad, and powerfully depicted by the actors' full engagement of these tender state of minds. The son pressures his father towards abandoning the idea and the ship, the father escapes into a dark corner away from his son's touch but eventually surrenders. Pity turns into intimacy, the son helps the father to wear the suit, and reassures him that he didn't fail his mission in finding alien intelligence, because he had discovered the ultimate truth, ""we are all that we got"". Still, the father lived in insanity for too long and had lost all his attachments to life. He craved intimacy through the void and forgot what was in front of him, so this father-son short intimacy breaks into conflict and leads to the final stage of this brilliant confrontation, which is to let go. The son manages to break from his father's ideal, and the father finally escapes into the death that he danced aside for so long. The journey ends with the rebirth of the protagonist as he reaches home to seek the love that he had lost in the past.Ad Astra digs deep into really big ideas, and my main criticism of the movie is that its too big for its own medium. I think what really stood short in here is the timing, as an extra hour would have transcended this piece into an unforgettable masterpiece, but imprisonment by the need of commercial success is a dream killer as it does to most projects of art.
There are two different stories in Ad Astra, both would have needed more details and an even slower pace. A series would have been the ultimate triumph that sadly we did not get.Yet, Ad Astra is magical and deep, portrayed through tender emotions and shot with breathtaking cinematography. Its heavily affected by Kubrick's space odyssey , Ridley Scott's blade runner, and Frances Coppola's Apocalypse Now, by drawing several examples from the general dreary atmosphere of the journey towards meaning; the connection with artificial intelligence as ""Hal"" in the odyssey; the steely psychological analysis of the replicas in the Blade Runner; and the long trip towards the insane in Apocalypse Now. But the movie manages to take its own beautiful course of exploration of fatherhood and attachments to the past and through that dissects our instinct in craving connection and love, to reach the final conclusion of this picture, which is that the answers we seek, and the meaning we need, are mere inches from us, right here, within the intimate touch of our fellow beings, who are our true stars and our so beloved Astra.",Ad Astra

Oh boy, was I wrong.I sat for the entirety of the film waiting for something to happen other than Brad Pitt commentating in a depressing, monotonous voice about his family issues.I'm leaving this review because if you're thinking about renting/buying it, PLEASE don't, wait for it to appear somewhere free in a few years.",Ad Astra

The makers of ""Ad Astra"" would have done well to watch the TV series ""The Expanse"". The expanse is s great example of how a story about a future solar system should be done.To summarise, Ad Astra was a ridiculous story, with bad science and mediocre acting all the way. The hero has to travel to Mars to send a message to Neptune to attempt to stop damaging signals coming from there. Why? On the way he stops at the moon and gets involved in a local war where the protagonists battle each other in Apollo era moon buggies. Really?

1304,moviefest-90757,"Hoyte, Gray, Pitt and Richter all deserve oscar shouts for what is easily the most beautiful, intimate and immersive experience you'll have all year!",9,11 October 2019,"James Grays most recent exploration into film takes you on a visually thrilling journey to the far, lonely depths of space and beyond. But ""Ad Astra"" isn't just any space exploration film; it's a fully realised, visual orgasm that has as much substance as it does style. James Gray pulls no punches here, from start to finish there's a horrifying suspense as this slow burner slowly takes you on a beautiful, yet terrifying and lonely journey throughout space, thats full of twists, turns and plenty of bumps in the road.
.
I cannot help but admire Gray for creating, in my opinion, one of the most realistic experiences of space exploration. Never does this journey once feel easy or straightforward, the atmosphere and environment of space are constantly testing, threatening the lives of whoever dare try and traverse it. Not only that, but every detail to provide you with a beautifully immersive experience is on point; the sound effects are intense, Max Richter's score completely isolates you, making you feel lonely, shut-off from all existence and lost, and it's utterly haunting, yet harmonious and wonderful. The costumes are spot on. Every frame is aesthetically and thematically pleasing, Hoyte Van Hoytema never wastes a frame, each one has a meaning and a purpose to the story and/or character development.
.
Grays unflinching direction and thought-provoking screenplay provide ample food for thought, like, how us, the human race, only want more and more, we're never happy with what we've got, we consume everything in our path, but still thirst for more. We also struggle to let things or people go, but what if we could? How would it change our lives?
.
There's also the terrifying questions of, what if there are no other forms of life beyond earth? And what if we are all we've got? We should all just take some time to appreciate what we have individually and as a civilisation and stop always wanting for more. If you pay close attention, there's so much going on, whether the film's on about human civilisation as a whole, space exploration, the aforementioned questions, or the in-depth character study and personal growth of Brad Pitts protagonist Roy McBride, it's always grounded, intimate and packed with substance, even with such a lack of dialogue.
.
This is Brad Pitt's film, the supporting cast are essentially all just stepping stones for his character to personally progress. He gives a masterfully nuanced performance that really pulls at the heartstrings, for a man so closed-off, monotonous and unafraid, Roy sure is rife with pain, anguish, loneliness and resentment, and all of this was subtly displayed through Pitts exemplary use of facial expressions - especially his eyes - and some magnificent camera angles.

Rather he/she takes the alternative form of an anti-matter energy .... or is the anti-matter energy actually a virulent expression of evil? Don't know, don't care. Chances are you won't either after about a half hour into this epic convoluted orbital melodrama sprinkled with pop rocket philosophy which may be more aptly described as taking up space via the quantum physics theory of "" doesn't matter "". You may ask yourself why do 'nauts still have bulky space suits this far into the future? Apparently technology hasn't advanced much since 1969. Meanwhile, ethereal synth tones over snazzy cinematography of jazzy spacecraft interiors may aid you in suspending your disbelief and dampen your yearning for an actual substantive galactic excursion toward Planet Entertainment. Good luck getting through the Van Allen Belt. Donald Sutherland shows up as an octogenarian action hero to inject some life into the goings in only to be yanked into a black hole prematurely. There is a reported tragedy communicated by "" Big Daddy "" aka Tommy Lee Jones to offspring Brad Pitt from Neptune via Jetson phone who later declines any interest in returning to earth, possibly due to a dearth of engaging films, but I'm just speculating.

Unfortunately none of them are financially successful and that's why I know this Golden Age will not last long.I'm not going to argue actual science with Ad Astra, I don't go to films for scientific accuracy and am just looking to connect on an emotional level and this did that for me to a high degree hence the 10 rating.And if people think this is boring I do not see how the same people could enjoy Space Odyysey 2001 or Apocalypse Now which is a shame as they are obviously great films.

1317,WinterWoodwere1,Horribly Disappointing,4,22 January 2020,"Fans of forgettable, uninformed, uninteresting, science fiction can rejoice that there is finally a big budget movie for them! Ad Astra is at an interesting position cinematically. But that's probably the only thing interesting about it.What do I mean by this? Well. It's not an action movie, yet it's not slow science fiction either. instead it's a disappointing combination of the two in which logic is sacrificed for action, and action is sacrificed for pseudo intellectualism. Given that this movie ignores many real, basic scientific facts (such as what the heliosphere is) we can eliminate the idea that this is a well researched scientific based movie that was handicapped by it's non-existent emotional aspects. This isn't a thoughtful character study because the character doesn't develop and is not analyzed at all. So I'm left wondering what the intention of this movie is.In a bizarre case of misjudgment, someone thought that the goal of everything involving space is to find aliens. This element seems to be the reason everything in space is there. Every station and building seems to be about finding alien life, or profiting from the concept via tourism? Perhaps this was to connect the main character to his father? Maybe they thought that not giving us an answer would be a clever twist? Ultimately I couldn't find any reason in the movie to care.Please forgive the mortal sin of reviews that I am about to commit, but I need to summarize just how bland and predictable this movie is, all because it wants to advertise an action oriented angle. One again, I apologize for the following:
Another issue in this movie is its predictability. To force drama, every time the character must travel somewhere, a minor character will die en route. Shortly after our lead remarks that he could care less (what an opening! workers on the unnecessarily large antenna fall to their death/explode. This causes our lead to go the moon. On the moon, the lead has to travel to the dark side (for some reason) and several woefully unprotected astronauts die at the hands of moon pirates. Then on his way to mars the leads ship makes a stop (rocket equation be damned!) at a remote research space station which has sent a distress signal. While inside the station, the lead witnesses the death of the rocket pilot, at the hands of a ravenous space monkey. After some less then interesting dialogue, and a not so shocking reveal, the lead realizes he must travel to the outer solar system to meet his father. The lead sneaks aboard a rocket, the crew is then killed (and the writers desperately try to push blame away from the main character). Being the only survivor the lead makes his way to his father, a short uninformative scene later, and the two are about to return home. The father remembers that the script says a character must die before the lead travels anywhere, and so he kills himself. Some wacky uninformed but clever gravity tricks later, and the lead rides a rocket home on the back of an antimatter explosion. I'm actually surprised a rescue crew member didn't get shot or die when they were removing him from the capsule upon his return.Now that that's over... It's pretty clear that they wanted to convey danger by having people die before or during a journey, space travel is a dangerous thing in real life, micrometeorites can damage a ship, electrical fires pose a massive threat, and so things must be kept clean and monitored. However these challenges are difficult to express in a movie that wants to be perceived as an action movie, and so it is natural to create physical peril that the lead must face on their journey, however the way Ad Astra executes this feels so calculated and uninteresting.There are several areas of this movie that indicate an attempt to emulate cerebral science fiction, but forcing thoughtfulness to a low brow action movie script. For example, 2001: A Space Odyssey conveys the loneliness of space travel through music and visuals while Ad Astra conveys the same idea by having the lead tell us he will be alone for a few months, and showing him inject himself with some food substitutes something that doesn't seem very unusual because there is no prior explanation to how people eat in space during this movie, so the audience is left wondering if food substitutes are an act of desperation, the hardship of a long voyage, or standard for space travel. Moon (2009) implies untrustworthiness of the characters employer through hesitation but Ad Astra does so by having multiple characters tell the lead that ""spacecom"" is hiding the truth. It's this ""tell not show"" attitude which ruins the facade that this movie is thoughtful or ""psychological"" as it is listed on wikipedia.Really it would be much more effective for the character to have no idea as to his father's actions or status, he would travel to find answers, there could be tension as the bodies of the crew are found. In this scene the audience and the lead could be surprised and horrified when they learn it was the father that is responsible for the death of the crew. It could be interesting to learn why the father killed the crew, in a more elaborate explanatory way. Instead we get a recording where he just states he killed innocent and guilty because there was a mutiny and he wants to complete his mission to find aliens. It's very strange to think nasa or spacecom would appoint a zealot as a mission commander, and it's even stranger to think the religious zealot kills his crew because they're not being scientific enough?The balance between explaining certain elements and leaving others ambiguous is the key to good, thoughtful sci fi. If every motivation wasn't spelled out and repeated multiple times, then perhaps one could find time and room to think for ourselves. As it stands, the filmmakers likely didn't want there to be any misreading their story, so they decided to do all the thinking beforehand, and make something that's relatively straightforward and uninspiring.This movie is desperately clinging to two things: the rover scene, and the visuals. The rover scene wasn't really that amazing from a cinematic or plot standpoint. Why are the buggys so valuable to moon pirates? The spacecom ones look equivalent to or worse than the 1970s Apollo era ones. They don't look like they have any towing capacity. They don't have life support (the ones on Mars looked much safer). I have a feeling the creators of this movie thought the audience was so stupid that a new moon buggy would be too hard to imagine, so they just used what we already know. The visuals in this movie are pretty ok... some nice shots of space, or an intriguing interior design here and there... but they're in service of one of the worst plots a big budget sci fi movie has had in recent time. For instance, while on mars the lead needs to travel through a duct of what appears to be water. He wears his space suit, and is guided only by a thin wire, light only by occasional dim sections of diffused sunlight. It's a well shot scene, and is visually stimulating, but it seems to serve no purpose. Its uncertain what this corridor of water was, or why it leads to a launch pad.Overall Ad Astra is pretty bad. It may be an ok movie if you're only familiar with contemporary blockbusters, and intimidated by movies that treat their audience intelligently, but otherwise it has little to offer. It's not a realistic depiction of space travel because it's full of technical flaws, it's not a character study because there is nothing to analyze, it's not a thrilling action movie because the action is predictable and boring.Final Score (42/100)",Ad Astra

Often times illogical or far-fetched the film barely managed to keep itself grounded in a plausible story line.However, I must say I did enjoy the watch.

I not sure what century they put, maybe it make sense in the future. But no matter how, certain plot is some how silly. Fighting in the Moon? really? The monkey attack one of the space craft and is the monkey eat them 100%? Where is the left over body... .... Cannot have emotional and this will make you disqualified to continue the journey? Lastly I think they is no security control at Mars, so easier to break in. lol.His father refuse to home because he fail to find others life. Let him be, but this will make impact to the so call interference to earth and mars where came out from that space ship where locate so far away at Neptune and need to destroy? This part is the most does't make sense at all.He basically violate the laws and kill the others and he is free from any judgement? because he success destroy it. hmm...Anyway beside all the does't make sense, the acting was great, the cinematography or CGI view was brilliant and I actually quite enjoy the view.

Scientifically the movie is just ridiculous down to second grade school science. But let's leave that aside, since it Sci-Fi so let's just pretend. But the cheap 'drama' they tried to create with Pitt's slow and boring narration was one of the most devestating parts of the movie. The characters were as flat as a cutting board and any attempt to give them depth turned out like cheap beginner's drama lessons. Tommy Lee has hisv3 minutes of glory and Pitt appears as a guest in his own movie. He's detached from his character just about as much as they try to portray his character as being detached.

The cast is beyond marvelous, they fit the out-of-the-world backdrop and storyline seamlessly. Brad Pitt as a NASA astronaut, teamed up with Tommy Lee Jones and Ruth Negga and they dish out some of the most riveting performances of this year. First of all, Ad Astra does not disappoint as a space movie with its stunning visuals. Sci-Fi fans can attest to that even with preceding space movie superbness like Gravity and Interstellar. But it's far more than just pleases the eye. The dialogues in this movie have some indeed otherworldly power, and Brad Pitt's character Roy McBride definitely has a lot to say, his monologue poetically weaves through some superbly-chosen soundtracks, through earthy lights to the dark side of the cosmos. An overachieving astronaut thrust into nonbelief that his long-lost father might still be alive, McBride looks to continue his commitment to a higher calling for NASA and for himself - finding the renowned spaceman McBride the first in a galaxy far far away. Yet there is more to this journey.The fantastic direction of light, minimal set design, and a sense of earthly anxiety all make Ad Astra stand out as the art house space flick of the year as it is. We may have come so far beyond our ancestors' wildest imagination thousands of years ago, but what for the conflicted thoughts we formed vis-a-vis the vast cosmos? What if we believe space is our ultimate test only to find the most difficult humanly understanding remains on Earth? Can we really be space heroes for ""the future of humankind and all that?""

It was well shot and acted, it just doesn't impart anything significant onto the viewer to walk away with. For me it was just enough to get a brief sci-fi fix.

1342,susancvan,Pretty much action packed?,9,25 December 2019,"Okay. I wanted to see this movie so badly. Hubby and I both like science fiction, we loved the cast of Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, Brad Pitt, Liv Tyler. We saw clips of the moon scenes...Brad wants to rescue his Dad... knew nothing else about it but did read that a lot of people didn't like it. So... we bought it 4k blu-ray to watch at home and enjoyed it.
People said it was boring. They said the only action was one fight between buggies on the moon.... that was NOT the only action. They said it was all about him talking all the time, retrospective about his relationship with his Dad... they were wrong. That wouldn't actually have bothered me anyway, but thanks, because I was gripped by all the ACTION.
OKAY... some of the science is wrong. I am not a scientist, so I let them humour me through most of it, but I don't think there's that much water on Mars that makes that the only route to the launch pad... but I'm not a scientist and I don't live on Mars...so I was ok with that.... the getting on board after the launch sequence has begun and the engines are firing? I did have a problem with that. but...it's a movie! In Star Wars there are people with green skin who have ears that pivot.
What it was NOT was boring.... It was not boring. It was action scene after action scene as I saw it. Yes...he get to the moon and there are 3 buggies carrying "" VP's"" Pitt and Sutherland and they are beset on by pirates. How can you say this wouldn't be possible? It's the future. Then Sutherland has an attack which lands him in the hospital so he can't go any further. I love Donald Sutherland so I now care about him and hope he's ok. SO now though Brad has to go by himself with a top secret, tell no-one mission. It's imperative that he carries this out, first priority, so when a Norwegian science vessel with 26 people on board send out an SOS, he tries to tell the Captain they can't stop to help. The Captain asserts that they are obligated as a directive to assist and when Pitt objects, the Captain asserts his authority again and demands Pitt tell him why his mission is so important and demands to know the classified details. The Co-pilot looks like he's okay with skipping an encounter where 26 people aren't answering their hails, and I'll admit I am a coward. I think cowards are smart... it's gotta be bad... help me, but none of the 26 people are available to reply? WE don't know what happened but all probably best left alone... but Pitt... well trained as he is, can't reveal his own orders, allows for the delay and offers to assist our Captain in place the the intelligent but cowardly but smart co-pilot. They fly in suits to the Scandi craft which we learn is 26 scientist doing animal experiments... apparently bad ones... I won't say more...spoilers... but not boring? I jumped! And not ridiculous.... lord knows what we willl experiment on in the future.
Then to Neptune... okay... how is he not older, I guess? but maybe we've acquired a method of travel we don't know about yet... sheesh it's science FICTION! Are we going to toss out Orson Well's Time Machine? It's a movie... it's entertainment... I are up on a steady diet of Star Trek, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Space 1999, Soylent Green, 1984, 2001 a Space Odyssey... I don't expect science fiction to be explainable by today's science People who thought this was slow moving must think the best science fiction is Guardians of the Galaxy.... oh... but the ones looking for logic and critique the science aspect? go give ""Them"" a try, it's about giant ants.
Speaking about logic, it was one of Pitt's characthers' strengths and flaws. He was almost Vulcan in his approach to everything. It sure sounded like Tim Russ (Tuvok) was the computer voice speaking to him. ""Your psychological analysis is complete.""
I won't tell you what happens in the end, but I will tell you it was NOT boring. The visuals were great... it looked like the moon, it looked like Mars, the sound was great.... we have a home theatre with pretty powerful speakers and take-offs rocked the speakers so hard a stack of cd's fell off the top.
If you LOVE Liv Tyler and you're waiting for her... she's not in it much... Donals Sutherland's part is pretty small as well... and we don't see Tommy Lee Jones much either... I still thought it was really good.... if you are expecting long conversations with his Dad, it's not that deep...to me it's just a really good sci fi movie. up there with Gravity, Interstellar, 2001, Star Trek, So many haters in here...

1350,tzeup,How can modern Science Fiction movies get science and physics so wrong?,2,29 September 2019,"Warning: Spoilers.I love science fiction movies. I always have. One important thing to keep in mind is that sometimes the writers and directors need a pass once in a while in order to move a good sci-fi story forward. But this movie goes beyond that to the point of just being insulting with one ridiculous thing after another.The Mild:
1) Anti-Matter explosions on a spaceship near Neptune causing CME-type particles to hit the earth similar to solar flares, causing power blackouts, sent there to pass the Heliosphere to detect aliens.
The Earth's magnetic field protects us from that kind of thingThe energy required would destroy that shipNeptune is much further away from the earth than we are from the sunetc.But OK, it's sci-fi, I'll give this a pass. What's next:2) The movie's hero does a space walk to fix an Antenna on a tower that is mounted on the earth, yet high enough to be above the atmosphere, so that it can do a better job listening for aliens.Taller antenna's don't accomplish this. Multiple Dish-style antennas like which are used by SETI would do a much better job at much lower cost.I'd give this an OK, but the scene featuring this does not serve the story at all.3) Where is the moon again?
When going to the moon, the lead character's ship is pointing directly at the moon which is wrong. Any ship going from the earth to the moon needs to be going in the direction of where the moon WILL BE, not where it IS NOW.But I can give this a pass because maybe their rockets are faster. Sigh. Anyway:4) Full Gravity on the moon.
Yes, I kid you not. Brad's character goes to the moon and walks around with hundreds of others in normal gravity. No explanation as to how this is accomplished. Just full gravity because audience: stupid.At one point after this some moon buggies take off across the lunar landscape in full gravity again, and oh yeah! Have a gun fight with pirates. Shortly after this, one of the buggies does a semi-soft landing to suggest lower gravity, but its quickly forgotten and back to normal dumbness.5) On their way to Mars they pickup a distress signal by another ship that just happens to be in the same area.
They ""stop"" in space to answer the call.No mention about the energy required to slow down, stop, accelerate again later.6) Under Pressure! While on that space ship, a crazy monkey goes on a rampage. Our hero closes the door, and lets the atmosphere out and the monkey's head explodes.UGH! It doesn't work this way. If a human or any animal suddenly found themselves in a no-pressure situation, your blood would boil and the air would be sucked out of your lungs, but you would not explode. (You also would not instantly freeze to death)7) Ship does a vertical landing on mars.
A ship landing on mars, engine down and firing, is extremely inefficient. No parachutes are used to even slow its descent, no gentle orbit is used to burn off speed. Just land.8) Swimming in an underwater lake on mars
Ok I could give this a pass as its interesting. My only complaint is that the distance is very long, and his speed is very low. You'll know what I mean when you see it.9) Climbing up the side of a rocket, from its base, as its taking off (And opening a hatch, and getting on board)
The vibration would kill him.The rush of atmosphere might at least blow him offOpening the hatch while taking off is // never mind.This isn't a super-hero movie. Its not a James Bond movie or even a Die Hard movie either.10) Near Neptune, a space ship has a spinning Radar-type antenna. Hero Brad uses it to ""fling"" himself through the rings of Neptune to another ship.There's not enough energy in the spinning antenna.How did he aim himself so perfectly? He didn't. Of course he didn't.A spinning anything on any object in space would result in a counter-spin of the main object in the opposite direction and -- I give up.There are more, but you get the idea.The movie wants to be Part 2001: A Space Odyssey, part Gravity. While those movies had flaws too they at least tried harder to get the basics right.So OK, I am really knit-picking. I guess its because I was thinking that somehow this was going to be a really good science-fiction movie full of yummy brain-goodness. It wasn't.",Ad Astra

1355,nessieclarks,"Ad Astra review, with a little bit of 4dx review.",7,4 October 2019,"The focus of the movie as I experienced it was, more on the relationship Between Roy and his father. not what I expected. The saga just happened to be set in space. but ok, I can't blame the movie for that.
However the plot, anti matter is going to destroy all life as we know it, is really to simplistic. the solution, of blowing everything up, lacks creativity. Clearly this was not the part of the movie that the writer thought was important, and it showed.
The sidetrack where, Roy on his way to Mars, encounters the monkeys from hell on a spacestation, is too B movie level. And does nothing, for the plot except for adding some cheap thrills.
This part of the movie I give a 5.
That being said, there are significant redeeming features, which outweigh these negative items.
The beautiful pictures of the moon. The slow gliding feeling you get when you are in space, due to the chair movement. Enjoying a buggy ride on the moon with full 4dx experience. Rocketing through the rings of neptune, closeups of Mars and Jupiter. feeling the jolt of a pull of a rope in space which is tied to your middle, feeling the wind in your face when the camera swoops down in a valley on earth, need I go on.... that was amazing. This part I give a 9.
The problem is that when the experience, is so doubly distributed, the movie feels disconnected, You are not quite sure what to think of it, when walking out of the movie theater.
Definitely not on the same level as interstellar, the martian or gravity, but if you are like me and love everything that has to do with planetary exploration, then it is worth going.",Ad Astra

A story about the loneliness of a man to join his father who had taken the path of loneliness earlier than him. And an experience feedback at the end of the film draws our own story!",Ad Astra
1358,DarienWest,A collection of many great elements held back by bad writing.,5,28 September 2019,"If the writing were ignored, I would give this a 7/10. The acting is pretty solid, Brad Pitt is extremely good at playing his character, the sets and backgrounds are immersive, the music is solid but isn't special, and the CGI is convincing. There were also some decent shots. The only thing hurting that rating is the sound design which is kind of inconsistent at times. There's a scene where the characters are on the moon and shouldn't hear anything except for the radios, and part of the time this is true but there are other parts where you can still hear the outside.But when you factor in how the plot and characters are written, my rating of the movie gets tanked. The main character doesn't really change throughout the story that much, his motivations or thoughts aren't really explored that much, and throughout the film there are scenes of dialogue in his head which wouldn't have made a difference if they were removed. There were a lot of illogical moments, plot holes, and contrivances which didn't feel as if much care was put into them. The world that this takes place in (the future) isn't very well developed, and even though we visit the Moon and Mars we never really get a glimpse of the society. On Mars we only see about 4 people in total, even though a character mentions that thousands live there. At the beginning another character mentions territorial wars on the Moon... how did that ever happen? Well, they never really say. While I do understand that this is something that the main character most likely already knows, and it would seem awkward if this was explained to them, there has to be some other way it could be explained to the audience.But with that said, I don't think this movie is entirely bad. I would still recommend it, just to show people how big a difference writing can make in a movie's quality just because of how little it is cared for. Personally I thought most of the film was unengaging, but maybe you have different tastes and can watch this easily.",Ad Astra
1359,TonFisch,"Started in automatic, insisted on manual but could not find the gears",5,11 October 2019,"After a more or less standard opening establishing the typical problem caused by the typical military people needs to be solved by our hero, while remaining undercover, because how else?
This hero is the first thing that is not standard, not completly at least.
Some more imersive SciFi world gets built.The next what felt like 20 minutes was good. Humanity has the foot in the door to a inter planetary species, atmosphere is dark and the ""bad guys"" feel shady.
Action kicks off with a chase, the real bad guys show up.
Then the story, that opted to drive automatic with all-typical until now, decides it wants to drive in manual, then proceeds to not getting into 3rd gear.At this point the VFX guys called it a week, so dirty default concrete military base set gets taken from storage. No Sci-Fi for you!Our new found crew follows a call for help and finds an empty ship. Tension rises as none is there to explain anything. What I suspect is an experiment gone wrong, that info is given, then leads to a minor inconvenience for Mr No-Feelings hero.
This empty ship that is there because... who knows why it is there, for action reasons.
Instead of the crew bonding over this event, they get put on a shelf, because we may need them later.Military shady happens. Nothing is explained, more loose strings get tossed out.And the shade is taken away with a typical Sci-Fi glas tablet. Because driving automatic is easier. We would be picking up speed, but the tension curve is a straight line going nowhere. No depth to the main character except for ""maybe my dad is the bad guy?""-feels.
The movie takes the 5 minute break to confirm, shady military guys are shady confirmed.Crew from earlier who we did not know gets killed for good in a horror movie style bad decisions gone wrong event. And this would be very tragic, if we would have been introduced to them. Mr. No-Feelings has brief seld doubt. The film is desperatly trying to get 3rd gear in and climb the tension hill!Turns out, we had enough speed to slide over the crest. Time for 30 minutes of absolutely nothing! Camera crew and VFX guys did an amazing job though.Rolling on a straight in 2nd gear, the expected ending gets dragged out a bit.
Someone then decided to suddenly cut to a foreshadowing, and then back to this little tension we had going to kill it off for good.And then the thing... ends.
All the loose ends are hanging like the electrician quit his job after taking the ceiling tiles out.Its own logic was thrown overboard at some point. Ships suddenly do the Starwars thruster break (without front facing thrusters), to be honest, I did not care anymore.Music and Sound were good, images were well crafted.

I tried to find something good in it, but there wasn't - except for the visual effects. Unfortunately, that is as good as it gets.
As for the performances, they all were pretty vanilla, no energy was put into any of them at all. The movie itself was super slow paced, and all the time there countless of close ups each one of the actor's faces. That was so distracting.Verdict: You can skip this movie if you want.

1374,megamatt-80194,"""Ad Astra"" tells us something we should hear.",8,4 June 2020,"I will give no spoilers in this review, since I went in blind and was pleasantly surprised.Ad Astra is a really beautiful film. Not only in its stunningly gorgeous cinematography and visuals, but in its development of its main character, and his ""hero's journey"" if you will.Brad Pitt, who gives a subtle and realistically somber portrayal of astronaut Roy McBride, soars throughout the Solar System in an attempt to stop and hopefully reconnect with his father, Cliff McBride, who might cause the death of the human race.Along the way, the audience is shown wonderful depictions of The Moon and Mars, complete with social and consumerism satire, and gets to experience artistic and influential cinematography.In the end, the heart of the film is really what makes it so spectacularly memorable and important. The message it says, which I won't give away, is somewhat frightening, but ultimately humbling and truthfully inspiring.The emotional and mental voyage Cliff goes through within his relationship with his father is heartbreaking and engrossing. In space films, it's rarely ever full of quiet moments filled with thought provoking questions. But Ad Astra is filled with those important quiet scenes, and also contains swashbuckling action. It finds a fantastic balance between fantasy and reality.Some complain that the science isn't correct, and that the film is too slow. First of all, of course the science isn't realistic. We don't have colonies on the moon. Does no one recognize what ""Science Fiction"" means anymore? It's fiction people!The pacing could be annoying and boring for some. But I'm so used to arthouse films, and intense character studies that this film was truly incredible to witness. A space fantasy with the development of an arthouse film. It's really something that isn't around much.For any negatives, I do feel that while the message is important and eye-opening, the writing sometimes is extremely unsutble, especially in dialogue. The plot is a little basic and bare-bones, but honestly, it didn't bother me that much. We're so used to increasingly bulky and complex plotlines these days that a simple plot stands out in a crowd. But just because something is simple on the outside, it doesn't mean it isn't complex on the inside. Luckily, Ad Astra is.So, in this time of quarantine, I don't see what's wrong with exploring the stars a little. Taking some time to look inside ourselves and realize just how important we really are is something we can all do. Ad Astra is getting a lot of negativity, but it surely doesn't deserve it. If you want to think, and if complex questions and answers is what you dig, Ad Astra is for you.Maybe if you're lucky, a trip through space will help you appreciate our planet even more.",Ad Astra

Brad Pitt turns in a decent performance but once again a scifi film has a ridiculous plot.A near-future astronaut with psychological abandonment issues has to confront his father near the edge of the solar system who is somehow responsible for growing ecological disasters back on Earth.I understand what the writers attempted to do with the story but a good hour of the film is completely superfluous. What was the point of the constant disasters? The moon pirates - why? The Norwegian ship on which the biological experiments had obviously gone horribly wrong - why include that entire scene? What possible purpose did it serve? The near-death experience on the flight from the Moon to Mars - what was that for? The fight on board the ship just after leaving Mars - again what narrative purpose did that serve? The central story of the film wasn't as terrible as some make it out to be but there was just so many scenes that served no purpose whatsoever.What science there was in the film was horribly inaccurate but sadly that's par for the course these days with scifi. It is what it is.Overall? This is the space film that Arthur Shopenhauer would have made. Overall a 4/10 as a scifi movie.

Unfortunately the main character is unsympathetic, unlikable, and just plain boring. Every character in the movie is one dimensional and gone so quickly you didn't have time to care one bit about them. The story was simple, get from A to B and do C, so they added all these random events that just don't make much sense, or even feel like they fit together.

There's just us, looking for ourselves, looking for an escape from what we've done to and from man, i.e. from what we've already are. This movie tells us about the need for new narratives concerned with the man on earth, not with a man in space. It tells us about the need of the Other, the need of reconnection with the Other and the possibility to achieve it by becoming present, hic et nunc. Thus the plot is a philosophical investigation of the need for relationship, trauma, and most of all - pain.It's slow, indeed, but that's where its beauty lies. The camera takes are breath taking.

Roy is the epitome of the calm, cool, and collected type, but almost to a fault: he barely seems real anymore, and has become so focused on work and duty that he's neglected his personal relationships.It's hard to review this film without talking to the ending, because that's the part that really got to me. The entire film leads you to believe it will be about alien encounters, but it does opposite: there are no aliens nearby, and we're effectively alone in the galaxy.This conclusion that humans are (most likely) the only intelligent life in the galaxy has significant implications: If we're truly alone in the milky way, that means we truly are special and we need to treasure our limited existence.The film seems to acknowledge this by making Roy reconcile with his wife in the end, which I think implies he's realized how special humanity really is.

It represents the willingness of human imagination to spin tales about how far we are willing to not go. The absurdity of the conditions set forth with this story was enough for me to enjoy this film. I tire of cliche and desire more introspective dialogue. As one clever reviewer points out the similarities of 2001: Space Odyssey and Apocalypse Now, I go yes that's what film is all about, things don't need to blow up every five seconds and space rules need not apply for a story of heart and mind.

The movie is like I titled this review, an eye candy for people that enjoy cinematography.Story in the movie isn't something that one should hope for to see or...hear. It's straight forward story, but with small events along the way that can feel natural, yet at the same time mind bugling because they can feel rando. These events have small introductions, small explanations before they happen, or at the moment of it happening. Events themselves are short, thus it creates this feeling to which we are not accustomed to feel, but can be frustrating or...weird to some viewers. These are basically meaningless events that are happening, meaningless to the general story, but at the same time, when you think about it, these events gives this natural feel to the movie, natural events to the story, like...movies and their stories tend to show things that are mostly if not totally relevant to the story or subject of the story, this one shows basically daily or weekly, or monthly, or just time to time events that are happening in the universe of this story.For example, some pirates and bandits on space rovers trying to kill main character and its team, and that's it, one random event happening along the way, it doesn't tie with anything besides the universe as such, showing what the future could be after colonizing Moon for example, having these rogue groups.Next thing is a travel to Mars from Moon, they stumble upon station with distress signal, it's basically another random event that has nothing to do with main story, but it gives a feel that it's a situation that could happen in future.But overall...for the cinematography, which seems to be the core point here, I give 8, maybe too high for some, but I enjoyed it for what it was.",Ad Astra

1406,info-876-910949,Ad Astra-nomicaly bad // Where logic and science have no place.,1,27 September 2019,"One of the worst film on space... ever!!Don't get me wrong, I like psychologically driven films which are on the slow side such as The First man or The Thin Red line, and even though Interstellar was tedious at the end, it had some strong visual moments. When done well, such films give you something to think about, to ponder. But this was none of that.The story makes no sense at all and is so fraught with inaccuracies, it is an insult to our intelligence. We didn't know any of the characters' motives, I personally didn't care about any of them, and the visuals are okay but everything looks dated. Tragically, the science is...well there is no science at all. Why did they bother place the setting of this story in space if they aren't even going to try to make any attempt to be scientifically relevant? I was shocked at how Pitt could decide to make such a film given how bad the science was. What's next? Flat Earth?We are led to believe that Brad Pitt is one of the best astronauts out there yet we see him at the beginning of the film as a repairman (?) on a giant antenna on Earth supposedly SETI related (don't get too excited, there is no alien encounter in this film). Don't get me started on the logic of building a giant antenna that reaches Earth's upper atmosphere offering no advantage whatsoever from a scientific point of view while the far-side of the Moon is accessible (we see boy-scouts visiting the Moon base!). Following an absurd power surge coming from Neptune (anti-matter bla bla) Earth is in danger. His mission is of great importance : Pitt has to save humanity. Yet he is asked to fly as a civilian (why?) to a town on nearside of the Moon only to have to drive a moon buggy (Apollo style) on the lunar surface through hostile territory (??) to reach a military base on the farside. Why not fly to the military base directly if there was a risk of attack?Nothing on the moon base is believable. The characters seem out of place in such a lethal environment (receptionists plays as if she works in a motel), the interior of the base seems poorly conceived (they must have used lots of underground car parks to make this film), the lack of low g on the Moon (and on Mars) is just inexcusable. What is the point of trying to make this a space film if you can't even get basic physics right. The bright neon advert signs on display on the outdoors of the lunar town use valuable energy and are directed towards empty lunar surface...no idea who these adds are aimed to? Oh yes - sorry, my bad - these are aimed to us as these are real adds of restaurants and other crap. Thanks Pitt for allowing rich corporations to target us in your supposedly artsy film.
Oh... and there are pirates on the moon who attack moon buggies for no apparent reason... What were their motives? Salvaging damaged pieces of lunar buggies? Feeding on the blood of dead astronauts ? No one knows.On the way to Mars, Pitt and a crew of astronauts - that look and act like waiters in a cheap restaurant - stop to respond to a distress signal only to find hungry Norwegian Killer Baboons in an empty floating station.... Yes... It is that bad. At least, it was the only time the film got me on the edge.Crew arrives on Mars (thanks to Pitt who seems to know how the spacecraft operates yet had no training whatsoever), which is a collection of empty grey rooms and long dull corridors filled with strange objects (empty bird cage, dolls?), and is asked to record an audio message to send to his dad on Neptune (this is his prime mission). Why can't he record this on Earth and have it sent to Neptune directly? Why go to Mars? Is it because Earth is in opposition to Neptune? We don't know. None of this makes any sense whatsoever. Even worst... After recording and sending one of the messages, they get a reply back from dad within minutes. This is impossible as it take hours for light to travel to Neptune and back. I mean, come on, this is just basic physics.I could go on ad nausea - this film suffers from so many logical fallacies (hatch next to rocket engines, crew acting as if they don't know basic laws of physics, etc...), It was just awful from start to end. It is disturbing to know that grown adults have gone through this script full of scientific inaccuracies and accepted to fund it. A teenager could write a more realistic story.I might have been kinder to the film if the story was interesting, engaging, poignant, original or just entertaining. Unfortunately, it was none of the above. Just awful.Terribly disappointing. Do not waste your time with this film.",Ad Astra
1407,thisisforspam579,I Dreamt of Re-editing This Film,7,12 January 2020,"Ad Astra is a mythological epic about a man's transformation from traumatised automaton to loving human. It happens to be set in space. Roy (Pitt) must travel to his father (Lee Jones), who happens to be near Neptune, and who's influence continues to be destabilising and destructive to Roy, as well as humanity as a whole. A fever-dream of allegorical events flows into a 79 days of deep-space solitude, after which Roy emerges like Jesus, the wood-carved Buddha or a particularly zen butterfly as a man knowing himself, forgiving himself, and forgiving others. Roy finds his father, who is still running from himself and cannot find the strength to stop, choosing death instead. In the tradition of myth-logic, Roy then performs several impossible feats as proof of his enlightenment in a grand return to Earth.This is not necessary the film that we ended up with, but it would have been with:> Less on-the-nose narration. Example include ""they're using me!"" (we know, we thought you did too) or when he goes all Tyler Durden at the moon space-port. Pitt's face is receptive, as if he's always listening, but his voice talks too much.
> Less unnecessary exposition. I don't need to know the moon pirates are moon pirates, only that the moon is a dangerous place and proof of mankind's inability to find mass peace/ enlightenment in the way Roy will. (on that note, the space-monkeys didn't bother me. In myth-logic, it's fine, if a little obvious).
> A stronger shift in tone after Roy's space hibernation, specifically removing threat. There were elements of a shift but it undermined itself on a few different counts. At this point, Roy was already ready to let his dad go, without more convincing (no space-hug needed), and the leap to his ship effortless and more obviously impossible. (Less exposition for the nuclear-blast surfing would achieve the same).
> There was no need for him to return to his girlfriend. All we ever saw of her was in the context of a terrible relationship and so, from the audience's perspective, there was nothing worth saving. Returning to Earth should have been a fresh start in general, and it ruins the film's message to confine his new enlightened space-love to the girlfriend/mother archetype.
> His aging escort seemingly served no purpose at all.
> Stronger emphasis on the failure of communication. There are many times were Roy talks only for no one to answer, as if he doesn't exist. They build on this a bit with him eventually not waiting for an answer, but could have gone further with him simply speaking less and less - heading for the cocoon before he is quite there physically.
> A clearer stance on ever present surveillance. e.g. The constant monitoring of Roy's mental health is itself helping to deteriorate his mental health.There are perhaps other things. But in general, my experience was there is an incredible thought slightly-derivative space odyssey film in there somewhere, which only a little imagination can bring out. The cinematography is simply jaw-dropping - for once, an AAA film that uses texture! The performances are similarly mesmerising, with Pitt, on whose performance the entire film relies, doing my favourite work of his career.",Ad Astra
1408,RyaanKiing,Brad Pitt being bored in space,5,15 October 2019,"I had high hopes for Ad Astra, I really did. A huge fan of sci-fi films, to be honest, anything technology/science-related. My favorite film of all time is Interstellar and I thought Ad Astra would be a contender, it's not a common thing for me to have this much potential in a film so I was highly anticipating this being released. Would I say I was disappointed? Probably but it's not a complete sucker punch to the face. There are a few areas that I enjoyed about Ad Astra but then there are some glaring negatives that just keep me from loving it. As always, we will start with the positives.I'm not a super geek for Cinematography but I do respect it and my god does Ad Astra have some beautiful shots. They come at you so profoundly, you almost take a seat back just to admire them. Some really gorgeous environments inside and outside space stations throughout. So good that you know a few people are going to have some of the shots as their desktop background. This is why I'd recommend going to see Ad Astra if you are into cinematography, you will get plenty of entertainment from that.May have been a wrong choice of an actor but Brad Pitt gives another great performance. Saw some reviews slating oscar performances where I agree to an extent but don't believe it'll end up going to him. Rest of the recognizable cast do a stellar job as well, no bad performances what so ever. If anything they make this potential future seem only a few years away rather than centuries, genuine and realistic portrayals.Now to discuss those negatives... I just could not get over how boring Ad Astra is. Boring would be the one word to describe the whole experience for me anyway. Seen a fair few films that would be classed as slow burners, they take their time getting into it but the end makes up for anything. I waited. Waited some more. Nothing came, nothing was gonna come, just the roll of credits. Obviously can't say too much about the ending for spoiler reasons, things do happen, don't get me wrong, but it just ain't worth it. Ad Astra is not a crazy long film but it does feel long. Your brain starts to wonder while shots of silence are presented. When you feel the ending looming you start to wake up, eagerly ready, only to drift back again.An add-on almost to the last point would be that Ad Astra feels like filler footage. The scenes you would usually get in between big events to cool you off are used persistently. There were far too many sections of Ad Astra where I was more interested in people struggling to find seats than the actual movie. They found their seats in the end if you are interested.Lastly, I do feel that Brad Pitt may not have been the best choice for the role. A few people have suggested that Ryan Gosling would have been better and I do agree with them. He doesn't perform badly. As I mentioned earlier, Brad Pitt's performance is outstanding. It just didn't feel right. The character is very calm and quiet, not something that I would usually link Brad Pitt to.A mixture of bad actor choices and boring plot give me no real reason to recommend Ad Astra to anyone other than cinematography junkies who will enjoy some beautiful shots.5/10P.S No after-credits scene",Ad Astra
1409,stefan_motologa,"No sci-fi, no drama",4,21 July 2020,"The blunders in this sci-fi movie are so glaring they make you cringe. It's not the first sci-fi movie to have them, ask Neil deGrasse Tyson, but most of the time you could simply ignore them. Not this time. They are all in your face. As a sci-fi, is an utter failure.As a father-son drama, we have a father who is an astronaut who has made his life mission to search and find signs of intelligent life in the Universe. Hardly a worthless way to spend your life. The authors of this movie have a different opinion. The interaction between father and son lacks depth, emotion and logic. So, as a drama, it's also an utter failure. And by the way, the religious overtones in this movie are way too harsh for my taste.Enough with the criticism. How about something constructive? What could have made this movie better? Maybe a different plot, a different theme. There is a great theme in the movie, unfortunately only hinted at. It's about the temptation of institutions to cover things up and how, eventually, this cover up will blow in their face. It is a history lesson that happens over and over again. The Pentagon Papers, the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak. The same theme could have been developed with the cover up in this movie. It could have been a movie about how it's much better to tell the truth, admit you've made a mistake, treat the public as grown men who can handle it.Why four stars and not one?

1411,tylerchesserswim,2 hours of ... nothing.,4,23 December 2019,"A little exaggerated for there are a few scenes that were actually kind of cool: the pirate chasing scene on the moon was nice, the monkey killing scene was un-expected, and then Brad Pitt killing the whole crew (by accident) was a little intense. Apart from that, this move was a wasted 2 hours of my life and just left me at the end wondering: what was the point? So I say it missed 6 key points:
Acting ability: I'm a fan of Brad Pitt, but wow does he have a limited range of emotion. There was maybe 2 scenes in the movie where he's sad or mad. However, the rest of the 98% of the movie is Brad Pitt basically being a psychopath and not showing a lick of emotion.Connection with the characters: the main character Roy McBride lost his mother, then his father at an early age, left his wife or his wife left him, and says on multiple occasions that he's made a lot of mistakes in his life. And yet, I don't feel an ounce of remorse, regret, emotion, nothing for him. Could be attributed to his nonchalant and emotionless acting throughout the movie, but even in the end when he is reunited with his father (what the whole movie ""builds up to"") and then his father is lost, I still just don't feel the sadness or anger or anything.Suspense and Climax: or better yet, lack there of. The whole movie builds to this point where Roy is reunited with his father for the first time in like 10-15 years. Over 20 minutes of the movie is then summed up into: Hey dad, missed you, time to go back to Earth - No, my work isn't done - Were going anyway - Both get outside - Father jumps away from the ship to death - 5 seconds of ""Oh no, my dad's gone"" - time to go back to earth. Talk about anticlimactic and soooo pointless. As stated before, there's some intense scenes here and there, but overall this was boring.Ending: 2 hours of Brad Pitt traveling to Neptune, to blow up his dad's ship, and then 20 seconds of him ""riding the blast of a nuke"" back to Earth. He doesn't reunite with his wife. He doesn't have an emotional breakdown finally. Simply goes back to being a regular astronaut = ending sucked.Wow factor: almost gave it a point for this for the unique scene here and there. But overall, its a space movie where everything goes wrong, and then ends crappy. Yeah I've seen that before. The action scene on the moon with the pirates was kind of cool, but that's really the only unique quality to this movie.And finally, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. If you've watched everything available on cable, Hulu, Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV, HBO, and every other available show/movie available, and then this comes on and is free. Sure, spend 2 hours of your life watching a dragging on pointless movie.",Ad Astra

Well, no I didn't hate it....it left me mostly indifferent with a slightly negative curl toward a wasted evening. Both films were pretty slow and drawn out in their own way but the difference was, I cared about what was happening to the characters in COSMOS and after about 35 minutes of viewing AD ASTRA the complete opposite was happening.

The story just sucks and that's from a fan who likes movies are are not typical etc. It's a bad father-son film, the final message is so basic it isn't worth 2 hours to wait for. Only 2 hours but kind of drags. Brad Pitt is too old to just randomly be finding himself at age 55 anyways.

I think it fell into that hole most sci fi films fall into where they get very wrapped up in itself, becomes too serious in delivering a needless message about humanity and then ends up in an incoherent mess. It sort of reminded me of Solaris where is just meanders along bathing in it's own bull crap.The only good bits were in fact a pointless such as the moon chase and the space station that had a distress call.

1425,ihasnochille,Space done right,9,22 September 2019,"I suppose the title to this review might be a bit controversial as everyone has their own ideas as what it a good and fun interpretation of space, but for me this is perfect.I'm a huge sucker of realistic interpretation of space travel and this film did not disappoint in that regard. I absolutely adored the darkness of space, the vastness it created and the feeling of being far, far from home. I enjoyed the ideas presented in the film, from the electrical pulses amplified from Neptune to just the idea of the moon being somewhat of a tourist attraction, all of which was handled with care and grace that made it feel like a real potential future.The sound was also well done, with touching and soothing music but also keep the quiet and muteness of space.The acting was also great, Brad Pitt didn't speak much but instead conveyed a lot through his actions and subtleties that I really enjoyed as really much of it didn't need to be explained too much. The story all things considered is rather simple but it's the journey that I found engaging.However this is where I must bring up my two complaints although very minor:
1. Despite the quietness of Brad Pitt's character for whatever reason they felt to need to add his internal dialogue and thoughts which I honestly felt were unnecessary, which greatly reminded me of the blade runner and it's infamous 2 versions. I just felt it was redundant for those who were paying attention and it occasionally took me out of the film because of it.2. The casting, this is really a problem with me more than anything but there were certain characters who I just couldn't take in properly, namely Tommy Lee Jones. Now I love Tommy, I think he's a great actor but I just can't help but think ""hey look it's Tommy Lee Jones!"" rather than just accepting the character for who they are. Same goes for Natasha Lyonne in her brief cameo role, I absolute love her as an actress and just got finished watching Russian Doll but she just felt a little out of place in this film, nothing against her or her acting but again I just saw her and not the character. Of course this is just me but it might be something to consider going in.Other than that I loved the film! Some people are complaining it's not a real 'sci-fi' and I guess I get that, if you want aliens and intense space battles you won't find them here. This film isn't about that, This is a realistic interpretation of how the future may look in however many years just technologically speaking and I loved that.",Ad Astra
1426,gbanoon,Very good movie,8,29 September 2019,"I don't get all the backlash people give this movie. I do understand some though.First of all, if you're inspecting something similar to Interstellar, please skip this movie already. This is not for you if you're looking for that kind of movie. Now I'll tell my summary and review.Roy McBride is the main protagonist. He's on a undercover mission to Mars initially to unfold the remains of the Lima Project. He stops first on the moon and he gets confronted with pirates that fight over resources. Then he reaches the military base so he can join a crew on a long haul spaceflight (because those rockets are only on the moon) as a passenger. He gets a stick with information of his companion Thomas Pruitt that has to stop at the moon because of his health issues after the pirate attack.When Roy is on that spaceship going to Mars he watches the files that are on that stick and more things become clear about his father. His father intentionally killed his crew and stopped all communication systems so he can continue with the search of intelligent life beyond earth.After that, they're suddenly stopped by a distress call from another Norwegian ship that researches animals in space. There's no reply from the spaceship at all, so Roy and captain Tanner go on board the ship to find out what's going on. Space monkeys have killed all the people on the ship and Roy needs to save himself and kills the monkeys. Unfortunately with that captain Tanner dies too. Now Roy becomes a pilot of the spaceship.They eventually get to Mars but they have to semi-crashland the spaceship because of another power surge. He survived that, which looks unrealistic to be honest. He meets with operational director Helen Lantos. He goes and tries to send a message to his father so he will eventually reply to it and SPACECOM can pinpoint the exact location of his father near Neptune. Roy becomes more emotional because his father did not respond to his first messages, and then when the message becomes personal his father replies the message. SPACECOM has pinpointed his location and since Roy is very emotional, SPACECOM declares him unstable and he can't proceed with the mission.Roy is angry because he feels that he is being used. Then when Helen comes to him to have a talk, he finds out that SPACECOM has send the crew (which was his crew when he flew to Mars) for a search and destroy mission with nuclear weapons. Roy is determined to still continue with the mission to save his father. He sneaks aboard the spaceship with the crew and the nuclear bomb.
The crew is hostile because they got the order of SPACECOM to neutralize him. He kills the entire crew and controls the spaceship on his own.He eventually gets to his father with the goal of still destroying the ship (because of the power surge), but with saving his father instead of killing him. He succeeds in planting the bomb and he is trying to get his father out of the ship. His father tells him he did not care about Roy and his mother at all, and he was continuing his work on the search of intelligent life. His father killed the crew because they wanted to go home and his father was really convinced the re was intelligent life and thought his crewmembers were traitors. When they get out of the ship, his father resists because he feels that he'd done everything for nothing. Roy lets his father go. He becomes really sad and screams it out and wants to stop for a moment. But then he continues and swings himself back to his own ship and uses the nuclear explosion of the bomb as a propellant to get back to earth. He survives this and lands back on earth where he succeeded his mission and solves his social life problems.Okay, so now I have summarized the movie. I only told the story beforehand so people actually get the point of what this movie is actually about. Because I see a lot of people that are leaving a review behind, don't get the actual story. People need to understand that this is not about being action packed. This is more of a drama movie than a real science-fiction blockbuster.Things I found a bit negative:The travel times to the different planets are unrealistic.How Roy survived every single threat even when he was outnumbered in some cases.SPACECOM forgave Roy at the end of the movie, but he killed people and boarded a ship illegally.Donald Sutherland deserved more screen time. His name was very big on the trailer, but I saw him only in the first 30 minutes of the movie.What I found good about this movie:The fantastic space scenes.The immersion and connection I felt with the movie because it was well written.Good character development.The good anti-climax/climax combo at the end.Trust me on my review because I watched the movie twice now and fully understand the movie. If you like drama, this is really for you.",Ad Astra

This movie ended up being a character study on Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) compared to the sc-fi adventure that you may think it is going into it.

The story strongly reminded me of Apocalypse Now: Finding (and ending) a high ranked officer gone rouge; the slow descent into madness further down the river; the main character as a soul-searcher who is very good at what he is doing, but not even sure he likes it.I especially loved the massive impact the darkness of outer space had on me. Lonliness, despair, yet tremendous beauty. I really liked the movie, but I can understand everyone who did not. It's not a movie for the broader audience.",Ad Astra

However, in this case while the trailers may imply otherwise, it is not really a science movie so I don't really hold it to that standard. It is much more of a art house drama. Space often serves more as a metaphor than an actual location. With that being said this is definitely the type of film that I would understand if you didn't like. Yes it is slow. Yes it may be a bit pretentious at times. Yes, there are some plot holes that you accept. However, it is also very well acted, there were some genuine surprises, it was visually stunning, the effects were absolutely beautiful, and it has a good heart to it. Finally, there was some very cool realistic world building that didn't feel overdone which I really appreciated.What can I say. I just really like space movies.

Don't be surprised to see Ad Astra on the cover of next months issue of psychology today. You are left to feast on Roy's emotional journey.The effects are good enough to keep you engaged, but they never over power the story. For this type of film, that was probably the right way to go.Everyone's talking about Pitt's performance. They're right. He's kind of got that lost innocent look through the movie that reminds me of the character louise in ""interview with a vampire"",without the raging moments. Live Tyler could have used more screen time, but she's just as soulful when she's there.Even Tommy Lee Jones who is a great high energy actor, dials in to match the speed and tone of the film.Dialogue is minimal considering the situations Taking place in space, but again for this film it serves best.So there it is. I feel details aren't needed to get anyone's interest in this film, because it is more simple then complex in the way its told.Check it out as a night time feature.....a mood regulator/sleeping pill if you will.",Ad Astra
1438,dereksorensen,"This film is better than you think, let me tell you why.",9,22 September 2019,"This film is not what I, nor anybody else, expected to be. It was by no means the action packed, complicated plot, ""interstellar-esque"" film of the year; which is what most viewers wanted. Just because the plot was ""simplistic"" does not make this film a failure, as this film still gave something truly remarkable in it's own fashion.Brilliant film making is all about evoking emotion from the audience. That being said, it is important that the film's mood is a perfect reflection of the characters and the theme of the film. A film maker has all sorts of tools in his or her's arsenal to make this happen. Director James Gray receives an A+ for creating the mood of this film.This film is about a man who is learning how to cope with childhood traumas. His history of parent abandonment has lead him to dealing with relationships in a unique way. In the world of Psychology, Roy McBride's behavior would be diagnosed as ""avoidant attachment""; simply meaning, Roy has a fear of developing any real attachment with anyone- even himself. Not only does this effect his married life, but it also effects his work life. To cope past the accumulation of all these emotions, Roy turns off emotion all together to get through his psychological exams. He is lonely by choice and faces the consequences throughout the film.As noted before, it is important that the mood of this film follows the feelings of Roy McBride. Location choice of the film is a great example of how this is done. What better way to explain what loneliness feels like, than putting a man by himself in space.
Another way James Gray induces this mood on the audience, is by the coloring choices within the film. Deep reds and blues invoke an emotion of melancholy from the viewers. Probably taking inspiration from Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", Ad Astra combines this coloring with the atmosphere of space to create the perfect lonely mood.
Wide, symmetrical shots are the often used to effectively show the emptiness that is both in and around our lone space traveler. The cinematography's choice to alternate between far shots and close-up shots symbolize how this feeling of loneliness is both extrinsic and intrinsic to the character.
Of course, Brad Pitt does an outstanding job of portraying what loneliness looks like as well.All of these tools (location, coloring, cinematography and acting) are used to full potential in creating the mood of Ad Astra. However, it is not simply this that makes this film an achievement.
Making a unique story about how a man copes with mental illness, is an achievement. Making a film about the traumas that some children will later endure at the fault of their parent's wrong-doings, is an achievement. Making a film that effectively teaches us that the best way to cope with our emotion, is by opening up to those close to us, is an achievement.At the start and end of the movie we are treated to two very similar scenes: Roy McBride, standing in a dark room, going through his psychological evaluation. Both scenes are from the same angle and almost seem to be a perfect parallel. However, there is only one difference between the two. In the first psychological evaluation, Roy explains how he will remain focused and dedicated to his job, by shutting out the world around him. In the second psychological evaluation, at the end of the film, the ever-changed Roy explains how he will remain focused and dedicated to his job, by letting people in to his life, serving and loving them along the way.So maybe this was not the action packed, science fiction adventure that we all expected. Maybe, it was the life-lesson movie that we all needed.8.9/10, I would highly recommend.",Ad Astra
1439,denisefig,Regular to good,6,14 December 2019,"No surprises and twists, a simple and well executed script. He sins a little for lack of rhythm, is ""stopped"".
The visual effects are excellent and very palpable to reality, the photography is very good. I preferred Gravity and First Man, which are also movies of the space genre, but still a very good sound.
Brad Pitt is very good on paper and very realistically feels like a lonely, embittered man who has trouble bonding with others. Some camera shots are used simply and very well designed to further demonstrate this loneliness and when it gets rid of all the hurt you realize in some nuances in the interpretation of your change.",Ad Astra
1440,yicketyyackety,Space baboons,6,29 September 2019,"Overall this movie, which is somewhat copied from Apocalypse Now (based on Heart of Darkness) did not meet my expectations. It was all over the place, or should I say, all over space. Parts of it made no sense, like when Roy leaps from the Lima ship towards his own ship, which not only can he not see but is parked perhaps a thousand miles away and yet scores a bullseye and returns not only safely, but in less than 3 hours, the time he had before the Lima ship blows up from a nuclear bomb.
If the main theme of this movie is meant to be psychological; that is, the son damaged emotionally by his distant (in more ways than one) father and the son's desire to heal, then it failed to produce any sympathy from me. I did not feel invested in Roy's father-problems one bit.

When I brought up the IMDB page I was shocked to see this movie had an 80 rating from Critics. Are Critics being paid to give ratings like this or are they really that disillusioned from cinema going fans?This movie is really slow. It seems like the Director is adding elements to the film that are not plot driven just to make it a feature length film. I didn't like a single character. It really is just bad.

Brad Pitt's acting is once again on top, playing a lonely space mayor on the quest of retrieving his father on the border of Neptune. Tommy Lee Jones, having a small screen-time, has a crucial part in the movie, and it was nice to see him again after a while. Even though the story has a few weak spots, such as the monkey, whom we are not aware of its origin and with no sign of as the scenario continues. Liv Tyler is incredibly underused, as we see her just for a few minutes throughout the movie, is a waste of a decent actress. Like in The Martian or Passengers, the inevitable catastrophes are present, which seems a little ""cliché"".Overall Ad Astra is a solid movie with some blameless acting, Pitt making the audience feel empathy for his character throughout the whole story.",Ad Astra
1445,Simon Andrew,Slow as hell,4,9 February 2020,"*some spoilers*
The glacial pace of this movie is reminiscent of 1970's sci fi in a bad way. I was left scratching my head as to what exactly was going on through most of it. Brad Pitt barely changes from stony face to stony face. The rest of the cast appear and disappear so quick I really have no idea who they were or why indeed they were there. Donald Sutherland randomly appears, wanders around for a bit then decides that maybe its not a good idea to go into space when your eleventy hundred years old. There's some frankly utterly bizarre 'pirate' combat on the surface of the moon. Physics decides to take a holiday. Also the extrapolation of apollo era space nonsense is hilarious. I mean psych evaluations every five seconds. All astronauts devoid of emotion. Everyone going in slo-mo in low gravity - amazing this hilarious nonsense is *still* in a modern movie!",Ad Astra
1446,archiemills,Ambitious and Unique; Great message,9,14 June 2020,"Ad Astra does not intensely follow the rules of science nor does it try to. It is made to entertainment and use space as a setting to highlight the importance and impact of human relations . The plot may seem random at times,but even the oddest scenes teach us a lot about the behavior of our protagonist (Brad Pitt). The film is a slow burn that pieces together ideas and emotions.The third act with Tommy Lee Jones is when the film really comes together.The message of the movie comes together with Pitt's performance, and even scenes with little dialogue are emotionally rich. The chemistry and performances Brad Pitt and TLJ are outstanding but subtle. The film also does a good job of creating a unique world through things like The Moon now being a tourist destination, (monkey in space ?), And moon pirates. Overall this is a really ambitious film that suceedes where a lot of other space movies fail imo. Great performances all around and jaw dropping cinematography.",Ad Astra

I don't think that would have been a problem with ""Ad Astra."" That is to say that most of the internal monologue is so blatant that it often detracts from the acting and scenery of this slow moving movie. It general, it's very similar to Pitt's buddy's performance in ""Solaris""...but instead of a dead chick it's a murderous father he finds out there across the expanse of space.

It was embarrassing. I guess it's not their fault, but the director's who failed to transmit his vision to the audience ... if he had one at all. Although visually pleasing , it's still just a Super lightweight, unscientific gibberish about some 'surges' that threaten all life in the solar system.

The age old query if sons really do inherit the sins of their fathers. If you're looking for another Star Wars epic or an action packed thriller this movie is not for youI personally research the movies I watch. I rarely go in blindly. Yes, there are scientific discrepancies here but that is not the point of this film. If you like thoughtful, classic Greek-like storytelling then you're in for a treat. Not to say the visuals aren't stunning if realistic.This is, as another reviewer said, an art house film. Like Tarkovsky's Solaris or even similar to a Kubrick film.If you want Hollywood, then look away. Find some Adam Sandler movie to occupy your mind.

At its core Ad Astra is a film about a man with daddy issues & how he ultimately faces up to this, to move forward as a complete human being. That really should not take two hours & 15 minutes to tell & this is Ad Astra's biggest fault it is boring.Much of the first two acts revolve around the main characters mission with a looming threat of a conspiracy to stop him. Well at least that's what the first two acts are & this is all abandoned by the third act. Now a transition such as this is not always a bad thing but Ad Astra does not handle this well. With the exception of Pitt's character, every other characters motivations comes into serious question. Think about it for a second; what possible reason does Negga's character have for helping McBride considering their respective family history & the jeopardy she would place herself in.If like myself & paid ticket fair to experience an Intellectual Sci-Fi, you may want to brace yourself for disappointment.

1464,anna_regenboog,Difficult movie that made me think,9,24 September 2019,"SPOILERS ahead.Side note: This is my interpretation. It doesn't have to be THE interpretation.
The movie is about loneliness and imo going too far as a human race. The latter is being showed in the movie with the bigass atenna, the experimenting on the monkey, his father and the antimatter rays that could destroy our solarsystem and are actually caused by humans, the ""we (humans) are worldeaters"" part and that is (again) all about resources (the war on the moon). Instead of looking at the stars (ad astra) we should be looking at our own beautiful world. It (the movie and Roy) has a dark view on humanity.It's all brought to a micro level with Roy and his father. Roy is obviously lonely (hence the girlfriend (Liv Tyler) that shows up from time to time) and his emotions are flat, very, very flat. I would say he is depressed.His father is also lonely. He went too far and lost himself. He was looking for alien life at any cost. But in the end Roy learns from the data his father gathered he didn't found a planet with life. At that moment Roy also says that life was right under his (his fathers) nose all along. By which he means: his family which he abandoned. His father was so immersed in his project (looking at he stars / going too far) that he lost sight of what life is really about (love, family, caring).So Roy returns with the data and being a lot wiser (facing his dad made him wake up). Instead of loneliness, he chooses to make amends with his former girlfriend (the end).So instead of looking for life in deep space we'd better look at ourselfs, the ones we care about and the world we live on (macro lvl). You/we can't run away from (y)ourself. You/we have to face to what is here at this moment (maybe a link to the destructive force humans have on planet earth and possible other planets (for example depletion of rescourses?).The monkey also represented imo the going too far part. That ship clearly experimented on animals. And that went terribly wrong. The monkey was pure rage. Did we go too far? Where does it end?Anyways, it's a difficult and dark movie. Maybe pretentious for some. It has a dark layer that probably most people don't want to hear if it is shown and said directly. That would be too invasive and easy. It is in hiding. You have to figure out for yourself as always to actually be convinced by something. And that's the journey Roy unintentionally takes.So yes, I liked it. I probably will watch it again to see if above interpretation still stands.",Ad Astra

Would be good just to start from this sentence, and one can already foretaste the stories already shown (like Event Horizon movie, for instance). But there is nothing like this. Instead, we get a 90% screen time of Brad Pitt's face, which mostly even does not have any sign of commitment for acting. The personal tragedy of the main character does not invoke any pity. There is a moment there, where (attention!) some crazy space ape killed a crew member... and guess what the main character did just a couple of minutes after this had happened. He was overthinking his relationships with his ex-partners and realized that he was not ready for any relationship. He doesn't give a heck about a space monkey and why this all happened, he even did not investigate the case and obviously feels nothing regarding the homicide in his spaceship. Isn't it ridiculous? In general, this movie is not a SciFi, it is extremely boring and is just a waste of time.",Ad Astra

Like the scene when they are at a large facility on the moon where they move and walk exactly like they were on earth. In the near future even we can't expect any other technology to contour gravity other then centrifugal force, which don't seems to be that case so they should be moving inside a lunar base, the same way they do in the surface on the moon.

It is a realistic space film like The Martian or Interstellar but the realism makes it boring. The premise is interesting as Brad Pitt's dad goes on a mission to explore the solar system and try to find evidence of extraterrestrial life but something goes wrong and his dad's ship starts emitting waves of energy that disrupt the Earth and they say it could destroy the solar system. Brad Pitt has to go and find out what happened. The special effects are fantastic but overall the story is very slow and the answer to what happened to his father is a disappointment after the build up. A lot of the reviews say it is one of Brad Pitt's best performances but he seems bored most of the time. He was much better in the Ocean's films, Se7en and Troy. They show his wife a few times but she has zero character development and he doesn't even seem to like her, let alone be in love with her.

And even if you do like slow burn its a paper thin story that could be cut in half screen time and still work (and more effectively). I get it that main theme is detachment but there is nothing beside that- Brad Pitt character is set in stone, you get all about him in first 5 min. and I don't expect him to change or grow but he is on a loop from that point forward because script presents nothing to him beside constant reaffirmation of that one theme. Acting is good, both Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones (especially him) are good but as I said problem for Pitt is that his character has no real arch, he is just on this slow melancholic journey while reflecting over and over more of the same. Science seems off and some things are lazy and unexplained like government actions that are illogical and sloppy. Overall I liked it because it reminds me of Sci-Fi short stories I used to read as a kid and that is exactly what this should be-1 self contained up to 45 min. episode on a Sci-Fi show, there simply is not enough material for it to be a full movie.",Ad Astra

That is not going to happen by far, even farther than that!Someone had brought a firm decision to disregard any and I mean ANY science whilst filming this. I have no other explanation than that this was done by someone who really HATED school.
And never have read anything, also!If you say that the scientific part was intentionally screwed up to maximize the dramatic plot, it will fail too. Except for the main character, no one seems to have any motivation for their actions. This plot is full of holes!How could this have happened, with such a good crew, I have no idea.

Knowing how much work by talented people goes into making any film I can't bring myself to give this great looking film less than 4, but it does not reflect the thin script, the derivative plot, and the fact that Pitt cannot act, and ruins every role that demands any notion of intelligence. He continually speaks words as if he has no grasp of their basic meaning, with the effect that he may as well be narrating the back of a box of cereal. There are so many badly conceived, ludicrously implausible futurisms that a child could have come up with, and a slightly older child could have improved upon, but which are drenched in such an effective and seductive visual design that their insincerity becomes even more irritating. Nothing ruins a 'serious' sci-fi more than a continual parade of beautifully shot, crap science. I imagine they made Pitt watch Apocalypse Now and told him to pretend he was Sheen. It's basically Heart of Darkness, in the laziest sense, but with absolutely no real world pathos, so who cares? The lesson fails. Try writing a story rather than failing to tell someone else's. Once again the Metascore reveals an abject disconnect between professional reviewers and any understanding of what makes a film great.

I am of the opinion a film needs a story, a deep or twisting plot, this film is basically a guy of to space, in top secret, on a commercial flight, going to meet daddy., who effectively tops himself when his son arrives. What was the whole point with the space pirates, a means of adding some real but unrealistic action.
A trip which takes absolutely months to undertake seemed to happen in days.
I like Brad, a lot, I gotta say he is one of my fav and versatile actors but half of the time I, as serious as he is trying to be, half expect him to start laughing or joking...
Whilst the film has artistic content which we have seen before in Gravity, the Martian, and 2001, sadly I feel it had nothing new to offer. Quite the opposite, I felt it was a mix match of potential scenarios, lightly covered so as to ensure that a weak plot came in at under 2 hours.

It creates a cloud of engrossement around what made Pitt the way he his and how it affects him.Pitt's performance is marvelous and complex while you know he is distraught but it doesn't effect him. He is still highly capable which is somewhat frightening. The rest of cast works well but Pitt is the standout as he delivers an emotional journey billions of miles away.

They must really suck at diplomacy on the moon. Did I say there was a Walking Dead Killing Monkey on board, straight out of some Alien. Yes, there are killing monkeys on space, you heard that right, KILLING MONKEYS. And they act all normal about it as well? Like oh, the monkey killed him, just normal space stuff.

Brad Pitts performance is also great in this movie honestly one of the best of 2019. What makes it great that it's a really held back performance making him very emotionless it almost seems throughout the movie just how the character is supposed to see while still able to give the character it's own personality. Where this movie runs short a little bit tho is the bumpy plot. Over all this movies plot is pretty good all be it a little slow which may turn off some people, however there are bits in the movie that leave the audience a little confused and there is a goofy fight scene that left me chuckling a bit.

I wasn't disappointed, the movie is very well shot, the Space images are well made, deep sky, the Planets, the Moon, really nice.However, I think the movie was ruined by its screenplay which lacks of coherence. The story is really weak and undeveloped.

We have but ourselves, and ourselves is all we need to go forward into that infinite vastness of the cosmos. Brad Pitt's intriguing performance, a stoic and calculating steely eyed spaceman, lends credence to the indomitable will of mankind, as does Tommy Lee Jones' will to persevere in the face of all hopelessness and loneliness. The beautiful visuals and terrifying darkness give so much more than eye candy. It give us the future of mankind in such crisp and riveting detail as not seen on the screen in some time.

This movie isn't so much a sci-fit exploration movie or anything like that, it is definitely more of a slow drama which may automatically put it at risk due to mainstream audience expectations. Throughout the movie we still feel the vastness of space in a sense by wide angle shots, the character Roy using technology on the ship, and the discussion of length and distance for some of the trips.I appreciated we didn't get too bogged down in the science as this will make a film and it's running time extend far to explain stuff that doesn't matter for the movie's sake. If we explained the science for everything it could add another 30 minutes to the movie. With that said, I think some people appreciate the science and consider this a bummer.I'll admit.... the baboon is bad. There must be another way writers could have figured out how to kill off that character. I also thought the voice overs were a bit overused.I did enjoy the pirate moon chase...

1536,tricia-snyder,This Is NOT a Space Adventure,7,21 September 2019,"This is NOT a space adventure movie. It is a human drama about letting go of the demons that haunt us, thinly wrapped in some spectacular space visuals. I'm OK with that because I knew it going in. I feel sorry for anyone who went seeking a space adventure.What I loved: Brad Pitt's eyes and facial expressions as the co-star. Everything about Ruth Negga and every scene she was in. The gorgeous planetary shots.What I hated: Kip Thorne was clearly not the science advisor on this movie as he was on Interstellar. The movie suffers from just some plain old bad science. First and foremost is that an antimatter/matter explosion does not grow in intensity as time goes on. Antimatter and matter annihilate each other, until only one is left. That's why our whole universe is made up of matter and not antimatter. If it were strangelets, that would be a different story.I also immensely disliked Tommy Lee Jones' character. The lack of scenes with both Ruth Negga and Liv Tyler bugged me, too. Lastly, how did that second in command even make it into astronaut training? He had the balls of a neutered kitten.All in all, I like the movie. Will it ever be in my Top 20? Probably not. But, I think if you go into it knowing what to expect, you'll like it a lot more. I'll buy it because it will make a fabulous movie to unwind to with its soft score and gorgeous visuals. I may, however, just fall asleep to it because of that.

Hiding under the vivid science fiction surface is a movie about humanity and how sometimes it's best to just let go. How we become so obsessed with the things out of reach rather than what's in front of us. How discovering or achieving something that seems so possible probably won't really make us happy.

This movie's story should have taken place 400-500 years ago. Then the distances could have been relatable to people not familiar with any astronomy. And because they are not relatable or understood by even the writers themselves...It would just be easier to write it to take place in the 15th or 16th century. Here are a couple of things I noticed at the theatre:1. Why exactly does he have to go to mars to send a message? The laser was destroyed on earth is the reason they give in the movie. Have you heard about radio waves to mars then laser that to neptune?
2. He sends a message to neptune and then they wait for a response. Something that seems to take minutes in the movie. In reality this response would take 8 hours. The distance between Mars and Neptune is 28.5 AU roughly, in light minutes that would be 4 hours. Round trip: 8 hours.
3. Why do you need a zero decibel room on a mars base? Guess just adds to the scifi feeling?
4. If your pulse has never gone above 80 you probably have a heart defect.
5. Falling from very high altitude is no joke. You break the sound barrier within 90 seconds - didn't see anything like that in the movie. Seriously missed opportunity.
6. So a antimatter reactor sends off some weird electro-storms or something that destroys equipment 29AU away...But is unaffected itself? Radiation and sound waves and such degrade exponentially with distance. On earth they would get the radiation dosage inversely proportional to the square of the distance. And 29 AU is quite some distance.
7. Ride a shockwave home? Do I even need to?
8. Stop the ship for an emergency beacon? The writers obviously don't understand how much energy it takes to start and stop ships in space.
9. He travels from Mars to Neptune in what in the movie feels like days. The distance is 50 times longer than it is from Earth to Mars. And it takes a long time to travel from Earth to Mars.
10. Talking about #9, I really feel like this is the same issue we have with mercato projections of maps. I really wish we'd stop doing them. If you can't depict what you're trying to describe in a elementary school textbook correctly - find a different way to do it correctly without using math that is beyond the reader.I got bored writing now.

Essentially then it is only incidentally a sci-fi film. But the sets are great. I particularly liked the moonscapes and the surface of Mars. The pirate attack on the moon rovers was exciting. I think Brad Pitt is good as the introspective and unflappable astronaut. But something about it didn't quite gell for me.

There will be a scene where he arrives at the moon and it looks exactly like an airport on earth and the audience will be like ""Oh my god, look there's a Starbucks on the moon and there's a subway, It's exactly like Earth"" and then the narration will be like ""Look at this moon airport, its terrible, it's just like earth, I hate it"" And that's when a guy shows up and explains to Brad Pitt how the moon has disputed territory and how there are moon pirates, even though Brad Pitt lives in this world and would probably know this, the audience doesn't but now they do. And then they get on a moon rover and then look here's some moon pirates and then oh look they're gone again. And we'll hire Donald Sutherland, but not for an entire movie shoot, for about a week, we'll see how far we get. we'll just write him out and never mention him again, it'll be fine. And we'll hire Liv Tyler but make sure she doesn't have any dialogue scenes. So Brad Pitt finds out that his dad is alive ""somewhere near Neptune"" and not dead as he previously thought. And his first question isn't ""what information leads you to think he's still alive?"" it's not ""what do you mean somewhere near Neptune?"", ""why do you think he's responsible for crazy antimatter explosions that somehow don't blow his ship but affect us here equally on earth, moon and mars?"" or ""why do I need to travel in person, first to the moon, then to mars to send what is essentially an encrypted voicemail?"" his reaction is essentially just to agree even though we later find out that he doesn't believe that his dad is responsible, that they are essentially making it up to cover themselves.

If he's so important, and they know there are moon pirates, why not send more security, or put him in a safer vehicle? How can you accelerate a vehicle enough to get to Mars, and later Neptune, in a few days without killing the crew? How can you stop a vehicle traveling at those speeds to answer a Norwegian space lab SOS without using all your fuel and re-killing the crew with the acceleration? If the mission is to look for interstellar life, why put the station where half the sky is obscured by Neptune's rings? And if energy bursts from anti-matter release are bad, won't releasing all the anti-matter at once in a nuclear explosion be lots worse?That's just the big stuff. It's hard to get the great message of the film when there are so many distractions. And speaking of messages, didn't we already learn that ""there's no place like home"" in 1939?",Ad Astra

1574,guraspashvilimari,Deep and beautiful with meanigful message,10,26 September 2019,"This movie is beautiful as in its cinematography so in its meaning. Brad Pitt is excellent, he portrayes the character so greatly that you can 100% share what he's feeling and why he's feeling those things. The movie is about a broken man who tries to hide his brokenness from himself, because he's scared and because this is what ""strong"" men do. He so tries to not be like his father and fails, because he can't accept his own pain. In the end it's okay to love someone, and it's okay if that someone doesn't love you back. Well, it's not okay, but hiding it supressing it deffinetely can't change the truth. Brad's character is a sensitive man who shields himself with rationality, because he thinks it can protect him, but truth is, this is what actually kills him inside as a human. in the end there's nothing left but acceptance of painful truth for him, but only in that pain is he able to see and feel love and beauty, only in acceptance he is able to finally be free from his father's shadow and be himself. The movie shows us that sometimes painful things happen and they are hard to carry, but only if you can accept it, only when you can feel it fully, can you be free. Also it shows us humanity's great flaw, seeing things as they aren't and not noticing/appreciating things in front of us. Sometimes we think about what can happen and what might happen so much that we miss the fundamental between us. We exist in future or in past, so we miss the only thing real - present, and that way we miss life.",Ad Astra

It IS visually engaging. It has a great premise. Energy surges from Neptune? destroying earth so Brad has to contact his missing dad to stop the deadly surges.The message has to be be sent from Mars! Why?
OK, putting that aside. If Brad has to read the message in person from Mars, why not just record it?
""Dad, are you there?"" no answer.
OK, off to Neptune then. What?!
From there on the wheels come off.
Space pirates
Space monkeys
Sneaking on to a rocket at take off??
I won't profess to any in depth science knowledge but NONE of it is credible.
It's just plain wrong.
If it's trying to be realistic and not Sci Fi then oh dear epic fail.
Think Flash Gordon, Space 1999,planet of the apes.
While visually as pretty as Gravity its as ""real"" as Tracey Island and as scientifically factual as Frankenstein.
It's such a muddle and all to get dear bonkers dad home. Dad the mutineer?
So Pirates of the Caribbean then?
If you want to take a nuclear weapon to neptune why rescue Dad? Why is he allowed to live?

1582,braca_am,Excellent work in Directing,8,23 September 2021,"This is one of the movies where I liked everything but the story. I think director has done some excellent work here. I really loved visual effects with color changing and something that really thrilled me were that 2 excursions of the main character with war zone on the Moon and with trying to help crew of Norwegian spaceship. That 2 excursions are totally unnecessary for the movie plot but they gave me a little better sense of world in the movie. Especially situation with war zone where we can see potential threads in the future.On the other hand, situation with the baboon was very inspiring for me. When we see actor Tommy Lee Jones for the first time in the movie, his bags below eyes and his whole face just reminded me of that baboon and I think that also that was directors goal, because in some way he killed his crew like that baboon.In some way I can see that the point of the movie was to show us that we are alien to each other and that we must work on improving those connections and connections to humanity... But I didn't like that point for such a fantastic work in directing.In the end after that big flashlight we see main character coming home, meeting his wife and talking about life stuff, so basically very happy end... But his last word is 'submit', so in that contest I chose to believe that he didn't make it home and that that was his last message before he died in the deep space... or maybe because director tried hard to present his actions like his fathers, he tried to finishes his fathers work.This is the path that I chose for films ending, and I really think that director also did here some excellent work, that provided me with that choice.",Ad Astra

The story is astronaut Roy McBride is sent on a mission to find his missing father who poses a threat to humanity.
There is a lot of breath taking shots in space and the music helps create a strong atmosphere.
This movie is more of a space drama than an action movie, if your the type of movie watcher who loves action movies and is not a fan of slow paced movies with a heavy story then I do not recommend this but if you love space movies like Interstellar, Gravity etc then I highly recommend this movie.",Ad Astra

Can only presume they might prefer all sci-fi pictures to feature killer robots and worm holes. While those cinematic tropes have their place, this isn't it. As for people moaning about the science; it's a story, not a documentary. Anyway, if you enjoy near future sci-fi that is beautifully shot, has a fantastic score and clearly has a theme deeper than the setting (the magnificent 'Moon' is perhaps my favourite recent-ish example), you'll be richly rewarded. Would have given it 10 stars but for a little bit of clunky dialogue and a very slight personal annoyance about Tommy Lee Jones looking every bit 73 years old in 'old' footage.",Ad Astra

That is what has become ""normal"" for many and that is what this movie invites us to question.If you're looking for space adventure, Ad Astra is not your movie. If you're looking for a deliberately paced film about self-imposed exile and human disconnection via careerism/capitalism and the generational baggage we inherit and pass-on as creatures brought into this world by deeply flawed human beings as parents, then this movie may succeed in making you think about these relationships in ways you haven't before. This movie probably would have worked better as an abstraction like an animated film, because many will watch this and get hung up on the impossible physics or irrational command structure of military organizations.But if you can ignore those things, and accept the space setting as visual language to convey that feeling of deep disconnect and isolation that many of us have felt at one time or another, then you may get something out of this movie as I did, even if it doesn't entertain you.",Ad Astra

The protagonist embarks on a journey across the solar system to find his father, but the journey serves as am engine where the character develops and reflects. What I like even more about this movie is the fact that it is a Sci-Fi setting without it being up in your face about it. It's a new world that adds depth and flavor to the main story, but it is not the actual story. I wish more movies did that.

Another subdued, subtle but powerful performance that at the very least deserves a nomination. Ad Astra is a gradual, thoughtful movie with perhaps some of the best use of voice over narration in recent times. The film is not concerned with the science of space but instead the psychological effects it can have on the human mind, and for that reason it's likely to disappoint audiences expecting something more in the vein of Interstellar.Ad Astra may look like Interstellar but it's a vastly different feel. Nolan's film was an intellectual, cerebral exploration of the infinite expanse of space and interdimensional travel while Ad Astra is an emotional exploration and a character study. Interstellar worked out brains, Ad Astra works out hearts.Ad Astra is a patient film, it's not a sci-fi adventure and that very fact makes the film a bold choice for today's audiences however it's execution proves that a film in space doesn't always have to involve laser battles and space ship chases, sometimes the silence is more profound.",Ad Astra

Direction is cumbersome.I did notice a lot of senior citizens at the showing I was at paying first run ticket prices which is very unusual. I felt sorry that they wasted their money on this one. I wonder why they were there?I am curious how this movie had such a high rating in IMDB? Did someone pay reviewers to give artificially high ratings in order to manipulate the score? Probably so as no way this is movie is a 7.2.Anyways, one star for the special effects and one stare for the music even though it drones on and is overbearing at times.

1607,Few_Specific,A drama ahead of its time... sort of.,9,4 April 2020,"Ad Astra had a lot going for it. It is a landmark in film making because it is one of the only films I've seen where it takes a common human dilemma (father-son relationship issues) and makes it set in space.
Think about, in the future- if we were to have inhabited the solar system- wouldn't we have brought all our problems to space? It is ignorant to think that just because we are in space means that all our human emotions are gone.So this movie is Sci-fi; it is a fictional representation of what the world in the future could look like. I really liked the idea that the moon would be a place polluted with tariffs, segregation, battle lines, disagreements, and commerce.Where Ad Astra terribly fails at:
1) The pretentious dialogue. Almost everything Brad Pitt was saying was so surface level; so banal and so basic, that it didn't make me actually understand or feel what he was feeling (until he met his father). You could have seen better dialogue in toxic YouTube comment sections.
2) The science. It's been already discussed, but I'll discuss it again. The science in the film is so bad that astronauts and astronomers dislike the film. I don't know about you guys, but I like my film to make sense, at the least.
3) Dull and very slow. This wasn't really a problem for me, but I understand it can be for others. Points off because this film was marketed as an action. I'm okay with slow burns, as long as they make sense!This movie looked absolutely gorgeous though (Neptune's and Mars' contrasting blue and red is stunning), and apart from the bad science, I didn't mind it too much, for it still gave me a great experience and a different view of the future.

Because... this movie would work great as Total Recall, a dream or a huge simulation they were running to see if they could break Pitt and then they awake him at the end and say 'you did it. You understand caring is important. Now you are ready for the real mission' - credits...But as it was it was WAY to on the nose, way to brush by rules on the science and no big surprise. And even his revelation to become caring didn't really have a reason. And no subtlety at all. When he needed to make a point the character has to say stuff like 'the sins of my father' so the audience was 'following'. A good movie wouldn't have to say that. Let alone the science behind blasting his ship back to earth. Nope.Again felt like a dream or simulation run by the space agency or even better one of the aliens his dad might have discovered to see if earthlings were ready to communicate emotionally or something. Was really hoping that was the end...",Ad Astra
1622,rodm-5,Very good and interesting film (but not SciFi),7,6 October 2019,"Hee hee I gather a lot of viewers did not like this film. My wife and I, unexpectedly, did like it a lot.The trailers lead one to expect an action SciFi space travel film (bad trailer!) and I can understand people who watch the film, expecting that, might be disappointed. Luckily I heard a detailed review before seeing the film (which said it was atrocious) and, although I like ""hard core"" SciFi (e.g. 2001 A Space Odyssey, The Day The Earth Stood Still (original), Blade Runner 2049 ), we thought we would give it a go.The film is Science Fantasy (Physicists beware!) but that is totally irrelevant as it is just a ""vehicle"" to carry a story about human relationships in a difficult environment, with some rather weird little action scenes thrown in, and beautiful views of space and spaceships.To give you some guidance, the closest similar movies I can think of are Arrival (2016) {loved it}, Never Let Me Go (2000) {loved it}, The Time Traveller's Wife {good} and The Fountain {loved it}.If you ONLY like films like Marvel's ""Avengers"" series and Star Wars then this film might not be for you.Good luck.",Ad Astra

No emotional attachment at all and throw away characters who have promise then die in the next scene.There is no plot twist to keep you guessing, no edge of your seat suspense like gravity and literally no reason to put this story in space.

1635,markjenkinsmedia,AD ASTRA: A VERY BAD FILM INDEED,4,5 December 2019,"Reviewers here and elsewhere are correct, the science in this movie is dreadful. Very minor points which don't affect the plot can be forgiven, as contrasted to the relentless science stupidity of ""Interstellar"" (huge patterned sofas on a Mars base, instant conversations with home while several light minutes away from Earth, off-planet installations built from breeze blocks). But the overall feeling is an exact cross between ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" or ""Solaris"" - in other words a slow, calm consideration of the psychological effects of a long journey towards an unknown destination, interesting enough in itself. And there are brilliant visuals too, plus several amusing points about the commercialisation of space travel until it has become almost mundane.However, as if testing the audience to see how much the director can get away with , the scientific blundering and slap-dash handling of the plot become more and more difficult to withstand, until there's the hope for a REALLY REALLY good ending to make up for all this confusion - which never comes. The denoument is a mess, then everybody goes home - the end. Another reviewer elsewhere is right about the way Brad Pitt hurls himself around in space like a self-guided missile, but there is one tiny shot implying he's using a jet pack - only one though, certainly no clear explanation of how he's doing what he's doing, or what the Tommy Lee Jones character is doing in space at all.Brad Pitt co-exec produced, so we can take it that his own knowledge of orbital mechanics is not of a very high standard. A shame, because ""Ad Astra"" could have been a good movie. But it isn't. A few stars for visuals, and for nice music by a.o. Nils Frahm.",Ad Astra

1640,joecooling-74042,totally disappointing,1,30 September 2019,"I had high hopes considering the excellent cast. But what a disappointment, the story is totally ridiculous, dont even know where to start. They had sent a spaceship to Neptune and have not heard back or had suspicion something went wrong and they did NOTHING for 33 years? Then they send a totally hopeless crew (the second captain could not even land on mars) in a small spaceship that takes about 2-3 weeks to get there (judging by Brad Pits beard when he arrives at Neptune). Why did they not bother to do this earlier if it does not need a big spaceship and only takes a couple of weeks?
The father can he actually survive 33 years in a spaceship. Where is the food water and oxygen coming from?
But the worst is that there is no story really. Father is on a spaceship, no one knows exactly whats going on and son flies there and rescues him. End of story. Then they through in some random pirates (??!!) on the moon to do a bit of a car race (why are they attacking them?) to spice the movie up a bit. The on the way to Mars they follow a distress call and the most important person on earth (so it seems at the moment) leaves the ship in a spacesuit and investigates himself (really?) just to find the crew got eaten by some escaped monkeys. Again totally random and just to spice up the lame story.
And why on Earth is a small spaceship with a bit of antimatter causing so much havoc on Earth?? If that drive is so dangerous then it should never have been built in the first place, imagine if something had gone wrong building it on earth. From science point of view that is ridiculous anyway.
This could have been a good movie. Make it shorter, cut out the unnecessary bits and how about you have Bret Pit just hijack a rocket to rescue his father when he heard there is a change he still lives. After all he hijacked that rocket in the movie anyway (while it was taking off and the acceleration did not really do much to him at take off, nor the heat of the engines).
That kind of plot would have made much more sense and could have been delivered with suspense as well: he gets wind that his father is still alive but they covered it up because he killed the rest of the crew, then steels the rocket, almost gets caught, has some trouble on the way (of course they always do) and then finally finds his father but he is mad. Done, pretty similar but more plausible. Who is writing scripts now a days ? Monkeys?",Ad Astra

1647,overlookcinema,"Stunning visuals, a fantastic score, but the plot lacked clarity and was completely void of humor with its serious tone.",7,12 January 2020,"Ad Astra is a more traditional science fiction film rather than sci-fi fantasy like Star Wars, or the recent Disney Plus show The Mandalorian. Visually speaking, Ad Astra is going for if Stanely Kubrick made 2001: A Space Odyssey today and followed what we know now of space travel.The film starts with a grand opening scene with Brad Pitt in a space survival scene. The scene felt as if Cuarón's Gravity met a Mission Impossible opening scene. The action scenes in this film were great, but never the main emphasis of the film.Instead, the film takes on the same tone seen in Interstellar, an overly serious one. Both films have no comedic brevity and ultimately make them both a slog to get through at times. Going back to the recent Mandalorian, that takes a good mixture of action and darkness that then undercut with comedy and brevity. A balance Ad Astra doesn't attempt to try and stays in that flat cold sci-fi tone the whole time.Ad Astra is the first film I've seen by writer/director James Gray. I understand his films often involve themes that center around complicated father/son relationships, and Ad Astra's central theme is that. If you strip away the big-budget plot, this film is a story about a son who, emotionally, feels millions of miles away from his father for decades. That's precisely the case in this film with Brad Pitt's father Tommy Lee Jones being missing for thirty decades in deep space.I buy Brad Pit as an action star or as a stoner in True Romance, but I'm not so sure I buy him as a high-ranking 'Space Command' astronaut. Pitt works better in his recent part in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood-Films with a lighter tone. In Ad Astra, there are not many supporting cast members besides briefs scenes by Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones. So the film relies too much on Pitt, and I'm not sure if he's that type of actor. I've never loved any of his starring parts, but I do find him engaging in ensemble casts.Where the film shined was its cinematography and score, though the style of both reminded me instantly of Interstellar. It makes sense with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema working on both this film and Interstellar. Max Richter's score was reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's Interstellar score but was still a great listen accompanied by Hoytema's visual style.I enjoyed the more profound father/son relationship message in the movie, but did we need to slog our way to Neptune and back?",Ad Astra

As far as the acting goes, Brad Pitt is at his peak performance. He has become a classic, hands down. You could see the movie just for his sake.

I'd imagine in this future that space command would be very intelligent and resourceful but they just have simple minded astronauts who cant do their job. The lines they give Brad Pitt feel very bland and insignificant. Both BP and TLJ acting was on point though. If they could have focused on the science more and actually resolved the issue or discovered something new at the end they could made a great movie of the year.

So apparently Brad Pitt character is sent to contact his father who went missing near pluto. A mix of Event Horizon, Sunshine and Space Oddysey (sort of).
First thing that struck me was ridiculous settings - like moon having city sized bases made of concrete even though it still takes real life giant rockets two transport a couple of man. Moon also apparently have pirates because even though resources are scarce it makes sense to use the last drop of fuel attacking other lunar expeditions.
Then we have many unnecessary bits, like answering sos call and ship captain being eaten by monkeys. A part that could be cut from the movie as well.
Pitt flying through rings of Pluto (or was it Saturn), behind a piece of metal that miraculously shields him from rock debris is ridiculous.
And in the end we learn that the main character found his way of life and space was just a theme for his loneliness.

1. This is not sci-fi opera or action flick. 2. This is not son - father relationship movie. Those things do exist in film and are great, but they are all just setups for movie to work as a medium. This movie is about self reflection that's inevitable fo any middle age man. So if you're not over 40, and struggling about who you are, why you are and what have you sacrificed to be that person up until that point in life, this movie will suck for you as it is evident by so many low scores and lousy reviews.

Others have commented on the plot flaws, and they are on point.
What makes me saddest when I see a movie like this is when I realise how much it cost. How are people in charge of so much money unable to see how ridiculous this is. It's like they have no concept of truth.

Not even enough tension built for an expected result, let alone a surprise. The talents agents, and the talent, both failed in this one.

And it doesn't. Pitt eventually and accidentally kills the crew of the rocket he stows away on, after being excluded from the mission and thus has to continue the search for his father who's somewhere at the end of our galaxy, on his own. The travelling takes up a large part of the movie till he eventually finds his father who's a demented husk of a human being set on exploring and photographing the rest of the universe at the expense of our galaxy by using antimatter which is causing widespread destruction. Time spent between father and son is extremely short ending in the father not wanting to go back to earth (as if it that was even remotely possible), so Pitt let's him drift off into space and he goes home. More travelling and when finally he reaches earth is carried out of his landing Pod. The end.
The story is empty. The exposition boring and enough to put you to sleep. I found myself hoping that they'd all die and and finally end this extremely boring and futile movie. Pitt is supposed to have a continuous heart rate of 80 bps even under pressure so I guess this was supposed to explain his underwhelming performance. I'm sorry I bothered watching the movie. Tightened up and a bit more character development to make you care and interested as well as a more realistic emphasis on the science of billions of light years of travelling would have maybe made me like the movie.

But beneath their sublime surfaces... there was nothing. No love or hate. No light or dark. He could only see what was not there... and missed what was right in front of him.""After viewing it three times and with much deliberation, I can confidently say that I sincerely love this film. This is one of the most interesting movies that I've seriously wrestled with in all of 2019.From what I've seen from Brad Pitt, this has to be one of his most challenging and nuanced performances. This is an expertly acted role and witnessing Pitt's restraint in becoming the distant Roy McBride is something that really had me on edge.? It's always interesting seeing actors cast into different types of roles, but I've found Pitt's performance in this film to be one of the most riveting of 2019. Pitt says more with a glance and with his eyes than by any of the actual dialogue spoken. The emotional distance this film holds the audience at for the great majority of this motion picture is at once polarizing and sympathetic.James Gray's direction hearkens to the cold humanism of Kubrick. What appears at first to be a space epic of cosmic proportions evolves into an intimate father-son portrait, and it is in this dynamic that Gray's direction really shines through. The story of a son attempting to find and reconnect with his father, set against the backdrop of the practical futurism of the colonization of space, is simply fantastic and is executed with restraint and care.Hoyte Van Hoytema's gorgeous, slow cinematography is paired perfectly with the masterful production and set design. The set pieces in this film become more and more fantastic the farther we travel into the Solar System, with each location being distinctly designed to reflect both the pragmatism of the setting and the psychological underpinnings of McBride's journey.My only primary quip with this film is some of the writing for Pitt's narration which guides us through the entire story. While introspective and revealing to McBride's internal struggles, the writing feels almost juvenile at times. Rarely, but every so often, a line would be uttered that made wonder, ""Is this not the same blasé diction used in film and television that we always experience?"" Certainly more imaginative language could have been written in for an interesting and ruminative character such as Pitt's McBride.Ultimately this is a thoughtfully crafted, intimate introspective set against the backdrop of the cosmos that features a beautifully nuanced performance from Pitt, expertly crafted world-building and set pieces from the filmmakers, and arresting cinematography from Hoytema.",Ad Astra

I have to be fair with it though- unfortunately (and ironically) it's like a ship caught in turbulence that veers on and off course. Some sequences serve no purpose to the story and most characters (all but the two leads) we hardly get to know. Though it does have some deep themes, they could have been executed much more strongly with some simple choices. The film wasn't very satisfying for me, especially in how quickly they wrapped up the ending. The sequence on the moon is my favorite part by far, very interesting, and that concept has a lot of potential. This film has been compared to Apocalypse Now and 2001, and while it's similar (I do love both of those movies), this one doesn't quite hit the bar because it has weak focus. I can't help but think: what if they made it ""Apocalypse now, but set on the moon"" - now that would be incredible. Or if they focused on the futuristic conflicts and such on the moon.

A brilliant character study.,8,20 January 2020,"Are people seriously complaining about Brad Pitt having daddy issues and space pirates?Brad Pitt's character goes beyond just having daddy issues. Brad Pitt's character obviously is dealing with a severe form of depression. He's self destructive, only caring about the things he deems worthy while ignoring the people who loves him the most. However, he's deadly afraid of this since he recognizes the same traits in his own father, who'd chosen to throw away everything for the sake of his endeavor to find intelligent life among the stars. After finding out that his father might still be alive, Roy (Brad Pitt) engages in the same behavior and leaves everything behind to find his father. But throughout the trip, he starts to doubt his decisions as his decisions had lead to many tragedies. By the end, Roy finds his father and tries to bring him home. His father then tells him that he never cared about him and Earth as the only important thing to his father were ""bigger things"". With a drop of tear rolling down his eye, Roy simply replies: ""I know dad"". His father seems to comply at first but then decides to end his life as he believes that he's a failure and there's nothing left for him. Roy grants his father's wish because he understood his father. Although struggling a bit, Roy eventually found the will to go back home as he realizes that he's been wrong this whole time. His father, although found a lot of beautiful planets, was too focused on the life that wasn't there instead of focusing on what was right in front of him. Roy realizes that now and, through that, found the strength to return home; to right all the wrongs he's done to the people who loves him, therefore, completing his arc.And people... there are pirates on Earth... why do you act like you've never heard of them?

Its 2 hour run time doesn't ever feel boring to me, even though the pacing is consistently slow and introvert. Maybe it's because I'm also a somewhat of an introvert person that some of the dynamic resonates. The desire for solitude always conflicting with the inability to accept loneliness. The film is very meandering and smooth in its story telling, which is mostly expressed through beautiful visuals, the cinematography, and studious narration by the protagonist. He buries rage underneath a shield of calm and unfailing restraint. There's not a lot of politics here, or morals, or social commentary, just a very basic story about a person's character and motivation, and about father and son. It's about our drivers that determine what's important in a life, and what perhaps might not be. The scientific goofs that permeate the film every now and then seem an artefact of trying to put some tension in the proceedings, some Armageddon-style drama, and a touch of Life/Alien. It doesn't matter, they're just distractions. I'd say if you enjoy Moon, Space Odyssey (also part 2), Interstellar, and pretty much anything by Alex Garland, you'll like this too.

1723,acg_imdb,"A Feast for the Eyes, not so much for the Mind",7,20 September 2019,"There aren't too many actors in current film who can do a Look of Steely Resolve like Brad Pitt if he's put into a drama that requires it. Pitt does a masterful job of that here, underplaying and hiding his emotions as required of the character, but this film is in need of a screenplay worthy of his effort.It starts off with a great air of mystery and a flawless look at Things To Come in the near future on Earth, but as we leave there and progress further into space in pursuit of the plot, later contrivances, red herrings and headscratcher scenes threaten to stretch the film into one long space opera.We are just far enough into the future that we can travel to the well-colonized (if not peaceful) Moon, Mars, and assorted outlying space stations and such, but scenes along the way are more like excuses for action or fight sequences than actual story, such as a rescue attempt that disposes of one character for no particular reason, or a moon-based chase scene that feels stuck in because a movie executive somewhere insisted on a car chase, despite this being a space film.Perhaps all the side trips along the way are to keep our attention off the fact that this story will inevitably telescope down to the two main characters, Roy McBride and his father, out there by themselves in The Vastness of Space, or at least Neptune. We know that our story is going to come to its resolution out there, and the film seems determined to avoid getting there too quickly. In hindsight, that was probably a good idea.",Ad Astra
1724,jd1338,A movie in and about space,8,2 April 2020,"First of all, I get why so many people might be disappointed with this movie. I get it because I'm a hardcore-science-fiction nerd. I love to read novels and watch movies that take actual science and try to imagine where we could be 200-300 years.That being said, people who are disappointed with this movie probably had wrong expectations. This movie plays in space and its about space. But at its core it's certainly not about space travel, planets or engines we might use in the future to travel to Alpha Centauri.It's rather about the space between people, space between you and your inner self. Its about how we see others and how people might struggle in their life dealing with complicated social relations. Its about love in the face of ignorance. Its about the desperation of being alone, being misunderstood or just being lost in the space of your very own existence. Its rather asking questions than giving answers. Space is simply the perfect setting for the emotions it transports. Have you ever felt alone despite having people around? Have you ever thought that in the end it's up to you to make things right?Ad Astra is calm, philosophical and visually stunning at times. If you are not into this kind of stuff don't watch it. If you cannot turn off your hardcore-science-fiction point of view or your need for fast-paced space action, don't watch it. I cannot count the ridiculous scientific claims and situations in which I was like ""Yeah, right. This is against everything we know so far"".But if you like watching movies with an open mindset, if you like being moved and if you have ever struggled with your proven and undeniable insignificance in this endless universe, just give it a go!",Ad Astra
1725,LaLouch,Disappointing (spoilers),6,21 September 2019,"P:
Soundtrack is great - Max Richter is really good at making soft and lunar music that gets off the roads of well known composers.The near-future-ideas : the moon is conquered and easy to reach. The standards of living seem way higher with a very expensive pillow blanket pack. Tablets are now full glass. But fashion, design seem still close to our time. That proves reflection on this part and a few films succeed in making it realistic (the best for me is Her).Details : the traces on the wall on the Moon when he talks to his father's old partner; the walls that are not totally soft in the relation room...C :
you actually do not care.. The characters are so poorly developed that you have no real interest in seeing Brad Pitt meeting again his father. You have no empathy for them. They both seem very mind focused, very severe. One is obsessed by his job, the other by his father but they never try to include the viewer in it. It is an intimate relationship that you cannot enter in.Science errors / unrealistic scenes : there are a lot...The monkey scene - we use monkeys for long time it is very doubtful that a so much aggressive animal has been able to defeat an entire crew.
Entering the rocket while it starts.. no need to develop..
Launching himself with the nuclear explosion...
Lunar Buggy - they apparently switch the very tough ones with the one golf buggy to play on the moon...
acting : that was too much. Too much crying, too much dad/son problems with no explanationActually this film is just well presented, pretty and lead by very talented actors.

This is a slow-burning space drama with a feeling of reality to it. The physics felt right, and didn't need to make sense. As if laser sounds in Star Wars can ever make sense. It is a story and has some thrills, drama, character development and a back story that entwines with the culmination and resolution.

1732,bryan-d-ellison,Very unrealistic execution of a terrible story.,2,13 December 2019,"I have no idea why this movie has gotten such good reviews. It is awful. Plot, character, suspension of disbelief all suffer.The biggest flaw is the voice over. It is obtrusive and totally unnecessary. It chimes in often and interrupts me contemplating the character, story, or what is going on. What's worse, it doesn't really offer much. A lot of what is said is simply reflected on screen, so why the heck is narrating? It's also a crutch for a poor story since there are only a few scenes that show the character, it is doing the telling in the narration. It leaves nothing open to audience interpretation or projection. There's just way too much time spent on getting our main character from point A to B to C etc that we are not presented with scenes that truly expose who our character is. There's a completely underdeveloped wife. Everything is neatly wrapped up in the end where our MC is now all great because of... something. Terrible.The second biggest flaw is the constant unrealistic portrayal of what's happening, starting from the very beginning. It starts on a space antenna which is a long thing built from earth stretching into space. The crew is far above the atmosphere that we're in the black of space. This would be mostly weightless if not completely. But their actions are such that there is full gravity.The story depicts this as being in the near future, but there are multiple moon colonies so big that there's commercialization and lots of space. Mars base is similarly large. Long hallways made of cement. Lots and lots of empty space. It just doesn't make sense as all of this would have to come from earth. For this much industrialization to occur on Mars and the Moon, centuries would have to have passed, not near future. And if it is that far ahead, why are they taking dune buggies across the moon that look like they're from the 70s? The main character has to travel to Mars to send a signal to Neptune. Why? Why can't you do that from Earth? Plus, he has to do it live. What? Can't he just record the thing and rebroadcast it? It's just dumb.His father is on some mission to look for proof of ETs past our Heliosphere. In the story, he goes out there, but his ship stops at Neptune. Which is it? The heliosphere is really far away. Why does he need to go out there anyway? Is it really necessary to have a telescope or other astronomical instruments that far out? This far in the future, do we really need to be beyond the heliosphere? Also, it takes the main character only 72 days to get to Neptune from Mars. Seriously?There's a total throw away scene, and it should have as this movie is too long, where a distress call is answered. A radio voice over says there's 28 people registered to the craft, but when we go on board, there's no one and no bodies. There's 2 escaped wild monkeys that we presume killed everyone, but our main character takes chare of them with ease. You telling me none of the 28 people could have done that?. Where did they go?Just one dumb thing after another.",Ad Astra
1733,Lleuq75,"'Ad Astra"" Review: A dramatic self-discovery journey unmatched by its visual spectacle.",7,21 September 2019,"With 'Ad Astra', the take on the exploration of space makes a hard turn to the self-discovery drama, and pays less attention to the ""fiction"" part of its exuberant science display. Brad Pitt delivers a fine performance in a film that does enough to impress on the audience the inner struggles of its protagonists, but on a far more underwhelming level as its technical achievements.Pitt portrays Roy McBride, a Major in the military's space division in ""the near future."" Pitt is summoned by his superiors and is informed that the catastrophic events of ""the Surge"" are believed to be linked to a an expedition called The Lima Project, which was headed by Roy's father, Clifford (Tommy Lee Jones). With evidence to believe Clifford may still be alive, the protagonist is assigned by the space military the mission of making contact with his father. What ensues is a self-reflective exploration of the protagonist's soul, and not so much of space itself.The protagonist's principal conflict lies on his learning Clifford might be alive years after the ""Lima Project"" lost contact with humanity. Roy's depressive state of mind is the strongest part of Pitt's performance - his commitment to the mission of finding his father is founded on his sense of distance towards him. At one point, Helen Lantos (Ruth Negga) reveals to Roy information about his father that complicates both the moral and physical journey of the protagonist, and Pitt brilliantly manages to convey the heavy toll his family history takes on his psyche.James Gray directorial vision is at a masterful level, even if his narrative isn't necessarily up to par. Gray somehow manages to keep us in awe of the technological reality of this future in an unexpected subdued and subtle manner. The mundanity of characters entering a rocket ship to the Moon and being tended to by flight attendants floating around the cabin is mesmerizing. As extraordinary as the military bases and overall structures in space and both in the Moon and in Mars seems to us, the audience, Gray also conveys humanity's integration of this new world into its quotidian life.Gray's finds ways around the fabric of space to provide us with truly awe-inspiring images, but none that seemed unmatched or that stand out from other, just as memorable past efforts.The biggest fault in 'Ad Astra' is perhaps a sense of narrative closure that seems small compared to the vastness of its visual spectacle. Sure, the story is ultimately a coherent one; but its sense of finality seems dissonant with its thematic. It seems as if Gray gave in to the question of what looking to the stars can tell us about our search for a purpose.As implausible as the scientific endeavors of 'Ad Astra' might seem to us at this time, the movie is more keen to emphasize on our own struggle to find meaning for our existence. Looking to the stars for answers is certainly materially impossible as far as we are concerned today, and definitely within the technological grasp of Gray's ""near future"". But no matter which world, Gray seems to suggest, our human condition will bind our quest for meaning even beyond the stars. Although Roy McBride's story isn't a particular profound meditation on this matter, it is ultimately arresting enough on an aesthetic level to make us, the audience keep looking to the stars in 'Ad Astra' for answers.7/10",Ad Astra

Unfortunately, with a generation hooked on mindless (most of them, as Infinity War, Endgame, the Guardians and especially Ragnarok are good movies) Marvel movies, it's hard to make films like FIRST MAN or AD ASTRA.

Ruth Negga's character is the biggest example of this, it's one of the biggest holes in the plot, so clearly a Deus ex machina that the movie almost looks like a bad videogame at some points.The acting by Brad Pitt is on point, but the highlight here is Tommy Lee Jones with a great performance as a lost man that sometimes doesn't even look human.Another great aspect is the cinematography. Hoyte van Hoytema was clearly inspired by ""2001: A Space Odessey"", but the cinematographer managed to give his own flair to it and the results are magnificent.The soundtrack transmits to the viewer a sense of total loneliness, but at the same time shows the overwhelming greatness of Space.""Ad Astra"" is a gorgeous visual and sound experience, with great acting performances by its stars, but a lazy written screenplay and a mediocre work of direction by director and writer James Gray.",Ad Astra

There's a moment in the movie when the vehicle Brad Pitt's character is driving in the moon starts getting attacked. A lot of shootings in this chase scene - at this point the movie is already very boring - so it gives you a little bit of hope that something unpredictable and exciting is about to happen. But then that's it... Brad Pitt survives and everything about this part is gone and useless. They don't talk about it anymore. Nothing happened, it wasn't important, it didn't add anything to the ""plot"".You see something, and you keep it in your mind, hoping that it will make sense in the end, but the movie goes on and on, and you start adding and adding endless scenes, that just DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

There are some really stunning visuals, on par with interstellar at certain moments. There is also a major psychological layer, which I think is the main narrative here but it's often disrupted by the chaotic screenwriting. The whole idea which is presented, I mean the incredible importance of our relationship with our parents and the fact that we are, in a way, a copy of them, is portrayed in a interesting fashion. Also the topic o sanity and those blurred lines which separate sanity and insanity, yeahhh, I like the way that they touched it. At the same time, some solutions are simply bad, albo the matter of gravity and body interactions in space, naaahhh, simply not on par with the science.

I like what it's trying to do. I appreciate the message and the lead character's pain. I just never got very emotionally attached to the main character. I understand he's emotionally damaged and that can play a role as to his aloof attitude, but it just doesn't connect. His lack of emotion makes it difficult to be empathetic of his plight.They try to drum up the importance of the meeting with his father but it's never really made all too clear what is happening that is putting the world in danger. How exactly is a space ship 2.6 billion miles away producing an electrical wave strong enough to destroy earth? What was that about anti-matter? Poor attempt at making a believable threat even to someone with basic knowledge of physics. There are no stakes involved since the premise is ridiculous.The movie also tried to build up the reveal that the main character's father was maliciously intending to destroy the planet, however that was obvious from the start and lacked any real power. This reveal takes over half the movie, which again was obvious, so time well wasted.It was disappointing that they never explored the father's rationale behind his actions. Just a veiled explanation of insanity brought by a lack of success with his project. Also, again, how can this man have the power to threaten earth's existence?

The irony of trying to save the human race or find scientific discoveries in deep space is that you have to leave behind your humanity and reach almost a robotic state of enlightenment.Tommy Lee demonstrates this very well, and Brad Pitt's journey to Tommy lee is not only literal but also a metaphorical journey to this state of mind. The encounters Brad sees are often exciting to the audience but are mundane to Brad as just the realities of space exploration, as shown by his pulse readings. Once finally staring his dad in the eyes, Brad realizes this is not a life living, having seen that there might not be any more life it makes the one he left behind all the more special.Overall a great psychological exploration of characters in space travel, complimented by great cinematography and acting; however, the movie might not have as much rewatch value as other space travel themed movies.",Ad Astra

But talking about the movie as a whole, is so powerful from all sides that it deserves at least my rating 8/10.",Ad Astra

1767,cps-36696,A Vague Mess,2,30 September 2019,"Despire the incredibly misleading trailer, this is basically two hours of Tommy Lee Jones and Brad Pitt's Father Son relationship with everything else including the world ending threat treated as unimportant undefind background noiseThe Pulse is barely mentioned in any meaningful way and the ending is just ridiculous. Tommy Lee Jone's charachter just gives up for no reason after having killed all his crew and Brad Pitt's character then escapes and goes home with one ludicrous stunt after another.Nothing in this film even at the beginning is explained, has any details or apparently had any real thought given to it. From the line at the very beginning ""in the near future"" which it clearly isn't, to the moon pirates which have no story or motive and are just there to write out Donald Sutherland's Charachter, to the killer Gorilla which is just there to kill of the captain.None of it means anything as none of it has any context.One section that really stood out to me as being incomprehensibly stupid was when they come across the ship sending out the mayday that contains the aforementioned Gorilla and Brad Pitt's charachter who is ostensibly on a mission to save Earth tries to overrule the captains decision to investigate. The captain responds that he can only overrule him if he tells him what his mission is. Absolutely rubbish. Either he has the authority to overrule him or he doesn't. It makes no sense that he'd have to reveal the details of a classified mission to do so.This for me was a prime example of the poor writing on display throughout this film. They wanted Brad Pitt's charachter to object as he would given the mission was on but couldn't find a way or be bothered to find a way to realistically have his objections be ignored / overuled.Everything that happens in this film seems to only have one purpose - to kill of any characters that are with Brad Pitt so he can then carry out whatever the task is single handedly.From the Pirates, to the Gorilla to the cowardly first officer to to the idiot military officials to the crew that's meant to fly to Neptune that Brad Pitt manages to kill off in there entirety with no apparent repercussions.",Ad Astra

And slightly worse than being the film being about the most boring one ever, it completely ignores all precepts of the subject which it claims to hold sacred. This is supposed to be a movie about space, but to give an example without spoiling, they attempt a transmission across space which, since radio communications travel unimpeded at the speed of light through a vacuum, should take about 4 hours each way, and yet they wait only about 5 minutes for a response. Then there's travel times, which I will allow do not violate known laws of the universe, but are completely unrealistic. In short, PLEASE, for the love of God, DO NOT see this movie.

AA tells the story of Brad Pitt's character, whom I can't even name, sent off on a mission to find . his father, who holds the key to saving our solar system from an unknown catastrophe.The set up of how the world is in this future is actually very cool and one of the few things the movie does successfully, passing off some far-in-the-future technologies and concepts as run-of-the-mill for their time. Things such as space elevators, commercial flights to the moon and other planets within our solar system are pulled off believably. The special effects are pretty good especially anything having to do with lunar travel, and don't distract you as they could have done if they were done poorly. Could I see this world happening in a few decades? Yes and I think Ad Astra executes on that part very well.However, the main meat of the story and the characters is where things didn't quite work. The main threat in this story didn't quite feel ominous to me for being something cosmic that threatened earth and when you finally do see what it is, you're like ""that's it?"" I do understand the story was meant to explore deeper ideas of human connection but unfortunately, I don't think they pulled it off. I didn't feel any attachment to the characters or their relationships; perhaps it was the overly calm portrayal of Brad Pitt's character, which I think was meant to be juxtaposed against his discovery at the end but it just didn't work. His arc was good, though, you could see his frustration grow throughout the movie.Overall, the most enjoyable part of this movie was seeing how space travel could be in the future, but the story and characters were just too weak to invest in.",Ad Astra

It started very strongly... and then... well for me it became boring, unfulfiling and most of all so unrealistic that it completely turned me off.The majority of the action scenes felt like they were added as an after-thought to keep the audience awake. Most ended up making no sense once you started thinking about the plausibility of those things actually happening. This film presented itself as a realistic near future sci-fi movie but where apparently physics do not apply... Like going through an asteroid belt with a thin metal panel (the same asteroid belt that a few minutes ago severely damages the main characters sturdy shuttle to the point that it could not dock onto his father's ship)... And those space moneys... Or the space pirates...Too many things simply made no sense and those moments pulled me so strongly out of the movie that I was unable to enjoy it.Now, I might have actually been able to partially disregard this if the movie had had a strong ending, unfortunately the end felt very unfulfilling.I love sci-fi movies and I think Brad Pitt is an incredible actor but this movie simply did not work for me.",Ad Astra

The trailer didn't convey much to me other than the promise of some fantastic visuals. So i sat there and all i could see in this film was ""Apocalypse Now"". A man goes on a long journey to find someone at the end that may have lost their way. His mission, to stop said person. Along the way action brakes up the journey, with the visuals getting more surreal the further into said journey.Now this film looks amazing. The visuals are fantastic and sometimes had me gasping. A set piece at the start of the film involving danger at great height especially had me holding my breath. But then your introduced to the main character. A man who keeps his composure no matter what and his heart rate is almost always at a consistent low. Whilst Brad Pitts character is interesting and extremely well acted, the fact that he is always so cool no matter what is going on around him took away from the danger of the situation for me. After getting to spend some time with the main character i was never worried he was in above his head and therefore i didn't believe in the danger he was in. Also there is a lot of movie logic going on in this film. If your one of those people who like to sit there and pick apart any inconsistencies in regards to real life science and logic, then you will have a lot to do during this film. This film has things happen to further the plot, regardless if they have a basis in reality. This for me was not a problem, seeing as i like to let the film take me on a journey. But i mention it for the sake of others.This is a good film, its visually beautiful and has some great acting and some fun action.

The scientific part of the movie was really bad. And the story itself was boring. Can't compete with other movies like Interstellar and similar ones in no way. And portraying astronauts and scientist as a weak minded murderers is a pretty bad scenario. You do realise that there is so small number of pilots and astronauts because we are required to be healthy in body and most importantly in mind. I was really hyped to see this movie but I was disapointed. Now when I look at it it was waste of my time and money to go and see this.

Spoiler: Ad Astra is not that, and it works.Ad Astra is an emotionally complex film that centres around the character of Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) and spends its 2 hour runtime focusing on the exploration of his and his father's, Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), characters and relationship.While at points it can feel a little slow and the concept of the shockwaves threatening Earth, which is introduced in the first act, doesn't make that much sense and isn't really explained, I absolutely loved this film. Pitt's acting is one of his best performances allowing us to not only see but understand his emotions and thought process throughout the film. The interactions between Roy and his father are heart-breaking but painfully realistic. As well as this, the cinematography is beautiful, delivering stunning imagery of space.My overall review of this film is that if you're looking for a light-hearted sci-fi blockbuster this is not it but it manages to be so much more and be a heart-breakingly real film about parent/child relationships and the way they affect people's lives even decades later and is definitely worth the watch.",Ad Astra

1802,mjcarter73,No stars involved Did they forget the story?,4,21 September 2019,"This movie has some brilliant effects and acting isn't bad but the story is a disaster area with the authors missing many a trick. Right at the start Mr Pitt is shown working on a massively high structure, we are told it's a communications antenna seeking to contact alien life, but that's all. It's completely irrelevant to the plot, we don't know why it's being built how it will be used or even if it survived. One assumes it's construction was prompted by the outcome of the earlier project Lima which is highly classified and underlies this movie, but in the end there seems to be no link.
Likewise the reasons for sending Mr Pitt to Mars are a bit thin, if he's intended simply to read a script then why not send a recording? ... and his journey appears to be unusually hazardous... Ah you think foul play afoot! Someone doesn't want him getting there; but no, there's no hidden conspiracy, just bad luck. The attack on the moon is coincidence, although particularly odd, we are told that the pirates wish to acquire lunar rovers, yet all their actions seem intent on destroying them rather than capture. The odd Mayday from an apparently deserted craft is never explained, who sent it? Why? What happened on that ship? Was it a trap to again stymie this voyage. Once again the answer is a resounding ""No"". It's not a trap just another unfortunate coincidence. Finally the electron blast during landing us again just coincidental.There seems to be some sort of hidden or secret agenda behind the events on Mars, but if there is then we never find out about it. Me Pitt breaks script to appeal directly to his father. TUnlike the script, this seems to lead to a reply and is presumably why it was necessary to send him in person to mars in the first place ... instead of say a recorded message? However although it's possible this approach did lead to a reply, rather than follow up this communication it simply results in Mr Pitt being declared unfit for the mission! So was there a reply? What did it say? The fate of the base commander is left unresolved. Finally what's the purpose of him stowing aboard the Neptune rocket? This results in the death of the rest of the crew and achieves nothing that crew couldn't have achieved anyway had they survived. The origin of the bursts is only vaguely explained. Obviously you're thinking... has the father made contact? Is this an attempt at communication? An attack? Again no, he found no life just images of dead exoplanets and the origin of the bursts is purely accidental and only vaguely explained; they have no purpose. In the end this is just another ""man goes mad in space"" movie. Lastly, ad astra means ""to the stars""... But in this case only as far as Neptune, no stars involved!",Ad Astra
1803,lvo-98330,Ad Astra is a sequel to 1997's Rocketman,6,1 January 2021,"I know what you're thinking. This can't possibly be true. How can a philosophical sci-fi drama be a sequel to a twenty three year old goofball Disney space comedy, which has been criminally underrated since its conception? You'd be right for thinking it was god-damned outlandishly crazy, but you'd be dead wrong for thinking it wasn't completely true.What is Ad Astra about? H. Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) has gone feral on Neptune in his pursuit of extra-terrestrial life, threatening Earth in the process and Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) is dispatched to neutralise him. Roy's journey is riddled with perils, both physical and spiritual. His convoy is blindsided on the Moon by Mad Max space pirates and his crewmate is chewed to death by Norwegian lab baboons. Roy is also left to ponder the hubris of the human race, either through the fruitless endeavours of his father's search for aliens or by witnessing people make old mistakes on new worlds (fast food outlets on the Moon say it all). But how does any of this connect to astronaut Fred Randall (Harland Williams) and his motley crew of 90s space pioneers?Fred Randall is unrivalled in two areas. Firstly, he is a buffoonish man-child, obsessed with space travel, video games, musicals and, yes, aliens. He is also, however, by genetic fluke, the best astronaut ever born and the only man capable of guiding the first manned mission to Mars to success. What three elements make Randall the ultimate moon man? 1) he's a ""popcorn geek"" computer genius, 2) he is able to withstand immense G force without blacking out, which some unfortunate nuns learn the hard way 3) he can endure isolation for countless days without cracking, so long as he has a repertoire of classic songs to keep him entertained.Randall, along with his co-pilots Julie (Jessica Lundy), 'Wild Bill' Overbeck (William Sadler) and Ulysses the hyper-sleep capsule stealing chimp travel to Mars to search for (you guessed it) extra terrestrial life. More specifically, as Randall describes them ""Martian crust devils, with their venomous feet and wet, sucking lips"".What perils face Randall on this journey? His hand is bitten by a research primate, his buggy crashes and his space suit is torn and leaking. Does any of this sound familiar? Sounds to me like Roy McBride's adventures are referencing Randalls' directly. But what's the theory?Randall's Mars mission is a success, but NASA faces ridicule for sending such a fool into space, so in the words of Roy, ""they made him a hero"". Randall's skills are invaluable to the space program, which turns its attention solely to the pursuit of intelligent life in the universe. Randall is therefore renamed Clifford McBride and his begrudging teammate is also given a new identity, Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland). Randall/McBride marries Julie and they have one son, Roy. Like his father, Roy is immune to G force, as shown in the film's first scene, has unrivalled piloting skills and can withstand isolation without the need for mood stabilising drugs. His psychological evaluations always come up trumps and his bravery is unmatched throughout the galaxy. His father even admits ""I admire your bravery"" when they finally meet off the coast of Neptune. Remember the coin Bud Nesbitt (Beau Bridges) gave to Randall, what was it for? Bravery? You're damn right.
Randall/McBride's obsession with aliens and his child-like nature eventually consumes him and what once was endearing becomes dark, twisted and murderous. NASA sends Pruitt (formerly Wild Bill) along with Roy in hope that his old partner could help in calming his insanity, but the moon buggy ride from hell seems to be too much for Pruitt and his old heart can't take it. What happened to Pruitt to fear such an event? Well, consider that in Rocketman, Wild Bill found himself crushed beneath an overturned buggy, and only the Randall's superhuman mother-strength could save him. (Mama's coming, little Billy!)Are the pieces starting to fit?Do you remember when Roy was on Mars and he revealed his father was a fan of musicals? Do all of Randall's Wizard of Oz and Pinnochio references start to make sense yet? Does Roy's transition from emotionless space servant to well rounded human being echo the story of the brave little puppet?

1806,popcornparkofficial,ad astra-nomical success or failure?,4,13 August 2020,"Simply put, the visuals were absolutely stunning. The cinematography, sound editing and directing were really immersive. Certain elements such as the subtle changes of light on the actors' faces and the camera angles made up the atmosphere of the events that were taking place. I was impressed by each scene's ability to make it seem so realistically futuristic, like the world the movie was set in could happen sometime in the near future. Gray's storytelling portrays the theme of the coming of adventure, the feeling of adrenaline because of imagining something grand is about to happen but not knowing exactly what is to take place. These small and cunning elements perfectly captured this sensation in the storytelling.Ad Astra definitely won't be what you expect. Especially if you're looking forward to a sci-fi movie. What was truly missing was logic. A lot of elements in the movie especially the world-building suggested that the film was going for a more realistic sci-fi theme but a lot of what was happening to the main character, Roy McBride didn't make sense. It was just always focused on him, the one main character, who kept ending up alone and kept surviving even the most illogical situations even if he kept making several irrational decisions. So many scenes didn't make any sense and how the events played out just made me very irritated. Things just didn't add up a lot of the time.The film's plot also includes psychological drama which makes Ad Astra different from other sci-fi movies. This aspect of the plot wasn't very interesting or exciting but took up the backbone of the screenplay. After a certain point, you could see that the story was not going anywhere. However, there certainly is an important takeaway, which is to keep your loved ones close to you and learn to appreciate them in your lives, even if you will face many difficulties and grow apart.You can appreciate how the movie looks and sounds like (literally), but Ad Astra has failed at both attempts of being a proper psychological drama and sci-fi film.",Ad Astra

The father-son struggle, emotional challenges etc. could've been told through a story on earth way better rather than a really dumb depiction of space. I can list a page of dumb things in this movie, but let's keep it short. 2nd dumbest goes to the Gravity repeat. Tommy Lee tries to join Neptune while hooked to Brad, then brad tries to pull him back (insert Gravity science review here)
1st dumbest, Brad takes a panel off the station, hops on the rotating antenna and uses it to sling shot toward his ride back o_O
You can not change orbit like that, and you did that thin piece of panel wouldn't protect you through the belt. even smallest dust in would go through that, your space suite and your body with no problem. forget about how come the force from those hits doesn't stop him or change his trajectory.

1819,caisha,Retelling of Pinocchio story in space,9,21 September 2019,"Ad Astra is quite an ambitious and multilayered movie. On a surface level it's a grand space adventure: packing interesting action from earth premises to the edge of our solar system. Brad Pit is in his natural waters here and delivers a solid performance. Renderings of outer space are beautiful and accompanied by a chilling soundtrack.Then there is a deeper psychological level to the film. It's hinted by frequent emotional checkup sequences and flashbacks of the protagonist's father. Many modern viewers might struggle to understand this part. I've read one review where it was summarized as ""a stoic, closed-off astronaut with daddy issues"".In my opinion, the key to Ad Astra can be found in a Pinocchio story - it bears striking similarities. Both characters start as fakes and are being manipulated by the society around them. Then they choose to undertake a dangerous journey to the deepest part of the ocean (or the space in this instance) and reunite with the father figure. This allows them to become real and create genuine connections in the world. My only complaint was that Brad had some trouble manifesting this part convincingly - thus not a perfect ten.",Ad Astra

1827,jcs_ic2,Heart of Darkness Meets 2001: A Space Odyssey in Ad Astra,8,28 September 2019,"In 1861 John James Ingalls suggested that Per Aspera ad Astra, ""through hardship to the stars,"" be the motto for the state of Kansas. The idea being that hardship is the forge through which great heights are attained. James Gray's Ad Astra (to the stars) borrows half of this phrase, but it might have been more apt to use the full title. Ad Astra is chock full of hardship. The hardship of space travel. The hardship of being estranged from your father. The hardship of loneliness. The hardship of madness. Yet, as in the motto, the film is hopeful, desperately sad, and oh boy, is it gorgeous on the big screen.Ad Astra's director, James Gray, is previously known for the Lost City of Z, The Immigrants and We Own the Night. Films that were not particularly known for their big box office appeal, but were often critically acclaimed. That should have been everyone's first clue that his latest production would not be the usual space adventure.Gray stated back in 2016 that he intended to create ""the most realistic depiction of space travel that's been put in a movie."" Gray accomplished this task handily. The film feels like a sibling to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey, without the grand cosmic mind trip at the end. Instead, we are treated to a different sort of odyssey, one that is reminiscent of Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness or Apocalpyse Now if you prefer.Brad Pitt plays a veteran astronaut, Roy McBride, who is the also the son of legendary astronaut Clifford McBride, played by Tommy Lee Jones. The senior McBride, it seems, departed years before on an expedition to Neptune essentially abandoning his family, never to be heard from again. That is until some 30 years later, at which point the Earth starts to receive anti-matter generated high-energy pulses that threaten the solar system. Of course, the origin of the pulses is Neptune and Space Command immediately suspects the lost expedition wasn't lost after all.Ad Astra TrailerRoy McBride is ordered to travel to a secure transmission facility on Mars in an attempt to make contact with his father. Roy's effort is successful, but he is also deemed too emotionally unstable and conflicted to continue to Neptune. It is at this juncture that the story turns into Heart of Darkness or Apocalpyse Now in space. The younger McBride becomes obsessed with finding his father, who has gone around a murderous bend in the road, complete with a Martin Sheen like narrative and mission to kill the Kurtz like Clifford McBride.Brad Pitt's acting is pretty amazing. Pitt is given very little in the way of expressive lines, the desperation, the sadness, and at times the madness are all conveyed through his eyes and a series of remarkable facial ticks. He is clearly a broken man and has been for some time. Donald Sutherland and Liv Tyler put in forgettable walkthrough performances. Tommy Lee Jones' does a reasonable job with maddened Clifford McBride, but in the end, comes up short.The other major character in the film is space. Much like the jungle in Apocalypse Now, it is a dark (literally), ominous and foreboding place. Space is not the fun, exciting place we have to come to expect in our movies, but is instead the harsh cold, deadly place it truly is. Gray's love for this subject matter, in this case, shines through. It is a stunningly beautiful film to watch and to enjoy it fully, a big screen is needed, but do yourself a favor leave the comic book hero kids at home. This movie is meant to be meditated on.Monkeyfist.life",Ad Astra

But no, somehow a single spaceship that is 30 years old is causing massive havoc with our own technology.Ok, so the science and the premise are crap. But what really takes it over the top is the insult to the intelligence of the user. Going to Neptune? Go to the moon, then Mars, then in a scene that reminds me of taking the A train in Manhattan, next top Jupiter, Saturn, ok end of the line in Neptune.So as if making up the science fiction isn't enough, the writers are so lazy, and so desperate for pictures of beautiful planets, that they have to rearrange the solar system.There were a couple of good action scenes, and Brad Pitt did an acceptable job. But when compared to the Martian, where there is one huge mistake (wind on mars) but where everything else is reasonable, this movie makes it look like Damon is just better than Brad Pitt. Which is fair because he should never have agreed to do this steaming pile of S**T.As I said, my initial guess was that this was some sort of remake of the star trek veeger episode, but that would have been infinitely better than this was.

Nice story, BUT:
-The reason the father left makes no sense.

I read the reviews before I watched it and was worried it wouldn't live up to my expectations but I must say, I was wrong. The story is definitely a little slow but I believe it no way affects the movie negatively. They did a good job in developing the plot. I feel like there was a little bit of everything in this movie.

This is a very ""realistic"" approach, sure some science is pushed to the damn near impossible. However, it's in some weird way believable and needed to advance the plot.
The plot is completely coherent and you can really connect to what's happening even though you only following the recent events of the characters.

And not so much about ""space exploration"" itself.But if this story is so much about ""finding someone important"", why do we barely get to know the characters? What was the true motivation for dad to leave into space? What about the son's emotions? All we get is some cheap monologue and ""psycho tests"" that the son (sorry, I totally forgot the main character's name) has to undergo every then and when, revealing a *little* bit of his emotions.The rest is sometimes downright silly ""space soap opera"" like a ""moon buggy laser fight"" and ""boarding a launching rocket"" - during the last 10 seconds countdown (!).So what's left is a mildly entertaining space ride with pleasing (but not mind-blowing) visuals.Better watch 2001 - A Space Odyssey again for The Real Thing.",Ad Astra

1856,vgoudreault,"Eye candy, no story, and even less realism",2,21 September 2019,"I could write reams about how much of a disappointment that story is. But I shall be succinct (couple paragraphs) because it does not deserve much of my time. This is just a very small sample of the faults I found without even trying hard.I have an issue with verisimilitude. If a movie is about a man wearing his brief over leggings with a big S on his chest, able to fly without using any muscle, OK, that is a given and we should take, as this is what the movie advertise. But jumping from one ship to another one that is so far to not even be seen to take aim would actually require the same kind of ""leave your critical sense at home"" that is needed to think that a man could be bitten by a radio active spider and acquire all its abilities.But when a movie tries to show realistic hardware and misses the boat so completely, it completely destroys everything. Case in point: people are in a Moon base where gravity is 1/6 that of Earth, yet everyone walks normally.
And between two US bases on said Moon, are a bunch of renegades that will attack on sight? For what? Is everyone riding a Moon buggy assumed to be carrying million in gold bullions or something? Bases large enough to have *fast food joints* with EXTERIOR neon signs (who the (*^$ is going to be lured by those anyway???) and not enough security people to go and pacify the highwaymen?Then, on the way from the Moon to Mars, you just happen to pass by orbital laboratories? And there you are, going at least 3000 km per *second*, and you can stop just like that to check things out?What a massive let down... When leaving the theater, I could only repeat to my better half that this was garbage. Anyone willing to accept that fittest and greatest astronaut in the corps (with a rank of major) is merely some kind of maintenance guy on an antenna?There is so much ""happy"" coincidences that cannot be explained that are not even necessary to the story, it is like a Swiss cheese plot without any cheese, the holes occupy 100% of the volume.But I have to commend Tommy Lee Jones' character. For someone who has been alone in space for 16 years, he kept his hair relatively neat and tidy. Not to mention that he must have had plenty of oxygen and food to last that long.

This is another impossible story taking place in space, that shows that space is heavenly beautiful but at the same time the exact definition of hell.
The movie is stunning, and gives you the chill of deep space, especially when there is a wider angle image with no sound that gives you the creep of the silence of space. The story itself starts well but ends poorly to my taste. Still better than interstellar.",Ad Astra
1859,alejandrodear,Extremely disappointing,4,23 September 2019,"Honestly: the trailer I had seen was very promising... but the film advertised is a flop.
While the promising part of the story (the relation between the main character a his father) is developed without conviction, many accessory things happen without being necessary for the narration.
After Gravity, so many impossible things should not appear on a movie, if it is to be taken seriously. At least I was expecting some more respect for the physics.
One thing that prevents me from giving even less stars is Brad Pitt's acting: it is the best part of the movie, by far. But it is a shame he (as the lead actor and one of the producers) did not read the script more thoroughly before endorsing it.",Ad Astra

Or maybe the answers were just lacklustre.Physics and realism which seemed important to start with, seemed to be non evident by the end of the movie.I assume that this because all of it was playing out in Roys head, or purgatory.

It's a long astral naval gazing slog with some emergencies thrown in. It's visuals are stunning and if you're into CGI then this film could work for you, notwithstanding the Neptune sized plot holes you will have to drive through, not to mention the bad science. I'll avoid any spoilers so as not to ruin the surprise for you, but you may want to experience the baboons in outer space. Well, that's one spoiler, sorry.

How do those brigands afford to get to and live on the Moon? Unexplained. How the heck does Brad Pitt's character get to Neptune and back so fast? Unexplained. How and why is anyone doing anything?

1877,davidwilliamrose38,A great slow burn literally. With terrific acting by Brad Pitt,8,6 December 2019,"I liked this movie very much. Brad Pitts acting gets better and better with age. When he plays himself as a soft spoken real person, he is so much more effective, especially in a role like this.
Although stoicism presides, his character reaches down into the deepest part of his emotions. I think many of us can connect in some way with the loss of our fathers whether it be spiritually, emotionally or physically.
Brad Pitt does a great job In showing us that with great responsibility can coincide with sacrifice and loss.Tommy Lee Jones played the role very well although we don't see much of him, but we do see him as a man wrott with remorse by guided by purpose.He just could not let of his dream to find extra terrestrial life, no matter what the cost. In the end even after telling his son that he didn't care about him or his mother in the past, you know that he loved his son as much as he could, physically and emotionally capable of guilt but ultimately he could not let go of his obsession...And in the end he remained where he felt peace and tranquillity, selfish by letting his son down but giving his son the satisfaction in knowing that he was alive all that time. By not fighting his son to disarm the bomb. In the end excepting his faith and choosing his fate, drifting off into Oblivion.
I really like this movie it's another slow burn that really makes you connect emotionally! It wrapped it's self around me and didn't let go. Brad Pitts acting was very well done like I state, he's come a long way with toning down his overreacting and I believe he is going to start winning Oscars as he changes over In age. Pitts a different actor, and man with a persona that I've been waiting for and waiting to see since Thelma and Louis. The cinematography of this movie was absolutely beautiful and it left me with a feeling of peace and tranquillity and a satisfaction in the end that Brad Pitt makes it back to earth and back to real life and can reflect on his mission and know where his priorities lay, in life and in the future. I wish he would've got up to embrace Liv Tyler in the end, but then again we have to leave something for the imagination. Overall I really liked it! I'd like to give it a nine but I'll stick with the high eight since I can't do that I'll give it a eight out of 10 but it was a great movie. I'm looking forward to more of Brad Pitt acting more like Brad Pitt. He did a great job and should be awarded. Thank you for reading my review",Ad Astra
1878,MarioV73,2 Stars for Visual Effect Only,2,10 December 2019,"On a budget of roughly $80 MIL and with cast consisting of Pitt, Jones, and other known actors, it is surprising they managed to put together a decently visually-rich space flick. However, as the polarizing reviews indicate, Ad Astra is nowhere close to being even a mediocre movie. A good movie would captivate the great majority of the viewers, but due to the extremely weak plot and numerous unanswered questions, this movie will leave you frustrated in lieu of satisfied. What were those odd situations? Why this or that? Where is the final explanation, or the twist? A good movie doesn't need lots of action, but really, add some meat and content to the flick rather than pauses and dull dialogue. Seriously, movies like these should not be released to the public as a mainstream film.

1887,LeonvanKamp,"Visually stunning, emotionally cold, utterly polarizing.",10,6 December 2019,"The protagonist of the film (masterfully played a Brad Pitt who at this point in his career really has nothing to prove), is one who is focused and committed to interstellar exploration. And like many of his real life counterparts, has sacrificed all else (namely meaningful human interaction) for that goal.It is the type of focus that made men like Neil Armstrong living legends (I would highly recommend last years' 'First Man' on that note), and it is the type of focus that makes Elon Musk's and Jeff Bezos' investments over the last few years somewhat baffling to most of the world and wholly relevant to the themes focused on in this film.The film plays on the dual edged blade of outer space; in that it has great allure and yet is wholly terrifying. It spell binds us in part because of the space race of the cold war (and the iconic mood landing), and in part because of science fiction (hard and soft) that have captured the imaginations of people for decades.Yet conversely, by the actual act of reaching into the void and by imagining of doing so, we have become more aware then ever just how lethal that allure can be.Ad Astra as a film understands all that, and delivers a thoughtful exploration of it's consequences. It deals with the psychological stress of being unfathomable distances away from home, from Earth. It deals with the very real fact that few are suited to it, and that those who are, often are trying to escape something of the typical Earth bound life.Ad Astra harkens to '2001 A Space Odessy', to Tarkovsky's 'Solaris', and 'Blade Runner' (particularly in relation to psychological testing). This is not 'Aliens' and it's certainly not 'Star Wars'. This is not an action film, it's slowly paced, it's intentionally confusing and detached, and it is certainly not trying to elicit that godawful tendency of applause in cinema. Like it's main character, it's desire for validation is highly repressed and complicated...It's a lonely film and suitably so, because it's dealing with the loneliest of all topics. For those of us who are bored to death of films with teams of heroes overcoming the odds and defeating exotically clad bad-guys with wildly predictable story arches, Ad Astra is a breath of fresh air. What cliches it does offer build towards and add to the emotional arch the main character reaches at the end, and it leaves just enough open to interpretation to allow the most optimistic and the most cynical of us to come away with feeling we have been on journey that mattered.In terms of realism, there are questions to be asked, and no one should be using to film to build on their knowledge or justify their actions in space (seriously, do not take cues here as to how to deal certain planet ring related activities). Yet no Sci-Fi film has ever been wholly realistic, and where physics do go out the window, the visuals do compensate. Then there's the action set piece with rovers on the moon, and whatever you may think of moon pirates (fits my perception of what colonising the moon will look like), car crash debris has never looked as fascinating.In terms of plot, it won't work for everyone (as no film does). And it definitely overreaches in terms of building up that classic 'save the world' plot, which is a shame because it's not the actual meat of the movie. However the midway excursions the film took are like weird overthought homages that were simultaneously brilliant (despite most critics vocal disagreement). Especially in terms of how it reshapes and reinforces the main characters' motivations. Ultimately, it is how the character deals with everything that happens in the film that gives it's ending meaning, not that some disaster has been saved by flawless heroes.Every detail of Ad Astra has clearly been lovingly and meticulously made, from the filmography, to the voice work, to the score (the soundtrack creates half the film's atmosphere), to the acting. It delivers on everything it promised in the build up preceded it, and for those that weren't paying attention to the type of film they were about to watch, I have no sympathy for the ultimately meaningless pocket change you spent on it (plus it's damn relevant, we are after all on the verge of this sort of space exploration being a big part of our reality).It's an intentionally polarizing and uncomfortable film. A film that clearly postulates all we have as humanity is each other, then shows you as that truth tears it's characters apart and remakes them. Something that is not original granted, but if we're truly honest with ourselves, is a type of emotional rebirth we all could do a bit more of in a world obnoxiously coming to terms with it's own immaturity. We might just be alone in this thing called existence, and given that, it can be hard to see space exploration as worth the effort. Nevertheless, it is what the film ultimately leaves the audience with, and it tries to convey that as a positive.Go roast a film that the mainstream audience adores if you feel the need to readdress what the film industry makes. Because I like millions of others will cherish this film for decades and hope the director James Gray, the entire team who made this film and anyone in the film industry with a similar outlook and attention to detail, continue to make films of this breath, scope and intelligence.",Ad Astra

Fantastic acting by him in this beautifully done techno-melodrama and by TLJ as well in what must surely be one of his last major roles in his long and successful life - not to mention the almost cameo by Donald Sutherland.All the acting in fact was spot on. Some new faces especially the Mars-bound Captain with the melodic and almost mesmerising speaking voice. The CGI is impeccable and something to behold - from the incredible scenes at the very outset, to the detailed space craft interiors and finally to the truly amazing vastness of space and the monstrously beautiful gas giants.The only bone I have to pick, and it's a small one, is the ridiculously short time it took for the craft to venture from Mars to Neptune - some 79 days if I recall correctly. The average distance between Mars and Neptune is 4.3 billion km, which over 79 days means an average velocity of 2.3 million km/hr or 630 km/second. I doubt we will have this sort of velocity at our fingertips in the next 50 years let alone the next century. The Parker Space Probe used gravity slings to get up to 95km/sec last year - from 95 to 630 is more than a quantum leap, using what is evidently brute force chemical tech. Also, when the Neptune bound space craft traverses Jupiter it does it far too quickly even taking into account perspective. These are areas where good science advisers would have come in handy.Notwithstanding, these are minor issues and this movie is a must see. Big screen only - when it's out on DVD do NOT see it on anything less than a 65 inch screen, that would be putting pearls before swine.",Ad Astra

-The Scenery, Setting and the Cinematography were all stunning. Pretty much what you'd expect from any movie set in outer space these days.-Brad Pitt was great, although his character felt a little bit two-dimensional to me, I think he did a fine job.-The Message was overall meaningful. It reminded me to some extent of Tuco's line in The Good, The Bad & The Ugly ""If you work for a living, why do you kill yourself working?""Stuff I disliked:
-The Movie felt flat. It has a message, and It wants to deliever that message through the Father-Son relationship, which in my opinion lacked depth. It felt like they were trying too hard to make the movie a Father-Son relationship movie that they forget it needed to make the audience connect to these characters. I guess the only way for me to enjoy the movie was by accepting the message the way they excuted it, as flat as it was (for me).-The Score was too generic for my liking and had nothing special about it. I was shocked when I saw in the end-credits that Max Richter was the composer, he usually composes very unique music that I always admire.I do not mind slow-paced movies at all so I did not find it boring like others pointed out.6.5/10",Ad Astra

Just straight garbage from beggining to end! A plot so simple and childish you would think it was a middle school project. 90% of the movie is random scenes one after the other with no correlation to each other whatsoever, mostlt just for shock value, and it didn't even succeed at that. It also constantly kept trying to be/sound deep with Pitt's monologue, but in reality it was just a cheesy way to put out what the movie's exposition was, and at the same time it was incredibly cringe worthy.

1928,ghostwhitetabby-28347,Heart Of Darkness In Space (Sort Of),5,25 June 2020,"Ad Astra is a lot of things, but most prominently it's a road movie set in Space. Numerous sequences of Brad moving through space from Earth to Mars to Neptune are beautifully and imaginatively realised. Sadly where the film falls down is lack of antagonism. I can't help feeling that many of these 'transitional' scenes couldn't have just been cut. Where the antagonism appears it's often tangential and incidental to the storyline, eg, the pirate moon lander chase.This has also clearly been written as a kind of Heart of Darkness in space. The Kurz in this case is even the father of Brad Pitt's character. Sadly too much of the film revolves around internalised conflict with much of the visual spectacle being provided by cool but irrelevant spacey stuff. (The weightlessness scrap with the fizzing oxygen cylinder impresses more than a bit, for example.) Compare this with that most famous of Heart of Darkness movie-takeoffs, Apocalypse Now. With AN you get progressive externalised conflict which mirrors the internalised conflict of Sheen's Capt Willard. Result: great movie you can watch time and time again.There's none of this - or at least very little - in Ad Astra. Worse, when Pitt eventually meets up with his longlost Dad after half a lifetime has passed the result is a brief unconvincing exchange of utter banalities and platitudes - almost like the scriptwriter kind of lost interest in this pivotal scene. Compare this with the electrifying final confrontation between Sheen and Brando in Apocalypse Now.Despite the above, this isn't a bad film. The spacey stuff is well photographed, and the journey to Neptune is just about compelling enough. Don't get me going on the return trip to Earth though which seems completely unbelievable. Ad Astra will probably be loved and watched regularly by the rocketheads, but as a sci-fi drama it fails to move.",Ad Astra

1933,neilvanzyl,Ad Astra Review,5,4 October 2019,"Brad Pitt is sent in search of his father near Neptune, after years of presuming him dead. What follows is an extremely slow trip into deep space with little to no cinematography to show it. Hoyte van Hoytema's wide shot of Pitt's initial fall from the transmitter tower showed a mastery of wide screen. However, for the remainder of the movie there was nothing that stood out at all. The journey to Neptune is shown by little more than Brad floating in isolation amidst the white of the spaceship. This was Brad Pitt's most stagnant role in a while. His portrayal of Roy McBride and his attempt at a compartmentalized, and disengaged protagonist left little to the imagination thanks to his robotic monologues throughout the movie. Providing Pitt with a counter part was one of the few times this movie managed to shine. Tommy Lee Jones as Pitt's father Clifford McBride, managed to provide some much needed emotion and enjoyment to the movie. His inability to come to grips with his failures and return to a home where there is nothing left for him provoking his suicide was one of the few scenes where you felt something that wasn't forced or mechanical. In the end, it's not enough to save the movie. You are left with a return journey home, floating through a vast galaxy with nothing but the spaceships interior to comfort you.",Ad Astra

It's a great movie imo.It's an interesting concept where in the future, when most countries already able to go to space and even having babies in Mars, and have this one over obsessed man who thinks to break the science world with searching another intelligent life and create this chaotic humanity drama.... this is a really interesting story.People keep saying this movie is ridiculous and makes no sense, i disagree. This movie makes much sense than Interstellar which is travelling through black hole without being spaghetti and some five dimensional future. I'm not saying Ad Astra is better than Interstellar, I'm just saying that Ad Astra is much much much more logical than the Interstellar.The monkey attack... maybe that happens when the wave did disturb the ship. Poor the Cpt. And the travelling using nuclear, it's actually makes sense by science. Only the problem in today is how we're gonna able to transport the nuclear, maybe in the future which is where this movie is set.Score are so great. Lighting. Cg.

1954,jwb9999999,Not worth the price of admission,3,25 January 2020,"I was looking forward to this quite a bit. It was very disappointing. First, it's basically a Brad Pitt monologue. You begin to wonder if other characters will ever speak, so there is not much in the way of character development for anyone else. If you are seeing this because you love Pitt, fine. But he is completely expressionless and emotionless throughout, so you are not really going to see any great ""acting"" here. Nor will you develop much in the way of warm feelings for him. As said in many other reviews, Pitt and Lee's characters are both mass murderer's, we are talking willing killers of people, which just doesn't seem to matter at all. And for the psychological father-son relationship ""drama"" that the film actually turns out to me, well, there's not any real drama. On the other hand, if you are not worried about the drama aspect and are seeing this because of the science fiction and space aspect, those are just as bad. All of the various laws of physics broken in this movie, mentioned in other reviews, are there, plus more. Using the shield to go through the rings of Neptune? Ok, but those particles are not going to big and chunky like that, nor grouped so closely. And when your shield hits one, you will change speed and direction (equal and opposite reaction), so you will no longer be headed on course for your ship. Not to mention that when he casually tosses the shield aside, that would change his course so completely that he'd never get close to the ship. The only good thing about the movie was the cinematography, and the opening scene of the movie was quite different and interesting. So I gave it 3 stars. Whatever the current rating of this movie is, subtract 3 stars for the Brad Pitt fans who rate it up, and subtract 1/2 star each for the fans of Sutherland and Jones also rating it up. That will put you closer to the truth of how this movie should be rated.",Ad Astra

Quests are often more about what happens along the way.This is most suited to a mature contemplative person considering life, what is true and of value.

The premise on paper is amazing but it falls flat on its face in execution. It starts off well with a big opening action scene that's visually stunning and...that's it. The rest of the film again has some great visuals but for the most part it's just long monologues from Brad Pitt that don't really make any sense in context. It seemed like at times that his character was losing his mind and I felt like I was too. I kept drifting off into my own brain because my daydreams were far more interesting than the plot. None of the scenes or set pieces made any sense to the storyline and there was a looming sense of doom that didn't really develop into anything. Character development was also non existent, I didn't care for the journey he was on or anyone else at all. Nothing was explained at any point, the Space monkey scene seemed odd in context, there was no urgency to any of it and the ""big twist"" i'd heard about in reviews didn't appear (or if it did, it was so rubbish that I missed the reveal) I was honestly expecting it to turn into a time travel movie where it turned out he was his dad in the past, which would have been ridiculous but way more interesting compared to what we ended up with.

I'm still stunned that they made a film that lasted 2 hours when absolutely nothing happens! Brad Pitt goes into space to look for his dad. That's the plot summary and that's exactly what happens. No excitement and no twists (apart from the monkeys that is -  by the way?!? - did someone realise the same thing that I did and say 'Hey, this is boring , we need to wake the audience up somehow...'??

I guess the writers have never heard what would happen to someone free-falling from 200 miles up. His terminal velocity would have smashed him into little itty bitty pieces - all over the landscape, yet he walks away?
We won't go into how he flew to Mars in just 7 days, using liquid propellant rockets that somehow managed to come to a dead stop - without a burn (which would have used up all remaining fuel) - to answer a distress call, then somehow get started again & still keep on schedule, or how he managed to climb onboard a rocket - during launch - with nobody noticing that he has sneaked on to the ultra-secret launch in the first place - sheesh, even the Apollo launches were festooned with cameras at every angle.
Then there is getting to Neptune in 71 days???? Really, guys? Not with liquid propellant, he won't. 71 months maybe - just - as Neptune is 2,700,000,000 miles away at the closest point so they would be travelling at 1,500,000 mph to do that (which comes in at about 417 miles per second)Plus the ending is a real waste of time too - there are all these dark hints about ET discovery throughout the film, but that all gets thrown out and it turns out to be all one loony creating these surges (which are never explained except for statements about 'anti-matter' which is yet more nonsensical garbage.

Even those living on Mars, Earth's nearest neighbor, need the comfort of total immersion rooms with surrounding images of Earth to keep from going stir crazy. The thesis is reinforced by the absurdity of baboons in a Norwegian space vessel, probably the focus of some kind of research project which has driven them insane. It is underlined by the necessity of astronauts needing frequent psychological evaluations to make sure they aren't going bonkers.If that isn't clear enough, one of the final lines of the movie makes the point that Earth, with God, is all that we have.

1980,TitoCinephile,Person preference and right timing,8,29 February 2020,"This movie is fundamentally about a culture and social encouragement to be detached and seek prosperity and answers out into the literal void of nothing while living as an inhuman cog in a machine. The end point SPOILERS is about how many of us use space and other destinations to project our dissatisfaction and unhappiness and do whatever we can to escape ourselves constantly without being able to see the insanity of our own unhappiness. The end is about the characters' exploration of basic humanity and how to be present with ourselves, with others, and finding fullfillment where we are. Not being a deranged machine, but finding out about what separates us from our humanity to begin with and how at the end many of the characters discover wonderful things during their journey and capture it but are unable or unwilling to appreciate it. Everything about this movie points to the characters' inability to be at all present or happy in their own lives first before exploring the outside. Your essential life as a human and then explore from there. Roy at the end discovers this by contrast to everyone else who he met along the way except for the few sane ones. The whole point of the movie is about being present to the moment and being appreciated of where you're at instead of being psychopathically projected into an insane level of escapism and thus turning into a machine rather than allowing your full humanity. The slowness of it I think partially represents the characters' inability to be fully aware of the wonders around them and instead trying o push through environments that are not truly inviting or supportive of sentient life.

Really, really, I'm all for psychological stuff, for films that take their time, for films that don't have a special moral and focus on the grace of the journey.
But really... And when I read what was saying James Grey in the said interview, I said to myself ""Wow, this guy is so lucid, intelligent. I was logical, profound"".
So how come ?
What's annoying, really, is that I felt that it could have been a good movie, so personnal. But the work is just not done. All the characters are still a depressed James Grey, for instance. James Grey and his problems. But where is the rest of James Grey ?
Having seen these two movies and read the interview, I felt convinced that James Grey was stuck and needed help.
What I saw is the first draft of a script, really, that was shot as it is written, with no rework on credibility, characters, or dialog.
Maybe seeing older movies from J.G. might reveal something to me. And I'll sure hope James Grey gets better, because he seems to have a very good mind, quite a bit of patience, of courage.

Cue some great set pieces across the solar system with visuals to match, although that is no surprise. What may surprise is the frequency of these set pieces. By no means is this an action film, and it often runs along at a tempered pace.Supporting the action and exciting visuals is quite a basic story. Brad Pitt is an astronaut following in his father's footsteps, who is called on a secret mission once his bosses have reason to believe his father may still be alive in the depth of space, after disappearing many years ago. Cue a lot of emotional reflection, narration, and exploration of this 'absent father' theme. And be ready, because you will get a lot of narration. Brad Pitt's character analyses himself within the film via psychological checkups, and then there is also further voice-over narration. At times this can prove to be almost redundant, and serves to spell out themes and character beats which the audience could reasonably infer for themselves.Yet despite all the narration and inner dialogue for Pitt's character, the themes never seem to be explored all that deeply. A lot of the dialogue is emotional with no real consequence or insight, which is a shame. To me, it seems that they put this voice over so that average audiences could stay on-board with what the film was trying to say and explore - but the very people who need that voice-over will likely find the film boring and slow anyway. Removing the voice-over could have rendered many of the films themes more subtly and, perhaps, more powerfully to individual viewers, as what the voice-over spells out often seems quite shallow and surface-level.Finally, when everything comes together towards the end, it all happens a little too conventionally. There is no interesting twist or revelations, and it seems the drama was meant to be the focus; but for me I never became quite so invested that the character drama itself provided a fulfilling ending.Overall, I have to commend the film for trying something a bit different, and I can see myself watching it again. The acting is great, everything is beautifully shot, the ideas are generally great, but it all never quite lives up to its own ambitions. Somewhere in here there is a much more emotional and timeless film, but I think currently it is too slow-paced and heady for some, and too straightforward and obvious for others.As either a straight action/thriller movie or a 2001-esque mindtrip, this could have worked better, but as it stands it exists in a strange middle ground where I can't see it completely appealing to very many.",Ad Astra

So Brad Pitt in a Sci-Fi movie what could go wrong. Just about everything! Brad pays an astronaut, the son of the most decorated astronaut in the history of the world (Tommy Lee Jones). Tommy Lee was last heard from somewhere around Neptune searching for intelligent life. Well he won't find any of it in this movie. The world is being pummeled by electrical pulses originating from (guess where) Neptune. Has Tommy Lee gone rogue like Marlon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now""? Has he teamed up with some alien life force to punish the world for putting him in this movie? Brad is enlisted by Space-Com to find out. Now you'd expect the action to really ramp up. Wrong! What you get is Brad in a space suit droning on in a monotone voice about God knows what. Have you ever been stoned and everything seemed to be moving in slow motion? You are stuck in this move. I mean the glaciers are melting faster then the pace of this movie.
I think the screen writer and director wanted to make another ""2001-A Space Odyssey"". Exploring eternal questions like why are we here? Where did we come from? What is the purpose of life? What they made instead was one of the most boring Sci-Fi films I have ever seen. And what the hell does ""Ad Astra"" mean anyway. Probably some geeky term I know nothing about.

Brad Pitt has father issues. His father has psychological issues. The motives and philosophies of Tommy Lee Jones weren't even interesting like in the movie Sunshine by Danny Boyle.
Basically there's a for profit space travel company which has scientifict and military projects. They send an exploratory mission to Neptune headed by Tommy Lee Jones(TLJ) (Brad Pitt's Dad). The mission lost contact and went silent 20 odd years ago and the public were informed that the mission failed and the brave astronauts died heroes. Turns out, almost all of the crew were homesick, and TLJ decides that the mission is more important than the people so he kills everyone on board. Meanwhile, the space company gets to know this but in fear of a scandal they keep everything secret. Also meanwhile the equipment onboard TLJs spacecraft malfunctions in its antimatter core or whatever and it starts sending pulses of electrical surge across the solar system which may end the world and the solar system. So Brad is tasked to go to Mars and make an emotional plea to his presumed dead( but not really cuz the spacecom know he's alive) dad to deal with the engine thingy via a special laser comm rig. Turns out all they wanted was for TLJ to communicate back so that they can locate him and nuke him and his ship. Brad discovers this and even though he is tasked to go home now because he's too emotional, he sneaks onboard the nuke ship and ""accidentally"" kills the three hostile crew members onboard (Sins of the father) and flies to Neptune himself. Where he places the nukes in the ship and takes his dad out of the ship despite protests. He's also now stuck in space because his small vessel which was supposed to take them to Brad's bigger space ship has drifted off. But not really cuz Brad has his compressed gas propellers. But TLJ wants to be left in space cuz he's like that, and Brad is forced to leave and he pulls a captain America by flying through an asteroid ring while using a piece of TLJs old ship as a shield and reaches his own ship and flies the way home using the nuke blast as a propellant.It was awful.
There was no point to the movie. I believe the editing sucked because there were so many characters who didn't have any background, like we don't know what is up with so many characters and why they did what they did. There are space pirates and we aren't given much info there, there's Ruth Negga her character's backstory was basically narrated in two lines. There's a rescue scene of another craft which I didn't get the point of other than some action to relieve us if looking at Brad's face.Poor direction

Also, in what time does this take place? Not that it matters but the government did send him on a commercial moon flight, so....
I seriously believe I've lost IQ points because they had me believe you could travel through space relatively easy and be able to find a rogue spaceship near Neptune. Oh, and use a nuclear blast (in space) to shove you back to Earth.
I rate it a 2 simply because of Brad's fall to earth from the antenna; that was shot relatively good.I know it's Brad Pitt but does that mean automatic nominations? Talk about Hollywood privilege. If there is someone who can explain to me why I'm wrong, please do so. If so, I may try to watch it again. Key word is ""try"". I doubt I'd waste another 2 hours.Oh, as far as cinematography goes?

And when he finds who he was looking for, the person has been living on the space station for 30 years? So, he had enough food and oxygen for that long of a time?

2022,denislavg,An emotional and visually-stunning journey into the psyche.,7,27 September 2019,"Not especially surprised with all the internet 'scinetists' bashing the film because they didn't find the science believable. Personally, I don't presume to know everything there is to know about science or what the makers of the film intended when constructing a particular scene. I'm there to see the story that the film is telling me and get to know the characters involved in it.To that regard, Grey and Pitt take us on a journey of self-discovery and emotional catharsis for the main character who searches for the truth about himself by crossing the vastness of space to find his father. This is a story about connection and love, learning to let go and to live with one's mistakes. If you come into the film expecting a 'space procedural' about terraforming Mars or investigating the moons of Saturn, you might be disappointed. Grey gives a peak of this version of the world, but many of its internal logics are mostly left for us to imagine. The focus is on the character of Roy and how he changes, what he discovers about himself at the end of his journey. The cinematography is gorgeous, with vibrant colors, stark contrasts and evocative lighting, as well as spectacular visual effects depicting a stark, but gentle rendition of outer space. Pitt's performance is contained but emotionally complex which anchors the film to his character and motivations, an aspect which would have been lost with a lesser actor.Overall, I found the film ot be a wonderful movie-going experience.

I just feel the overall feel was very obviously inspired by movies such as Apocalypse now, Blade Runner, Alien, all some of my favorite movies, but it lacked just that real original flare. When you set out to make a movie there needs to be some risk and artistic originality, not banking on a collaboration of previous safe techniques. Casting fro me also let it down. Brad was overall un-interesting, a bit wooden. And Tommy Lee Jones was just Tommy Lee Jones, these actors have done so many roles they just couldn't really offer any new from them. I do appreciate these guys though , they have done exceptional roles before. One other thing that ticked me off was some of the cinematography at times. Long CU of faces and heaps of shaky cam during action scenes that were quite disorientating. Just give me some clean wides. The story was at times predictable.

1) What the hell were those ""space antennas"" at the beginning? They are never explained, yet obviously a major and expensive project. 2) Why go to the Moon, let alone the far side, if your ultimate destination is Mars? It's more energy-efficient to go straight from LEO orbit to Mars. 3) Why land on one side of the Moon, at a major base there, and take off again from the opposite side? Again, waste of energy. And if you are going to the other side of the moon, it would be far faster, safer, and again more energy efficient to take a short rocket hop than a trio of ground rovers. 4) A ship heading to Mars in 19 days--hence at extraordinary speed--cannot just ""stop"" and rendezvous with another spaceship going in any other direction. In fact, ""stopping"" doesn't mean anything in this context, period. 5) Why go to Mars just to send a radio transmission? You can do that easily from Earth. 6) A radio transmission from Mars to Neptune would take around a half day to get a reply, not 5 minutes. 7) If you go all the way to Neptune, why park just on the opposite side of the rings from your final destination, making the final leg unnecessarily difficult? Actually, if the ships are on opposite sides of the rings, then their complete orbits must cross through the rings, with ensuing damage twice each orbit. 8) Why use an atom bomb to destroy the other ship, when all you need to do is blow up the antimatter containment vessel? The antimatter will then react with anything nearby and destroy whatever is left. 9) A little push from a spinning radar boom would not be enough to push an astronaut through the rings, let alone accurately; nor is a nuclear explosion going to propel your ship back to earth, let alone accurately. 10) No explanation of how a teeny tiny ship around Neptune could be creating ""power surges"" which dramatically affect Mars and Earth. Antimatter doesn't begin to account for that. 11) The only explanation for why the Lima project is in the outer solar system was to make observations ""outside the heliosphere."" But Neptune is nowhere near the edge of the heliosphere.II. Plot.
1) Donald Sutherland's character Pruitt doesn't do anything important. Yeah, he gives Roy a secret he wasn't supposed to, but not enough information for him to really know what to do. 2) There's no explanation of how they know the father is still alive, or is likely to be responsive to a message from his son but not from the rest of earth space command pleading with him to stop the power surges. 3) Actually, our protagonist Roy (Pitt) doesn't do anything either; his father doesn't respond to the message as far as we know, and the crew which Roy killed (accidentally, to be sure, but after taking a grave and needless risk) would have done *exactly* what he ended up doing if he had stayed put. 4) Nor does his father Clifford (Jones) do anything, well, again, other than kill a bunch of people, and gather information on alien planets which an unmanned probe could easily have done, information which shows them to have no life...so his search failed. In short, no one in the movie does anything good or important. Roy doesn't even save his father, or meaningfully reconnect with him; Clifford first agrees to come back to Earth with Roy, but apparently insincerely as he tries to kill them both in space--why, as there surely were many ways he could have laid a trap and killed them both on board his ship? And why do that, if you want your data on alien planets to be collected and preserved? 5) Why lunar pirates at all? But if you have lunar pirates protecting or stealing from each others' mines, why in the hell would a team of them go after a trio of lunar rovers? Do they think they'd be carrying gold or something? 6) The space baboons were just dumb, period. But on top of that, it makes no sense for the hero on a special secret mission to explore the derelict craft and put himself in unnecessary danger. And how the hell did they break a space helmet? Those things are tougher than baboon teeth I think. And why would a spaceship have the double mission of biological research on space baboons and exploring an asteroid? You could do the former in LEO, combining the two makes no sense. 7) A bunch of hints go nowhere. Half-way through I thought they just might salvage this wreck by revealing that what we are seeing isn't what is happening; the increasing coincidental parallels between father and son's lives, the virtual reality on the walls in Roy's Martian room, the suggestion that Clifford might have contacted alien life, all hinted at some weird twist, possibly making the journey into some mental test, a replaying of the father's journey, or something even stranger. Spoiler: no such luck. No aliens come along to explain all the unexplained and unexplainable science goofs and plot devices. 8) We are never even told if Clifford got let alone replied to Roy's message; the secretive CIA-types act like he did and are keeping this a secret, but we never get the slightest hint of why, either from them or from Clifford, so this is all just a red herring with no purpose except to make Roy suspicious of the other operatives. In fact, the enormous secrecy and mistrust they have for Roy obviously backfires on them because it incentivizes him to sneak on board the ship to Neptune, resulting in many pointless deaths.I am disgusted by comparisons between this movie and 2001 or Solaris; Ad Astra doesn't deserve to lick the bootheels of such great works. Some directors are producing fine SF these days; Gravity and The Martian, while they each have some scientific errors in their premises, are still miles ahead of this one. This movie tries simultaneously to be an action-adventure, a moving family drama, and a contemplative spiritual mediation. But it fails utterly in all of these aspirations.",Ad Astra
2047,Nplus1,Almost an insult to the genre,3,19 September 2019,"I'm a big fan of Sci-fi movies, when they actually make sense...
As visually impressive as it might be at times, Ad Astra tries to be a psychological drama set in space. Only that it fails as a psychological drama and it's almost an insult to the space Sci-fi genre.You clearly see a movie failing when a grandiose or highly abstract topic revolves around the personal stories of a character or two, it makes it feel ""cheap"" or sloppy (yes, I'm thinking Interstellar also). If you place the main story in any other setting, some details change but the main idea can be left untouched, so is this a Sci-fi movie? Is this a space movie? And if it's not, why is it wrapped up like one?As some reviews describe, the main story is unconvincing at best, with a very sloppy script. Decisions feel forced for the sake of suspense, the journey totally predictable, there is no depth in the character construction.
However the worse part, which I consider almost an insult to the genre, is the message that can be read between the lines: ""believe and do not question"". It's almost like a bored priest in the Vatican decided to sabotage a Sci-fi movie.

First, the good stuff. They apparently spent a small fortune on sets and some CGI. And I've always liked Tommy Lee Jones. Fun to see that, although a waste of TLJ's talents. But that's about it.
The plot was ponderous and somewhere, very early on in production, someone said, ""let's just forget the science and make stuff up as we go to fit the plot.""I'll give one example (minor spoiler). They use booster rockets and traditional thrust to go from the Moon to Mars, but decide to stop en-route to investigate a mayday call. Hello? How does one stop? And then how does one start again without the boosters?

2061,JohannesBlack,A secular odyssey of paternal desires,8,8 October 2019,"If the genre of science fiction repeatedly finds itself, as the title offers, looking per aspera ad astra - from the Latin, ""through hardships to the stars"" - director James Gray returns the gaze, turning instead to the onlooker themselves. Brad Pitt is subject to an almost painterly study, his emotional muteness viewed with an intensity that rivals Milos Forman's scrutiny to the expressive script of Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - the contours of skin, every facial tick, slur, or pause, as fathomless as the gulf between planets. Ad Astra knowingly plays into the traditions and grammar of space opera, its thrilling ambition met with typical unoriginality. Opening in the ""near future"" - its blazing red typography somewhat Bladerunner-inspired - Gray paves a transcendent, Conradian journey that staggers from planet to planet, eventually settling on the blue expanse of Neptune (a rarely used, planetary set piece). It is a story of fathers and sons, or rather fatherless sons, whose Freudian longings for something more dismantle the stability of their present. Space becomes a harbour for such internal damage, a site for the dispossessed - the lunar plane, for example, a focal point of territory warfare - which, over the course of its two-hour runtime, sees its drifting astronauts yearn for firmer groundings. Inseparable from prior instalments in the sci-fi genre, Interstellar, Gravity and Sunshine the most immediate examples, Ad Astra's voltage inspires a sense of wonder and uncomplicated mystery with each passing scene.Brad Pitt continues his year of acclaimed roles with Major Roy McBride, the abandoned son to famed Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones) - ""the first man to the outer solar system (...) a pioneer"" - whose career in astronomics seeks to leave the shadow of, and honour, his inherited paternal legacy. In the wake of a series of paralysing, anti-matter surges, Roy is employed by U.S. Space Command to investigate, an operation that leads him to make contact with the resurrected ghost of his father - long since considered dead. (Much like Schrödinger's cat in a steel chamber, the father is neither dead nor alive, at first, as much a figment of imaginings as he is of reality.) Clifford had originally headed the ""Lima Project"", oriented in its quest to find extra-terrestrial life, whilst in orbit of Neptune, though it had since been ruled defunct by its radio silence. Such an allure, as originally sketched in Tarkovsky's psychodrama Solaris (and its later 2002 remake), opens its protagonist to an intellectual and philosophical risk. In space, no one can hear you scream ... or meditate on life, you might also argue.It is during Pitt's introspective musings, as captured by a roughly-whispered voiceover (in the style of Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life or To the Wonder), that director James Gray distinguishes Ad Astra from the current trend of mainstream blockbusters. Re-treading his arthouse/euro-indie roots, Gray requires more than banal thrills from his audience, daring us to wait out his silences, carefully hold each word, and allow each moment to contribute to a far greater whole. ""What did he find out there, in the abyss?"" Roy asks hesitantly, a question posed as much to himself as it is to a wider community. Ad Astra, moreover, is not the first time its leading star, Brad Pitt, has acted alongside the use of voiceover. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, Andrew Dominik's 2007 revisionist epic, also engages a similar effect, the dramatization of the titular killing guided with a storyteller-like, third-person narration. If to this narrative it felt supercilious, it can be argued that Gray is more explicitly successful (with the occasional laughable moment) - ponderous thoughts carried with the gradually drawn cinematography of Hoyte van Hoyten, resting finally on day-old stubble or the wrinkles in the corner of eyes. It is a wonderful and highly satisfying effect.""I've got my wife and children and they're great, and I can find plenty of joy in that,"" Gray assured in an interview for Digital Spy, discussing the possibility of encountering alien life, ""(but) to rely on false Gods, the idea that there's these little green men out there that'll either save us or eat us, to me that's more horrifying than having to rely on other people."" It is by questioning our reliance on myth and conjecture that we are forced, when watching Ad Astra, to re-focus our ideals, if for a moment - the fictions of space exploration revealed to be simply that, fictitious, especially when we come to realise that no other life accompanies our voyage. In this case, and by pulling the carpet from beneath our feet, Ad Astra might be said to be offer a family drama more than anything else, a movement away from cheap fantasy and instead turning inward, looking far closer, far more intently at ourselves. Clifford is a relic of this old ambition, a symbolic marker of what could be achieved, and his son a force to subdue this misanthropy, a lens by which to correct the dreams of another. ""The enemy up here is not a person or a thing. It's the endless void,"" a sentiment captured in the recurring image of a helmet visor - at once reflecting space and, again, faintly revealing the profile of its astronaut.Ad Astra is a beautifully simple picture that clothes itself with sustained philosophic reflection. If you choose to watch it, you must look past these obscuring elements to the universality of its narrative - I certainly found myself in several places. Gray undoubtedly built the apparatus of its narrative whilst looking to rival the same grandeur as Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and yet, unlike the top-heavy nostalgia of films such as Interstellar, Ad Astra manages to subtly navigate its source material, achieving an effective counterweight to its intelligent agenda. Spectacle is found equally in the dazzling set pieces as it is the lyrical wonderings of Roy McBride, a wonderfully unstrained performance from Brad Pitt. It is possible that some of the ideas and their realisation here will be usurped, possibly even bettered, with later additions to the genre, but what we are given, nevertheless, is a pure example of what the wonders of cinema can achieve.",Ad Astra

Hell it would have worked as a straight ahead save the world story. But instead we are provided with barely luke warm morsels of any of these themes. In fact the first two themes above are casually tossed off in one line near the end. It was actually a bit embarrasing to watch that level of amateurish writing. And yes some of the science was increadibly silly for 2019. But I can easily cope with such sillines if the story is good. It just didn't work for me at the story level.,Ad Astra
2092,wkronz,"A Beautiful Journey, Into the Deepest Depths of Space",10,1 October 2019,"With Ad Astra, James Gray makes his first big budget film, and in doing so, delivers a powerful, exhilarating space epic, that's easily one of the best films of the decade.
The story here is simple, yet quite effective. In the eerily plausible future, astronaut Roy McBride is summoned after a large surge of energy coming from deep space, nearly decimates the Earth. The revelation that Roy's father, who was lost on a mission to Neptune 16 years before, may still be alive, compels Roy to venture forth and find the truth. The simplistic story of a son searching for his lost father is resonant, and incredibly explored through the farthest reaches of our galaxy.
The films grappling with themes of family, and loss are effectively mixed with an insightful, almost frightening look into our fate in the universe, and whether or not we're even alone.
Elevating the story even further, are the powerful performances. Brad Pitt, tops his role from earlier this year as Cliff Booth in an entirely different manner. His beautifully reserved, yet poignant performances lifts the film to its astronomical heights. Others such as Ruth Negga and Tommy Lee Jones shine.
Ad Astra also boasts some of the best technical aspects I've seen yet. The sound editing is meticulate, and immersive, the visual effects are brilliantly rendered, and the production design provides a grounded, plausible vision of the future. The direction boasts wonderful camerawork full of dazzling tilts, pans, and immaculate long takes. Max Richter and Lorne Balfe compose an enchanting, hypnotic score, that provides plenty of emotion. The most impressive of these technical aspects is by far the cinematography. Hoyte van Hoytema's work here solidifies him as one of the best working cinematographers. Each and every shot is so gorgeously composed, with nuanced uses of lighting, colors, and outstanding framing.
Bleak, and desolate like the hazy cosmos that encompass it, Ad Astra succeeds on multiple levels, providing an investing character drama, and an insightful look into humanity's future in space, leaving you thinking long after leaving the theater.",Ad Astra

Moon ... and Mars which has a very big base of human !!!he must go to the moon and take a rocket to mars !!! as if the plants just around the corner or at the end of street !!then to get things more action , the moon now has some kind or terrorist or space Pirates !! which we don't know from where they come or what they need !
then he reaches his father in far away plant and he left him with no reason !!to be fair ... space images , planets , moon and sky shot very well ... if it is a documentary movie about space and moon it will get at least 7 r 8 out of 10but with this story and acting no more than 2 out of 10",Ad Astra

This film is absolutely a slow burn, so if that's not what you enjoy, this film may not be for you.

Unfortunately, ~10 minutes later, we know ~exactly~ what is going to happen. An hour and a half later, after that indeed happens, we still have no clarity regarding why. Spoiler alert: the plot literally drifts off into space.The film initially lays out many intriguing plot directions- a destructive signal from Neptune; an antimatter system gone awry; a rogue astronaut who was once a hero. There is a lunar shootout, which just sort've begins and ends. Alas, none of these plot lines leads to any sort of denouement; in the end, the lead character simply closes it all down, and Ad Astra goes ad terram.That's it.Honestly, I would've preferred that Ad Astra end ~one hour in; my imagination could've completed it far more creatively.

I understand this is probably just not what people expected when they think of sci-fi, but that doesn't mean it can't be a great film. As I've said, Bard Pitt is in one of his best roles to date and delivers the best performance of the year SO FAR. The movie is slow, tense, emotional, and tragic. If you liked Ryan Gosling in First Man (2018) and Blade Runner 2049 then you will love this. Pitt's character is quiet and hesitant, but so, so alone. I don't know what it is about space films but they seem to handle loneliness better than most. My point is that it's not a blockbuster and it's not trying to be. Its just a story about a lonely man ""looking forward to the day my solitude ends"". It's beyond words, and I think that's its strength.",Ad Astra

As i watched it seeing the more top named actors being in it made it an all star cast and that is the kiss of death for any movie.

Way out there, we discover more about ourselves. That's the beauty.On the sci-fi part, this movie did a fantastic job with the effects and creating a sense of the future. There is a great sci-fi journey here and some scary surprises along the way. The outposts on the other moons/planets was perfect in my option of building the world. Some reviews are calling it out on certain scientific inconsistencies, but that's in every sci-fi move you'll ever see. I actually appreciate where the movie took us and how it took us there.On the personal part, this movie really affected me.

Over a 100 things that can go wrong in the hostile, cold void of space but for some crazy unknown reason they choose pirates on the moon and killer baboons in a space lab for the conflicts. I think maybe the screenwriters were drunk when they came up with these ideas. Of course as per title of review they rarely showed orbital mechanics correctly (see Expanse show for how to do it on screen correctly). But what really ruined it for me was the comic book return to Cepheus which involved the protagonist taking a metal plate and using it as a shield to go through one of the ice/rock rings of Neptune. Looked like Capt America. Totally ignored the physics of an object hitting the metal and causing rotational spin. Plus the sparks flying off it when there is no oxygen to create any combustion/sparks. It was what I would expect in a super hero movie and you know to suspend belief and enjoy it for what it is but not in what should be a serious space thriller. I want more movies of the near future in space but such tripe as this movie really hurts the overall genre and what I expect to be it's ultimate failure may cause other studios to take a pass at producing more space thrillers.

You will feel the solitude, the loniless, the stoicsm and patience of Brad Pitt's character. The soundtrack complimented the visual aspects of the movie well and made you fell like you are along for the journey.
I won't give anything away, but this movie is more of a not too distant future telling of real life space exploration.

The nuance of space also okay where austronots suppose to be always calm and emotion stabilized.
And then come to the story, this where this movie fall apart. Some reviewer said 'what is the point of this movie', 'absurd', 'unrealiatic' these all reviews unfortunately is true. I just expect the director add twist in final climax of the movie, as they found maybe alien or something.

There are a few space related set pieces but for me this had overtones of ""Arrival"" in that the story was the key element.Clearly influenced by this, 2001 and shot with a pace and style of the Blade Runner sequel this isn't for your Star wars diehards.This film is a Pitt vehicle and he does not disappoint. I think this is his most mature performance to date. There is depth to his performance and the emotion of the story builds within him slowly but with genuine feeling. Lee Jones plays little and could really be any veteran actor and Sutherland for his brief appearance as always grabs and holds your attention. It's a shame the story didn't allow longer screen time for him.I thought at first the pace was a tad slow but after thinking about it, it is spot on. A film that makes you think about the primary relationship between the main characters as the film progresses does so in a style and with subtleties missing from a lot of films. Pitt shows depth and style missing in his recent past and whilst the film is unlikely to trouble the academy beyond glorious technical achievements, Pitt is worthy of a nomination.Go in with an open mind and watch carefully and this will be considered a satisfying few hours.",Ad Astra

If you want details, check out the _Science vs Cinema_ guy on YouTube and other such.Yes, the bar for scientific realism is higher when the story takes place in the near future rather than a couple centuries hence. Yes, I expect the suits at the top of the ladder to demand sometimes unrealistic script changes to make the movie more marketable.Looks like this time, the writers strolled around the bar, whistling nonchalantly, right from the start.I found some of the plot and character points poorly communicated.

Very well done...well...That aside my big problem with this movie are the Characters. Especially Brad Pitts character, which was in my opinion terrible written. I got it, the character had a difficult childhood and doesn't trust anyone anymore...but how many other characters does have this problem too. (Iron Man, Batman, etc). An they are still interesting, because they are written in a way that the audience have fun with them and cares about them. And THAT was the problem. I never really cared about the Brad Pitt character, neither did I for the Tommy Lee Jones character, especially because I never really 100% believed their father-son relationship. For that, I just wished they showed maybe a flashback in which you can see them together, in a good or a bad situation.

2162,rw-15604,Prententious disappointment,5,22 September 2019,"This is one of the occasions where the producers have managed to secure a big budget and good actors but failed miserably when it comes to the screenplay. The story is a pretentious attempt at recreating the feeling of 2001, the enigma of Solaris and the stunning visuals of the Martian, yes, even the awful Gravity, and failing miserably.Apparently the story itself was deemed so important that considerations about physics, the ""hard SF"" that Clarke excelled at and later Weir managed to repeat which gave us 2001 and the Martian, was considered secondary to the story telling. Unfortunately they didn't have the sense to keep it out of the screenplay so a lot of the movie still relies on this really really bad physics (way too many instances to list here), continuously chafing at the viewer's sensibilities.Ignoring the... very strange pseudo-scientific basis of the story then... well, It's very hard to understand the motivations of the characters. They waver between some kind of blind loyalty to the space agency (so strange!) and personal relationships with no clear motivation for either one or the other. The endlessly recurring psych evaluations and self-administered amateur psycho analysis sessions in combination with the spoken narrative of the internal mental process of the main character are bewildering to say the least. The final meeting between Pitt and Jones only makes sense after having been worn down by the previous two hours of strange storytelling.Here and there completely unnecessary action sequences have been injected (forcefully) in a desperate attempt to keep the attention of the viewers as the director apparently must have realised that the goal of recreating the riveting sense of mystery in 2001 simply wasn't there.No. Save your money.

These must be some thugs from Africa or something that decided to build there own rockets and space-buggies to fly to the moon and, for no reason at all, attack and kill all the other people there? A trip to Mars takes 19 days, so that avarages about 400.000 miles an hour. And oh yeah at these speeds, when you want to do a stopover to fight some spacemonkeys, it is not a problem sir! On Mars there also are big undergroud lakes in which there are ropes to pull yourself to just underneath spacecrafts. And when the spacecraft takes off you can climb into it last-minute and while it accelerates you walk upto the cockpit to say hi to the rest of the crew. Neptune takes about 79 days to reach which avarages about 1.4 million miles an hour, in the near future, good to know! Neptune by then also has parking spaces for space-ship, and you can just jump from the one to the other. And an efficient way to get your spaceship into the right position and speed to go back to earth is using a nuclear explosion of course, why didn't I think of that pfff.

On one hand, this film was overall amazing: Brad Pitt and his cos-stars' (mainly Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland) acting was amazing, the cinematography was great, all the shots of space were beautiful and the sci-fi plot was believable enough. There were amazing scenes with great dialogue and i really fell inlove with James Gray's directing.
Now, on the other hand, every once in a while there were these extremely mediocre scenes that clearly only happened to move the plot forwards without much work. If this movie was overall worse, these probably wouldn't affect me as much, but when in the middle of such a great production there are characters like Ruth Negga's that only existed to move the main plot along and plot points taken out of a straight to dvd bootleg version of this movie, it's really jaring.
This film coudl've been one of my rare 10s, but it had too many plot devices that were just staright out lazy for me to even give it a solid eight. So, I still recommend watching it, but be prepared to be disapointed once in a while.",Ad Astra

He shows nearly no emotion and gives us very little to care about him at any moment in the film, especially the climax, which was a huge miss. You can't really tell if the conflict within Roy (the main charcter) is really solved, due to the extreme lack of emotion.(Spoilers after this point)I teased at this earlier, but the climax is very weak. The slow build to the end is not justified what-so-ever and the inner conflict of Roy is ""solved"" in what feels like no time at all and you're left thinking to yourself, ""So what? Is he just over this? He just met again with his father and then he kills himself"". Basically you're left with no reason to care.In nearly every other aspect, it's perfect.

I should note my ""worst films"" are not old 1950's B movies but modern highly budgeted movies with major talent that simply turned into horrible disappointments.I gave this one star only for the visuals. Everything else is far below a 1950's B movie.One thing you can count on for the movie is watching Brad Pitt stare... and stare... and stare... a LOT.Dialog? ... there isn't any.Acting? ... you'll find more in a 2nd grade school play.Story? ... there isn't one.The science? ... Flash Gordon serial episodes of 1936 have more science than this movie.SpoilersThe opening has a free standing ""tower"" that is in not tethered in space and remains in the influence of gravity at a height that could never exist structurally. Brad falls but does not manoeuvre away from the tower before deploying his chute which gets shredded with falling debris... something any remotely experienced skydiver would do.Space pirates in ""black"" outfits using ""black"" moon rovers attacking three ""white"" moon rovers carrying astronauts in ""white"" space suits. Who are they? What do the want? ... gotta have a car chase even if it's on the moon and has absolutely no point whatsoever!... and when will movie makers EVER learn there is no sound in space? ... well, except of course the blazing guns of moon pirates.Seems like low gravity doesn't exist inside the utterly absurd moon station.... and will movie makers EVER learn materials to build space habitats are hugely expensive to get to the moon so there are no high ceilings or long hallways of meaningless pillars where space is at a premium.For a moon space port of such magnitude to exist it will take us far into the future but instrumentation, vehicles and, apparently... common sense have all remained in shuttle erra technology.Brad Pitt's rogue dad, ostensibly responsible for cosmic electromagnetic bursts from a project near Neptune has managed to live without replenished food or water for 20 or so years, after killing his crew. Like his son, he stares a lot too and has nothing intelligent to say.Instead of going through the very wide gaps between the 7 rings of Neptune apparently the clever thing to do is risk everything to go right through the rings.It just goes on and on and on with stupidity like this, as other aware reviewers have noted. This movie is sufferably appealing to morons who never finished school, have no life and have zero understanding of even the most fundamental elements of space science... and this in an age we are actually in space.The most sickening thing about movies like this is it was financed with over $87 million and returned $127 million globally, making a profit of $40 million to inspire more ignorant garbage like Ad Astra.Do NOT pay to see this movie and make sure you are in need of rest if you watch it because you are going fall asleep.At least the actors didn't have to worry about remembering their lines... there weren't any.",Ad Astra

It is an epic film poem. Think '2001 Space Odyssey' or 'Interstellar' - well maybe it lacks some of the visual splendour for the former and heart-tug of the latter but in its way 'Ad Astra' asks just as deep questions, questions that these films don't, about life.

The movie suffers from clunky dialogue, a flimsy premise and terrible pacing. While visually stunning and well produced, most of the film lacks any sort of tension or sense of purpose.What really bugs me about this film however, is that you have to ask what is the point it is trying to make? Because if it about a relationship between a father and his son, it is painful how badly it was done. Maybe it was about finding other intelligent life? Yet even with this, you come away with the feeling that the movie is trying to tell us to stop imagining what is 'up there' and focus more about what is 'down here.' Part of what draws people to sci-fi media, and astronomy is what it inspires in our imagination, how it makes us feel part of something larger. It is a humbling experience. It is an experience that makes us want to know more. Yet this movie seems to suggest the opposite, and you come away feeling as if it glossed over all of that to tell a very weak story about a son and his father.The protagonist we are led to believe is almost a prodigy of self-control, but it makes him incredibly difficult to like because he has absolutely no personality. Nobody in this movie seems to care about anything. Even the 'antagonist' for lack of a better term is pretty chill about everything that is happening.The acting was good, I think Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones did well with the dialogue they were given.

This is why I say this movie isn't for everyone. If your a fan of visuals, sound design and other stuff that isn't just action you will probably get the same Enjoyment as I had. But if you like fast paced action movies and you come into the theater expected this you will be disappointed.Brad Pitt does amazing as always in this movie. His character arch though out the movie is really good but since this is spoiler free I won't go into details. He does voiceovers but without the voiceovers it would be hard to get emotionally attached to his character and his problems.The only real criticism I can think of for this movie is how inconsistent gravity is. There is a scene were he goes from going really fast in space to pretty much not moving at all.The visuals and the color palette in this movie is amazing. It's like a moving painted. From the light reflecting from his helmet to the shots of space this is probably the best visual movie of this year. Every location has a different look to it so you won't get confused and every set looks beautifulThis movie isn't super scientifically accurate but it didn't really bother me to much but I can see why I may bother some.So In conclusion if you go to this movie expecting a fast paced action movie in space you will most likely be disappointed but if your a big fan of other stuff inside of films and not just the action you will probably enjoy it as much as me.",Ad Astra

The narrative, meant to delve into Brad Pitt's character's troubled past with his father, instead sounded like angsty teenage journal entries. The movie introduced characters simply as plot devices to help this boring movie trudge along.

2204,regular_user,An ultra-realistic sci-fi epic masterpiece!!!,10,16 October 2019,"Ad Astra is one of just a few high-budget Hollywood movies that explores the increasingly popular and exciting theme of near-future human space exploration in a realistic and serious light (other examples of such films being The Martian and Interstellar). Ad Astra tops both in my opinion. Ad Astra not only explores the near-future, but it actively transports you there, with its realistic characters, realistic and vast setting, a realistic but highly engaging plot and absolutely stunning visuals. No unnecessary shoot-outs, no cliche love triangles, no sex scenes and nothing too ludicrous sci-fi wise; this movie instead sticks to hard realism, even time wise, and focuses on much deeper themes such as the psychology of space travel, the human condition and the difficult questions humanity must face regarding our position in this universe.I can't recommend this film enough. While it is packed with action, its gradual pace, uninterrupted serious tone and lack of the usual Hollywood fight scenes, love triangles etc. mean that this film won't be for everyone. This film is only to be consumed by those who love space and who can appreciate a deep, meaningful and highly immersive film experience.The production, CGI, camera shots and acting (especially by Brad Pitt) are deserving of as many Oscars as possible.I will solemnly stand by this masterpiece and call it the most underrated film of 2019. Ad Astra had me glued to the screen for the whole duration and left me speechless when it ended. It restores my faith in humanity that there are directors/writers out there making films like this.",Ad Astra
2205,stewartkaty,World-class acting and gorgeous cinematography,10,7 November 2019,This is a cinematographic masterpiece. Glorious scenes and exquisite visual story-telling. An incredible performance by every single actor and actress. I watched with awe from start to finish. This is art in its truest form.Screenplay: there are people leaning towards criticizing the final editing. I think many scenes were cut to reflect longevity requirements in cinemas but this doesn't affect the story at all. Many things happen in the background and are briefly mentioned in lieu of having at least 7-10 more scenes. The movie doesn't suffer from this at all as it is very easy to follow the story-line from the point of view of the main character.Do not miss this movie!,Ad Astra

The story is thin to say the least, goes no where, and it all culminates in a non-ending.. and did I mention the science (or lack of???).. honestly, flying through the rings of a planet with a piece of scrap metal he removed with a hood-pin and just happening to meet up with his spacecraft.??!!?

2213,drinnable,Checkpoints and the lack of time,8,3 December 2019,"I really liked the movie, but what I somehow disliked was the lack of information about the time. I would have wanted to know how fast they were traveling from Earth to Mars through the ""checkpoints"". That about the checkpoints I sent an idea to NASA actually some years ago that how we could achieve getting to Mars as human beings to make it easier for things like not getting hibernated.According to data, it takes 39 days to get to Mars, but since it follows the Sun, it might take 9 months as you have to calculate the direct route. The checkpoints would be called as ""Comfort Zones"" like in the movie. The crew members slept there in that movie true, most likely as hibernated though. Or thorugh dangerous checkpoints..What I disliked was mostly the space monkeys, gorillas out there killing the captain. Like wtf? That checkpoint was meant to be some sort of a biotechnical faculty. That stuff came like nowhere. Why the gorillas were in space?! It was needless part in that movie to be honest, but maybe crucial to why the dad killed his previous crew. After all they shared the same story.That checkpoint was also in MAYDAY mode, so there must be other ones too between the route from Earth to Mars. Rules of the sea.. Moon and Mars will be occupied, controlled by other countries for the resources for sure in the future.The last minus comes from the Roy's dad. He is living in a small space called ""home"" that will be the threat to humanity with ""energy surges."" From such a tiny home... How is he actually surviving there with the limited food resources for example?I give the movie 8.5/10! It was good, but not really science-like as it should have been.",Ad Astra

For the whole time I watched it, I kept wondering ""why the hell did Mr Pitt agree to be part of this"". Seriously, and woth respect, I would expect this quality of movie to star a lower paid actor - not Pitt. It's a story about a son who believes he had lost his father, but he didn't, his father was still alive. His father was sent on a mission to find aliens basically. However his father went a little nuts and killed his mates that went with him. So years and years later for some god knows reason the government who sent his dad on the mission thought best to send his grieving son to go and find his now not dead dad and kill him and blow up his continued mission. All sorts of shizzle occurs including mental monkeys. He eventually finds his dad, his dad tells him to sod off, but without much conversation he drags his dad away from his work to take him home... His dad kicks off and they have a little tear up. Pitt gives up and just let's his dad go. Oh all this rubbish seems to have occurred in SPACE!!!!!! 🤷‍♂️Brad goes home.

And the science, oh my gosh the science. It was so wrong it was painful to watch.This movie tried to illicit the pace and isolation of 2001: A Space Odyssey, but what they failed to realize about that book and subsequent movie is that what made it great was the science and the predictions it made about technology. Reviewers complained that Gravity wasn't scientifically accurate, but it was leaps and bounds above this in realism.For instance, a radio broadcast from Mars to Neptune, and the subsequent return communication took about 15 seconds with everyone standing around waiting. Light would take almost 8 hours to make that trip. James Gray (author) comes across as having a third-grade knowledge of how science works. The science could have been done correctly, without changing the story. It's just plain laziness that it's as bad as it is. A simple Google search will tell you how long it takes light to get from Mars to Neptune.It's the first movie I've been to where a group of people got up 15 minutes into the movie and just walked out.

Being in space and seeing stars with my own eyes is a dream of mine like everyone. In the film, you're going to Moon, Mars, and far.And the film makes us face our nature. There is a saying in the film which true. It warns us about the future which we build.I think the scenario is weak. Without space scenes, nothing is left except a sad man in your mind.

It is basic knowledge that space is incredibly and infinitely vast, yet Pitt appears to dot about the galaxy with no real aspect of time taken in to account.There were 2 key issues for me which I couldn't get around. I may have missed something - and to be fair its one of those movies where theres no logic as it's all made up fluff anyway. If there was a loophole or a gap in the story it could easily be plugged by a made up solution.Issue 1 - it took Tommy over 13 years to get to the point that hes lost near Neptune....Pitt seemed to get make his way there in a few months.Issue 2 - it was explained it would be close to impossible to find him as it is such a vast space in which he could be.

After reading so much negativity about it from viewers, I was expecting something really awful.I thought it was beautiful. I thought Pitt was great. I enjoyed the slower pace. I feel like it was a pretty grounded take on the future. Colonies on the Moon and Mars were believable. I spend a lot of my free time consuming YouTube channels like Isaac Arthur and John Michael Godier, Cool Worlds ect. I'm completely fascinated by futurism and space travel. I could nitpick about some scientific inaccuracies but thats not why I watch movies.The bit of action in this like the rover chase on the moon was visually stunning. You keep waiting for the aliens like when they board the ship broadcasting mayday distress signal but they never came.I'm happy the way it ended and didn't turn on its head like a movie like Sunshine did in the final third of the movie. I like how it ended with us being alone in the universe. Its a nice change from the alien or supernatual ridden sci fi we always get. Its an idea not explored a whole lot in the medium.I was expecting some epic showdown with his father when he reached Neptune. But we got the opposite.

They try to have this big drama between the father and the son and the psychological impact of the father dying when the son is just a teenager.However after most of the movie is spent with the main character taking a few different rockets to get to the destination the ending was horrible. It's basically the father talking crazy nonsense about life on other planets for about 3 minutes, then committing suicide in space. That's it! You can just fast forward to that point and save yourself about 2 hours of wasted time. I think this was the worst ending to a movie that I've ever seen.The only part worth watching was the action scene in the first 5-10 minutes of the movie. I love science fiction and have seen many movies. But this was the worst science fiction movie I've ever seen! Do not watch it.",Ad Astra

It is the slowest paced film in the history of movies. Period. I was soooo bored even an hour in and by the end, i just wanted to chew my arm off. I didnt care for any of the characters, the story was so full of holes that you just wonder how on earth did this ever get into the cinema. Thankfully Vue was just £5 to get in.So Brad goes to mars via the moon to send a signal to his dad at planet Neptune. Why not send the signal from Earth? There are way bigger dishes. Then just hops over to Neptune, in a chemical powered rocket ( this is a 12 year journey for us anyway ) . Hasnt aged at all when he gets there, exactly the same perfect haircut ( so he took a barber? ). When he gets there gets attacked by a monkey, finds his dad, who floats off into space, but by then you really dont care who lives or dies, you just want it to end, and then comes back ( would another 12 years ). So this would be a 25 year round trip, and looked exactly, and I mean exactly the same as when he left. It was just a mismatch of pointless scenes one after the other...pirates chasing on the moon?? then it was this, then that.. nothing flowed...So, in between all this nonsense. there is alot, and I mean ALOT of sitting around in corridors.

As a lay-person with knowledge of astronomy from an intro class in college there were glaring errors in the science that took me out of the story. (1) How long would it take to send a round trip message to Neptune from Mars? Hours, not minute. (2) They went to the edge of the heliosphere by traveling to Neptune. Why did they stop 1/4 of the way ther?Space monkeys and moon pirates?

2271,hamletrocks69,Ad Astray - should be the actual title,2,23 September 2019,"Warning - Review with Spoilers
Ad Astra - A space movie, IMAX experience, great visuals, space action et al, well these were the things I was hoping to see when I got into the premiere show last night, but alas turned out to be a total disappointment. So let me make this easy for you and save you 2 hrs and a ticket price. The story takes place on Earth in the near future where we have a colony on the moon with Starbucks, Applebees, Emirates and Virgin Atlantic as the preferred space flight for a trip to moon. We also have some pirates on the dark side of the moon. Plus an outpost in Mars for deep space exploration.
Plotline- there is a father who is the only man to travel to Jupiter Uranus and then Neptune goes cuckoo and his spaceship is shooting electromagnetic surges which is causing havoc on earth and other satellites at a distance of 1.5 bn km away. Plausible scientific explanation please look elsewhere. So his son Brad Pitt another great astronaut with a Mathew mcconaughey hangover monologues which makes no sense at all is sent to Mars to send a message to his long lost dad via laser to stop this or we nuke u. S#!^ happens he then has to fly solo to Neptune get his dad nuke the spaceship and return back home in one piece. So in between all these events he survives a half naked senseless pirate attack on the moon, primate attack on a lost ship, vertical landing on Mars, two space hand combats and a nuclear explosion used to propel his rocket back to earth, we the audience get a boring 2 hour space saga. Art house critics might say the psychological aspects was great but sorry I could not connect to the scenes or the emotion. Even the visuals were not that great and the sad part was that watching it in IMAX it had zero scenes shot in IMAX, such a wasted opportunity.

We can't blame his acting, because we all know he's a fantastic actor and he clearly did the best with the script he was given. None of the characters actually had any depth.

It looked neat but that was it.I like Sci-Fi a lot so I gave it a try but oh my, what a bit let down.The movie just doesn't have something interesting in it. Everything is dull, like you would have swallowed some drug before seeing the movie that kills all emotions.We don't really get attached to any of the characters and there are so many scenes that are just strange and you wonder why they are in the movie or you wonder why they wrote the script that way, why the writers or the director thought that this scene was interesting or made any sense.For example there is a scene on the moon, where Pitt and the other ""good guys"" are chased by some kind of moon pirates. It looks cool, so I guess this was the reason it was put into the movie but there is not much information generally about the current state of the world, why there are such space pirates, why the military seems to be unable to protect themselves appropriately against such a threat. Also for the mission Pitt must use a commercial flight to the moon and from there to Mars to send a radio signal. Really? There wouldn't be any other way for the military to sneak someone to their own moon base and why does the signal have to be transmitted from Mars? Also the whole rocket start on Marse scene is so implausible that it hurts. Many things in this world are a bit weird, maybe this is intentionally and should give the movie a touch of mystery but for me it doesn't work.Then apparently Pitt manages to travel to Neptune where he meets his father. The whole journey doesn't look really like a big effort, not even like an effort at all and you wonder why they just didn't send any other rocket or crew already to that place.On the station Pitt in Neptune's rings Pitt meets his father, they talk a bit and then they want to return. Not much conflict there, no suspense. Then there is a little fight between them when they want to travel to their return craft and Pitt's father seems a bit suicidal, because he seems very eager to drift into the void of space when his son surely could have saved him with his backback that he can use to navigate in space.So, Pitt returns to earth and apparently no one else has a problem with the fact that his boarding of the rocket on Mars lead to the death of the entire crew.I know, critics seem to love this movie. And it's apparently not a Sci-Fi movie at all. It is a father and son relationship drama disguissed set in a Sci-Fi theme. Well at least it surely wants to be that, but as said, it doesn't work for me. It maybe wants to be deep, but it is not. It maybe wants to tell an interesting story, but it doesn't.I give the film three stars, because of the great aesthetics and the good performance of Brad Pitt and also for the 5 minute screen time of Tommy Lee Jones.",Ad Astra
2281,antichristlady,Check your expectations before deciding to watch it.,6,24 September 2019,"First thing to keep in mind when going to watch ""Ad Astra"" (2019) is that it's a drama. If one expects action, a thrill ride and mind-blowing science fiction concepts, I am afraid they are few and far between in this. The emotional arc of the main character is the focus of the story. So, I think it's only fair to judge the movie based on it's intent and not on one's expectations. Having said that, it is a very slow movie. As the reviews reflect, some people will find it tediously boring and some will be emotionally engaged enough to appreciate what the movie is trying to do.It's essentially a one-man-show, with Brad Pitt's character taking up most of the screen time. Since the character is an emotionally closed off individual, it's easy to think acting is stiff and wooden. I thought Pitt's acting was subtle and engaging enough and I could appreciate it. Besides Pitt, everyone does an okay job, with no particular stand outs.The visuals were mesmerizing at times and a tad underwhelming at others. Personally, I thought both ""Interstellar"" and ""Gravity"" offered a more satisfying cinematography, but there are some scenes that stood out for sure. The score was very good as well. I was impressed with the space travel element, even though the scientific aspect left couple of things to be desired.I won't spoil the ending, but I am sure some will find it poetic and beautiful, while others will find it uninspired and boring. To me, it played a bit too safe to my liking. I can almost feel that there was some other ending in someone's mind somewhere, but it is what it is and for what it is, it's okay, just not what I would've wanted.So, the review is all over the place, but to be fair, so is the movie. I am not sorry I watched it, I don't feel any time had been wasted, but when it comes to ""space movies"", it's probably not going to be on my ""have to watch again"" playlist any time soon.To everyone interested in watching it, I would recommend it, but just keep in mind, it might not be your cup of tea.

Not entirely true tho. This character's greatest feat is his pulse never once going above 80 BPM and that's exactly how I felt for two hours while scenes alternated between inconsequential and nonsensical.Indeed, the everlasting monotony is seldomly broken with some mindbogglingly out-of-tone scenes (comic relief? trailer bait?). Some other scenes feel unbelievable science-wise and will leave the viewer scratching their heads.The themes and philosophical stances of the movie felt simultaneously superficial, banal and corny. This is actually is on par with Brad Pitt's acting: 2 hours zealously spent on overacting non acting.Ultimately, the conclusion also fails to deliver. ""Foreseeable"" and ""shallow"" are the epithets which come to mind to characterize how this movie ends.As the credits started rolling, my feeling shifted from boredom to a mix of relief and frustration.

They're sending messages from Mars to Neptune via some form of laser communication in order to pinpoint his dad's location...lasers need to be specifically aimed in the first place, so where are they aiming it? Pitt boards a rocket while it's taking off...ok? Why don't they fire a missile instead of sending people to Neptune? Everyone else in the ship died because some smart fellow fires a gun and hits some gas cannister that contains some gas that kills almost instantly? Why didn't Pitt record his message on earth to begin with and save the trouble? Why do Pitt's tears run down his face in zero gravity? Pitt eyeballs a launch trajectory off a spinning radar, through a debris field to get back to his spaceship?And the biggest insult, there were no aliens.You would have to completely ignore the sci-fi setting of this movie to figure out what the point was, but then why bother setting it in space at all then? It wasn't even a good story.",Ad Astra

He went out and explored space for signs of life sacrificing everything and not seeing the most beautiful life right in front of him: that of his son and his wife. McBride Jr; Roy McBride played by Brad Pitt realizes that when he flies all the way to the edge of the space to realize his life is on Earth. Closing scene shows that he will not make the same mistake.Many people totally missed the point of the movie, arguing how there should be life space, and how it makes no sense to go there and not find any life.

Because of this I didn't care so much about the program he his going on much less understand how they can have all this technology and still have a 70s style CIA briefing room.

It has few redeeming qualities and, sadly, it's not so bad it's good, so can never achieve cult status for being so awful. It's boring, stupid (yes there really are Moon Pirates and Space Monkeys) poorly researched and terribly scripted. Characters are unengaging, sub-plots go nowhere (the main plot does too), wasted actors (eg. Keifer Sutherland pops in for awhile and then has a sudden medical emergency and disappears; Natasha Lyonne from Russian Doll has a bit part as receptionist on Mars, Liv Tyler appears sporadically as estranged wife), overly dramatic acting that is occasionally confusing and completely unscientific (it's a still a sci fi movie...

For the first half of the film there were dozens of moments in the story that can have you anticipating Something Interesting Happening, but by the final 45 minutes I gave up.

in space in complete solitude for years and years just to reach another place where there is nothing but more astral space to be explore. In other words a very good fantasy on how in the future man kind could reach other planets, it relies on pure imagination on things that exist but are not real just yet , witch makes this movie so interesting because in real life, if I let go of a rock from a 10 story building the rock is going to hit the floor but with this movie when is being watch we don't know what is going to happen, . the plot is very simple but very interesting ans is not boring at all at it keeps you thinking and the photography is superb and the sound is incredible",Ad Astra

2319,christiefarm,Despite all my anticipation - this film deeply disappointed on all fronts!,2,19 September 2019,"Now im a big fan of these types of films, I loved Interstellar, I loved the Martian, I really enjoyed First Man - I loved Apollo 11 (doco film) and i really liked Apollo 13.
I even enjoyed Sunshine for the most part.Now that has been outlined - i hated this movie Ad Astra - because:SpoilersOpening shot from Brad's characters shows earth spinning below - looked great - but then seconds later you see they are on a fixed Antenna, locked to the rotation of Earth - the first of dozens of really obvious and poor oversights! (How about the continuity of Moons gravity, once in the Rocket facility everyone is marching around with Earth grav - seconds earlier the rover ((based on a version 2 1969 variant?)) floated almost with no gravity influence)And the stupidity of the facility on the Moon - absolutely huge, looked about as big as downtown Vegas, but they are still driving around in open top rovers, and flying Rockets that look like last years Atlas Rocket or somethingRidiculous plot is established that requires Pitt's character to fly via the Moon to Mars to make a god damn phone call from a pathetic sound studio style booth to his dad, for WHAT!? Apparently to gain a reply, so they can locate the ship. Well they KNEW it was at Neptune (granted a big planet, but really, a phone call to a ship that hasn't been heard for 15years or something). Liv & Donald's characters should not have been in the film, these added nothing, and just added more frustration from the underwhelming utilisation of their known talents.BTW the idea that you can casually stop midway from Earth to Mars to check on a distress call was utter CRAP- they had to be going at something like 525,000mph to get to Mars in the 6 days or whatever the ship said, and the idea that they could stop, make the door call (to a ship that had rampant Chimpanzees solely there to remove the Captain character) and then get back up to that speed is pretty far reaching. The bad acting by supporting roles, such as the fumbling Co-Pilot who froze during landing, and my favourite - the lady in the check in area on Mars, who was flapping fingers on the key board vaguely like it was a 8yr olds play or something.The hilarious water manhole on Mars cracked me up - WTF and why was there a rope thing to grab?
Also - at the base of the rocket below the engines - flame pit area - there is a casual Electrical Box for WHAT?Everything that happened whilst watching this movie pulled me closer to getting up and leavingI could go on",Ad Astra

Firstly, it's a space opera but the character development and exposition and is sub-par at best. The motivations and behaviors of the characters are absurd. Don't even get me started on the scientific explanations. It is a big budget movie. They could have hired someone to make legitimate explanations. It's just massively insulting that they didn't even try. Story is just not good.The visuals are beautiful and the VFX look good but honestly, they could be so much better. Looks like the director intentionally didn't want the movie to be about the visuals but rather about the characters. But the characters are uninteresting and not developed well. It's just disappointing. There is one action scene. A space fight on the moon in lunar buggies. Yet, even THAT, an space fight on lunar surface, is boring and very uninteresting.",Ad Astra

I can't understand why people hate this so much??,9,21 September 2019,"Let be start by saying I do feel like this is a film for people who love films, not for people who like Brad Pitt or people who like Sci Fi etc. Nothing is done with enough intensity to satisfy those who love certain parts. Pitt's character is relatively simple, a steely, takes no astronaut with just one weakness (his father). Although Pitt has not much dialogue, partly due to the nature of his character and partly to allow other elements of the film to shine.
Yes it's true this film is certainly a slow burn, theres little action and what action there is isn't as grandiose as Sci-Fi fans might be after. I understand how those with a penchant for action and adventure would be bored. However, for me the tension builds beautifully, character arcs are satisfying, story is fascinating and the twist at the end really hit me hard. It gets you thinking about the vastness of space and how scary that actually is and all round really got me thinking. Which is all I ask of a film.

Utterly disrespectful of the audience and -frankly- of the art of acting, every event is explained to us in a breathtakingly tedious voice over by Pitt, instead of - ya know - letting the action and acting stand for themselves.

2360,info-919-717897,Oh.My.God.,1,24 August 2020,"So three of my faves; Brad, Science Fiction and really good CGI. Even with all that I couldnt stay awake tho it started so well with the paragliding landing from the Space Station, but after that it got complicated, unnecessary, astonishingly ridiculously wrong science-wise, messy, boring, silly and unbelievable and I found the story quite hard to follow - though I suspect that was because I kept nodding off. Murderous space monkeys aside, was the director on LSD?My one star is for the few minutes at the beginning (only because I like paragliders and once had an accident like that - though not from the Space Station, only a hill - so all the adrenalin of my own terrible crash flooded back giving me quite a thrill), these were the best few minutes. After that it was mostly a blur until near the end as I struggled to keep myself awake while wondering what on earth was supposed to be going onEven seeing Brad spot his abandoned space ship from whatever planet he was on (cant remember but one with rings) wont allow me to add another star for being so bravely unreal.So, mostly I recall this bit: near the end after spotting his space ship light years away he pushed off - with his feet - from the outside of Dads spaceship (which was ripping apart the universe with sound waves in some frightening and unbelievable way) towards his lift home after cleverly saving everything. This perilous journey through the rings had many rocks floating about so before he left he tore off a whole sheet of metal using only his space gloved hands.. flimsy as balsawood this bit of space rocket skin became his mega shield as he leapt across space through rings dodging rocks and navigating only with his eyes - his incredible eyes, the two eyes that allowed him to spot his little rocket in the first place. So he easily gets all the way to his own rocket exactly, and while whizzing past it at hundreds of miles an hour or maybe thousands, he grasps a rung or something sticking out, so he doesnt shoot past . I was a bit surprised that he didnt even dislocate his shoulder. His tendons must also be as amazing as his eyes.Awesome, if you are about 6 years old. If you are over 6 this is absolutely ridiculous from start to finish, this is by far the silliest worst sci-fi movie I have ever seen, by FAR, and yet somehow it got nominated for awards! Well, I dont know how they managed to swing that, it was either a lot of pity-nominations or there was something dreadfully fishy going on, fishier even than killer space Mandrils.Anyone that rates this highly I'd just like to say Im never going to read your reviews again, you've blown it.",Ad Astra
2361,mymim2012,Question,9,18 September 2019,"Why isn't Natasha Lyonne listed among the cast? Although her role is virtually a walk-on, it's fun to see her.
The cinematography alone is worth the price of admission. Notice how the many and intense close-ups contrast so beautifully with the wide-open scenes of outer space.
Notice, too, deep shots of eyes. The Pitt character refers to the rage in the primate's eyes. Pay attention and you'll see that same ocular expression many times.
I also particularly enjoyed the repeated visual images, including spiraling, umbilical-like tethering, ladders.",Ad Astra
2362,gandalfstormcrow679,A near masterpiece of science fiction drama,8,21 September 2019,"Ad Astra took me quite by surprise. If you're reading this and have not yet watched the film, be warned; the trailers completely misrepresent the film and it is marketed towards the wrong audience.This is not the next 2001: A Space Odyssey, nor is it anything like Interstellar. The film has more in common with Apocalypse Now and Moon, than any of those movies. I am surprised a movie like this even got made, which in some ways explains the rather mainstream appeal of the trailers in order to compensate for the film's deliberate pace.With Ad Astra, James Gray has created an intimate and soulful film set in space. The only thing ""science fiction"" about this is the setting. Otherwise, it's a human drama. The movie is very simple and straightforward but it is effective.Powerful visuals accompanied by stellar acting from Brad Pitt, a tight focus on the story, and a sublime musical score, makes this different from other space films out there. The film's slow pace might lose its audience after a certain point, but the ones who stay with it till the end will be rewarded with an excellent but simple film.The brilliant use of a plausible near future setting is excellent science fiction material. Mankind has commercialized travel to the Moon and has set foot on Mars. But not all is as it seems. There are dangers still, and some parts of the Moon are war zones. This setting gives enough plausibility to the plot, while still selling the empty loneliness of space exploration. Mars is Mankind's last stop before the unknown and Brad Pitt's character, Roy McBride finds himself journeying alone to complete the rest of his mission after a certain point, which forms the best parts of the film after the Moon and Mars sequences. If you love science fiction settings, especially based on space colonization, this part of the movie will no doubt appeal to you.Still, the film is not perfect. The only problem I have with the movie is Liv Tyler's character, Eve. I felt she was not needed in the movie and while she was barely in the movie, her minor scenes added nothing but rather, detracted from the film as a whole, given the movie's tight focus on Roy McBride and his mission.Maybe the audience might find Roy McBride to be an emotionless robot, but there is a lot going on in his mind and that is enough for me as a viewer to engage with. The wife character is unnecessary in this otherwise flawless film, which seems to me its only purpose is to tell the audience, ""It's ok, see? He has a wife, he's relatable now!"" No. The film doesn't need that, and I think in some ways James Gray knows that too. It is definitely an unnecessary addition to the film.But, the rest of the film's tight focus on Brad Pitt's character shows James Gray is confident about his vision and he doesn't need to switch between multiple characters or side plots to tell his story. As mentioned above, the only misstep with this film is Liv Tyler's character, Eve. With the exception of Tommy Lee Jones' character, Clifford McBride, every other character is only a minor supporting character and they come and go as per the story.All in all, Ad Astra utilizes a science fiction space setting to tell a heartfelt drama about father and son. Some people might find the film to be uneventful for a space movie, and might find the third act disappointing. But, for the first time in a long time, I feel like I may have to watch a movie again immediately after leaving the theater. The more I reflect on the film, the more I admire it. Ad Astra is a near flawless masterpiece.",Ad Astra
2363,arunshourieh,A bad Sci-fi Movie,4,12 March 2021,"Watched many Sci-fis, even those less rated, but enjoyed most of them, but this one some how, fails to make a connect to the audience. All along the movie we are always in hope of some thing good coming up and it never turnsup. even the climax is so disappointed.

Basically it felt like a 2001: A Space Odyssey remake done by someone that had multiple head injuries as a child.It got a 4 because we didn't walk out of the movie (although I thought about it, multiple times) and the visuals were nice, like every movie since 2000.

However the atmosphere, the individuals scenes and the ambiance is amazing. it makes you feel, it's not a sci-fi movie, but a ""documentary"" from the future. That's why it's a shame, all that build up leads to nowhere, there is no real twist.

The plot is lame, the ending is pointless and any slight bit of action lasts two seconds. It's basically a fixed camera on Brads face for two hours. The best bit about watching this film was the 35 minutes of trailers before it started. There is a line in the film near the end which basically sums it up when Brad Pitt's character say ""how much longer can I go on"". I nearly then walked out.

2371,m-chalapuk,This is how a high achiever's life looks like!,8,27 September 2019,"I'm getting the impression that people don't get the point of this movie. There is some action in it (not only one scene as some reviews claim) and special effects which are on point but this movie is not about that. It's also not about all good values that the protagonist represents, not about the story, and not about all the advancements in science.The movie is about a very disciplined and unbalanced life caused by psychological trauma. The protagonist is a complicated man, concentrated on his work and quite distant from everyone. I personally know some very ambitious people which are similar in this manner. Focusing on the goal and avoiding unnecessary activities is what makes such people climb to the top. The movie is meant to be slow and concentrated on subtle emotional cues of the protagonist. This makes the role an acting challenge, very pleasant to watch given Pitt's acting skill. Not to give away too much, the movie ultimately delivers some answers to questions about such psychological conditions.Quality-wise, space feels like space, moon feels like the moon, mars feels like mars, camera work is very good, plot closely follows the monomyth (with first half of the cycle stretched until last 20 minutes) and is believable (and not that important IMO). Given the subtleties of the protagonist, I'd say Brad Pitt's acting is very good. Some reviews reported an impression of underdevelopment of his character, but I don't know if there's a good way of introducing more of his background or showing character changes during the journey, given the limitations of what he has to offer socially.Waiting for the release on Blue-Ray.",Ad Astra

Normally like Brad but my god the good scripts must have dried up.Nothing in this film was believable from moon pirates to man eating monkeys, hatches on Mars and then swimming to a rocket.

It's a haunting, metaphoric travel into the soul of the protagonist. I personally think, that, if one fails to recognize this and hopes for ""the movie to get better"", one has only looked for an action-rich SciFi blockbuster - which James Gray never wanted it to be. Many of the scenes (especially towards the middle) reminded me of the quieter scenes in Blade Runner 2049, a personal favourite, and many other of the greats, like 2001 and Apocalypse Now. Highly recommendable.",Ad Astra
2375,idriss-boudhina,"this movie is definitely a masterpiece.Sadly, this genre of cinemas are apart of a dying breed.",10,10 February 2020,"A lot of these recent psychological space films within recent memory focus mainly on impressive visuals,nonstop action BS and emotional storytelling. I can't help but be dreadful at the state of how ludicrous some of these reviews are. My God, like did you all seriously not realize what type of film Ad Astra is?.Ad Astra is meant to be deep and personal,masterful psychological drama disguised as a gorgeous sci-fi epic. It has a dark layer that probably most people don't want to hear if it is shown and said directly. That would be too invasive and easy. It is in hiding. You have to figure out for yourself as always to actually be convinced by something. And that's the journey Roy unintentionally takes. This is not the next popcorn space adventure flick some were desperately waiting for. In fact, it is way more than that :Explore the galaxy. Search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Are we alone in the universe? Are we self-destructive? Are we willing to continue until the end regardless of the consequences? Do we become what we judge without realizing it? The story that the film tells us has a very deep meaning and explores the most hidden corners of the human being. A slow movie that goes through the stages of degradation and collapse of an individual feeling lost and the will to continue forward and get up to reach a goal. The sound and score, the photography, the scenarios and landscapes, the cinematography, the direction and the colours are really gorgeous.Questions are raised, and answers are not always easy to digest. A life devoted to achieving a ""greater"" professional/scientific (but not necessarily noble) goal can lead to alienation and eventually abstaining from life itself. And it's not like it's always a rewarding journey. It often just leaves behind severely traumatized souls, as Gray's depressive, introspective space drama depicts in the most touching way.The movie is also about loneliness and in my opinion it's about going too far as a human race. The latter is being showed in the movie with the big antenna, the experimenting on the monkey, his father and the antimatter rays that could destroy our solar system and are actually caused by humans, the ""we (humans) are ""world eaters"" part and that is (again) all about resources (the rebel scenes on the moon which was thought-provoking and somewhat depressing thinking our dysfunction as a human race perpetuates in the future. although I may disagree with what James Gray perhaps trying to say but I will defend his right to say it: Instead of looking at the stars (ad astra) we should be looking at our own beautiful world. It (the movie and Roy) has a dark view on humanity.It's all brought to a micro level with Roy and his father. Roy is obviously lonely (hence the girlfriend (Liv Tyler) that shows up from time to time) and his emotions are flat, very, very flat. I would say he is depressed.His father is also lonely. He went too far and lost himself. He was looking for alien life at any cost. But in the end Roy learns from the data his father gathered he didn't found a planet with life. At that moment Roy also says that life was right under his (his fathers) nose all along. By which he means: his family which he abandoned. His father was so immersed in his project (looking at he stars / going too far) that he lost sight of what life is really about (love, family, caring).So Roy returns with the data and being a lot wiser (facing his dad made him wake up). Instead of loneliness, he chooses to make amends with his former girlfriend (the end).So instead of looking for life in deep space we'd better look at our selfs, the ones we care about and the world we live on (macro lvl). You/we can't run away from (y)our self. You/we have to face to what is here at this moment (maybe a link to the destructive force humans have on planet earth and possible other planets (for example depletion of resources?).The monkey also represent in my opinion the going too far part. That ship clearly experimented on animals. And that went terribly wrong. The monkey was pure rage. Did we go too far? Where does it end?Anyways, it's a difficult and dark movie. Maybe pretentious for some. It has a dark layer that probably most people don't want to hear if it is shown and said directly. That would be too invasive and easy. It is in hiding. You have to figure out for yourself as always to actually be convinced by something. And that's the journey Roy unintentionally takes.p.s.: Many haters will desperately try to discredit this film. The easiest path is to rant about the screenplay and overly focus on supposed ""plot holes"", taking the plot at face value despite the movie's metaphorical approach. Sadly, they are missing the main themes along with every point it tries to make. It's actually very absurd, since most of the scepticists are obviously fans of Interstellar, whose ending is a plot hole the size of a... black hole! Don't let these hateful attacks distort the experience of this thrilling journey into the soul.",Ad Astra

So yeah scifi-action is more like a nicely developed icing on top a story based on a main character in a way I haven't seen a while and it works. Music and supreme visual art and soynd designing build an almoat perfect background to the story and Pitt's supreme acting. I really wanted to give this 10 but dare to say the mid-end - part was made too hasty. Why this had to be just 2 hours long. I felt the most important part of the film could have been more deep and it could have emphazised more what I felt was Ad astra's roots - emotions, and the main character's psychological process. Pitt took a difficult role in being the only main character in the film and that the side characters didn't have much screen time at all.

The setup to the search for the father was well enough done but the payoff was more like the gun in the cartoon that shoots out a sign instead of a bang.

I thought the acting by Pitt was good but why was everyone else so melancholy? Not one character had any spark, they were all lifeless automatons going through the motions. This movie focused on too much of the psychological and not enough on the way real people act, even emotionally damaged ones. The main character could have woken up in an insane asylum at the end with the preceding plot as a figment of his imagination and it would have made more sense (especially considering the bad science.) Case in point, the technology, at times, didn't seem to far from the Apollo era yet someone can live in space for 30 years? Or a spacecraft going full blast from the moon to mars can screech to a halt so they can go investigate a distress call? Then rev 'er back up to make mars on time, forgetting that it's probably now moved along its orbit and they won't have enough fuel to catch up now? Also climbing aboard a rocket ship as it's taking off? Even mars has gravity and g forces at takeoff. Too many nonsensical plot devices, plus a leaden pace and wooden acting, I say meh.

Ad Astra is objectively a bad movie. Nothing happens there, you do not care, what is going to happen next, you do not care about how it will end. You just want to go home and do something else.
When you compare it to other movies, it just fails. It's not like Interstellar, because you absolutely do not care what is going to happen to any of those characters. Hell, I did not care about the fate of humanity at all. It's not like Gravity, because you already have seen both visual highlights (tower and lunar rovers) in the trailer. Do you want to see a slow paced engaging movie? Go see 21 Grams.

He's a handsome guy good for action and comedy, but completely overchallenged by serious roles as the current one. Although he is supposed to be soldier-like with a mask to cover all his emotions, he's not credible as Roy mission his beloved hero-declared father most of his life.

Possibly the most surprising was the abysmal acting of Tommy Lee Jones. I didn't know he could act that bad. Brad Fencepost Pitt was emotionless through 98% of the movie. There were so many stories that never got explained and only had one line to introduce what was happening. The ""stunning visuals"" weren't that stunning, in fact they were incredibly boring as they were usually set smack dab in the middle of the screen. To give you an example of how poorly done this movie was, there is a scene where something goes awry trying to land on Mars. The Captain (not Pitt) freezes up and can't make a decision. Now mind you, there are at least 15 times in this movie where Pitt is shown being given a psychological evaluation to make sure he is fit for the next step or mission. Now, all of a sudden we are supposed to believe that this Captain can't handle this landing? But worse than that, there is no real tension here. He just turns his head away and Brad Pitt takes manual control making him out to be the hero. After landing he states that he won't report this to his superiors. This takes all of 45 seconds. The whole scene takes 45 seconds and we are supposed to look up and idolize Pitt for his command and daring, his compassion and stability. It was boring and fruitless.

As mentioned in the goofs list, in zero gravity, tears don't stay on a cheek- they float away.
I'm an avid science fiction fan, but I also know my physics. When Roy moved from the pod to the Lima ship, the pod floated away. Huh? Lima had significantly more mass than the pod, so the pod would have stuck to Lima and not gone anywhere.

Although the story is about a space trip to Neptune, really beyond the trip, it is the events that lead a man to question his life purpose and why he makes the decisions he makes.
It is a movie that takes full advantage of the visual and sound aspects of being located in space, but those factors go to the background when the protagonist is on scene, since the primary interest is to know his thoughts.

I really liked what they were going for with Brad Pitt's characters. The idea that this almost robot like guy is worn down throughout the movie could have been really great emotionally, but It doesn't go further enough. Same thing with his father. We only hear some stuff about him throughout the movie, main character misses him and then when Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones finally meet there's a pretty anticlimactic resolution to their story. Those things aren't horrible but if they would have been stronger than this whole movie would have been amazing.Thing that carries Ad Astra are the amazing visuals, breathtaking atmosphere, great small details in the world and a really great soundtrack. I'm the type of guy that can love movies that have a pretty bare bones stories if the movie has a great atmosphere and this one certainly does have It. loneliness of space is perfectly created here and the world feels really realistic, at least to me.So would I recommend this movie? I don't really know. Even If I can look past the pretty weak story because I love the visuals and the world so much I can understand that many other people just want to have fun while watching a movie or at least shed a few tears. This movie will not make you do any of those probably but It did make me think while watching It that even If this movie is far from perfect It just makes me feel so happy what movies can achieve.

Cinema is my hobby and reviewing is my passion. I previously was a professional critic and contributed to several sources of literature.Spoilers:The positives:Great cinematography
Great acting (especially by BP)
Good set designThe negatives:
Boring!!! (Honestly, could this thing be any more boring. If I ever thought that Star Trek TMP was slow-paced and boring, this one exceeded it by ten times.)
Subtle Ripoff (I was thinking the entire time how this was a collection/homage to Apocalypse Now, Blade Runner and 2001. I couldn't get out of those three movies while watching this.)Don't waste your time on this. It isn't even worth renting on a Sunday afternoon.I had high hopes for this movie. I've wanted to become an astronaut since I was a child and have always loved science fiction, science reality and space movies (in particular Interstellar). I had no expectations for this walking in. The first few minutes were intriguing and I thought it would pick up eventually but after several minutes of the plot slowly moving forward, I realized I was in for the long haul. The ending was a dud. I get the message and can appreciate what they were ""trying"" to say and do but at the end of the day, cinema needs to be (at the very least) engaging and hopefully ""exciting"". This movie was neither. I honestly don't mind slow-paced movies with a clear agenda or message but at least give me something engaging. I had just recently seen Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and even though it's nearly a two and a half hour movie (with no ""real"" plot) it was engaging and a joy to watch. Highly-rated. This movie is amongst my top three worst and arguably the worst (the worst is hard to beat). I'm not sure what movie critics watched but this is a prime example of audience versus critics. Audience reviews have generally been terrible whilst critic reviews have been generally positive.
This has been a similar situation over the past few years and often times in reverse. Critics hated it, audiences loved it. Bohemian Rhapsody is a prime example.Save your time and money. I wouldn't even waste my time watching this for free if I had all the time in the world.",Ad Astra

2465,liamklotz,"If you love Brad Pitt, Space, and Mystery - Do yourself a favor and DO NOT WATCH THIS",3,29 September 2019,"I love Brad Pitt, my wife loves Brad Pitt. I love Sci-Fi, I love space, I love action, adventure, mystery. There are so many things that I feel I should love about this film that I absolutely DO NOT FEEL.Recently we've watched Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (brilliant!), rewatched Interstellar (stellar!), and are a couple years out from enjoying James Gray's We Own the Night (pretty good!). We went into this movie with the highest of hopes, so high in fact that my wife agreed to watch a movie in theaters past 7 P.M.!!! Well, thankfully the theater offered alcoholic beverages because we found ourselves in dire need.Here's the plot in a nutshell (trying to avoid spoilers, but if this helps to prevent you from wasting 120 minutes of your life then it doesn't really matter): Brad Pitt's character finds himself undertaking a mission to Neptune, where his father (Tommy Lee Jones) who was thought dead or lost for 30 years, has been attempting to contact extraterrestrial life. Earth is under the assumption that Jones is trying to destroy life in the galaxy by sending anti-matter pulses through space which leads to mass power outages (or at least I think this is what was going on; the writer/director tries to pretend that the plot is so deep and intellectual that explanations are few and far in between). Extremely long story short, there are a few ""entertaining"" scenes attempting to break up the monotony of space travel such as an encounter with moon pirates (whose presence is explained away with such a brief moment of dialogue my yawn literally drowned it out so I never understood why they were there). There is also a rescue attempt scene between the Moon and Mars in a seemingly abandoned space station that involves a semi-gruesome scene orchestrated by escaped test subjects. Spoiler: it's stupid and short, so don't go to the bathroom like my wife or you'll miss it, and is also minimally explained. These scenes are obviously attempting to inject some adrenaline into the plot line, but are so brief and random that they are only remembered after watching the film because you come to realize nothing else was even remotely entertaining.All supporting characters' scenes, even if they received high billing, range from a few words to a few wordless flashbacks. All space cinematography feels like something seen before. All Pitt's scenes feel overly stoic. All tracking shots feel hopelessly unedited.I gave this film 3 stars because I think Pitt tried to do something. I took 7 off because James Gray screwed up a film that honestly should never have been made. It had nothing to say, but believed it was profound. I just can't believe the filmmakers watched this after completion and thought it was a work of art. And I honestly can't believe critics are giving it good reviews. Critics have lost touch in regards to the purpose of filmmaking. Movies are there to entertain first and foremost. Of course they are also pieces of art and can convey profound meaning and even effect the lives of those who watch them. BUT if they are not entertaining, then in this amateur critics opinion, they have no purpose.",Ad Astra

Although it is about a highly risky mission within our solar system, I think it is more about the relationship between emotions and humanity. From a science perspective emotions can be hindering, can be something that should be get rid of. That is why I think Brad Pitt is so masterfully plays the character, because he can play the fleshy full of emotions guy he had proven that. In this he is playing something totally alien to us. Something so controlled, so distant, that it intimidates, it marginalizes normal people. I do not want to spoil anything, and yeah it is not a normal run of the mill sci fi, but I truly recommend it to people who likes difference, who like to think, who feel a bit distant from normal society.

They are in free fall even when the ship is accelerating and fall irretrievably when actually in free fall. Not one character acts in a reasonable fashion. It's pretty and also pretty vacuous.

2508,elg02,A beautiful brown banana,7,21 September 2019,"This movie is beautiful and I really like it, but it is flawed. It has a somewhat weak story and plot holes that does not make sense, which left a part of me disappointed. However, some aspects of the film truly do shine of moments of brilliance, which for me makes it redeem itself. The direction and cinematography are truly outstanding. Ad Astra is one of the most beautiful artworks I have seen in a long time and I guess that is what you need to take with you from this movie. The beautiful imagery with an exciting soundtrack and sound design, one that kept me invested in the movie even though the story disappointed me.A common complaint I have seen reading other reviews is that this movie is boring. This I do not agree with. Yes, the story has problems, but I thought the movie was interesting from start to finish and never found myself bored. Is it a slow burn? Yes, definately, but the movie manages to keep itself fresh with how it looks and some really exciting scenes.As previously said, I do believe the story is lacking, though I think it manages to tie up nicely with a message that we have seen before, but is worth noting. Ad Astra also contains some plot holes and some questionable science that in my opinion could have been avoided and sadly they lessened the story quite a bit. However, I think that by fixing some of the major plot holes the story could have been much more solid than it is, even though it is not very complex.With all that being said, this is not really a space exploration film as much as it is a slow charachter drama about a son and his father that happens to take place in space. Putting the story's flaws aside, I think it succeeds in telling the emotional journey it aspired to and that it will leave a positive mark on a certain audience.In conclusion, Ad Astra is a slow burning beautiful film with flaws that may leave you wondering what the movie could have been, but all in all is a journey worth experiencing.",Ad Astra

I went to the cinema for space adventures and expected at least in some way in view of the development of events, but no! the only thing that we saw almost the entire film is the face of Brad Pitt, his character is cold-blooded, and now we see this for more than half of the film, almost no emotions from Brad or from me from this film. the main character speaks most of the film in trivial phrases that do not need context, constantly measure the character's state, and nobody explains to us the current state of affairs in the world that they show, they just spit cold facts on our faces. When the main character gets to his goal, we will see even more stupid script, simply because ... the whole movie the main character wanted to find his father and knew that his father does not care about him, the film will not reveal any morality to us, just imagine that you are watching from the balcony to disassemble the father with his son, only you don't pay for it; you didn't spend a lot of money and didn't drag it out (I'm talking about the scene of sorting out the relationship). why is that? I expected at least a little to enjoy the view of space objects on a larger screen, but I ""enjoyed"" the composure of the main character and stupid reasoning.

2533,louishurrey,'Ad Astra' partly makes up for its predictable plot with inspired background world building and visuals. Definitely worth a watch but don't go in expecting 'Interstellar'.,6,24 September 2019,"'Ad Astra' excels in its depiction of a near future human society. Forgiving some blaring scientific inaccuracies and coincidences for science fiction's sake, this film showcases some extremely interesting concepts: from the monolithic ""International Space Antenna"" built on the Earth; to the Moon which is comparable to the Earth in the golden age of exploration- ""safe"" tourism hotspots and military strongholds surrounded in a no-mans land of piracy and civil war; to the underground colonies of Mars and other human endeavors into the outer Solar System.Similarly, the cinematography and visual effects do not disappoint, with beautiful panoramic views of our solar system and masterfully set up shots of the various bases and ships Brad Pitt visits reminiscent of Sci-Fi masterpieces ""Interstellar"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".However, the comparison to these titans of cinema can only go so far- the plot of ""Ad Astra"" felt lacking to me and was devoid of intensity- it felt as if I was waiting for a twist that never came in order to become fully invested in the story, although this might be an unfortunate consequence of my subconscious comparisons to similar movies in the genre.On top of the plot's predictability, I felt a severe disconnect with the main character, who was played perfectly well by Brad Pitt, but had a shallow and fairly straightforward character arc and is the main focus of the entire film. I much preferred the infinitely more interesting characters played by Tommy Lee Jones and Ruth Negga, who showed much more depth in the short amount of screen time they had.The narrative decision to have the main character's thoughts and feelings conveyed to the audience through a voice over is especially jarring and in my opinion lazy story telling. This and a couple of scenes (the rabid baboon in the spaceship) really took me out of the film at some points. Another disappointment was the soundtrack which felt like a watered down version of 'Blade Runner: 2049'. On a more positive note, the sound design was impressive with the use of silence to convey the vast emptiness and isolation of space and other planetary bodies being particularly effective.Overall, 'Ad Astra' is a movie which partly makes up for its predictable plot with inspired background world building and stunning visuals. Definitely worth a watch but don't go in expecting a Sci-Fi masterpiece like 'Interstellar'.",Ad Astra

This movie talks about Roy McBride( played by brad Pitt did a good job playing this character did not expect that) on a mission to find his beloved father, Clifford McBride.
Plain and simple. This movie has a good story not complicated one.
To save you some time. This movie isn't for everyone. The reason why i liked because of the setting and the psychology of it.
Not getting into too much detail this two thing go good together. It takes us into the mind of these characters, showing us their thoughts, and mindset.
With a good environment to compliment it, space.
Also loved about this movie is the color, the way it changes colors throughout the movie, and the camera style filming the movie where for instance the would record one scene through the helmet of astronaut and then slowly the color changes so we would see the reflection on his helmet to see what he is seeing.

This movie clearly has no basis in reality, and the writer has never read a physics book in his life. There's no shockwave in space, let alone the fact Neptune is at minimum 2.7 billion miles from earth. Let's just assume you can ride a nuclear shockwave, even a .001 degree error in his approach would wildly miss earth.Of course this is just one scene why fixated on one issue.. the movie also includes crazed space monkeys that aren't explained, and rogue space pirates on the moon with 0 context.This movie kept me hanging on waiting for answers. Is the US corrupt and keeping the world in the dark? Is his father actually attempting to save the world? Has his father discovered intelligent life and knows something we don't know?

I suspect this was Brad Pitt catching up to Matt Damon (Martian) with regards to space movies.
Admittedly, I worked in the space shuttle and current space programs, so my awareness of the errors with regards to physics for me was obvious. The times to go to the Moon, Mars, and Neptune were just highly errant. With current technology, it's about three days to the Moon, eight months to Mars, and about a dozen years to Neptune. One cool event that was nearly factual was Roy's descent from International Space Station to a parachute Landing. There've exactly been 2 people that have accomplished similar Feats, one was a stewardess of a Czechoslovakian airplane who fell some 30,000 feet when the airplane was bombed, and another was a daredevil who actually prepared for this feat. Unfortunately, there was no real explanation of how he survived parachuting from space in this movie.
And there was one scene where the US flag patch was bizarrely reversed that the Stars we're in the upper left quadrant. No explanation.

Have never been a James Gray directory fan, and Ad Astra was no exception.Having seen the trailer, I expected something like Interstellar by Nolan, the film which I really enjoyed watching several times, though I believed Ad Astra should have been more of a Sci-Fi thing. Well, I will be straight forward, there is absolutely no Sci-Fi in the film, which the viewer can see from the very first minutes. Then you start to search for some drama and again, the storyline is just so simple and poorly thought out, when you expect some emotional burst, the film just leaves you empty inside.No questions about Brad Pitt's acting. In any emotional situation he felt very natural and manages to act out even some storyline bloopers.I would not recommend the film to any cinematic enthusiast, who like going too deep into films.

It centres itself heavily around the themes of neglection, love and life and how it is important to focus on what is around you instead of what is in the distance, which is what Pitt's and Jones' characters have to come to terms with.I think from the trailer a few people might be disappointed watching the film thinking this was going to be a huge Space epic as all of that is completely in the background of the story.

2555,saadimam-43128,Ad Astra-nomical Failure,2,20 September 2019,"Let me begin by saying that I'm being generous with my rating of 2 stars. This movie was a disappointment on so many levels. The science was completely wrong. There were elements of the cinematography and overall visuals that deserve some credit. But apart from that, the movie left much to be desired.As a fan of space movies and Brad Pitt, I went in expecting an epic, but left disappointed. On one hand there are movies like gravity that keep you on the edge of your seat literally gasping for breath. While this was a 2 hour closeup of Brad's face and had very little, if anything, to do with space.Here's what was wrong with the movie.
Firstly, the movie fails to show the vastness of space with skewed distances and timelines.Secondly, space, a place that requires calculations and accuracy down to the millimeter. But we see Brad eyeballing his jump thru rocks and debris orbiting neptune, while holding a piece of sheet metal as a shield, yet perfectly nailing his jump and landing on his rocket.Sneaking into a rocket from a magical airlock near the thrusters after lift-off ? Erm.... NO!Discharging a firearm in a pressurised confined space travelling through deep space, hmm... what could go wrong?Using a nuclear explosion as propulsion? Science and logic both took a major hit there.I could rant on......Somewhere between the unexplained lunar pirates and unnecessary killer baboons, the storyline just fell flat. Even an actor as amazing as Brad Pitt could not save the movie. It is nothing more than a drama about daddy issues, the setting for which just happened to be space. The backdrop could easily have been an old people's home and it wouldn't have mattered.The people who have rated this film highly are wannabe intellectuals who are pretending to understand a ""deeper psychological meaning"" that just isn't there.

The transitions from one scene to the next aren't your cheap black screen cut, it's a smooth glide from a wide pan out to inside the rover visor.

The film could have been so much better if the director had listened to his science advisers (assuming he had any). Space has enough perils in itself that you don't need to add man eating space baboons or moon pirates to up the tension (think the spinning docking sequence in Interstellar as a good example).As an art film, I give it a 10.

2587,sophia_lanza-91761,Space: The Greatest Escape,10,24 September 2019,"Ad Astra propels the audience to the stars on an intense voyage to the farthest reaches of our solar system while penetrating deep into the innermost regions of our souls. The film does not pretend to be heart pounding or exhilarating, but rather maintains a heart seeking and calming approach much to the contrast of mainstream space films today. Ad Astra asks us to slow down, breath in and encounter the awe-inspiring images of our galaxy.Roy McBride (Brad Pitt) follows in his father's footsteps (Tommy Lee Jones) dedicating his life to space exploration as an astronaut with the USAF Space Division, aka ""Space Com."" In order to pass daily psychological exams Roy compartmentalizes his life leading him to a place void of emotion, yet full of loneliness and eventually rage.In this near distant future in which commercial flights to the moon are an everyday occurrence Roy boards a Virgin Galactic Spacecraft on the first leg of his journey to uncover the facts concerning his father's death or disappearance. In this world though secrets are many while truths are scarce. From the moon Roy is guided to an outpost on Mars amid pirate attacks, distressed aircrafts and death. On his quest Roy becomes overwhelmed by his desperation to learn what happened to his father and we gain a glimpse into his grief and the hope found in his own determination.Through intense monologues the film addresses the feeling of abandonment that has the ability to touch all fatherless children in the audience. Roy ponders, ""did it (space) break him or was he already broken?"" The challenges of Roy's mission unravel his controlled façade and he finally shows how truly shattered he is inside. This insight into a child's long-term reaction to parental rejection, along with his eventual act of letting go allows the audience to experience the freedom attained only with ultimate surrender.The audience will leave the theatre feeling connected to something greater than themselves, which should be the purpose of any good space film. The final word, ""submit"" drives home the moral of the story while reminding us to seek truth while clinging to faith and embracing emotions related to the human condition. Now ""go forth"" and enjoy the show!",Ad Astra

2591,johannh-32187,Yawn.,4,25 September 2019,You optimistically are sitting there waiting for the storyline line to get better and it just doesn't. All in all great actors with a crappy script,Ad Astra
2592,claybell-60972,Well at least Brad's still hot.,1,25 September 2019,"As long as you can handle massive plot holes that literally ruin all of the hard work done by the special effects people, it's OK to watch.
The holes start with a Major in the space command doing grunt work on a planet-based antenna. The bad science starts with needing to send our hero to Mars in order to send a message. Because ""security"".
Then there is roving bands of space pirates on the moon, a place where you can shoot someone from literally the other side of the moon, let alone anyone on the surface is easy to pick off from orbit. (Don't be a moon pirate kid's, you would have a 30 minute life span).
Next, it's off to Mars but hey, we've got tons of extra fuel to slow down and check on some random space station that's for no reason on the way (space is vast unless it interferes with meaningless sub plot drama).
Then there is a perfectly timed (for DRAMA) power surge that kills some ship systems when landing, so we get some hero time.
Then there is the epic insanity of climbing in a rocket that's accelerating towards Neptune. Apparently taking off on bad-movie-plot-mars is slow enough you don't pull multiple G's. Then there are the overly emotional crew, that suddenly turn on the famous major even though they keep dying or the idiocy of someone having a projectile weapon in a space craft. I can only assume the gun is due to more extraordinarily well funded and hard to shoot pirates.
Then it's on to Neptune, and we are cutting off communication because ""radio silence"". Clearly ships don't have comm lasers unless they were launched 30 years ago.
Next up, 80 days of ""SPACE MADNESS"", followed by a miraculous recovery in time to arrive at the major (broken) plot point.
Where we decide to wreck the shuttle pod (the only way back to my ship) because... no reason, we just need more drama and have this poorly thought out escape plan.
On to the next middle-finger-to-real-science we have Daddy who's been in zero-g for 30 years and it's zero-g for no reason other than it's cool to float around on wires so let's do MORE bad zero G.
Plot twist the random power surges are from an anti-mater reactor that is broken just enough to send power surges at key dramatic points AND it's not dad's fault.
You'll never guess how to fix said device that can end all life in the solar system! Yep, let's blow it up. and we will of course need a nuke, because killing the power to the magnet bottle that contains said anti-matter would be boring.
Our next lazy writing lack of surprise is... crazy old space coot is crazy, tries to kill himself while attached to only son, then wants' only son to let him go.. Whole thing should have ended right there.
But no, we have yet more bad physics on son's soft touch down back on major plot point that is no longer surging but must be destroyed.
And now! On to the worst and I mean worst escape plan ever. We are going to take a thin metal sheet off a rotating radar (yes, the radar was covered by metal) then just by jumping off the rotating (well established not on the same plane of travel) radar we are gonna jump back to our original ship, through the 1000+ miles of ice rings using said thin metal sheet as a shield, because in space, if you have a shield, you don't slow down when stuff hits you. Queue up high-speed impact into a spaceship that is clearly happening at bone crushing speed, but our hero not only doesn't bounce off in any kinda of actually real physics but ROLLS, I kid you not, ROLLS down the ship, in a space suit, and of course manages to grab the last rung of a ladder. All of this after traveling through the ice rings and all the gamma radiation.
Believe it or not, it gets worse. The solar system destroying anti-matter explosion now, due to the nuke somehow produces magic space forces to propel our hero home along with no debris to slice up his ship.

2596,ajd-31256,High Minded Drama with a Terrible Plot,2,26 September 2019,"Ad Astra is the latest in a series of psychological sci-fi movies with dramatic visuals, music, and premises. It's quite a shame that it can't live up to their standards.The entire plot hinges on mysterious bursts of energy emanating from Neptune, which have completely wrecked electronic transmissions across the civilized parts that humanity has managed to reach. Fortunately a station on mars is still working, so the protagonist is sent there by the people in charge of US Spacecom...If this is supposed to be some sort of commentary on military excess it certainly hits the nail on the head, but perhaps too hard that it might get missed by most members of the audience as stupid. Could he not have simply recorded his message on earth, then had a physical copy sent to mars for it to be transmitted? Unfortunately though had a smart person been in the room, the entire plot would've had no reason to happen. This simple fact alone makes this movie so utterly unbelievable and terrible that it's not worth watching at all.This transit from Earth to Mars seems to happen solely for the purpose of getting the main character to mars, not because he actually needs to be there. Why didn't he just start there? The entire first 30 minutes of the movie feel completely useless and unnecessary, and written by people who should not be writing movies, or even children's novels.Moon pirates? How does that make any sense? Where do they live? How do they survive in the harsh environment of the moon? The moon isn't just some place people can go and live easily, as it lacks certain things like... Water, Air, food... light... You know, just the basics for human life? Also why is everyone walking around on the ground so easily on the moon? That's not how lunar gravity works. There's enough to send you not flying into space but not enough to keep you from bouncing and jumping around with every step you take. If we're meant to believe they've mastered some sort of artificial gravity... why is it not also present on spaceships?Norwegian Space Baboons?I'm just going to leave that there, the sentence and thought are so absurd that it's very clearly nonsensical. Norway can not into space.The trip out is neat! He gets there and his dad is still alive having survived 16 years in space by himself. How? Who knows, that's an absurd amount of time for any person to survive without a food and water supply on a station that wasn't meant for that kind of habitation. I have no idea how this is possible and the movie doesn't try to explain either. Moving on!The nuclear explosion sending the ship home isn't as implausible as it sounds. NASA actually studied doing this for a long time but concluded that the harmful effects produced from the detonation of nuclear weapons made them unsuitable for use on planet earth (radiation kills people and causes cancer, go figure) However, using it in space where such problems don't exist would be possible.Despite this though, if you were to use a nuclear explosion as a means for generating velocity you would require proper shielding to not get vaporized by the blast---meaning the ship would need to be designed to handle this. Most spaceships are designed with a significant amount of radiation shielding to protect astronauts from the sun's radiation (on earth we have the Magnetosphere to do this for us) however it's very likely that this would be wholly insufficient to withstand the force of a nuclear blast, and would shred the ship, and even if they managed to survive, they would develop radiation sickness and die very quickly ( see chernobyl for an idea of what this looks like).Don't waste your money on this. If you're interested wait for it to get to netflix.",Ad Astra

It may even take longer to tear apart than the haphazard creation of it. Simply put, a story does not exist here. James Gray might have the worst eye/mind for detail of any successful director living. No other explanation can exist for how this movie turned out so utterly ridiculous. The ridiculousness of the horrifically bad science was only trumped by the dull agonizing tone. This movie warranted walking out on at the start of literally every new scene. If not for Brad Pitts usual great acting. I might not have made it through more than 15 minutes. As a huge fan of sci-fi this was simply one of the worst I've seen. And it was a true shame because it looked to have massive potential. This gains 1 star for Brad Pitts acting and 1 star for the occasional beautiful visuals.

2608,drewmac-94298,Amazing Cinematography but not for your Typical Audience,8,28 September 2019,"The acting and photography alone are more than enough for me to thoroughly enjoy it. The slow pace and metaphorical story will probably lose most people. I think the rule of thumb is that if you really like Marvel movies, you probably won't enjoy this.I usually like a slower pace and for movies to take their time with those really long shots and massive scales to weigh on audiences, but I get how that can be uncomfortable to sit through.The story was not as strong as the photography. I appreciate it for avoiding the tired binary good/bad win/lose plot of most movies. It does an excellent job of illustrating the cost of success and that success isn't always what we expect. However, some of the slower scenes were kind of unnecessary.My only gripe with it is that the representation of interplanetary travel was pretty weak. There are a lot of shots of rockets taking off, seemingly on a bee-line for the next planet. Anyone who's played Kerbal Space program knows that there's kind of an elegance to orbit transfers and gravity assists. Ad Astra misses out on that by depicting a planet-to-planet bee line. The staging doesn't make a whole lot of sense either. There are, of course, sound in space issues but they acknowledge it and consciously break the rules sometimes for the sake of a compelling scene, which is fine.Between Ad Astra and Interstellar, Interstellar is still my favorite but Ad Astra was a good watch.",Ad Astra

2614,imdb-62677,"Cliched plot, laughable physics but good acting",2,29 September 2019,"Ad Astra reviewIt's been a long time since I saw a film that was as big a waste of time, and as big a disappointment, especially after reading a number of glowing reviews, as this one. Even the film title doesn't work as none of the protagonists make it out of the solar system.Set in the near future, the motivation of the main character, Major Roy MacBride played by Brad Pitt, whose performance was the film's saving grace, was that he wanted to find his father - a hero to the rest of the world - but whom he hardly knew, and who had effectively left him emotionally disabled.It's a story arc we've seen many times, and its predictability lost my interest pretty early on. His father has gone rogue somewhere off Neptune and is sending deadly electrical surges sunwards into the rest of the solar system using anti-matter.One of the main problems concerned the setting of this humdrum story in space. I've become accustomed to Hollywood's playing fast and loose with the laws of physics but Ad Astra takes top spot by a country mile. People jump on and off spacecraft without a thought for the need for fuel or trajectory adjustments. Using a box of anti-matter, they send surges across billions of kilometres that result in things blowing up on Earth and Mars.Pitt's character needs to go to Mars to deliver a message to his dad - although he could have just recorded it and sent it to Mars, if that were truly necessary, using a radio upload. We can do that now.Laughably, they stop dead, mid-way to Mars to mount a rescue mission, find killer apes in a spaceship, and then proceed on to Mars. What happened before they got there and why the apes escaped are questions never answered - nor are we asked to care. In fact this whole episode could have been excised without altering the story arc one bit.A few days later they get there and MacBride has to take control of the ship to stop it crashing onto the surface of the planet. His aim is to stop the electrical surges so he then jumps aboard a spaceship that's on its way to Neptune - while it's in the process of taking off - and within minutes, the rest of the crew are dead, mashed by gravity or hit by a bullet fired from a gun. Not a likely object to find on board a pressurised vehicle.MacBride gets to Neptune after just 79 days (the New Horizons mission, which got to Pluto in 2015 took almost 10 years), and quickly finds his father's space station in orbit. After surviving multiple collisions with Neptune's ring particles, he sets up a nuclear explosive device to stop the surges but his dad doesn't want to leave and zooms off into space. Pitt's MacBride pulls off a piece of aluminium from the mission space station and surfs it back to his own spaceship - there are no problems with orbital mechanics nor any limit to the number of ring particle collisions a thin piece of aluminium can withstand. His ship is where he left it and the nuclear explosion propels him home, unharmed.When he gets back, his girlfriend, played by a grotesquely underused Liv Tyler, walks in the door just as he's rediscovering his emotions.The only thing that really worked in the film was Pitt's superb acting. While the film was well-produced, the complete lack of regard for even the basics of how the laws of physics work negated any joy that might have been taken from the visuals. The storyline was cliched and predictable, and would have been much better set here on Earth. His father could have been lost in the wilderness somewhere, for example, without the need for hokum such as electrical surges from Neptune.Don't bother seeing this film, you'll only be disappointed. Unless you are a huge fan of Brad pitt - there are lots of close-ups...",Ad Astra

2622,godwinjosh-25080,A Space Movie Not About Space,8,3 October 2019,"Most trailers and synopses are extremely misleading on the point of this movie. This is not a space adventure film for the average movie-goer to enjoy for thrills. It's much more about the human psyche and existentialism using the space setting as a catalyst for character development.Brad Pitt plays one of his best roles yet as a United States Space Command Major, seemingly orphaned as a young child, tasked with finding his missing father on the far reaches of the solar system. Originally cold, calculating, compartmentalized, his focus and only goal is the completion of his mission. He denies any emotional connections to his father and is incapable of forming relationships with those around him. Along his journey, his interactions and experiences with the characters he meets along the way make him begin to question his own existence and what he truly believes in.Ad Astra is a classic film disguised as a modern film. It may be slow paced, but the sheer wonder of the settings and the continuous inner struggle of the main character kept my eyes glued to the screen the entire time.",Ad Astra

Emotionally self-contained and self-sufficient, McBride finds safety in emotional autoregulation - a coping strategy that alienates him from his wife.As events unfold, Roy encounters unexpected allies who invite him into emotional co-regulation. Hence, the question posed by the film pertains to whether secure attachment is in Roy McBride's future.",Ad Astra

There are some parts that made the movie even worse for me it's like a weird mix of events that lead to a weird situations . Boring! I had a lot of expectations for this one, I think it's just disappointing to see how much money people invest in creating beautiful technology of space in a movie, and it's just boring movie, drama that doesn't go to anywhere . 4 people left the cinema in the middle of the movie which I could completely understand them.

The marketing led me to believe it was something like interstellar or a mix between that and a realistic drama. It is far from realistic.
In one scene they show a silent explotion and in another various sounds in space. It is all over the place. The story is dull and the point of it all is just uninteresting.It looks good though. Great visuals especially in the beginning.
It started out great and slowly dissapointments dropped in one after another and at the end of the movie I was just in a bad mood.
All these references to God? These are scientists and well educated people in the future. It just feels old in that aspect.
Why search for extra terrestrial life when you can stay on earth and close your eyes... not very forward thinking.I can't go in to the most annoying aspects without going in to spoilers but the most annoying thing is the message. Too bad.
The performances are ok. The visuals are really beautiful at times.

Isolation because of work, self-reflection, questioning your decisions, while never realising you were doing it all the time, constant race for more of this, more of that, do tend to drive people towards things they know and like.

But since the basic school up to high school I've been interested to physics. Later I've been able to have a telescope and started as a hobby, it obliged me to study more profoundly the solar system. Sounds of shootings on Moon ( a very common and unrealistic thing that is find in most sci-fi (?) movies) are so... I can't find a decent word. This is the first thing that insults my intelligence. As a former an awarded sci-fi author (it is no joke, I really am a multi-dimensional man) I would just give an a dvice to those second-hand screen players: if you are completely unfamiliar with the science data (7 weeks to Mars! and much others - Neptune is about ten times farther than the sun! - about 4 billions of km from Earth), then put a hand on a book: Ray Bradbury, Gerard Klein, or watch only two of the films directed by Andrey Tarkovski.

Not for me, but let's say yes.Does playing fast and loose with plot- and story-line, scientific fact, etc., constitute ""experimental"". That's not the word I'd use to describe it all, but I'll give that the nod too.The fact that I found this a mind-numbingly boring movie, as did a good many others apparently, seems to account for the ""rather than merely entertaining"" bit, although personally I'd qualify that and drop the ""merely"".The Latin title is something of a giveaway too.All things considered, I think I have to accept that it's intended to be arthouse.But here's the rub.

Brad Pitt does an ok job. Yep that is pretty much it.This movie is so goofy and far fetched from a basic science standpoint that it hurts to watch. Hardly know where to start- here goes:
The idea of a space station with a malfunction that is 2 billion miles from earth sending out some kind of electromagnetic pulses that violently disrupts everything on earth but leaves the source unaffected- wait, what?! Did anyone question for a minute how much energy that would take?And Brad is working on a tower that is attached to earth but reaches to the edge of space. But magically the tower stands unsupported by wires etcThen Brad goes to the moon to send a radio message to his dad- wait, what?! Why would he have to do that? I think it is so they can show the cool moon fight- that seems random.I swear Hollywood writers sit around smoking something and then start coming up with ideas - like ""yea, yea and then they can ride around in 60s era lunar rovers and shoot stuff at each other."" ""Yea, yea and then let's add some random Nordic crazed baboons"". "" And we can have Brad swim through a mile of water underground on Mars while wearing a full space suit and then come up just in time to grab on to a rocket that is taking off. Yea, yea that would be cool"" "" and we can have him grab on to a spinning antenna that will magically fling him directly towards his space ship with pinpoint accuracy,"" oh and he has to go through the rings of Neptune while holding a shield as he gets battered by debris in the rings ""yea yea that would be cool"".And then to get into his space ship that gets hit by a nuclear blast that pushes him with such force but with such accuracy that he can make it back to earth in the time it takes to grow a beard ""Yea, yea that would be cool""And in the end the conclusion is that there is no other life out there- which they figured out because they are near Neptune which is a pretty great place to study extraterrestrial life.Dear Hollywood types- please run your ideas by even a 6th grade science class.

2666,strawaphid,Ad Astra--An Interesting Peculiarity,7,27 December 2019,"Ad Astra is beautifully shot and composed, Brad Pitt's performance is subtle, and the themes of isolation, detachment, and loneliness are what made the movie for me. Pitt's internal monologues are an interesting, if annoying, aspect of the movie. There seemed to be too many of them, so it got annoying after a while. They are interesting when you consider detachment-he has no one else to tell how he feels, so he just speaks to himself. Finding his father, then, is his last attempt at finding someone in his life to connect to.The story is weird, however-moon pirates, a crazed space monkey, a never-ending Mars subplot. The Mars subplot does serve a narrative function, however, and that is to show the true purpose of the government's mission-kill Roy's father.All in all, this movie is worth watching if you have the time. It is not terribly exciting and sometimes the story is downright strange. The latter, while distracting for many people, is not the focus of the story. It was never about the moon pirates, space monkeys, or the Mars subplot. They are backdrops to explore the themes and show Roy's journey to find a connection with his long lost father.",Ad Astra

That, and it really makes it hard to get into the story when they throw in a plot element that is so absurdly stupid and unrelated that you sit there wondering if you've walked into a B-movie -- and they do this five or six times over.Finally, this film made me angry at the simple lack of respect for plausibility, continuity, or common sense. Is this really where we're at these days? There's no excuse for how bad the science is in this movie, for no good reason, nor is there any excuse for the cheap shot plot decorations and random bullsh**.

Internal monologue is much more central to the Ad Astra experience than any dialogue present (Perhaps aside from the most important message of the entire film spoken by Brad Pitt's character to his father (Tommy Lee Jones) in the last act.**Definite Spoiler Alert below**Decades of space adventure themed films have pushed the expectation that the discovery of extraterrestrial life would do one of three things to the human race: 1) create a unification of humanity to survive via conflict with extraterrestrials (think Independence Day), 2) humanity would erode into chaos due to the conflict (War of the Worlds), or 3) extraterrestrials (or in the case of the Interstellar, humans from the future) would provide technology / insight to further advance humanity (Arrival).Ad Astra seeks to examine a scenario which I have personally ruminated on for many years and which I have posed to those willing to listen: what if the Fermi Paradox isn't a fluke. What if we are alone? What are implications for organized religions and for humanity in general? Brad Pitt addresses this question succinctly when Tommy Lee Jones, distraught by the failure of the ultimate goal of the Lima Project to find extraterrestrial life by searching once out of the heliosphere (Yes, distances and travel times are completely unrealistic in Ad Astra, but I disgress). When faced with a reality that all of the Solar System moons visited and examined were devoid of life, Brad Pitt informs his father that he did not fail, instead, he succeeded in showing us that we are of God.So, there it is. A space film that touches on the sanctity of the possibility that humans are alone in the Universe, that life is unique, not an evolutionary numbers game certainty. In Ad Astra, that possibility seems likely due to the exhaustive measures that humans have taken in their search, the lack of success beginning to devolve humanity back into the time worn reality of materialistic conquest and the inner-conflict that inevitably follows.In the midst of the new likely reality that life on Earth is unique, that humans for that matter are unique, and that the present day popular belief that humans (or life on Earth for that matter) can't truly be special as it must be a statistical probability, Brad Pitt's character experiences an inner transformation from a self-reliant and inevitably selfish person into someone who realizes the value of societal interaction and co-dependency.The message of the film being that humans can't hold out hope that some external force will save us from our animalistic nature, our materialistic ways. We must embrace each other, be dependent upon all of humanity as a whole because its possible that we're all that we've got.From a visual standpoint, the film is beautiful in parts (we've seen Jupiter so many times (2001: A Space Odyssey) and Saturn (Interstellar) and Mars isn't pretty anyway (The Martian, Mars rovers Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity) but trust me, Neptune is absolutely gorgeous in this film. But don't go for the visuals because you'll likely feel cheated.The feel of this film is more The Thin Red Line and Apocalypse Now meets Blade Runner 2049 than Interstellar.Did I enjoy the film? Absolutely. I felt compelled to compose this to put my thoughts (which were present throughout the film and immediately afterwards) into words. I never did that with Interstellar (which is one of my favorite movies, btw), because I didn't need to. Somehow the fight against time (both in the climate effects being felt on Earth and also through the time / space relativity examples given throughout the film) which Interstellar presents wasn't as thought provoking to me as the the internal human struggle that Ad Astra presents.If you're into Led Zeppelin, Interstellar is to Kashmir as Ad Astra is to Stairway to Heaven.",Ad Astra

It hasnt the action of the classic sci-fi because its not meant to be focused just in the science.
It was all about what we currently experiencing as a society in fast changing planet. We all looking at the stars trying to find our next habbitable planet and we miss what we have here in our real home.
Brad Pit's perfomance was absolutely stunning, very emotional and realistic. The slow process of the plot isnt that tiring as I read and the photography along with the music cover was magnificent and dreamy. Despite the bad science and not being the typical sci fiction movie, try to see beyond that. Space is the best backround for a movie that want to show you how it really is to be isolated, alone and lost in a quest that the answer is most of the time is in front of us. We look at the stars to find the solution on the problem but the answer lies here.

First of all the visuals were amazing, but this is recognised by most reviewers, and must be admitted by everybody with eyes in the head. The rover hunt made me think of the Luna books of Ian Mc Donald
Secondly I found it an interesting mixture of sci-fi and psychological study, kind of 2001 meets Apocalypse now - while ad Astra is much more accessible.
Thirdly are the action scenes really excellent, how people could claim to ""fell asleep"" is unbelievable. This movie was never boring and the action scenes were jaw dropping.

2705,yakuzacat,A Really Excellent Kernel of a Story that Lacks Development,7,7 January 2021,"After reading several reviews, it appears there are roughly two camps: those who thought this was a deep, soul-searching movie with other elements (somewhat) unimportant, and those who lamented the poor story telling and were appalled by the beyond-flawed science. They're both correct.For me, most truly masterful moves combine a strong story (that may stand on its own) with at least one deeper layer/message. Examples frequently mentioned in these reviews being 2001, Bladerunner (in my opinion, both original and 2049), and Apocalypse Now. This movie is not masterful, but my husband and I found it provided an engaging evening's entertainment, hence my score.Positives
I give the movie substantial points for returning to a story of the human condition and trying to tackle larger questions. What's it about? I agree with ""song-arizona"" and ""Joe Yabuki"", it explores how an individual recognizes and attempts to conquer his inner hollowness/deadness/emptiness. He wants to feel, to connect with others, but can't; beyond professional accomplishment, where he ""hides"", he feels no true reason to live. Is this emptiness a result of his father's abandonment or is it because of the larger lack of hope/purpose that pervades our society (and his father is simply a symbol), you decide if it's either reason or both. His father was desperately trying to find/validate ""God"", ie, a reason/purpose, through finding life elsewhere. Dad fails because his lens is so limited he can't see the awe/beauty/magnificence that he has discovered (and has always been around him), which could be a spiritual message if you choose to use that lens. Our protagonist first uses external goals to exist; then, facing his father-and realizing where his father has failed-he sees how he can move forward differently. At one point he literally (but quietly) makes an internal decision to live. Does he have an awakening or simply gain enough to see the next steps forward, again the viewer must decide.Pitt deserves to be lauded for a performance that carried the movie, Jones also made a nearly impossible brief role impactful. Sutherland and Tyler were admirable being given nothing to work with.Many have commented on the movie's beauty. It is indeed lovely and more importantly reinforces the story's main point. The use of symbolic color was fine, but not inspired.As I mention above, there was enough here to keep my husband and me entertained.Negatives
The co-writer/Director could have given decent nods to scientific accuracy and a solid plot; he didn't. It's important because some scenes/events are so kluged and/or ridiculous they detract from the overall movie. See other reviews for myriad examples. How much of this was from studio interference we'll never know, but the way the movie progresses leads me to think the story was lacking from inception. The repeated referencing of greater movies/stories underscored the lack of creativity and depth in this work.To me it seems somehow sadly poetic that this movie received major praise from reviewers; are we really so shallow and desperate to find meaning that we'll wildly cheer anything even remotely resembling quality?

Without any plot points, so as to avoid spoilers, those who are sensitive to obsessive, compulsive, or neuroatypical sociopathy or narcissistic personality disorders may want to give this a pass. It will absolutely stir up some deeply familiar, and consequently troubling, feelings. I award stars for technical expertise in this case, but I absolutely did not enjoy the film because of its relentless, ambient-trance quality of immersion in the paranoia, exceptionalism, and falsity of the obsessive mind.

I get that that's how life is, but that's not why I started a movie tonight.

When I first heard about this movie I expected that too.This is not a Sci-fi action film. This is a psychological, heart of darkness esque, drama that is simply using the Sci-Fi setting as a backdrop to analyze depression, loneliness, and the value of interpersonal relationships.This is a good film and enjoyable if you have an open mind and don't let preconceptions disappoint you.The plot is a lot like heart of darkness esque films. Think Apocalypse Now. It follows a depressed and isolated man as he fights his mental battles that are manifested both internally and externally delving deeper and deeper into isolation and depression.I think one reasonable complaint about this film is its slow and the energy is very flat. By this I mean the plot never really spikes it maintains a constant drone through out the film. I will defend this by saying that anyone who as experienced depression knows that depression is a constant state of low with little deviation from that state. As such I think it is fair that this film about depression has that type of energy.In short this film is okay. Go into it with an open mind. It is not uncommon for Sci-Fi to use it's fantastical setting as a way to comment on humanity in some way (1984, starship troopers). This is what this Ad Astra is.",Ad Astra

If Clifford was alone for decades, how has his hair remained a structured shag? Why does Roy's beard grow (fairly slowly), but his haircut remains a beautiful sight? Why do the energy spikes kill the electronics - except when Roy need to travel across the galaxy?

2749,qeljorr-kenobi,"A masterpiece, but not a science fiction (more like a psychological drama)",9,22 September 2019,"I marvel at the many negative criticisms. Especially in terms of realism. After all, there are plenty of unrealistic, nonsensical, and illogical scenes in Interstellar, but it doesn't appear in the ratings. In fact, for some reason, just about everyone just praised it. Don't get me wrong. For me, it is one of my favorites. But to be honest, Inetrstellar does contain more of the Hollywood blockbuster elements than Ad Astra.
I think this movie is obviously not realistic at all, but damn, nobody has ever colonized the Moon and Mars, and nobody has ever been to Neptune. It's a fantasy movie, a fiction. What's more, there are plenty of classic, well-known science fiction novels to include elements that wouldn't fit into the science world and could be snapped up.In fact, I feel that this movie brings a lot of emotion and thought to it if we let it go. Actually, we're not talking about a science fiction movie, but a psychological drama put in such a robe. It's all about one basic idea, that's true. But it is also true that this is a problem that plagues millions of people throughout their lives, so the film reveals a simple yet extremely diverse and profound thought. If we are not looking for space realism in the film, and not even for real life events, but as a kind of psychological journey and approaching the film as a whole in a childlike way, we can even understand why it is so important with this simple, cliché message to deal so deeply. Because it's actually the same process as any learning. Slowly and gradually, one learns to jump over an obstacle that is, in fact, extremely simple, yet impossible and man-trying.I don't even consider badly-written dialogues to be badly written. Here, however, we should not even compare it to real-life dialogues (just as the scientific background in this film should not be taken too strictly to understand what it has to say). It's a feature film, not a documentary. Here, using the effects of the cinema, they try to evoke a feeling in people that the artist tries to bring to the viewer the emotions and thoughts he has created.For a long time, I felt such intense emotions as in this movie. Most recently in the Interstellar. I think there were two scenes that had a similar effect on me. Here in Ad Astra at least twice as many times. In this case, however, I felt that there was somehow a constant transition between the scenes that caused the emotional outbursts to be felt throughout.And the acting of the cast was just phenomenal for both Brad Pitt and Tommy Lee Jones. (And I've never been a particular fan of either of them, until now.) Their first encounter was simply breathtaking. What a tension, a lot of uncertainty, how much emotion in one short scene.Let's take a look at the end of the movie where Roy has to let go of his father. For me (applying the attitude detailed above to myself while watching the movie) it was a cathartic scene. Many people here criticize the lack of clarity and panty of the dialogue, while I think it was the most honest scene in the whole movie. Here was the opportunity for most of the feelings to burst, and then a huge amount of thought and questions could circulate through the viewer's mind. It is precisely because of the plain text that seems incomplete. After all, it gave the viewer the opportunity, in a very cathartic way (now deliberately without narration), of this free emotional outbreak. Inexpressible, (interesting from a psychological point of view), but at the same time, thousands of thoughts and feelings of remorse, insecurity, incomprehensibility and, at the same time, grotesque liberating remission due to our human weakness and limitations, may fall upon the viewer.
I think that's why this movie is unique, and that's why I see it as a masterpiece, even if the audience that is socialized in today's Marvel movies doesn't really discover it all. (Honorable exceptions. I love comic books very much. Only they cannot evoke such deep emotions and thoughts as a more serious film like Ad Astra. This is a completely different category, made for a completely different purpose.)As a final remark, I would like to point out that the music (contrary to the opinion of many) perfectly signed all the emotional charge that strongly characterized the whole movie. It was simply the perfect backdrop for everything that you would want to experience while watching this movie.I wasn't bored for a minute. Time just flew with this movie.

2752,BadgeringTheWitness,Bring back the baboons,6,27 October 2019,"Visually magnificent, everything else a chore and a bore. The story is too shallow to carry the movie far along. It's not that I couldn't follow the Freudian nuances of a son's (non?) relationship with his father. More, I couldn't be bothered making the effort of jumping that angst-ridden chasm. I hadn't been made to care enough about the characters, Liv Tyler's yearning filled glances notwithstanding.
Other reviewers here have tabulated the science bloopers that mar a film that looks so right. So I'll just stick to how the plot became more of a plod.
""2001 a Space Odyssey"" showed that space can be, even should be, if not slow, then at least casual. Ad Astra slows that casual down until it is almost a dirge. The only real excitement and concern for the main character came from his confrontation with what I presumed were escaped experimental baboons on a distressed medical research ship. Perhaps it would have better to have worked them into a much larger, and therefore, more interesting film.
Watching Ad Astra,I at first thought it might be a remake of ""Heart of Darkness/ Apocalypse Now"". A trek to find a rogue hero turned villain. reinforced by Pitt's character initially not wanting to respond to the baboon ship's mayday. Shades of the Mekong's puppy in the junk. But no, it diverges from that into a somnolent journey to Father-Son angst.

This story should have taken place on a ranch in Texas.Examples of ridiculous space things
The space antenna made no sense. The entire antenna seems to have been built for two dinky satellite dishes, in which case they could have just launched and out those dishes in orbit. Stupid.
If the station on the moon was developed enough to have a Subway sandwich franchise, why did the rovers they used look like rovers from the Apollo era? No armored personnel carriers?The biomedical station that stop at on the way to Mars has no reason to be there. That's pretty extreme deep space.

2776,zerkalofan,"The Superhuman ""Cool"" of Brad Pitt",7,27 September 2019,"Ad Astra is a superhero movie masquerading as a space odyssey with a fair amount of Freudian baggage thrown in. The basic structure of the plot is a hero's journey in which we are taken through the various stages of Brad's subconscious as he catapults through space-from the Donald Sutherland ""superego"" dying off to the confrontation with his id in the form of a baboon research specimen stranded in an abandoned space station. Each episode of the film stages a different conflict within Brad's psychology, all of which lead to the final showdown with his father, the big Other, who is played by Tommy Lee Jones.Jones is a Zeus-like figure who sends thunder bolts down from heaven onto the Earth. Instead of simply providing a device for expressing the psychological conflict between father and son, the electric disturbances Tommy Lee Jones sends down are the literal thunder bolts of an Olympian God or the death ray of a Lex Luther-like villain. He is also Lex-Luther like in that the electric disturbances threatening the Earth are being produced by the changes he has made to his spacecraft, as if he were a mad scientist. The Freudian influences get so mixed up with the Greek and Marvel that it is clear we are not in strictly psychological territory when watching this film, as many other reviews have suggested. David Gray's film is no less mythological superhero movie than it is space odyssey.The scene which gives away this more literal reading takes place when Brad Pitt's character launches himself off of a rotating antenna and hurtles through the rings of Saturn using a makeshift shield to protect himself. This is not realistic at all-he is like Captain America in it-and yet we are meant to believe it as realistic within the fictional world of the film, which follows the same physical laws as our own universe. This scene gives away the fact that this film is in the fantasy genre and not science fiction. Once we recognize its fantastical character, we come to realize the whole film is a myth.Though we are only ever told Brad Pitt's character has an uncannily low heart rate which allows him to keep cool under pressure, what we are asked to believe of him defies reason. The feats he performs are more clearly on par with what we might expect from the Man of Steel and not an especially ""cool"" astronaut. In fact, astronauts become superheroes within the mythology of the film.In the very first scene, we see Brad Pitt falling from an extremely tall tower after the electrical disturbances from space have destabilized it. We then come to find out these disturbances are being produced by Tommy Lee Jones, which reinforces the dynamic which I have just described in which Jones acts more as villain to Brad's superhero than father to his son. These disturbances are clearly an aggressive act and not accidental as they are meant to be portrayed at first. The subtext already here in this early scene is that Brad is extraordinary.Like Oedipus, Brad sets out on quest to find his father only to find out halfway through that he is actually going to kill him. The resemblance remains on the level of plot structure and not psychological analysis, however. The Freudian allusions in the film are only included to throw us off from recognizing the more literal understanding of the film, which I have been presenting. Since, as moderns, we are not allowed to take our mythology straight, we must have it cut with some psychobabble in order to enjoy it with a properly blasé attitude.But the joy of this film is precisely its retreat from psychoanalytic interpretations and fin-de-siècle ennui. The film is exciting not because of its ""intellectualisms,"" but despite them. Unlike many ponderous space odysseys in which men contemplate their insignificance existentially, in Ad Astra, Brad is not portrayed as insignificant but as extremely significant through his heroic acts. Although, by all appearances, a ""normal"" man, Brad is, in fact, extraordinary. His extraordinariness helps the audience to believe they could be extraordinary too by example. The film helps to reinvigorate our belief in heroes like another Pitt movie this year, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, in which Brad's character, Clint Booth, unbelievably defeats Bruce Lee in hand-to-hand combat as an example of his heroic, extraordinary capabilities.Brad literalizes the film's rejection of existentialism by responding to his father that ""we are all we ever had"" after Jones displays his contempt for mankind as a result of his failure to find any other form of consciousness in the universe. Brad's riposte becomes a mantra for the film: ""we are all we ever had,"" meaning: don't take what you have for granted. In the context of the film's denouement, this translates to Brad's character realizing he needs to appreciate his wife more; but in the context of our historical moment, it might mean something more like looking less to the stars (or the future) for solutions and instead paying more attention to the here and now and the everyday.Returning to the action of the film, the lunar buggy chase scene further confirms the commitment of the film to the fantastic and not the rational. In it, we see not a depiction a realistic scene but rather the daydream of a child, who, on the brink of sleep, imagines things that are not really there-space pirates emerging implausibly from behind a lunar hill.Indeed, what makes Ad Astra work is its willingness to indulge in the imaginative. The fact that the lunar base has a Virgin Atlantic advertisement plastered on its outside is a welcome reminder of the kind of space movies that used to get made (Total Recall comes to mind immediately). Despite the ""cheapness"" of such gags, this kind of kitsch is actually preferable to the pretentiousness of other space films that portray our future as progressive. Ad Astra satirizes the familiar utopic elements of the space genre by using these banal sight gags to remind us that the world will be no better in space because we cannot escape ourselves. The scene in which Brad boards a space shuttle resembling a commercial airline is further proof of this. When he asks for a blanket and pillow package he is told will cost $125, which is a familiar form of on-board extortion for anyone who has ever flown coach. The fact that the moon base looks like a New York subway station is also a reminder of our terrestrial limits. The fact that the transmission room where Brad sends a message to his father resembles a recording studio reinforces the idea that our speculation about space travel is bound by experiences on earth. Unlike most coldly rationalistic scientific space odysseys, Ad Astra embraces the social-historical over the rational-scientific. All of the foibles that plague our daily lives are transported to space with us.Tommy Lee Jones' character fails to discover any signs of conscious life in the universe outside of humankind. In the context of the film's stylistic choices, this serves to reinforce the idea that our consciousness limits our perception to only that which is a part of it. There may in fact be other conscious life-forms in the universe, but we are incapable of perceiving them because we are in little siloes within our heads which only allow us to recognize other things that are human as well. That is the message of Brad Pitt's statement ""we are all we ever had.""At the end of the film, while floating in space pondering the greatest existential question of all, ""what is life worth living for?"" Brad then sees the Earth and immediately decides to continue. We are meant to deduce that Earth is what he believes life is worth living for, that Earth is the only basis for life and the only place where a real life can be lived. The film, therefore, rejects the rarefied realm of Tommy Lee Jones' meandering philosophical discourse on God. The only Gods depicted in this film are men, particularly Brad and Tommy, bringing us again to a Greek depiction of metaphysics and not a Judeo-Christian or existentialist one.The deus ex machina of Brad's atomic wave-ride home defies the internal logic of the film's physics established through the previous sequence of events and further convinces us of the film's overall disinterest in scientific investigation. The film chooses to ignore plausibility in order to stay true to its superhero-epic subtext. What makes the film interesting and effective, although disappointing to hardcore science fiction fans, is that it mixes the genres to produce something new.Unfortunately, however, the film exhibits some of the typical clichés that define the space genre. The minority, specifically black, characters are the first to be killed, and the ending has a suspenseful scene in which a person on a tether to a spacecraft is yanked into the gaping abyss of space. In a movie trying so hard to defy the conventions of the space genre, it is a wonder why they included these two.",Ad Astra

From the little information we get I imagine it could be just an automated thing with no issues, no human personnel needed.Even if you are a sci-fan, don't watch this.

2780,E-Birchman,A well-made movie about masculinity,7,15 February 2020,"I think people on here who are so severely disappointed with this movie, were expecting something very different, to do with the sci-fi-genre... But I'd compare this movie with other stories set in space that aren't very much concerned with the sci-fi-genre, like High Life, and contend that it's not a very novel idea to stray from the scientific aspect, yet borrow from that setting. I'd say this is a movie exploring the psychological harms and pressures that come with embodying the masculine ideal. Astronauts symbolise that ideal, at least in this movie, they are the height of masculinity in modern society: proactive, competent, emotionally self-sufficient, self-isolating... Warriors minus the war. And Brad Pitt's performance really connects with that, in my opinion. It showcases a similar mentality as Jeremy Renner's character in The Hurt Locker, or even the protagonist in Manchester by the Sea, which I really appreciate. If you're interested in stories about modern masculinity, or just love watching beautiful visuals of space and space travel, then you should watch this movie. If you're looking for something with scientific accuracy and a plot that fits into a more conventional action/sci-fi-category, then you might want to give this one a pass.",Ad Astra
2781,carlo-wood,Pretentious nonsense,1,20 September 2019,Saw this film yesterday and I still can't believe that I sat through the full two hours without leaving. My only excuse is that I foolishly believed something would eventually happen but no just one dull dreary scene after another. Have read previous reviews that suggest this is an exploration of the the father son relationship but how could there possibly be any such relationship between the two when they never really coexisted together for any real time.

2782,duffers1831,Why are people saying this is good.,1,18 September 2019,"Movie rant. Sorry!Ad Astra. Who is saying this film is good? Are you kidding me it rates on my top ten worst films of all time list.Spoilers ahead, don't read if you're planning to see this god awful film.
Things wrong with this film.Brad Pitt was pegged as some super dude, doesn't panic, heart rate doesn't go above 80 robot until he thinks about his dad. Then he becomes an emotional wreck.On the way to Mars they have to stop and nip on board a space craft that's been taken over by angry space monkeys. The only reason this was here was to kill off the captain so that brad Pitt could land the space ship when things got bumpy (because the second in command was to scared to touch the controls?)Throughout the entire film there was no feeling of the vastness of space. In fact it made it feel like Jupiter and Neptune were just down the road.Moon pirates, what were they about? What was their goal when attacking them. Some suggestion of hostage taking which is weird cause it seemed like they were trying to kill them all?You won't get to Neptune without me? Erm I'm pretty sure they would have and accomplished exactly the same goal. Guess you didn't need to kill them all after all brad? But it's ok because when you get back to Earth all will be forgiven, forgotten, well one of them.The heroic leap from one space ship to another using a panel to deflect all of Neptune's ring rocks. Erm not sure that would work. Hold it gets better. I'm going to use the nuclear explosion to propel me home. Erm....... no.Tommy Lee Jones after spending god knows how many years on the space ship trying to achieve his goal of finding aliens going so far as to kill his crew so that he could carry on. Just leaves without any fuss. Oh no changed my mind I'd prefer it if I just floated off into space. Ok dad see you later.The upshot is this feels like one of those films that's a really slow build up with a massive twist at the end. However there's no massive twist. Nothing is really explained and all of it is really unnecessary. It just ends.I developed no emotional attachment to any of the characters. The story arc is stupid, the acts the lead character accomplish are unbelievable and his part in the story was unimportant. (They would have gone anyway, found the ship, blown it up and the unexplained thing that was going to kill us all would have been stopped)It is beyond me how it's rated so high and if anyone can explain what I missed or how this is actually a good film I'm willing to hear it.",Ad Astra

On top of that a friend told me it was a bit like Event Horizon, so I expected something like scary space story or at least good sci-fi and science. I got none of that. Through the film there is so many plot and science holes.. Some examples:Boarding a rocket at launch 5 meters from the engine exhaust ? You would die from heat and vibration instantly wtf was that. In an actual rocket launch on earth you would die even 100 meters from the rocket.You arrive at the moon terminal and the gravity looks exactly like gravity on earth. Yet when they go out with the rover the gravity is moon-like. What is happening inside ? Is there some kind of Gravity enhancer ? Doesn't make sense.Moon rovers look shitty considering we are in the futureWhat about the monkeys ? This scene is so unnecessary.Pirate on the moon ? Seriously ?Why boarding the final rocket at all if he actually wanted to do the mission and destroy the target. 3 dead for nothingOn the other hand, the movie is beautiful though and well acted.I wanted more. More scicence, more story climax more mystery. When he arrives in the final ship, there is nothing special to discover here.

2791,denabhoth,Failed to reach the target,4,22 September 2019,"Spoiler, at least I think,this movie is very interesting in several ways while completely failing to fulfill the promises given by its initial setupshort summary: a visually stunning offshoot of THX1138, 2001 Space Odyssey and plot wise disappointment of Apocalypse Now expansion into Greek mythology (Oedipus).Longer version: the movie is a neo-noir take on, on something not very well defined. A successful military professional full of doubts about himself at age over 50??? Brad plays well a psychologically unsure veteran - sort of veteran - that is not given script and plot wise to express and develop his fears. The script is focusing alternatively on empty space, random shootout on moon and some flashbacks instead of developing into what could have indeed been a Apocalypse Now in space, if only the actors and the plot was given more air to breathe.
the sci-fi: actually useless. As the movie stands the sci-fi is for all intents and purposes as decorative as the explicit use of dark colors. Purely esthetic and could be easily removed ad changed into a tropical jungle context. With exactly the same result.The under-under ending. So everyone is good and the genius scientist could not just blow the ship by himself?? While he seems to be evil he also seemed to understand that it is over. So why he did not do the deed by himself? It was not the Marlon Brando situation where the king was leading hordes of followers ready to dismantle the humanity for him.The missed opportunity to use Brad. Old Brad is indeed ideal candidate for this movie. But he was not given the possibility to become the next Sheen.

The actors performances are really low except Brad Pitt's which is quite ok. It seems he did maximum he could in this case. But still it is one long boring crap. I almost fallen asleap in the cinema.

Space monkeyYep, space monkey. Really. Honestly. I would not lie to you IMDB review reader.There are literally space monkeys in this movie & for no real discernible reason other than to maybe (???) add so ""action"" to this 2+ hour Brad Pitt monologue. I can only assume that writer, director, & producer, James Gray needed some crazy space attack to break the monotony of his ""daddy didn't hug me enough"" space drama, so he used the tried & true "" a different space ship in danger, let us divert from our time sensitive mission to save humanity by investigating this distress call from an unresponsive ship"" plot engine.What's the big payoff?Space...freaking...monkeys!Now, I would have easily allowed for this & not dwelled angrily on it for the duration of the film if;
James Gray had pulled his pretentious head from his equally arrogant behind & made a tongue in cheek reference to said space monkeys.Golden opportunity squandered!
Brad Pitt references space monkeys in Fight Club! Ha! Hilarious!
Brad Pitt had a crazy role in a futuristic sci-fi film called 12 Monkeys! A little more subtle, but still could have been comedy gold.Nope. Nothing. Just an unreasonable & unwanted use of literal space monkeys.Space odyssey? Cool.
Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland acting chops? Sweet!
Liv Tyler Armageddon B-roll recycled for a different love interest with daddy issues via vintage NASA space Comms? Ummm, okay I guess.
Killer space monkeys?!You lost me at killer space monkeys.So, in summary: James Gray needs to stop writing, directing, &/or producing films for a while. He needs to focus on reconnecting with his dad & finally get that hug, so he can go do...literally anything else.
Literally anything else. The fact that he was able to get this movie funded & brought to any screen is an inspiration to me. It should be to you as well, person that has read all of this review. You made it this far & apparently care about the films you're going to invest in. Skip this terrible film with ""amazing cinematics"" (here is the spoiler, they're really not that amazing) & go spend 2+ hours on your own screenplay! If this narcissus can get this film made, just think of how easy it should be for you to get your movie picked up!Get out there & make something of yourself.**just don't use f'ing space monkeys...unless they're hilarious or you're working on the next Planet of the Apes reboot.",Ad Astra

Whilst the action scenes are visually dramatic they have little emotional impact and no feeling of payoff at the end.
A guy behind me in the cinema was snoring for a full hour - it was literally that boring.It's not a psychodrama, neither is it a sci-fi film. It's just a very dull father son story with no reason for being in space and no resolution at the end.",Ad Astra
2837,dmytro-kostiuchenko,"I get the ""philosophical"" part...",3,31 January 2020,"Believe me, I love psychological movies.
I love slow movies.
I love movies, that are intentionally unreallistic.And I do see the metaphors and analogies, how loneliness of a single human symbolises loneliness of entire humankind, and how we, humans, should make conclusions and live with what we have.But all that is just too flat, too obvious to justify weakly implemented setting.Maybe that was the intention on its own: trim decorations to the essential minimum to make the main point more accessible.But it did not work that well for me. I just can't stop thinking how amazingly entertaining this movie would be if they brought more realism into it.Ok, let them mess with the duration of the travel, if they accounted for that, timeline would get completely screwed... I'd eageraly accepted an assumption, that people invented some way to travel fast...But so many small opportunities are missed!
Roy helps his father to get into space suit. Gosh, make him comment, how father's suit is old and how helmet is ancient and how they don't make those anymore. It's been dozens of years and their suits look the same!Body of the father is unaffected by many years of zero gravity. ""Enduring hardships"" he says! And yet we see a groomed fit man after so much time spent on the space station...I give it 4 stars only because the main idea of the movie resonates quite well with my own worldview.

It's like someone took Space Cowboys, put it in a blender with Geo-storm and pretty much called it a day. Don't EVEN get me started on the science. How does one kick a space capsule off his foot like he's kicking off a pair of slippers? Clearly they did not have a budget for science advisors or a budget in general. I've seen better movies come out of a Sci-Fi channel. I completely get what is was trying to represent and where the movie was trying to go. It just didn't go there. How bad? I feel like Brad Pitt had to pay something off so he Nick Cage'd it and took the it just to make money and Tommy Lee just flat out lost a bet and had to do it. That's how bad.",Ad Astra

In Ad Astra, through the plotline, everything was so far away from the feeling of realism, that I believed Roy is dreaming of all the story under neurosis. All the time, I waited for the movie to make this plot twist in a smart way (which would also be hard to tackle). I'm still not sure if it would be a bigger disappointment to end everything as a delirium of Roy after first fall incident...

2866,leequentel,Ad Disastra!,4,7 December 2019,"This is a hopeless movie. And, I mean that in it's flat catatonic vibe; it's completely undeveloped story; and its shoddy execution as a big budget sci-fi drama.I wonder if the movie was originally longer, but substantially cut down in size due to to pressures from the movie studio akin to Event Horizon. At least with Event Horizon the edits worked alright. In contrast, Ad Astra jumps choppily from sub- plot to sub-plot where none of movie chapters or characters are meaningfully explored.The opening chapter with the space elevator and fall was pretty cool, but it was never shown from a real distance which would have enhanced the enormity and technological significance of realizing such an apparatus.The opposite problem occurs with the moon buggy chase chapter. The space pirates are shown from such a far distance 99% of the time that they and their motives are rendered wholly insignificant.Things get worse. For one, astronaut Roy McBride's Character is superficially developed and we really know nothing about him. We know even less about his father, Clifford McBride, and why the hell he has been piddling around Neptune for 15 years. Of all the places in the solar system, I doubt Neptune would be the place to set up camp to search for alien life. Sure, Neptune's moon Titon is interesting, and Neptune emits more energy than it gets from the sun. Who knows? Maybe they thought they'd run into the Event Horizon!Finally, the icing on the cake... Everyone can go home as we can now conclude there is, definitively, no other life in the universe!Oh, wait, could there be some value in looking at the trillion trillion or more other solar systems out there? Nah!The astronauts McBride would not be my first choices to be detectives!Finally, the ending reveal and ""climactic"" revelations are handled with all the fanfare of a late night diaper run to the Seven Eleven where one finds that the store is closed...Oh well, we might as well just head back...

The story is thin and there is heavy reliance on movie logic, thing happen because the story need them to, and disregard for science. However, none of that is what this movie is trying to do.

I like films that bend my genre expectations, but only if the end result is truly revealing and meaningful, and I found that quite absent in Ad Astra. Yes, there were some moments of great drama (McBride's first fall to earth), some of significant (not great) beauty (including a second-rate pastiche of Doug Trumbull and Dan Glass), some of great humanity (the pathos of Ruth Negga was definitely Oscar-worthy), but none of them were stitched together into a great film.

The father being a lead pioneer of space exploration and being so sucked into this outer world not caring about family and being so attracted to the idea of other extraterrestrial life with greater intelligance than that of a human. Great foreshadowing used throught the film and really touching moments. brad pitts character having family issues just like his father not loving his son, he is not the best husband toward his wife, not being with her alot as he is also sucked into this outer space adds alot of depth toward his character. Brad pitt gives a excellent performance in this film and really he's really giving his all in this.

On par with the ""Big Black Dog"" short that can be found on YouTube. If you don't or haven't suffered debilitating depression before this movie will go right over your head.

2950,landonparks,Character-driven space film that is almost slow to a fault,6,26 September 2019,"Ad Astra is one of those movies that you'll either love or fall asleep during. I saw it twice in IMAX, and the second time I actually surveilled the audience during some parts of the movie. The people directly behind me where in and out of sleep (complete with occasional snoring), while the people sitting in the same row several seats over where on the edge of their seat. I think this sums up the movie pretty well.It's slow moving, VERY slow in fact. It's a very character driven story, and most of the movie is about Brad Pitt's inner monologue with himself. The movie follows the character of McBride (Pitt) religiously, to the point that none of the other characters even needed to be in the movie except as a plot device to move Pitts character along the arc.You might think I hated the movie... But that is not the case. The story is very captivating the first time you see it. While it is very slow, it stills keeps enough tensions and action to keep you intrigued throughout the story.The only other complaint I have about the story is that it is VERY linear... It hits all the beats it needs to hit in just the right order - which makes for a very tight story, but also one that feels like you are simply hitting milestones along the way to get to the big ending scene.Overall, it's not my favorite space-themed movie. It is pretty slow moving, relies almost entirely on a single characters inner monologue to drive the story - much like a one-man drama play, and lacks any real action taking place except in a couple of places where the action felt like it was just there to make sure you stayed awake between the slow parts.Ultimately, Ad Astra gets a 6/10 for me. It's a good movie that will keep you intrigued considering you like character driven movies and don't require a constantly moving plot... However, there are much better space-themed movies out there that also rely on 'one man's story', like 'Interstellar' and even 'The Astronaut Farmer'. If you want a space movie with action, this is not it. If you want a space movie that uses beautiful, lifelike imagery and very 'real' space travel concepts, and also like a character driven plot - this is the movie for you. It REALLY does feel like you are along on the mission with Pitt, for better or wose.",Ad Astra

Even comparing it to movies like Interstellar, The Martian, Moon, etc. is a huge insult to those movies.As many others have mentioned, the storyline is insanity and makes zero sense. Everything that happens is just setting up the next visual set piece, whether that be a lunar rover chase along the moon's surface, to Brad Pitt crouching on a spinning solar array and eyeballing a jump through the debris of Neptune's rings to get back to his ship. While the visuals certainly look nice (although they seem rather bland compared to those in Interstellar), that's about all this movie has going for it.The complete absence of any kind of scientific accuracy and the noticeably repeated pointless praying throughout the movie made me wonder whether this movie was intended as some kind of strange Christian propaganda film. For a movie purportedly about space exploration, it seems to treat the concept as pointless and laughable.Most of the characters in the movie (and it's generous to call them that) didn't really need to be there at all. The one and only arc is that of Brad Pitt's character, who goes through his life an emotionless robot dedicated to exploring space, and by the end of the movie finds out humans are alone in the universe, so he should get back with his ex wife.I went into the movie knowing it wouldn't be great, but I was not prepared for this level of awful.

This isn't an action film with lots of kabooms, although there is definitely some good action in it.Why I give a 7 star rating in the end is the questions about humankind and our individual lives that are brought up in the film. Do we continually search for something outside of ourselves when what we are truly seeking has been in front of us the entire time? Are we constantly looking for something bigger and better?

If you're going in expecting a sci-fi film like Gravity or Interstellar with huge action set pieces, shocking plot twists and edge-of-your-seat moments, you're going into the wrong movie. This is an epic character-driven drama disguised as a sci-fi film, It poses very important questions about humanity's venture to the stars and how we've might've been looking in the wrong direction the whole time. Maybe it's unwise of humanity to search the stars for something to save us or to give us meaning, while ignoring what's happening to humanity in the meantime. That's a chilling thought. The entire movie was shot on 35mm film, giving it that realistic feel with the film grain not being removed. The cinematography is ASTOUNDING along with the beautiful colour palette used in the film. Overall, Ad Astra is one of the best movies of this decade and definitely one of the best sci-fi films of all time in my opinion.

2974,fabaden,There is no easy way from the Earth to the stars...,8,9 October 2019,"In Hercules Furens, Seneca the Younger wrote: ""non est ad astra mollis e terris via (there is no easy way from the earth to the stars). In ""the near future"", despite paying $125 for a blanket and pillow on a commercial flight to the moon, that has changed. However, I don't believe our title Ad Astra refers to the logistics of reaching the furthest planets of our solar system, but instead relates the metaphorical distances humans must travel to ""reach"" loved ones who have left us behind. Necessary bonds, like the kind between a father and son, get sacrificed to the Gods of progress, career, glory, science, or whatever we justify as nobler. In this case, astronaut Roy McBride's (Brad Pitt) father Clifford (Tommy Lee Jones) has abandoned his family to prove intelligent life exists elsewhere in space. His obsession has jeopardized Earth's very existence, but Roy's solution requires more than just blowing up the source of that threat. He also needs to conquer long buried, personal demons. First, Roy must try, at least, to repair the estranged relationship with his dad that has led to so many other relational problems in his own life, including the one with his wife Eve (Liv Tyler). The biggest mystery is whether Clifford is open to the possibility of reconciliation, if he is indeed still alive with his Lima Project somewhere in Neptune's orbit.Space operas work best as meditative and allegorical, when they're designed to do more than awe us with a sense of wonder. Modern film tech can easily achieve the latter, but it is much harder to create character pieces in space that explore nuanced aspects of the human condition and attempt to answer questions like: why do we drive people away? How do we create and justify our priorities, and why do we matter less to each other than the possibility of something/someone yet unknown? The film answers the final question of whether we're alone in the universe in a manner that drives home its central theme, forcing us to at least temporarily reassess how we look at our own nature. Ironically, Clifford's findings have inspired a bit of hope for us all on a human, if not a scientific level, and so the son does ultimately benefit from the choices of the father, to capitalize on the rest of his earthly life.Ad Astra plays like Apocalypse Now in space, inserting pivotal characters that help bring Roy closer to finding his missing father somewhere in the heart of darkness, further out than any man has ever journeyed. Also like Coppola's Vietnam masterpiece, collateral damage is inevitable and justified for larger ends, exposing additional parallels between the seeker and the sought. Driven men often leave destruction in their wake, but how much depends on how far such men are willing to go. The familial ties introduced only heighten Roy's commitment to success, if not risking even greater madness than that faced by Capt. Willard in hunting Col. Kurtz. But Roy's controlled emotions aid him in his quest, which is not remotely guaranteed. Brad Pitt's subtle conveyances lend perfectly to the film, as much as his laid back coolness lent perfectly to the role of Cliff Booth in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. I've never been a huge Pitt fan until now, and 2019 is undeniably his year.",Ad Astra
2975,jay-goodman1,Ad Astra = Apocalypse Now: Neptune....**Spoilers**,9,28 December 2019,"I'm not sure what all the negative reviewers looked at but I found this movie compelling and very provocative with the CGI and computer graphics just amazing.
Kudos Brad Pitt essentially carrying the movie ...the silence between scenes was just right I felt.
Space psychosis is probably main culprit to long range travel, perhaps we are not designed for this ...
the storyline I didn't mind at all and found somewhat believable in the voice overs added just the right touch.
I'm so glad Donald Sutherland wasn't a villain as he has been many times
I feel that people who are expecting an action adventure movie and that they will be highly disappointed as that's not what this movie is..
This is for true SciFi movie fans who appreciate the genra and can be appreciative ..The rebel scenes on the moon very thought-provoking and somewhat depressing thinking our dysfunction as a human race perpetuates in the future.

2985,keith-chiang-42-330159,"Immersive environmentals, abstruse storyline",7,24 September 2019,"After first learning about it on the radio, I was excited to catch Ad Astra at the earliest opportunity. After all, the trailer led me to reminisce about recent sci-fi blockbusters, such as Interstellar and Gravity, which I thoroughly enjoyed.The movie started off great. It had the elements - outstanding cinematics, an instantly-recognisable Brad Pitt that would get ardent fans up on their feet, as well as a pulse-racing free fall from what seemed like the stratosphere of mother earth.What this movie does really well is immerse you in an unfamiliar yet fascinating space environment. From the nonchalant interplanetary travel, to the buggy-riding gun chase across the plains of the moon, Ad Astra was visually spectacular and sets a high bar in that regard. Another positive was the talented Brad Pitt who, besides captivating most in the audience just by showing up, does a fine job portraying an astronaut with phenomenal composure when he took over controls during an almost catastrophic spacecraft landing.However, what could be improved for me were the storyline and character development. The storyline was difficult to follow and far-fetched at times. One example was not sufficiently convincing how the Lima Project spacecraft alone could threaten the planet. In terms of character development, there could be a lot more nostalgia with his marriage to Liv Tyler that would reveal a softer side of him prior to the outpour of emotions after learning truths about his father. The scene in the 'comfort room' was a bit jarring given the ice-cool image portrayed during the first half of the movie.Overall, while it doesn't measure up to the high standards of Interstellar, Ad Astra is still worth watching for its outstanding cinematics and the talented Brad Pitt. The abstruse storyline will however leave you feeling that a lot more could be accomplished.",Ad Astra

I understand that people prefer mass scenes, with shallow emotions.

Its aim isn't to creat a story based on solid science, plus all the so called illogical plots are explained in the movie already.Moving on to what this movie really is about, it's not, in my opinion, about ""how we take things for granted"", or the father son love cliché. It's an attempt to answer how we deal with the feeling of hollowness and emptiness in our daily life, how to find meaning in the often seems to be meaningless universe. Pitt, like his dad, wasn't a man of too many feelings. He wouldn't seek remedy for his failing marriage, couldn't have sympathy for his dead colleagues, didn't even have bad dreams. The reason he could stay so calm under all circumstances to a degree of heartless is that he doesn't have an anchor in his life or couldn't find a thing to live for- due to his father's abandonment. His father's chose to seek solution in outer space in the firm belief that there are intelligent beings out there and he simply couldn't accept the fact that their mission had failed. Roy went on a different path though.To my disappointment, it seems like the movie is trying to talk about something deeper and more philosophical like existentialism or nihilism but somehow didn't managed to execute well.

2999,ronwizbot,Brad a super hero?,4,26 September 2019,"I caught a matinee of this movie and found good points and bad. Brad's moping personality was supposedly caused by the loss of his father to a failed project by Neptune. I understand he needed to find out what happened to his dad only to be disappointed in his father's insanity once he was found. I understand the theme that there may be nothing out there and all the exploration may be a waste.The problems I have are how Brad was able to enter the Mars rocket on the way to Uranus by going through a thruster when it was actively burning during a launch. Well, that was super power #1. When he managed to calculate the trajectory from his father's ship to his ship and use a spinning antenna to launch himself that was a skill beyond Dr. Strange or Iron Man's abilities so that was super power #2. When he flew through Neptune's rings with just a piece of metal as a shield, he put Captain America to shame and that was super power #3. When he calculated without a computer the blast from his father's ship exploding would cause a straight shot at 1/2 light speed to propel him 2 billion miles to Earth without creating a time difference, that would have been simulating a Warp Drive from the Star Trek franchises. I like Brad Pitt but he should have pointed out those plot holes to the director.

In that book the whole point of it is no matter how far into the Woods you go, or how long you are in solitude the ultimate realization is that we need other people in our lives.Ad Astra is a rewarding movie experience that provides many interesting ideas for you to think about through a backdrop of traveling through space to the planet Neptune at a distance of 2.7 billion miles.",Ad Astra

Spoiler:
Brad Pitt is tasked to find out if his father who left him 30+ years ago for a space research mission to find life in the universe, is still alive and the root for some potentially fatal flares (call it whatever you like).The movie tries to keep the suspense for a while whether the father is alive or not.. and we find out that he is .. and he killed his crew because they got home sick and wanted to go home.For whatever reason, Tommy Lee Jones was able to survive on a spaceship for 30+ years .. alone.. apparently he has an infinite amount of food and oxygen.After Brad finds his father alive.. he tells him that there's no life out in the universe and we are all that we got. Then convinces him to go back go earth, but dad had other plans.. drifting off to space alone .. and we have Brad Pitt somehow using a piece of his dad's ship as a shield, floats through Neptune's rings and gets back to his ship and goes back to earth and reconnects with his ex wife.. the end.I'm glossing over alot of other things that happened, killer monkeys, space pirates, boarding a rocket when it's about to lift off...

In fact the character study and ideas within this film could have featured anywhere, the space backdrop merely allowed them to take place within a (literal) vacuum.If you expect (and enjoy) franchise films where you switch off your brain, lots of people get shot at and everything blows up then this possibly isn't going to be a film you'll enjoy.I loved the pace, I thought it was beautifully made and on the big screen I was really drawn into the universe (literally) that the story played out in.Yes I had an issue with the ""Moon Pirates"" sequence and I would have preferred it if Roy had ended the film in a different set of circumstances but overall I really enjoyed it and felt it was several cuts above many of the films I've seen this year.",Ad Astra

Besides the charming Brad Pitt (and, to some extent, Tommy Lee J.), the plot is dull and there is no resolution (of the type the Sci-Fi audience would expect).
Instead, this is a Psychological Drama film, focused on the things that really matter in a man's life - family, your significant one (if any), your kid(s) (if any), your (positive) emotions (for them)(if any).
The crew didn't reach the stars; they didn't even reach the trans-Neptunean part of the Solar System. The aliens - whoever they were (there was an EMP attack on Earth in the beginning, remember?) - were not revealed to the very end.

I saw at least 2 of those, which were at least 1km long.what was the Moon attack all about? They were carrying literally nothing of value, was it a kidnap attempt? That also made no sense, as they killed almost all of them... Also the lame comment ""It is about resources"" was totally out of place.laser communication is point to point - what was the idea of them not knowing the location of the ship, when they could target it good enough with a laser.why the need to travel to Mars - that was a big WTFthe final space jump... not worthy even of a comment.why didn't they record the message on Mars, if they wanted to send it twice, heck, why didn't they record it on Earth and send it to Mars if it was that important. Like normal space travel and cargo ships still go there, but one can't convey a single message? Bring a USB...Tommy Lee Jones (Clifford Mcbride) spent 30 years on this ship, but did not care to remove the floating carcasses from it? I get it, he was crazy, but still... Imagine the smell -> there should have been enough bacteria even on the ship to start the decomposition process...Many, many others - the whole movie was a blunder after a blunder...

This exciting engagement ebbs and flows throughout the movie but each time it flows, it is less impactful. The movie stagnates as it progresses to the point where it becomes boring. You're left sitting in your seat wondering why we are watching Brad Pitt drink water from a tube and sleeping, for 15-18 minutes of the film. It becomes too slow. Too drawn out.The final act fails to stick the landing. Throughout the movie we are unclear as to what Roy McBride's motives are. It is hard to decipher where his allegiance lies. The serious lack of character development compounds this uncertainty. The age old adage of show don't tell, is thrown out the window here. We don't learn anything about Roy McBride other than what he tells us. He blankly gazes into the distance repeatedly doing psych evaluations and often acts as a narrator. It serves little to engage the audience.The movie is not bad. But it's definitely not great. It's fine. It has beautiful cinematography and a very small handful of great scenes. It leave a lot to be desired and I won't be watching it again anytime soon.",Ad Astra

3037,gergszekely,What was the idea?,3,1 November 2019,"I guess this should've been a movie about how the ""near"" future of space exploration would look like and a man's voyage to self knowledge through understanding his father and his feelings about him. I think it fails on all of its goals.According to the plot, humanity is going through though times, but the main question is finding out if we are alone in the universe or not. Why? Never explained. We're nt trying to make direct contact, just looking for traces, like SETI does right now in actual reality. That means that the search has a lot of limitations but even if it succeeds only the philospohical question of being alone or not could be answered, no real contact could be made.The action scenes in the movie are pointless, incredible and even ridiculous to an extent. Car chase with pirates on the surface of the moon? Answering a distress call in outer space (Alien feeling) to find out that the other ship's crew was slain by - an experimental ape? McBride being tossed out of his mission, but despite his every step being constantly monitored he manages to sneak back to the spaceship just in time and (accidentally!) kills 3 crew members to finally carry out the mission alone? Neither of these scenes are important for the story but make it much less credible.But still this movie could be a valuable drama about the relationship to our fathers and to our lives from that perspective. But it isn't. Our main charecter both loves and hates, misses and fears his father and this makes building up the conlfict of the drama perfect (great thumbs up for Pitt, hence the 3 stars). He spends decades supressing those feelings but on Mars he finally confronts himself with them. And what does he tell his father who left him as a child when - after travelling through the solar system - he meets him? Nothing about these, he keeps supressing his feelings.His father on the other side became so obsessed with finding alien intelligence that he gave up everything. He gave up his family, he even killed everyone in his crew when they wanted to abort the mission after decades (we never see any of these events). Then his son shows up - about whom he openly says he never cared at all, because the mission was more important - saying they need to abort the mission and go home. And he's like: ""yeah why not?"". And shortly after ""I made up my mind, I'd die here instead"". Why any of those? We'll never know. Tommy Lee Jones got a one dimensional charecter and never had a chance to give life to it.And then the son, who realized how he related to his father, but chose to keep supressing his feelings when had the chance to confront the old man, suddenly decides to gave up entirely how he lived up until than and start living completely differently. How? We'll never know.This movie fails as a sci-fi but builds up the drama very well for a final emotional conflict of a single man. Too bad the conflict never happens, thus utterly failing as a drama as well. Great missed opportunities, painfully wasted actors.",Ad Astra

It spent the entire run time building up a nuanced tension and it never gave it a release, rendering the whole movie a waste of time.People praise Pitts performance, but I found him overly robotic and off-putting. Ruth Nega was truly wasted in a role that said little and meant less. The only character that I was mildly interested in was the captain of the Cepheus, and he didn't last long.I had high hopes for this moving after being taken in completely by the majesty of Interstellar, but I knew something was amiss when I found myself at one point thinking, ""oh Lord, please don't have a car chase scene on the moon.""Quite literally, its two hours of my life that I cannot get back.",Ad Astra

Going to see a movie like this and expecting every tiny detail to be realistic is like watching House M.D. and complaining about all the medical nonsense (just for clarification - I do enjoy House MD despite noticing all the mistakes) Movies like this are for entertainment, if you want to learn about space - watch a YouTube video or read a book.
What this movie does is show the viewer a personal drama. An inner conflict of an astronaut who is not really supposed to feel anything, whose emotional state is checked regularly (God forbid he shows a glimpse of emotions considered inappropriate), who feels alienated despite being a very highly functioning professional with a near perfect performance. The father-son and logic-emotions conflicts are the center of this story. Even shots of space with that stunning soundtrack serve to show the inner state of the main character. And Brad Pitt's acting is so minimalistic, at times reduced to only a twitch of a facial muscle. Truly worth an Academy Award nomination.

Glimpses of Interstellar and 2001 in terms of scope and certain visuals, but it all comes crashing down into one distinct conclusion. The story is bad, weak and contrived.The part that really made me sit back and think about this was the anechoic chamber on Mars. The set looks great and it's lit extremely well but why the hell would space com have an anechoic chamber on Mars? Are they fully booked with secret message sending 24hrs a day? It's contrived. The artsy folk wanted this particular look for this scene with this lighting and my own brand of suspending disbelief just said ""NO"". It is much the same with many parts of this film - The Norwegian space station mayday, the Space antenna scene at the start, the moon pirates, the underground lake, the trip to the moon and it's unsubtle ""blanket and pillow for $125"", flying through Neptune's rings with a shield and the main premise of the film, the anitmatter issue on the Lima causing solar system wide surges. It feels like there was no story or meaning to start with, just a set of goals and ""what mechanisms can we contrive to get to them"" without regard for proper story telling.What a waste of talent! Donald Sutherland, Ruth Negga, Tommy Lee jones, all disposable for lack lustre reasons. Error 404, character development not found. Tommy Lee Jones is the most egregious - On screen for a handful of minutes and then just drifts off into space.I thought I might have been hasty when I first watched Ad Astra, so I put my ""Try to forget your biases"" hat on and watched it for a second time. I came to the same conclusion, Set design - great but somewhat out of place, Musical score - great, probably the best part of the production, Lighting - Mesmerisingly good, but so unsubtle that it stuck out as contrived, Acting - Not so good, Ruth Negga had the best bite of the apple, but the dialogue for her character was not well written, Direction - (I am looking at you James Gray) Pretentious, you had the right ingredients for something wonderful and thought that this weak contrived story was the vehicle you wanted?

It feels more like a philosophical message is being preached to the audience, by a director with little understanding of technology or space travel, and little interest in learning.The characters and the sci fi setting are just tools to communicate the message the director ultimately set out to tell. That message seems to be: ""Forget about science or exploration, stop looking outwards. Just love those around you and love God"".The director also threw plenty of symbolism into various scenes, because they seem to think their movie will be significant enough for people to talk about for more than a day afterwards and the movie will be dissected in classrooms for years to come (it won't be).Overall the movie felt a lot like an imitation of Gattaca with updated CGI and religion swirled in for good measure.

Perhaps they were worried the audience wouldn't get it.With that said, it thankfully doesn't devolve into a slasher flick as Sunshine did, and maintains a symbolic cohesion.

The fact that it scored 80 with the critics is really depressing. This isn't a film that you have to understand to appreciate, it fails to make you interested in the main character or deliver its main themes of abandonment, loneliness and loss. The storylines are horrible and so unbelievable. Moon pirates were annoying, rage infected space monkeys were laughable and by the time Roy managed to break into a launching rocket through an underground Mars lake I was done.It is a terrible film, please save yourself 2 hours but if you don't make sure you come back to leave your review so it may save someone else.",Ad Astra

I did almost fall asleep during some of the slower parts which are many. It seems the first 30-45 mins are pretty good and makes you wonder.

I just knew it was about Space and had Brad Pitt in it. That being said I was very bored through the whole movie. It was more about the relationship, or lack thereof between a father and son than anything else. When it ended I felt relief and also frustration as I didnt feel anything was accomplished or had any sort of closure. Ron went across the universe after his long lost father. And that is basically the entire movie. I was expecting action and adventure and instead got a drama I was not interested in. Great acting and a beautiful movie to watch but I was bored.",Ad Astra

The story is so so and the space scenes are good. I had hoped for more action. The story is about a man finding his place which is ok but I think the trailer should have made that more present. Non the less it is not a 2 or 3 it has depth for a man tries to find his place by hiding in space but eventually realizes home is all we have. So i would give it a six or seven,Ad Astra
3114,serezga,Fathers and children..,6,15 December 2019,"Very much waited for this film and hoped of course for much more.. After viewing leaves very mixed emotions, feelings and thoughts, and most of which occupy a void. Yes, the film is very beautifully made, beautiful graphics, etc., and if you can still ""pull"" the idea of settlements of people on other planets of the solar system, for example, the presence of so-called pirates on the moon more causes a sense of laughter, as well as the plot of the film. In my opinion, to show the classic problem of fathers and children, as the history of cinema shows, it is not necessary to create a fantastic world and show travel on it. Initially I expected from the film much deeper and more global essence of the plot, but everything turned out to be very banal and simple. And it very much spoils all the impression of the film. It seems like beautiful and impressive, but the sense ""filling"" is essentially not. For graphics and animations confident ""8-9"" points, and for script and plot - ""3-4"" points maximum.",Ad Astra

3119,ecekupcu,just a bunch of nonsense,3,29 September 2019,"No matter how good the acting is, the visuals are or the composed music is the movie is complete rubbish if it has a bad script, which was exactly how Ad Astra was.There was no real storyline, just a bunch of started little plots that could've been used to create a story, but were in my opinion only created to kill off all of the other insignificant characters. Throughout the whole movie one was under the impression that everything was going to lead to something bigger only to find out that it was a bunch of nonsense leading to nothing at all. I think the movie could've had a great potential, but it was wasted utterly. Not only was the storyline flat or completely non-existent, but the whole idea of the story did not make any sense at all.First off Spacecom (or whatever the name of the science base was) was showcased as the 'villain' but then there were those attackers on the moon, later it was a bunch of monkeys and in the end Roy's father was portrayed as evil but then non of it was executed and I was just left completely confused as to what they contributed to the story.
On top of that the creators of the movie tried to make the film look like a real possibility of the future but seemed to ignore some of the basic physical possibilities, Roy was able to get into a starting spaceship without being injured at all, the radiation waves don't make any sense at all and for some reason Roy is this super human that can travel all the way to Neptune with no comunication, completely on his own and no difficulties whatsoever.What annoyed me the most was Roy's narration like the whole thing has some bigger meaning but in the end it's just a bunch of empty words to make the movie look more sophisticated.Bottomline the only good thing I could take away from this movie was that it sparked a discussion amongst my friends and I.",Ad Astra

Brad Pitt's character becomes his true self and saves the human race by finding his father, facing his fathers flaws and then 'letting go' of his father.

3143,instaCathy,Where is the character development? Zero depth.,2,7 January 2020,"If you've read other reviews, you've already seen the multitude of complaints. A bizarre tower to space? Space pirates with little introduction and zero purpose? Alien monkeys? Sneaking onto a presumably advanced ship from under the hatch as it blasts off? Celebrating a selfish, rogue pilot with a hero's welcome? Now any one of those ridiculous things could be forgiven- IF they had a real purpose in the film. However, these all exist merely to make possible the rest of the ridiculous plot. Enough on that. Others have roasted it enough.I could mostly forgive most of these if there was any real character development. These ridiculous plot splots though are time taken away from understanding who Brad's character is and what his feeling are about his father. I get easily emotionally involved in film characters. My children laugh and tease me about it. I have cried through scenes that I've seen 100 times and that don't phase most people. Animated flicks, television dramas, etc. So if anybody was going to get Brad's feelings, it would be me. Nope. Yawn, annoyance, and a strong desire to just fast forward. I didn't feel for him or with him. Meeting dad, I didn't get any feels there either. Seriously, Zombieland moved me more. For what its worth, I don't think its a function of Pitt's acting- he did okay with what he had.There was so much potential here that was wasted, good plotlines completely abandoned or left at mere hints. Asking us to consider how far is too far in reaching the outer limits of space? What and who would we give up? Brilliant. But the film gives that 4 minutes, most of which in the scene with the Mars employee who lost her parents. Or exploring the impact that dad's departure had on Brad's own relationships? Potential there. Nope, just a few flashbacks and a little reunion at the end. Instead we got more minutes with random pirates and monkeys.Those that say it was brilliant want to claim some sort of superior intellect and ability to find the depth in this film, and insult those that don't as being shallow thrill seekers looking for Armageddon or Deep Impact action. I call BS on that. This film is as shallow as that stupid space tower is tall. The two stars are generously given for the cinematography alone.",Ad Astra

Probably the worst moment was where Brad Pitt was climbing up into a rocket, from below, WHILE IT WAS BLASTING OFF (and he was experiencing maybe 3 Gs and effectively weighed 600-800 pounds!). And immediately after that, the crew unstraps and attacks him. But there were LOTS of others. Making antimatter without making an equal amount of matter, AND NO ONE SEEMS TO THINK THAT'S UNUSUAL, or that maybe it would be worth investigating/understanding a technology that's utterly beyond our current physics; no, they just want to blow it up. A tiny antenna sending a focused beam of energy from Neptune to Earth (ever heard of the diffraction limit?). Showing space elevators on Earth early in the film, and then using massive rockets instead to get into orbit; and NOT having space elevators on Mars, where they would be cheaper and easier to build due to the lower gravity.Even the social/personality aspects were completely unbelievable. The idiocy starts only a couple of minutes in when Pitt narrates about how he's a loner and doesn't like to depend on other people. He's an ASTRONAUT. He depends on TENS OF THOUSANDS of other people, ALL THE TIME.Anyway, DO NOT WATCH THIS TURKEY. Even if you can stomach the crap science, the plot is mindless and peppered with moments of gratuitous religiosity that feel as out-of-place, and ring as false, as the ones artificially inserted into The War Of The Worlds (1953) or Contact (1997).

3171,CymaticSorcerer,Based on a true story,8,1 October 2019,"North Americans and the odd other place might not know due to a complex issue that caused an info blackout at one point. USA and other countries ran several joint projects.The poster I saw years ago didn't say concept as they were active known projects. This one was changed after the blackout.You might recognize several ships found in sci-fi and fiction based on fact shows. The ship under 1960 on far right that looks like a pyramid is a link for a Dyson Ring. It was in fiction as StarGate and an astronauts parasite a goul'd. You will notice on the left a few things that are in Space 1999, Battlestar Galactica, and Wondering Earth. Around 1955 and Zero Restart you see the Astra. On the right near the pyramid you also see the IXS Enterprise with NASA marker.The main characters father survived. Saved before the explosion by another crew in the area. Their work not public so generally most public that did know weren't told he survived.The main character suffered cardiac distress on return from G Forces. Other's provided aid and remote landed the shuttle. The rest of the ship was a write off. It was the same type you see for Space X program. Most private space announcements are very old news.At the time this was written the main character had talked to someone he knew to write his story. He had once flown the Astra space liner as backup crew. He mentioned it and passed away from heart issues. He was walking with the writer on the way to his trial over the deaths, etc. He died before the case conclusion.The story was held for many years. But several of us encouraged it to be released. Many of us unknowns that had worked with the space programs or our families had. Several movies are let being portrayed as complete science fiction. This is because some of them do contain some fiction but mostly due to complex issues in politics, business, and public areas.In that poster you see a few moon based ships. One was a low gravity launcher. The miner war is true. Some were regular miners trained for Space or other contractors. But some were criminals. Some of them on death row. They were mining precious metals and other materials. Some was radioactive or otherwise toxic. Some stole gold and smuggled it back to earth to find their families or crime. The gold and silver was only safe for industrial use. Some hot sick handling it. The criminals that broke free and formed their own group fought others. They also tried to send a nuclear bomb they to earth to kill a rival. A very sensitive topic. You see that as the eye of the Sahara an impact crater not Atlantis.There have been many deep space missions and bases.

Despite the flaws with technology (Roy could have just send a message instead of going all the way to mars to record it in a sound proof room, and SpaceCom could just launch a missile to destroy the Lima ship), It's just a kid looking for his crazy father while battling craziness of his own on the way.

This can be a metaphor for space itself- always quiet, but is very complex inside.The end of the movie (without spoiling it) also works with that logic- there is no loud Inception horn, in fact, seemingly it's pretty relaxed, but you can still sense the tension and emotions going on.Now that's what I call ""show don't tell""",Ad Astra

At least a lot of the general public are not as gullible and are evidently more aware of the laws of nature. For no discernible reason we have highwaymen on the moon, unfrozen water on Mars, baboons circling a rock in space between the moon and Mars? Really? A hatch and airlock by the nozzles on rockets? Whiskers that don't grow for months but then do just a little? But these are just the minor things. The whole story line is ridiculous. The execution of the story line is ridiculous. Too long a list for this review. The plot from the beginning is deeply flawed such as they don't know where Tommy Lee is hiding? But Brad goes right to him? Energy gets more powerful as it travels billions of miles? Etc etc etc. All I can say is this studio must think the public is ""stupid, stupid, stupid"" just like the critics.

I mean the science was almost non existent making the storyline absurd. How does Pitt hold on to a ship taking off? Lol is gravity somehow not affecting Pitt? Im pretty sure when the staging occured and the astronaut with the gun flew head first into the door Pitt would have flew into it as well. Oh but gravity doesn't affect Brad Pitt! Ok and how exactly is the LIMA ship out in space ruining the known universe? I don't think anyone knows. Blowing the ship up with a nuclear bomb to propel Pitts ship back? I mean come on his ship would have exploded. Brad Pitt goes from a cool cucumber to a nervous nancy in two minutes. The fim does not make sense psycologically, scientifically or in any way shape or form. The movie invokes absolutely no emotional response. The character building is also non-existent except for a poor job on Pitts character. Out of the martian, interstellar, gravity, arrival, first man and every other space movie out there this one takes the cake as the worst one in the 21st century.

A son glorifies his father and finds out that the missing dad is not so great. Happens in every family where there has been a separation. That is how children do cope with it. Nothing special with that.
To use soooo many minutes to get to that point where he understands these basic facts are murder for the audience. Long space scenes will not rescue it, even if you put in THREE action clips where something really happens.
Not even in the start... where some additional action appear... it gets nerve kittling or tensed, because this guy can't understand the dangers he is facing.

3222,kevingoebel,"Bad Script, Bad Science, Bad Plot",1,13 October 2019,"This movie was a rip-off. I love science fiction, but this movie was ""the pitts"".The premise started off ok, but went downhill quickly with bad scripting, bad dialogue, and bad science. Visually, it has some great scenes, but they don't compensate for all the failings.I make allowances for things like not spiking the movie budget to display low gravity with rides on the Vomit Comet (reduced-gravity training aircraft), but as other reviewers of this movie have detailed, the celestial mechanics displayed in this movie were lousy.Future script writers take note: Just add hibernation beds (capsules/pods/chambers) and have your interplanetary travelers routinely pop into them to save on supplies and oxygen. They can become the equivalent of Star Trek's transporters to keep the story line from dragging, or goofing on the minutia of travel time, fuel consumption, etc.Spoiler AlertCommercial Space Travel - This whole scene was probably added as a time filler, or because some script writer was miffed about being charged for a pillow on an American Airlines flight. The entire solar system is having electrical fits like a aluminum chicken pot pie in a microwave oven and a well-known astronaut decides to go to the moon flying ""coach""?Space ""pirates"". There were bits and pieces of descriptions of government, politics, and conflicts of the future tucked into the dialogue. The entire ""rescue mission"" at the bio-research station was stupid. OK, maybe Norway WAS conducting 'sekret' bio-warfare research and wanted to isolate their lab against contamination spread. A lunar-based facility, or even a lunar orbital facility would suffice, and anyone in the area could have responded besides the one craft on a mission to save all humanity. Also, how did the baboons manage to kill everyone at the facility before one staff member can describe the nature of the SOS? Even at a minimum security prison there's more than one lock between an inmate's cell and the warden's office. Perhaps it wasn't bio-warfare, perhaps it was genetic enhancement, and this movie is just a prequel for ""Solar System of the Apes""Wait for this baby to quickly go to broadcast TV (probably on ""Svengoolie"").",Ad Astra

Okay, so Brad Pitt gets sent on a mission to the edge of the Solar System. That's really not what the story is about. The viewer follows the path of the main character's emotional journey. Even though he doesn't want to become like his father, he certainly seems to be heading in that direction. At a certain moment, when Brad Pitt has returned to Earth and is retrieved from his spaceship, it's quite obvious that this is where the movie will end. How will he be received by the public? How will we as a species go on? That's all irrelevant to the story, for it is his personal journey that has come to a conclusion. He still holds this strong, dedicated mindset, but his focus has changed towards the social aspects of life. So, quite an interesting movie for a psychologist, but that's not me. I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10. And that's mainly because of the breathtaking images from space.",Ad Astra

3225,manojmehtamd,"Brad Pitt, you waited all these years for this??",2,10 January 2020,"When you see a high production-quality trailer, cools special effects, and big names in a trailer...well, you expect a lot. But let me tell you, even if you expect the bare minimum, you will be disappointed. This is a vacuous, plotless, unscientific drama. And by drama, I mean pointless inner monologues and dramatic stares towards the horizon by Hollywood's most famous chiseled chin. That's it. Nothing more in this movie, and nothing more to say.",Ad Astra

3227,jimwangcorelink,A film of self redemption wrapped with sci-fi,7,4 February 2020,"The well acting of Brad Pitt, the mental part of the characters and the main theme, which was pretty clear and touching, may attract some people.
Unfortunately, the depressing atmosphere, the silent background tracks and some illogical parts of the screenplay (especially about the space and stuff like that) got lots of audiences bored. Those who had watched the trailer and expected the film to be a sci-fi action movie were even angrier.
Eventually, the critical reception came out to be extremely polarizing.
I like this movie, but I highly don't recommend it.",Ad Astra
3228,gptaman-45620,Not a sci-fi film,8,12 January 2020,"If you watch this movie expecting a sci-fi, with future technological marvels or intense sequences with accurate science then you will be utterly disappointed. This is not on the lines of Martian, Interstellar. Its a movie about humanity and our tendencies to constantly strive for greater things while we ignore what's around us.",Ad Astra
3229,kunbian,fell sleep many times,2,2 October 2019,"Boring, a Cannes film with meaningless long background music.",Ad Astra
3230,Choose123,Where's Jamie??????,3,21 September 2019,"Jamie Kennedy was supposed to be in this movie. Even though I nodded off a few times I failed to spot him in the movie.
Walking out of the theater, I have one question: Where's Jamie?",Ad Astra
3231,kevinjsimonsen,Bad Astra,1,23 September 2019,"Absolutely the worst movie ever. No character development, totally unrealistic from a science and physics point of view. All we could do was laugh. Guess Brad and Tommy Lee needed the money. Can't wait for Bad Astra II when all the loopholes will be explained. Save your money and your senses.",Ad Astra
