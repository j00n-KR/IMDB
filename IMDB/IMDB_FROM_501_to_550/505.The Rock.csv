0,MartinHafer,Me to brain: Sleep for the next 136 minutes and I'll wake you when it's over.,3,3 July 2021,"Let's cut to the chase....if you think too much during this movie you simply aren't going to enjoy it. Often things don't make much sense (such as furnaces and water systems that are STILL working 33 years after the prison was decommissioned) and much of the film just seems like mindless action and stunts....which really are all true. But if you can look past the mindlessness of the film (and it is 100% mindless), you may just enjoy it.A rogue general (Ed Harris) is sick of the way the government uses up special operatives and then tosses them aside. So, to make a point, he and a group of his soldiers steal chemical weapons and threaten to launch them into San Francisco from his base at Alcatraz. So, a motley group is assembled to sneak into the old prison and recapture it. And, of course, the entire mission goes south very quickly. What next? Watch the film...or don't.The dialog is mostly macho bullcrap and the film is dumb. But it's very well made dumb....with great music...which is the only reason it managed to earn a 3 . I didn't like it but I can see how many would.",The Rock
1,bkoganbing,Renegade Marines?,4,29 January 2007,"Renegade Marines. The concept is almost an oxymoron. Yet the premise of this action film is that a rogue marine general Ed Harris, steals some rockets with nerve gas and then takes over Alcatraz island which is now a tourist attraction and threatens to launch strikes into the San Francisco bay area unless his financial demands are met.After a Navy Seal team is massacred in trying to take the island back it's up to an aged ex-convict named Sean Connery and a chemical weapons specialist Nicholas Cage to save San Francisco from the USMC albeit a very renegade bunch of them.The Rock is strictly for action junkies who don't care about plot or improbable situations. In fact the film should have been familiar to the first James Bond of the silver screen. Sean Connery had some more realistic situations in those films than he does here.Of course fans of Sean Connery will pay to see him in anything and I'm certainly one of them. Nicholas Cage tries his very best to give the dialog a little meaning.If I had a favorite in this film however it's the Navy Seal commander Michael Biehn. It's a good, sincere performance in a Thanksgiving Day special of a film.For fans of the players above only.",The Rock
2,Leofwine_draca,All over the place!,6,27 August 2018,"THE ROCK is one of the classic action movies of the 1990s and also one of the cheesiest. I mean, I watched and enjoyed it and everything, but seriously, this film's cheese level is through the roof. Not that you'd expect anything different with Michael Bay behind the camera. The film is set on Alcatraz, where the unlikely term of a nerdy Nicolas Cage and a typically hard-ass Sean Connery are sent in to take down Ed Harris' crazed soldier bad guy and his army of mercenaries. Generally this is a mildly awkward film, tonally off and all over the place at times. Some of the acting is quite horrid - Cage doesn't come across very well, his girlfriend even worse - but Connery is warm and likeable and Harris has surprising gravitas. Tony Todd has a great minor role almost more evil than his CANDYMAN. Despite the lengthy running time there's plenty out of action here, the highlight of which is the incredibly cheesy and destructive car chase through San Francisco. Some of the jokes work well too, but this film hasn't aged too well and is really only for the action fans among us.",The Rock
3,SnoopyStyle,Michael Bay - Nicolas Cage - Sean Connery,8,11 January 2014,"Renegade general Hummel (Ed Harris) has stolen 15 VX rockets, taken over Alcatraz, taken 81 hostages, and threatens to strike San Francisco unless The Pentagon pays him $100M from their slush funds. He intends to use the money to pay the families of the soldiers under his command who the government has disavowed over the years. In order to disarm the rockets, the FBI is sending their chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage). And they're digging up a mysterious British agent prisoner John Mason (Sean Connery) who once escaped from Alcatraz. When the team sent in to take on Hummel is decimated, Goodspeed and Mason must disarm the rockets on their own.This is Michael Bay audacity to bring his heart pumping action style to bear. The action is big time bombastic joy. And for the best effect, he allows the actors to have fun in between the action. Nicolas Cage brings a lot of his manic energy and a bit of his crazy humor. And Sean Connery brings the Bond gravitas to the action. Plus the Cage Connery duo is a lot of fun, and they have great chemistry together. This is the best kind of popcorn movie-making.",The Rock
4,classicsoncall,"""Welcome to the Rock.""",7,16 July 2018,"Present day movie fans can be forgiven for thinking ""The Rock"" is a biopic of Dwayne Johnson. Back in 1996, pro wrestling's 'Rock' was just signing with the WWE, and he's pretty much everywhere on the celebrity circuit today. I seem to detect a trend with a lot of these action/adventure movies. A lot of them start out with an intriguing, if not highly improbable premise, but after the preliminary build up, they turn into an endless escalation of gun blasts and explosions. This one pretty much follows the same formula, and if not for the formidable cast, might have been just another also ran. Actually, it is just another also ran, but Sean Connery gives the story some spark, and Nicolas Cage is acceptable in his role as an FBI toxicology expert. What's kind of odd though is that even though Stanley Goodspeed was a whiz regarding poisonous substances, it really didn't require that kind of knowledge to remove a detonator chip on a rocket carrying a poisonous gas. You just had to know where to find the chip.Well folks, dispense with the critical thinking here and just sit back to enjoy the ride. Plenty of gunfire and over the top action to satisfy the action fan, and not a bad supporting cast that includes Ed Harris, Michael Biehn and John C. McGinley. This is also the second film in a row I've seen with David Morse where he's not playing some sort of wimpy character. That's got to be worth something, and when I figure it out, I'll get back to you.",The Rock
5,gavin6942,Michael Bay Can Keep on Making Movies...,7,16 April 2007,"Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) is a chemical weapons specialist for the FBI. So when a rogue general (Ed Harris) overtakes Alcatraz island and has a variety of rockets with VX warheads, he is called in to stop the general. But first he must subdue his new partner, lifelong convict and criminal genius Mason (Sean Connery). (I'm tempted to ask why the government has illegal VX warheads... something the movie never discusses... but I won't bother.) Some people (such as Trey Parker and Matt Stone) give Michael Bay a hard time for making flashy movies with little substance. And usually I'm right there with them. As I type, ""Transformers"" is coming out and it looks to be a horrible film in every possible way. But I think Bay really did a decent job here combining action with characters the audience can love.Let's talk about the action and characters. The action is undeniable: explosions, gun fights, and other such goodness (maybe not on the level of ""Die Hard"" but still pretty good). And there is an extremely memorable car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco. Probably the best part of the film. So the action is nailed done firm.The characters are also well done here. Nicholas Cage's character is pretty decent, though he suffers from outbursts that make no sense. Ed Harris plays his general role very straight and is quite possibly ""the rock"" the title refers to (besides Alcatraz, of course) because he holds the film together. And then Connery, who is always good. Connery's character might have been poorly scripted at times (he, like Cage, suffers from unusual outbursts) but this is also a very deep character (though once his secret is revealed, I found it a little disappointing). Quentin Tarantino allegedly did some writing on this one... I have no idea what parts.The romance is played done, and luckily Claire Forlani has a really small part. My friend Eric loves her, and I love ""Mallrats"", but I'm sorry.. she's almost as bad as Minnie Driver. Actually, no, she might be even worse.I am not an action fan, and I'll be the first to admit it. So I grade them a little harsh at times. But look, this one fared alright... and I think if you're going to watch an action film, you can do a lot worse than this one. Great actors, an interesting plot (overtaking Alcatraz? brilliant). And the focus on the interaction between Cage and Connery rather than the bigger action of the terror plot paid off -- they have a chemistry stronger than any VX warhead.",The Rock
6,lee_eisenberg,Stanley was almost an exact replica of my mother,9,8 April 2006,"Having won an Oscar for ""Leaving Las Vegas"", Nicolas Cage shifted to action with ""The Rock"". Portraying renegade Gen. Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) taking over Alcatraz, necessitating a rescue mission, the movie takes an interesting look at everything. We get to learn the story behind every main character, and even the car chase turns out to have a purpose.What was especially interesting about Nicolas Cage's character Stanley Goodspeed was his similarity to my mother: being a Beatlemaniac and desiring a beige Volvo. But this is Sean Connery's movie all the way. As ex-con John Mason, he creates a character with whom we feel that we can sympathize no matter what. Even if he tears up San Francisco in a car chase.There are some scenes about which I feel that I should warn you. You see, the movie partly focuses on these balls that release a chemical. This chemical melts your skin, among other things.But overall, it's a pretty good movie. Believe it or not, Michael Bay actually directed a good movie. I can't say the same for his work since then (""Armageddon"", ""Pearl Harbor""). Stick with this one.",The Rock
7,jboothmillard,The Rock,8,17 January 2007,"From director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, Transformers), I have said to myself I have seen this film many times, but I always remember I haven't, and I always love it. Basically Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel, USMC (Ed Harris) and his small army of renegade marines have stolen three warheads, filled with the deadly VX gas that instantly destroys all human internal organs, and melts the skin. Hummel threatens to fire these warheads on San Francisco, and kill the 81 hostages he has captive at Alcatraz prison, aka The Rock, unless he and his soldiers are paid a high ransom. FBI chemical/biological weapons expert Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) is assigned to try and get into The Rock and retrieve these weapons. The only way he can do this is to get help from the only man known to have escaped the prison, top-secret federal prisoner John Patrick Mason (Sir Sean Connery). After attempting escape in a high speed chase, Mason eventually agrees to help the Goodspeed and the FBI in their mission and get inside The Rock. They successfully get inside, but Hummel and his group know they are inside, and will stop at nothing to make sure they can't get to them. It comes to a point where the FBI sees no other choice but to fire a missile on Alcatraz and San Francisco, but eventually Hummel and the other villains get what they deserve and the day is saved, with Mason being allowed to get away, and Goodspeed marrying his pregnant fiancée. Also starring John Spencer as FBI Director James Womack, David Morse as Major Tom Baxter, William Forsythe as Special Agent Ernest Paxton, The Terminator's Michael Biehn as Commander Anderson, Vanessa Marcil as Carla Pestalozzi, Scrubs' John C. McGinley as Marine Captain Hendrix, Candyman's Tony Todd as Captain Darrow, Titanic's Danny Nucci as Lieutenant Shephard, Claire Forlani as Jade Angelou and Philip Baker Hall as Chief Justice. The one moment I do always remember is the bit when Cage crashes his car, and some guy says ""Dude, you just f***** up your Ferrari"", and he replies ""It's not mine!"" Connery and Cage do well in their roles, Harris is a good villain, and the supporting cast do very well too, it is one of those action thrillers you are never going to look away from because there are so many explosive moments to get your attention, making it a brilliant film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound. Nicolas Cage was number 33, and Sir Sean Connery number 8 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Connery was also number 3 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Very good!",The Rock
8,ccthemovieman-1,Too Much - Give It A Rest!,5,14 November 2006,"Here's another example of a modern-day action film that has TOO MUCH action, just bombarding the viewer to the point where one is actually longing for some lulls because they are so desperately needed. I like a good action movie, but almost everything in here was overdone.It has a good male cast with Sean Connery, Nicholas Cage, Ed Harrris, David Morse, William Forysthe and more, and some spectacular action scenes.....but it's just too intense for too long. Also, about 20 blatant abuses of Lord's name in vain didn't make it attractive for me, either. Who do the script-writes have doing the blasphemy: the supposed ""good guys,"" the government agents and bigwigs. Of course, in Hollywood the cops are usually the bad guys and the crooks are the heroes.If you like mindless action, and very little credibility - especially in the last 30 minutes - this movie is for you.",The Rock
9,rmax304823,"Actioner, efficient and predictable.",5,11 April 2004,"If you're in the mood for an implausible but reassuringly familiar action flick, this should do the job. I don't know that there is a single original thought in this flick. It's all been done before in one guise or another, but it's done about as well here as anywhere else.Car chases of course are de rigueur. This one involves a Ferarri and a dozen cop cars chasing a Humvee up and down the steep hills of San Francisco. There are multiple smash-ups with flying glass everywhere. The Ferarri knocks down a row of parking meters, spilling thousands of pennies. A telephone pole collapses across the street. Cars do one-and-a-half gainers in midair. A streetcar is blown straight up and comes straight down. And so forth. The chase itself is without point.I lost count of the number of bodies that crashed through glass windows in slow motion, or the number of deaths by slow-motion exploding squib charges. Bodies fall through glass ceilings or are impaled on some kind of pointed spikes. Is all this beginning to sound familiar?There is one novel note -- the labyrinthine underground of Alcatraz. Who really knows or remembers what's down there? What we see is a jungle of twisted and rusting iron, crusty gratings, burnt orange bursts of flame that come out of nowhere and accomplish nothing, over-sized rotating cogs, small railroad tracks with small carts on them, caverns, sewers, lots of water, pipes emitting plumes of steam (where is the steam coming from and where is it going?). But -- well, why not? Nobody knows or cares what's really down there. It could be the hanging gardens of Babylon for all anyone knows.That's about it for originality. Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage and Ed Harris are good, as usual. The production values are high (all those smashed cars). The script is sprinkled with wisecracks, like a Schwarzenegger movie, in order to warn us against taking all this too seriously, as if warnings were necessary. The car chase is punctuated by the expectable imprecations -- ""Hope you have insurance!"" and ""Sorry about that!""It must have been a bad idea to turn the Marines into heavies, so in the finale, the movie makes General Harris the only man of principle, however misguided that principle may be, and turns the others into nothing more than money-hungry mercenaries. The plot is so disarticulated that after Ed Harris is offed, another Marine has to become the chief heavy and he has a jaw like King Kong and a haircut like Hugh Grant or Hugh Jackman or whoever it is that has his long hair parted in the middle. You can tell all the bad guys anyway because they have bulging eyeballs that glow with lunacy, or they have sneers that radiate contempt for all the good things God has blessed us with in modern life, like Brittny Spears. Ed Harris, the Marine of principle, had to die a noble death. His evil successor has to be made to swallow a poison pill the size of a tennis ball and then melt on screen. The others, the ""phony soldiers"", to borrow a phrase, are just in it for the blackmail money. This is a common device used to avoid offending anyone in the audience. It can't be the REAL Marine Corps, so it has to be a loony splinter group of thieves. In ""Patriot Games"", it's not the real IRA but a splinter group. In ""Air Force One"", it's not the real Russians but a splinter group. In Clint Eastwood's ""The Enforcer,"" it's not even the real ""People's Army"" because the ""people"" in the audience might take it personally, so it's a phony band of greedy gangsters posing as a populist army. Yes. If you like to see cars doing grand jetes and exploding fireballs and ugly guns, this is your movie. Cage and Connery work very well with one another and seem to be having a lot of fun. They have just solved the problem and ended the threat, but can they call off the air strike that is seconds away from being unleashed on them? Guess.My biology is long behind me and I know nothing of VX, but if it is a cholinesterase inhibitor, isn't it similar to, or the same thing, as black widow spider venom? And if so, what does it have to do with melting your skin?",The Rock
10,Tweekums,Good solid action on Alcatraz,8,9 January 2017,"General Francis X. Hummel has had enough of the way US service personnel have been treated; especially how the families of those who died on top secret missions are told a string of lies and not compensated for their loss to this end he decides to blackmailing the government by stealing a quantity of deadly VX gas; taking over the island of Alcatraz and threatening to launch the gas into the city of San Francisco if is demands to compensate the families aren't met within forty hours. Of course he can't do this alone; he is supported by a squad of ex-marines who expect to be paid handsomely.The government have no intention of paying him so assemble a team to go to Alcatraz and neutralise the VX rockets that are to deploy the gas. The team will consist of a squad of Navy Seals; Stanley Goodspeed, an FBI specialist in chemical weapons and finally John Patrick Mason, the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz who will be needed to guide the team in. Mason could be a problem; he is a former captain in the SAS who has spent the last thirty years in jail but has never been formally charged with any crime and is considered extremely dangerous. Once inside Alcatraz the Seals are quickly eliminated leaving Goodspeed and Mason to deal with Hummel and his men and neutralise the weapons.This film is packed with action; there are shootouts, a car chase, explosions and the threat of a deadly attack on a major city the action moves at such a pace it is easy to overlook many of the more unlikely moments the scenes in what looked like ancient mine carts under the old jail seemed too far-fetched but once that was over it was soon forgotten; at least while watching the film. The story may include numerous clichés but that doesn't matter as it is a lot of fun. Nicolas Cage does a solid job as Goodspeed and Sean Connery is in top form as Mason; he may be old but he makes us believe that is character is tougher than the young marines he is up against. Ed Harris does a fine job as General Hummel; a character who isn't just a pantomime villain. This is probably director Michael Bay's best film; he keeps the action moving at a cracking pace without losing the story in the process; don't be put off if you dislike his 'Transformers' franchise. Overall I found this to be a lot of fun; it won't be for everybody but if you want a solid action film it is definitely worth watching.",The Rock

With the help of ex-Alcatraz prisoner John Mason (Sean Connery) and a team of Navy Seals, chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) tries to prevent them from succeeding.I've been having a bit of a nostalgia trip as of late, re-watching some classic action films of the 90s; sadly, my second-hand DVD of The Rock was scratched, meaning that the picture regularly froze or skipped. After viewing, I put the bloody thing in the bin—which is ironic, I guess, since it's one of the few Michael Bay films that doesn't really deserve such a fate.Save for one frustratingly poor car chase scene between a Humvee and a Ferrari through the streets of San Francisco, during which Bay succumbs to his irritating habit of waving his camera around like a madman and cutting every two seconds, The Rock is a super-slick slice of big-budget gung-ho excess—extremely preposterous, highly explosive, and seriously over-dramatic popcorn entertainment, which its stars gamely play along with: Ed Harris shines as war hero turned terrorist Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel; Sean Connery plays Sean Connery (yet again); and Nicolas Cage acts like a lunatic as only he can.There are, of course, better action flicks from the 90s—this is still a Michael Bay film, after all—but it's good enough that I could be tempted to stump up one more pound coin should I see another copy at my local car-boot sale.

There have been reports that this movie is why, as an MI6 agent was using the film as the basis for his reports from the country. Yes, this really happened.Bay had a sequel idea, where Goodspeed would be chased by the government to get the microfilm back and he must ask Mason for his help. I really wish that movie had been made.There's a scene where Goodspeed tells the guards to remove Mason's handcuffs and Cage has a crazy line reading - one of many in the movie - and he claims that his way of saying the words came from an Elvis Presley story he had recently told Connery involving girls in white panties wrestling chimpanzees.

15,hitchcockthelegend,Welcome to The Rock!,8,31 October 2010,"The Rock is directed by Michael Bay and written by David Weisberg, Douglas Cook & Mark Rosner.

The plan is to hold the government to ransom or he will unleash from the prison biological rockets to bring Armageddon down upon America. Enter chemical weapons expert Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Cage), who is forced to team up with the only man ever to escape Alcatraz - the mysteriously incarcerated in secret John Patrick Mason (Connery) - to break into the Rock and thwart the plans of the Mercs.So Cage as a chemistry expert who possible holds the fate of the world in his shaky hands? Connery, aged 66, as a tough prison escapee sporting a ""Grunge"" haircut? And Ed Harris, surely a bastion of patriotic Americana, turning bad and wanting to unleash hell on the Stars & Stripes? To expect nothing else but a berserker Michael Bayhem picture based on these facts is surely folly. He certainly has a varied CV does Bay, as do the leading actors on show here, but when on form, with writers prepared to put blood into the characters, Bay can deliver high octane entertainment if coupled with a cast clearly in tune with the material.

16,jotix100,Alcatraz,8,6 September 2006,"""The Rock"" is a film that borrowed from other movies. That said, director Michael Bay does a wonderful job in this action packed picture that has the viewer at the edge of his seat. Of course, a lot is asked from us in accepting things we know can only happen in the movies, but if we indulge the makers of ""The Rock"", we will be rewarded to an almost two hours of pure, unadulterated thrills.The story at the center of the film involves a renegade Marine General who wants to have the government compensate those people that have given their lives for the country without being properly compensated. His way of doing this is to ""hijack"" Alcatraz, the notorious former prison in San Francisco and stage his revenge from that strategic point. The only thing is, that in doing so, he and his men take hostage the unsuspecting tourists that have come to see the place.Meanwhile in Washington, all the powers that be, have to deal with the threat General Hummel presents. Someone remembers a man that has been imprisoned thirty years before for doing the unimaginable: he stole secrets from Edgar Hoover. That is how Mason, an Englishman, is asked to help the people that are trying to infiltrate Alcatraz, since he served there and escaped from it, and knows all its secrets.There is also a scientist who understands the chemical danger of the equipment that Hummel, and his men, stole illegally. Those missiles are now in place in Alcatraz and Dr. Stanley Goodspeed is commanded to get to San Francisco to help in the operation. Goodspeed, whose girlfriend had just told him he is going to be a father, has no way of getting out of the mission.Although one knows how everything is going to come out, there is not a dull moment in the movie. Director Bay stages with flair all the action, which involves the typical car chase in the streets of San Francisco. David Weisberg, Douglas Cook and Mark Rosner contributed to the screen treatment. The story defies all logic, but all the films of this genre are like this. John Scharzman's cinematography enhances the film and the action.The film works because of the chemistry between Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. They make an odd team, who are great together. Ed Harris is Gen. Hummel. His anger is real and he gives another vivid portrait of a man that is seeking justice, if even going beyond sanity to claim it.

This supercharged, high-octane, but improbable shoot'em up concerns renegade Army General who takes civilian hostages, occupies Alcatraz Prison with a small force, and threatens to fire poison rockets with deadly VX gas at San Francisco if the government refuses to bow to his demands. The FBI assigns Special Agent Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage of ""Con-Air"") to the case, and he receives help from the only man who successfully escaped from Alcatraz. As it turns out, this brilliant individual is former British secret service agent John Mason (Sean Connery of ""Zardoz"") who has been buried in the U .S. Penal system because he got his hands of all of America's top-secrets. FBI Director Womack (John Spencer) fears Mason. He sends in Goodspeed to negotiate with Mason. Naturally, Mason demands a trip into San Francisco, a meal in a sumptuous hotel, and a haircut. Eventually, a reluctant Mason leads Cage under the island, and they set out to disarm the rockets. Our heroes face a deadline as they battle their way through bowels of the prison. The Navy plans to obliterate the island if Mason and Goodspeed blow it. The first obstacle that our heroes encounter is a massacre in the prison showers when Hummel's men wipe out a squad of Navy Seals. One of the best scenes concerns a chase through the streets of San Francisco with Connery driving a Hummer. The script bristles with great lines. The music is terrific. If you watch closely, Cage's character learns how to lie during the course of the action. Michael Bay never lets the pace lag. Composers Nick Glennie-Smith and Hans Zimmer enhance the spine-tingling suspense with atmospheric music.",The Rock
20,Boba_Fett1138,"Entertaining, action packed movie.",8,14 September 2005,"""The Rock"" honestly is one of the best action movies made over the last couple of years. It has everything a good action movie needs; gun fights, explosions and a villainous plot that could kill thousands of people. It's a non-stop entertaining action packed movie.The movie already begins really good and features one of the better movie openings ever. After that the movie never loses its pace and its basically one spectacular action sequence after the other. The movie features some professionally made action sequences that work very well thanks to the nimble cinematography by John Schwartzman the good editing from action movie specialist Richard Francis-Bruce but mainly thanks to the spectacular movie score composed by Nick Glennie-Smith, Hans Zimmer and friends and of course also thanks to the directing of action movie specialist Michael Bay, who always (well, almost always) knows how to create an entertaining action filled, blockbuster movie.Difference with most other action movies is that this one features some good and well known actors. Sean Connery shows that he can still handle action roles despite his age and although Nicolas Cage probably wouldn't had been my first choice for the role he plays his role and alright and believable enough. The main 'villain' is played by the always excellent actor Ed Harris. The rest of the cast consists out of other well known actors such as; David Morse, John Spencer, John C. McGinley, Steve Harris, Michael Biehn (in a typical Michael Biehn role) and uncredited roles played by Xander Berkeley and Stuart Wilson. Some amazingly great casting if you ask me, especially for a type of action movie like this one is. Action movie fans will simply enjoy this movie. Its filled with 'over-the-top' action sequences featuring lots of gun fights and plenty of big explosions and one memorable car chase scene through the streets of San Fransisco. Everything is almost all of the time very over-the-top but its all done so beautifully over-the-top that it is no complaint.Simply sit back and enjoy!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Rock
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Just above average action-thriller, nothing else",6,30 May 2004,"This is pretty much a typical action-thriller; there are car-chases and shootouts, pretty much every major character utters at least a few one-liners or badass tough-guy lines, etc. You know how it goes. And of course, even though the two groups(Marines and SEAL, respectively) are highly trained military, they make the same mistakes that the military always does in Hollywood action films; throwing grenades with enough time to allow them to be thrown back, run in a straight line away from someone shooting at point blank range with automatic weapons(and surviving without a scratch, of course), half of the time standing in bad cover while shooting, while disregarding the enemy's great cover, etc. This is nothing new to these films, it just annoys me that films are made with so many blatant mistakes made by supposed professionals. It's a bad excuse to do this just because of the action-scenes; look at S.W.A.T.; in every way an average action film, but stays clear of all of the stupid mistakes, yet manages to produce some great action nonetheless. The humor in the film consists entirely of characters acting tough and spouting(mostly bad) one-liners and the likes. The plot is recycled from hundreds of other films like it, many of them better. They just changed the setting and played around with a few details. It has a decent pace, but nearly the entire first half was fairly uninteresting. The last half was reasonably good, but that was when the military mistakes started to appear. The acting is mostly good, and the choice of actors is definitely something the film benefits from; tough guys include Tony Todd of the Candyman series, John C. McGinley and Ed Harris, all three of them being very cool and typical tough guys. The characters are reasonably well-written, but far too many of them are just there to pose an immediate threat, be killed off later by one of our two heroes, or simply spout the infamous one-liners. The action is fairly exciting, but too much of the time, you'll find yourself being distracted and annoyed(well, I was, at least) at the huge number of unrealistic details and(yes, once again) military mistakes. All in all, just a standard, slightly above average action-thriller, and absolutely nothing else. I recommend it to fans of one of the actors, main character or minor, and fans of the genre in general. Just don't expect it to blow you away; only expect to be mildly entertained by something that there's a good chance you've seen before, possibly more well-made. 6/10",The Rock
22,view_and_review,Overall the production was good,7,16 August 2020,"Who would be best suited to steal military weapons besides the military? ""The Rock"" was an unholy marriage of rogue Marines, Navy SEALs, the FBI, the Pentagon, and a British SAS agent. This dysfunctional combination was full of the drama you want to see-unlike the drama we see between dysfunctional family members on reality T.V.Brigadier General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) gathered a small army of disenchanted Marines in order to extort the U.S. government for $100M. His cause wasn't mere greed. He wanted the families of the fallen soldiers on illegal missions to be compensated since they were never given proper burials or recognition. His aims were noble even if his methods were unorthodox.With 15 guided rockets loaded with VX gas, he set up a base on Alcatraz Island where he was going to launch them at various cities in the S.F. Bay Area if his demands weren't met. To make sure he wasn't summarily dispatched by some F-16's that would just blow up the who island, he made sure to grab 80 hostages.The government acted as quickly as possible by sending in a team of Navy SEALs, a chemical weapons expert, and a man who'd escaped from Alcatraz before. Agent Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), the chemical weapons expert and John Mason (Sean Connery), the one prisoner who escaped from Alcatraz, were the two most important characters. John would get everyone into Gen. Hummel's stronghold undetected and Stanley would be able to neutralize the VX gas pellets.Though Nicolas Cage was annoying at times, the overall product was good. ""The Rock"" was a big production with a clever enough plot. The action and the body count wasn't exorbitant which made it watchable.",The Rock
23,evanston_dad,Pretty Much the Definition of Dumb Action Flick,6,17 June 2009,"Another of Michael Bay's big, dumb, uber-macho action films.This has all the Bay trademarks -- the copious use of slow motion, the emphatic sound effects, the thudding plot exposition. The recent Bourne movies have proved that effective action films don't have to treat their audiences like they're retarded, but Bay apparently hasn't yet gotten that memo.And there's always something vaguely homoerotic about movies like this. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we're always watching a bunch of sweaty men playing with their big guns.Grade: C+",The Rock
24,anaconda-40658,Not Solid but Hard Enough.,6,25 June 2015,"The Rock (1996): Dir: Michael Bay / Cast: Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, Claire Forlani, Michael Biehn: Electrifying action film with a title that symbolizes Sean Connery whom no one is sure of but must rely on. Ed Harris leads troops into an isolated prison and holds everyone hostage. He demands money for reparations to the families of the American servicemen killed in covert operations. Nicolas Cage plays a chemical expert sent to disarm the missiles and Connery is the only convict to escape the prison. Deadly gas missiles are aimed at San Francisco where Connery's daughter lives. Fine concept nearly derailed by a mindless chase scene and several shootouts. Director Michael Bay handles the action but the story is merely a parking lot for those scenes to locate and explode. Cage fares well as a chemist under pressure, while Connery is excellent as an unstoppable force. We know where this is all headed because films of this sort need to end nicely after a massive mess. Ed Harris is a refreshing surprise after standard footage becomes altogether shifted in motives. Claire Forlani appears as Connery's daughter who will eventually have to come to mends especially since he wrecks havoc in a senseless car chase to locate her. Michael Biehn plays a fellow soldier who plans to go through with the whole threat. Exaggerated action with rock solid stunts. Score: 6 / 10",The Rock
25,FlashCallahan,"I'll take pleasure in gutting you, boy......",8,2 July 2010,"It's a quiet day in San Francisco. There are 81 civilians on a tour of Alcatraz, the prison famous for the fact that no prisoner had ever successfully escaped. During one of the tours, marine General Francis Xavier Hummel takes the civilians hostage, with the help of other marines. He has 15 rockets of deadly V.X. gas at his disposal, ready to launch at San Francisco. His reason for doing this is simple: he has seen Marines under his command get killed in combat without a military burial or benefits to their families. He makes a threat to the FBI: give the fallen Marines recognition or he will launch the V.X. rockets. After learning that one rocket is enough to take out sixty or seventy thousand people, the FBI sends for their top Chemical Weapons expert: Dr. Stanley Goodspeed, engaged to his pregnant girlfriend. While trying to figure out a countermeasure to the current situation, the FBI is forced to resort to John Patrick Mason, an ex-con who broke out of Alcatraz in 1962....it's a great movie to start with, if for some reason, you want to study the movies of Michael Bay and Simpson and Bruckheimer. To sum it up in one sentence is easy...Die hard on Alcatraz.But it's so much more than that. the characters are human, rather than macho hulks and all have their own specific weaknesses. Connery obviously has age against him, Cage is an action virgin and his girlfriend is pregnant, and Harris, as the main 'villain' shows hi human side a lot during the film, much to the pity of his crew.As expected from the producers and director, it's slickly made, well edited and had some of the best lines and set pieces that featured in a film released in 1996.Most important is the chemistry between Connery and Cage, they make the film so much more than just your standard actioner, they bounce off each other with ease, and when they are on screen together, it's an absolute joy to watch.It's a silly film, but then who cares, it's exciting and fun, and is still one of the better action movies released in the last twenty years.An essential action film, and Cage still had two more fantastic action movies up his sleeve..",The Rock
26,Aaron1375,Connery and Cage make this pretty good action movie into an excellent one.,9,20 July 2005,"Yes, Connery and Cage have a chemistry and acting ability to make this movie that probably would have been just okay with other actors turn into a really fun action movie. Cage is a guy who is an expert at deactivating weapons, especially chemical ones, and Connery is a man who is locked up for life, but once escaped the infamous Alcatraz prison. What brings them together, former military men led by Ed Harris have taken hostages on the island prison of Alcatraz and they are threatening to launch chemical weapons into the heart of San Francisco if their demands are not met. What ensues is pure action as we have car chases through the streets of San Fran, we have special forces slipping into the prison, and we have many gun fights between forces. Still though Connery and Cage stand above everyone else and really make this movie rise a notch or two above what it would have been without them as they add some humorous dialog into the film. If I had a complaint it would be that the Ed Harris character does not make a very good bad guy as you almost feel sympathetic to him. However, plenty of the other soldiers in his charge are more typical bad guys for you to pull against. All in all a fun action ride that has one of my favorite actors in it, Sean Connery.",The Rock
27,gradyharp,"'Uh, yeah, okay, that's about the most awful thing I've ever seen.'",8,3 September 2012,"That headliner line is not about the film - it is one of the funnier lines spoken by Nicholas Cage in this knockout movie. Almost twenty year old, this film - THE ROCK - remains one of the most entertaining and powerfully performed and produced action films in cinema history. Re-examining It today finds it still as fresh as ever - a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat with a solid story (David Weisberg, Douglas Cook, and Mark Rosner) and pitch perfect direction from Michael Bay. Yes, there are many special effects (pyrotechnics, underwater fighting, the recreation of the bowels of Alcatraz, etc), a dialogue that allows the intervention of comic relief in a situation that seems impossible to find humor, and some very fine performances by a huge cast of actors. It is an 'escape movie', both for the audience and for the story.Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage, in one of his better roles), who lives in Washington D.C., is a biochemist who works for the FBI. Soon after his fiancée Carla Pestalozzi (Vanessa Marcil) announces that she is pregnant, Stanley gets a call from FBI director James Womack (John Spencer). Womack tells Goodspeed that San Francisco's Alcatraz Island has been taken hostage, along with 81 tourists, by marine General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) who, for years, has been protesting the government's refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The death of his wife Barbara Hummel on March 9, 1995 drove General Hummel over the edge, and now he's holding hostages in order to get his point across. Goodspeed is needed because General Hummel has stolen some VX gas warheads and has announced that he will launch them onto San Francisco unless his demands are met. Goodspeed knows how to disarm the bombs, but he needs someone who knows Alcatraz well enough to get him inside and that someone is a former Alcatraz escapee James Patrick Mason (Sean Connery). The wise and experienced Mason and the nerdy brainy but intimidated Goodspeed make an odd couple but head to Alcatraz in an attempt to foil Hummel's terrorist scheme.The large supportive cast is populated with such actors as David Morse, William Forsythe, Bokeem Woodbine, Danny Nucci, Claire Forlani, Jim Caviezel, John Enos III, Richard Conti, Raymond Cruz and Philip Baker Hall. It is a bit long but never fails to keep your interest. A good old-fashioned Hollywood blockbuster action flick! Grady Harp",The Rock
28,safenoe,The Rock rocks,9,22 October 2016,"What an incredible ending The Rock had. You had a mutiny within a mutiny, and the action scenes at the end were incredible big time. The rocket man scene was something, and I wonder if North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has this in his DVD collection, given reports in 2015 that he executed a sleepy official with an anti-aircraft gun.The ending had a racist character, a soldier from the mutiny who made a disparaging remark against Sean Connery's character who is English. The soldier's father was Irish, but really Sean Connery's character was Scottish, so really there is a difference between the Scots and English folk.

29,Mr-Fusion,Kinda wish I saw this in the Summer of '96,7,30 March 2012,"Michael Bay is not my cup of tea. Not to disparage the man, he just doesn't usually make my kind of movie. But ""The Rock"" is fortified with such an ironclad cast and an abnormally (for Bay movies) decent script that the usual Bay idiosyncrasies (the histrionic 360 degree slow pan, the larger-than-life low angles, etc) didn't kill my overall enjoyment of the piece.Connery, Cage and especially Harris were exceptionally cast, along with a list of supporting players that's nothing to sneeze at. And the script keeps us moving through one huge set piece after another (mercifully spending minimal time on a lousy romance).Aside from a car chase that was better left deleted (a dizzying frenzy of whip pans with no sense of geography is no way to cut a chase scene), it's certainly Bay's most substantive contribution to the action genre.Also, I have to admit: Connery's ""Welcome to The Rock"" moment was pretty badass.7/10",The Rock

31,JamesHitchcock,Saved by some imaginative casting,6,1 April 2008,"Renegade Marine Corps General Francis X Hummel and a troop of former marines seize control of Alcatraz Island and threaten to attack San Francisco with chemical weapons unless their demands are met. They are also holding hostage a party of tourists, so the authorities are reluctant to order the Air Force to bomb the island. Instead, a crack unit of Navy SEALs is ordered to retake the island, but they are ambushed by the marines, and all but two of the party are killed in a firefight. It is down to the two survivors, Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason, to try and save the situation.The above plot could have been the basis for a very dull shoot-anything-that-moves film starring somebody like Steven Segal as Goodspeed and Jean-Claude van Damme as Mason. It is saved, however, by some imaginative casting. I have never regarded Nicolas Cage, with his lanky figure and long, lugubrious-looking face, as one of the cinema's most natural action heroes. The casting directors of films such as ""Windtalkers"" and ""National Treasure"" obviously disagree with me, but the casting director of ""The Rock"" presumably agrees. Cage seems to have been cast here precisely because Goodspeed is an unlikely hero.He is only on the team because he is the FBI's leading scientific expert on chemical weapons, and has spent his whole career in the laboratory, having never had a chance to practise the very rusty combat skills he learnt many years ago at the FBI academy.Mason is an equally unlikely saviour. Although he is a former member of the British SAS, he is now sixty years old and has spent more than thirty years in prison after being arrested in possession of American intelligence secrets. He has, however, never been convicted of any crime, but has been detained for the whole of that time without trial. The reason for his detention is not so much to punish him for his espionage activities but rather to prevent him from revealing what he knows about the CIA's most embarrassing secrets, including the truth about the UFO landings in Roswell and about the Kennedy assassination. He is on the team because he is the only man to break out of Alcatraz (he was recaptured soon afterwards) and therefore presumably knows how to break back in: he has been promised a presidential pardon in exchange for his cooperation.Mason is played by the original James Bond himself, Sean Connery. Connery was happy to be rid of the role of 007 after ""Diamonds are Forever"", but he later had second thoughts because he returned to it in ""Never Say Never Again"", and has continued to play Bond-like characters in action films. His most recent film, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", was one such example, and ""The Rock"" is another. Like the Bond films, it combines action with tongue-in-cheek humour, especially during the car chase sequence. (Ever since films like ""Bullitt"" and ""Magnum Force"" in the early seventies, car chases seem to be obligatory in action films set in San Francisco).One thing I asked myself while watching the film was why the villains were all ex-Marines. Their cause- the payment of increased pensions to the widows of special forces troops killed on covert operations- is the sort of thing that might inspire retired Generals to write angry letters to the press. It would not normally provoke them to attack a major city with nerve gas. Would it not have been better if the villains had been terrorists of one ideological persuasion or another? There are, I think, two answers to this question. This first is that the scriptwriters probably found it implausible that a gang of terrorists could wipe out an elite force of Navy SEALs; a squad of Marines would stand a better chance. The second, and more important, reason is that the film has some sympathy with Hummel's cause, if not with his methods of pursuing it. It falls within that tradition of films- other examples include the Rambo series and ""Clear and Present Danger""- which portray America's armed forces as decent and honourable but their masters, both politicians and Pentagon officials, as anything but. Mason, for example, only takes part in the mission very reluctantly, as he mistrusts (with good cause) the sincerity of the officials who have promised him a pardon.Insofar as a blackmailer threatening to unleash nerve gas on a city can be sympathetic, therefore, Hummel is a sympathetic figure. He is not some cartoonish Bond villain like Goldfinger or Blofeld, but a much-decorated war hero who cares deeply about the brave men under his command, who is full of righteous anger about the shabby way they have been treated by the authorities, and who has been driven to extreme measures by those authorities' refusal to see reason. It is therefore a role which calls for a sensitive, nuanced portrayal and gets one from Ed Harris, an actor who can often lift an otherwise ordinary film above the mundane.There are a number of plot holes; how, for example, did Mason find out the truth about the Kennedy assassination when he was in prison at the time it was committed. And if he posed such a threat why did the authorities send him to a public prison like Alcatraz instead of somewhere much more secret? Or simply kill him? Nevertheless, this is an enjoyable, well-paced action adventure with some good acting and lightened by the occasional touch of humour. 6/10",The Rock
32,MovieAddict2016,"A Solid, Action-Packed Thrill Ride!",8,27 February 2003,"`The Rock'The film that solidified Nicolas Cage as an action star and Sean Connery aswella guy who uses the F-word a lot, `The Rock' never ceases to slow on the action; its plot is, of course, ridiculous, but I'm not looking for an Oscar winner in an action movie.Cage plays Stanley Goodspeed (weird name number 1), a chemical specialist whom disarms chemical bombs and such.Ed Harris plays Himmel or Hummel or something like that (weird name number 2), a respected General who one day decides, `What the heck!' and takes Alcatraz prison hostage; he demands respect for dead marines from the government, or he will release some ba-a-a-ad gas on San Francisco. Enter Cage, who must, with a pack of government marines, enter Alcatraz from underneath (under water) and take out Himmel/Hummel. That's where Sean Connery comes in as John Mason, the only man to ever escape Alcatraz unscathed. Connery `agrees' to help them enter the prison the same way he escaped.`The Rock' is pure, unadulterated fun. Nothing less, nothing more. It delivers everything you want in an action film: Explosions, guns, special effects, and more explosions. If you can't have fun watching a movie like this, you can't have fun watching a movie. Period.The acting in `The Rock' is nothing to scoff at. Nicolas Cage is great in this role, as in other action roles. The thing that is different here, however, is that Nic doesn't know how to use weapons much; he is a chemical expert, not a trained FBI agent. So, it is more than humorous to see him running around defenseless; especially seeing that it is Nicolas Cage, who usually plays action roles where he is the master of the weapons.Sean Connery is perfect for the role of John Mason; he blends wisecracks, action andwellSean Connery.Ed Harris is also very good as Himmelhummelwhatever; he seems a bit held back at times, but overall, his acting is as good as ever.The direction style in `The Rock' reminds me very much of other Nicolas Cage films, like John Woo's `Face/Off' and such. It is gritty, dark, and exciting. It adapts to the characters' emotions.The first thirty minutes or so of `The Rock' are nothing special; I almost stopped watching at one point. But once they get to Alcatraz the action picks up and never slows down. Explosion after explosions after gunfight after stunts, leading to an explosive ending (literally) that may be predictable to a certain degree, but nevertheless lotsa' fun.All in all, `The Rock' is the kind of movie where you sit back, turn off your brain for two hours, and have some slam-bam fun.4/5 stars John Ulmer",The Rock

34,KineticSeoul,"Kick-ass and entertaining movie from Michael Bay. Even Hideo Kojima tried to emulate this into his ""Metal Gear Solid"" games.",10,2 August 2016,"Now I am not a big fan of the director Michael Bay, but this movie is kick-ass and is his best film. Sure, it still has the Michael Bay trademarks with chases and explosions, but it's integrated quite well into this movie. And actually has a cool plot, and stylistic emotions to go with it. It isn't the most intelligent plot but it does get the job done. Sure some parts might be a bit exaggerated, but for a action movie such as this, it works. It isn't a action movie that should be taken too seriously, it's suppose to be a kick- ass action flick. And like I said just about everything about this movie works. Especially when it comes to the entertainment department. From the action, to the passable dialogues and music it just melds together into a fun action ride. What really stood out about this movie while re-watching it, was how it was so obvious Hideo Kojima took notes and borrowed elements from this film. Especially when it comes to the style, action and characters. And how Hideo Kojima incorporated some of the ideas and tries to emulate it into the ""Metal Gear Solid"" franchise. I remember when this film came out and how it was one of the biggest action movie of the 90's. As a matter of fact this film and ""Face/Off"" is my favorite action movies from the 90's. When I saw this movie in the 90's I was just blown away by how cool it was. It is probably the movie that I could remember where I saw Sean Connery in action for the first time. And at that time, I thought he was the most badass old guy I have ever seen on screen. Even Nicolas Cage's freak-outs actually complimented this movie. Overall, this movie is a blast and I highly recommend it to just about anyone. Especially people that are fans of the ""Metal Gear Solid"" franchise or people that are into action movies in general. Sure it has it's flaws when it comes to the narrative because of few plot-holes. But it's not all that distracting and sometimes it actually compliments this film somehow.10/10",The Rock

Or maybe I have. Or maybe Bruckheimer/Cage's enormously inferior follow-up Con Air kinda drove the following point to light.It would be a huge surprise (disappointment) if this film got an endorsement from the large gay community in the very area its set in. And they thought Basic Instinct was bad.I only point out the few, but extreme, scenes of homophobia because, well, it's just not right. (They elaborate in ridiculing homosexuals in Con Air, but that's another story/review.) It's not right, because it teaches the core audience, teen boys to mid 30s, that making fun of gays (or blacks, or any creed) is not only an acceptable practice, but funny! It's not and I digress The other problem I had was Cage. Over! Under! Acting seems to be his moto. Too bad ""Good"" isn't part of his forte. Man, he was distracting! Thankfully, not only did Connery act circles around him, but went beyond Cage's performance to balance out the film.Get past the two negatives, and Action and Movie fans rejoice! There is, in fact, a way to combine plot with leave-your-brain-at-the-door action. But, I hate to say, they might have overshot it a bit. There was just too much.Suffice to say, it's a Hannibal Lecter (Actually, Mason, played by Connery) story in which Goodspeed (unoriginal and inconvincibly played by Cage) takes on the aid of ""The Prisoner with No Name"" to break into ""The Rock"" when he was the only one to break out due to some treasonous/mercenaries who are threatening San Francisco with toxic green balls. And not from The Hulk.Oh, there's a lot more: a distraught daughter, a confused and stupid and pregnant girlfriend, a dead wife, dimwitted military bozos who should be dead or discharged, soldiers on this side, that side, all with ulterior motives and much, much more. Sure, it's my quest to get intelligent action (SEE: The Bourne Trilogy, or The Dark Knight) but enough's enough.That said, it's a fun movie. Connery makes it really worth wild even though he doesn't show up until the movie got going. But, unfortunately for him, the director, writer or idiot, kept him running around in circles, literally, in the final act. I don't blame Connery for that; I think he was just given poor direction. Sure, his character was supposed to be the iffy hero, but they had him trotting around like a buffoon until he did what we all knew he would.Spoiler alert, the ending? Could it be any more Shawshank? If you can get past the homophobia (please do,) the enormously bad acting from Cage and oh, lest I forget, the far-too-many (director Bay's favorite) slo-mo scenes, the extensive action alongside Connery was good enough for a recommendation. It's always refreshing to re-visit pre-CGI movies. Don't call me old-fashioned. I like movies that took more time out of the computer room and into realism. With heart. Sorry, Avatar fans, we're still not there yet, so make action look real.",The Rock
37,FeastMode,hans... you are too awesome,8,26 June 2019,"Beastly movie. entertaining action flick. has flaws and things you can question, and some outdated moments but overall it still felt new. AMAZING musical score, good acting, awesome premise. The action itself actually wasn't done that well at times, some use of quick cuts and shaky cam. regardless, i enjoy this movie a LOT. it is a borderline classic for me in the action genre. one of the best parts about this movie are the characters. connery is a beast and hilarious, and harris is one of my favorite villains, one you surprisingly find yourself rooting for sometimes (about 6 viewings, 11/13/2020)",The Rock

It is unfortunate, then, that the protagonists and ensuing action sequences are goofy as can be. 'The Rock (1996)' separates its bursts of militaristic patriotism, underlined by 'cool' slow motion, with quirky Cage quips and over-the-top explosions.

39,bowmanblue,The greatest film ever made (sort of),10,4 February 2016,"Okay, so it may not be the greatest film ever produced, but it sure is up there with the most fun. Sometimes a film is just perfect. Or, to be precise, it's absolutely perfect for what it is. No, 'The Rock' will never be hailed up there with such greats as Citizen Kane or The Godfather, but it is the perfect popcorn-munching action film.Nicholas Cage (back when he still starred in decent films) plays a self-confessed FBI lab-geek who specialises in defusing explosive chemical weapons. And, by one hell of a coincidence, an insane ex general (Ed Harris) only goes and steals a load of explosive chemical weapons and sets up his hollowed-out volcano lair (well, sort of) on the disused prison-site of Alcatraz. Guess what poor ol' Nic's going to be getting up to today? Unfortunately, he's not much of a soldier and doesn't stand a snowball's chance in hell of defeating Ed's band of hired marines. However, that's where the only man ever to have escaped Alcatraz comes in – retired (and imprisoned!) British Secret agent, Sean Connery (his character probably has a name, but – like every film he's in – Sean Connery basically plays Sean Connery). So, as the tag-line says... in a prison where no man has ever broken out, two men must break back in.I hope whoever wrote that tagline got well paid. It really does say it all. You really don't need to know much else about the film. You only need to enjoy action films. And, when I say 'action films,' I mean action films that are actually quite fun, rather than the dark and depressing style we've been treated to in recent times. The Rock never tries to be 'gritty' and 'realistic' – it just has great action, numerous explosions and a plot so over-the-top it will envelop you completely and let it take you along for one hell of a ride. If the sheer joy of the chemistry between Cage and Connery isn't enough to entice you to watch this film, it's actually worth noting that Ed Harris' villain isn't actually as villainous as you might expect, being one of the only evil bad guys with a conscious whose point of view you can also emphasise with.Also, don't let Michael Bay's name put you off. It was made 'pre-Transformers' where he actually made some decent films.Don't think about the plot. Just love it for what it is – the perfect action film that really sums up the nineties (oh, that line could also be applied to 'Speed' – that's pretty damn awesome, too).",The Rock

I was surprised that I never heard of it until recently being the movie buff I am and with the big name director, composer, producer, and actors. I think Michael Bay is a pretty good director despite what everyone else says.This is about a ruthless general who captures the Alcatraz prison and is bent on taking San Francisco hostage unless he's paid the money he wants because he feels the American government did not recognize his fallen soldiers.The acting is very good here. Sean Connery still has some great action moves in his old age. Nic Cage is a great actor despite what everyone else said. Of course, I loved Ed Harris. He is one of the best.Unlike most action movies, this movie has great character development. The plot has been seen before but the creators brought the plot to a whole new level.

42,CuriosityKilledShawn,"TIme to grow-up, Mr. Bay",3,18 February 1999,"""I make movies for 15-year-old boys? What a crime!"" -Michael Bay You know what, Mike? I was 15 when I saw this movie back in the summer of 1996 and I wasn't too impressed, so maybe you ought to take back that ludicrous comment. As a matter of fact I went to see it twice (June and July 1996), just to make sure my judgement was honest and correct.Since debuting with Bad Boys in 1995, Bay has averaged about one movie every two years. But I think that it's quite sad and pathetic that in 16 years and nine movies he has not matured as a filmmaker in the slightest. If anything he's regressed.The Rock has characters with just a touch more depth than we're used to in Bay films. It's not necessarily a big story but he seems to stretch it out over two hours with heinously over-cut action scenes and extraneous sub-plotting.General Francis Xavier Hummel (Ed Harris) takes over Alcatraz with some poisonous gas rockets and aims them at San Francisco with the intention of vaporising everyone unless the families of each member of his dead team is paid $1,000,000. A nerdy and heavily bored FBI agent, named Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), is called to San Francisco from Washington to observe and instruct the inevitable SEAL operation to overthrow the Marines on Alcatraz. But wait, there's more. Alcatraz is a maze of twisted metal and broken walls. They won't stand a chance without someone who has knowledge of how to break out. Or break in.And so enters the philosophizing and lanky-haired John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) at about 45 minutes into the movie. He's been in jail for 30 years and doesn't appear to be annoyed at having to work for the very people who have held him without trial for so long. There is an utterly pointless and indulgent car chase before he actually gets down to business.Once on the island, the SEALS, as predicted, are crap and get killed instantly. So, basically, Hummel wants to honor his fallen comrades by killing more American soldiers. How absurd, but not much in this film makes sense. Plus these SEALS have thoroughly extensive training and, in real life, there is NO WAY they'd end up being so useless.Goodspeed and Mason are not a great pairing. I don't know what the deal is with Nic Cage, when he's good he's great, but more often than not he's so unbelievably awful I wonder how he manages to get work. Goodspeed isn't very appealing. He's annoying, not funny, and little of his dialogue sounds natural coming from his mouth. When he tries to be tough, he just seems ridiculous. Mason is just an old James Bond. Hell, he's even a British Secret Agent. The role was written with Connery in mind, so don't expect anything but his elite brand of OAP smart-ass cool.Coherent editing is not this movie's strength. In fact, coherence is hardly something one would associate with The Rock. There are so many distractions and superfluous plot points that the only way Bay can compensate is to turn every scene into a epileptic blur. The target audience is familiar with this kind of film-making anyway, and it has sadly become the accepted norm for action movies.The Rock is inferior and less engaging than a similar movie that came out the month before its release. Executive Decision attempts the same theme and an identical form of tension. In 135 minutes, it wastes no time on sub-plotting, develops far more likable characters and is way more exciting.Exec Dec is played straight. The Rock is played to look cool and hip. It's not. And apart from Zimmer's entertaining score, there's not much to recommend. This rock could have skipped along the surface, but merely sinks to the bottom under its over-written, over-wrought, over-directed weight.Oh, and if Mason is supposed to have a major beef with Womack then perhaps they should have cast someone older than John Spencer who would have been 19/20-years-old when his character first crossed Mason.",The Rock

Oh, tourists can take a look at the cells and amenities but no one lives there. But, a disgruntled Marine, General Hummel (Ed Harris) takes over the island by force, with a group of loyal underlings. A mostly good soldier and man, Hummel is upset that those who died or were wounded in covert operations get no compensation. His ghastly plan is to launch fatal nerve gas over San Fran if a huge fee is not paid. When the President hears of this operation, he and his staff are greatly alarmed. But, they want to stop Hummel, not negotiate. First, they contact a FBI agent who specializes in biochemistry, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage). They want him to defuse the poisonous bombs. Since Stan's fiancée has just told him she is pregnant, this man is under great strain. More importantly, how will the military land on the island secretly and get to the rooms where Hummel and company occupy? They need an EXPERT on the island's prison so they choose the only man who ever escaped Alcatraz. He's John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), a British agent accused of treason. Even though he escaped, Mason was recaptured and has been locked up 30 years! The idea is to offer Mason freedom in exchange for helping with the mission. Brother, they don't have a clue how honked off Mason is until the negotiations begin! Mason demands a night in a hotel room, room service, and a posh haircut. That is just the start! Will Mason and Goodspeed be able to help thwart the destruction of San Francisco's large population? This outstanding action film has non-stop thrills and a great cast. Sophisticated Connery and wacky Cage are great foils while Harris makes his character sympathetic in spite of all. Naturally the scenery in the Bay area and on the island are exemplary while the script has humor amid the very serious plot elements.

46,The-Sarkologist,A Great Action Movie if you can suspend your disbelief,8,8 November 2013,"This movie was produced and directed by the same guys that made Bad Boys. I realised the similarities with the absolutely beautiful cinematography that made Bad Boys such a great movie. The cinematography is superb and as such this movie, in this way, becomes a work of art. In fact, this is Don Simpson's last movie as I believe he died sometime during its production. The dedication at the end is to Don Simpson, and it is always sad to see such a talented person, or in fact any person, die, but that is the nature of this corrupt world.A bunch of highly trained marine terrorists take over Alcatraz, secure hostages, set up missiles carrying very nasty diseases, and demand that they receive recognition and that the families of their dead receive proper compensation. The FBI are called in along with Godspeed (Nicholas Cage) to try and diffuse the situation. They then go to Mason (Sean Connery), the only guy to have ever escaped from Alcatraz, to get back in. As Godspeed is the only person who can neutralise the gas, he is also sent in, much to his protestations.The one thing I thought about this movie when watching it was that it was somewhat unbelievable that such a thing would happen, and if it did, there would be very little the authorities could do without instigating a plan of acceptable losses. I am not saying that the world is a rosy place - far from it - but the nasty things that happen usually are mass shootings, and the occasional fanatical cult, such as the Branch Davidians (at least in the United States).The actions were simply to be recognised. The troops in this siege were special US operatives that simply do not exist. When one of them dies, the truth is covered up and the reply is that they were killed in a training exercise. No compensation or anything is paid to the grieving widow. When people sign up though they generally are told of what they are going up against and agree to such clauses. As such these people should have known what they were going into.In another way it must be frustrating for the relatives of the deceased as they know nothing about what their beloved are involved in as it is top secret. Such things may not work well in a family, but then there are lots of confidential matters flying around everywhere so one cannot really complain.All in all, this is a great action movie if one is willing to suspend their disbelief, which we all must do in the long run. There are unbelievable aspects to this movie, but one must understand that it is one of those movies that give the viewers that false hope that our problems can be solved with the brave actions of a single man - and in essence that is truth as Jesus was a single man as he did indeed solve all of our important problems.",The Rock

Ed Harris invests Hummel with real empathy!! In fact, of all the villains in most movies, Hummel has a genuinely understandable motivation. Personally I think more should have been made of this. John Spencer, David Morse, Michael Biehn and John C McGinley all offer solid support It's not perfect, there are parts of this movie, which drive me crazy. The car chase in San Francisco is a major culprit - the cutting is so fast and disorganized that the it's a headache!! You get an even bigger one if you look at the destruction of property and the lives endangered. Isn't this movie all about saving people from a terrorist attack?? That's my only gripe!!

Directed by Michael Bay and scripted by David Weisberg, it has the participation of Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage.Alcatraz is one of the most famous and feared prisons in the world. During decades of work, virtually no one could escape from there and tell the story. Now a museum, still retains its charm, and that was wisely used in this film. The wards of the old prison gave excellent scenarios for the film, filling it with a rusty and decadent beauty. The cast is good and the participation of Sean Connery and Ed Harris (the villain) stands out. Nicolas Cage has also played well, despite being erased by the two older actors. Nevertheless, this film is not usually considered one of the best in Connery's career (always pursued by Bond in people's mind). Ed Harris was surprisingly positive and managed to humanize his character. We see that its a man with feelings, acting in accordance with his conscience, despite the ends don't justify his means. The script is interesting, covering a topic rarely seen in action movies: chemical/biological terrorism. It contains several plot twist of great quality, becoming more unpredictable in more dramatic moments. The end is quite good.The film has some problems when using some very common action clichés such as putting Mason as a ""lone hero"" or that mediocre car chase full of accidents, too sensational to be credible.

57,Vartiainen,Hard-packed action classic,6,14 April 2015,"The Rock is generally considered to be one of the major Nicholas Cage films and one of the better Sean Connery films as well. And for a reason. It's a classic 90s action film from an era where the plot lines have started to become a little darker, but where the heroes still believe in human ideals and doing what's right.The Rock rises above its peers mainly because of its main actors. Both Cage and Connery are well-suited for their roles and their quirks and charisma hold the cheesy plot together. Not that I have anything against cheesy. On the contrary, I prefer my action movies to be at least slightly removed from brutal reality, and this movie is simply goldilocks.It also helps that the script is clever enough to keep us guessing until the very end. The basic premise, that of Alcatraz prison tourists held hostage, is enough to arouse our interest and from there the main players are introduced and allowed to work off each other. They're all distinct enough and memorable enough that you'll care what happens to them and you'll be pleasantly shocked when some of them do something unexpected. There are plenty of twists to keep you interested and the whole story does not have a lull moment in it, as it should be.That being said, the story as a whole is a bit clichéd, even by 90s standards, and while some of the twists are surprising, the main story arc is rather predictable. I'd claim that it's a professional take on old story traditions, but some might argue that it could have been more original with some effort. Personally I don't mind all that much, but it's a theoretical flaw.The Rock is a treat for all fans of action. It's one of the more well-known action films for a reason and is sure to thrill all those that decide to give it a watch.",The Rock

59,freemantle_uk,Bayham madness!,8,13 March 2010,"The Rock is a perfect example of a Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay film, simple popcorn action. A lot of people including myself have been critical of some of the films they have made and been criticised for dumbing down plots for simple profit.Brigadier General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) is a highly respected special forces general, who ends up being disillusioned with the American Government, when they dismiss the deaths of special forces soldiers, and not give families the money or the respect they deserve. He takes up extreme action to achieve his goal: with a special force team he steals a stockpile of VX from the US military and then takes hostiles on Alcatraz. Hummel threatens to fire the VX over San Francisco if his demands are not meant and the American government has limited options. The American government only option is to try and send in a special forces team, with a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) to disarm the weapons. The problem is that there is only one man who knows how to get into Alcatraz, John Mason (Sean Connery). The thing is, Mason was a former MI6 and SAS soldier, who was arrested by the American, and well unhappy of his arrest, and a now a man in his 60s.Some critics and film fans believe that The Rock is Michael Bay's best film, seeing it as simple summer entertain that is not being pretentious. I disagree, I believe that The Island and Transformers are better films. However the Rock is Michael Bay at his best and worst. There are very good action sequences, especially the military based action. He is not reliant on massive CGI sequence like he is in his later films. Bay could make a good film about special forces. Bay also shoots the film with the aim of an R-rating, and not playing it safe like he has done. Bay also ensembles a good cast, this was when Nicholas Cage was at the height of his career. Sean Connery is in one of his better roles outside Bond, though his part has to be Scottish because he can't do any other accent: if his character was Russian it would have been a bit more believable. Ed Harris was the strongest performer in the film as a the villain, who was made to be a complex character who had a noble cause unlike some villains in summer blockbusters. Bay was also able to fill smaller roles with talented actors, like John Spencer, John C. McGinley and Michael Biehn. But there are a lot of problems that are common with Michael Bay films. Bay has no clue how to reign in his films and like Transformers, Armageddon, etc... The Rock is too long. Bay needs a good editor who can make his films more tort and well more watchable. With this sort of film where the plot is very simple then making it long really affects the film. Things could be have easily been cut, like the car chase in San Francisco. A problem with the film is tone. When the script is written it aimed to be very serious, whilst the re-writes and the direction by Bay wanted to make it more light hearted and comedic. This shows with the different performances, with Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage almost being like a buddy pair, whilst actors like Ed Harris and John Spencer were more serious in their roles. As well there are some script problems, where the film explains too much details to the audience, and not respecting their intelligence. The script also has plot holes, like wouldn't the media question why people were missing or couldn't get to Alcatraz.In a film like this I describe Michael Bay as Oliver Stone with more explosions. This is a film that references at some conspiracy theories and American secret actions, like the locking up of Mason. A more political director would have flagged this issues up more, but a more political director possibility wouldn't have done this film. The theories involving Hoover and the microfilm wasn't needed at all.There are enjoyable action scenes, but there are problems with this film.",The Rock

I may get slammed by others for proclaiming such strong admirations for such a movie, but it's squarely my opinion. But to remove myself from opinion and move in the direction toward known fact, ""The Rock"" is an essential action film for any action-film fan.Three years ago I bought the last remaining Criterion Collection DVD at my local video store and I can see now beyond the horizon that another edition of this masterpiece probably isn't coming any time soon. It is squarely the best film ever done by music video champ-turned-big-budget-Hollywood-music-video-director Michael Bay and the last film ever produced by the Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer duo (Simpson died shortly before ""The Rock"" was released and the film is dedicated in his memory).But ""The Rock"" is all about one thing: entertainment, and nothing else. It's a hell of a ride from start to finish with plenty 'o explosions, humor, car chases, and one-liners supplied in a dynamite script by Douglas Cook, Mark Rosner, and David Weisberg (that also contains un-credited work from Quentin Tarantino). Even after this praise, you are, naah, you're not, still interested in seeing why ""The Rock"" is so essential, are you?To put it like this, the action begins with General Francis ""Frank"" R. Hummel (Ed Harris) having a vigil at his wife's grave and tells her that he is about to make a haste decision in the name of the many men who have died under his command and were consequently forgotten by the American government.So he and his men stage a daring heist at a military depot and make off with 16 rockets loaded with deadly V-X gas, which in the words of one of the film's characters, ""Is one of the deadliest substances known to man."" Their next move is to make a point that they aren't to be toyed with anymore. So Frank stages a hostage takeover at Alcatraz prison in San Francisco Bay. He tells the kids that are part of a tour group to head back to the boats while the 88 hostages are held in the prison's cells.Hummel demands the government make restitutions to the surviving family members of every man who has given his life for this country and if they aren't met, San Francisco will be reduced to nothing but a giant cloud of poison gas. The Pentagon and assorted officials know the score: they know that Hummel knows he isn't to be messed with and they take his demands seriously.A plan is put into effect: a SEAL team is dispatched to try to retake the island, but there is one catch. No one alive knows the inner workings of Alcatraz prison. No one knows, except John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), the only man known to have escaped the infamous island and lived to tell about it. But he's under maximum security incarceration because in the eyes of one F.B.I. Director John Womack (the late John Spencer), he knows all of America's most ""intimate"" secrets (including who really shot JFK) and allowing Mason to be on the loose would be a pretty bad idea.There is a third prong: an F.B.I. lab rat with no field experience, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), is also assigned, and with Mason in tow, they'll accompany the SEALs to Alcatraz to try to dismantle the rockets and Hummel. Of course Goodspeed is reluctant but because a baby is on the way with his longtime girlfriend, he decides he has no choice but to go.From then on, you know the game since any attempt to further describe the plot would be an exercise in futility: lots of people get shot, firefights, and breakneck pacing that's trademark of one Mr. Bay and any film produced by a certain Mr. Bruckheimer. What keeps this boat afloat is the dynamic and unlikely partnering of Connery and Cage, who both know their roles well and play off one another, add to the other's performance like old friends as they navigate through Alcatraz's labyrinth of dark tunnels and sewers. Ed Harris is even given a third dimension in his villain role that elevates him above the typical action-movie bad guy. He's a soldier with a chip on his shoulder and his argument is quite convincing (I almost bought into myself). But his true motives later become the subject of a rather colorful and inventive plot twist late in the film.""The Rock"" is why we go to theaters for action in the first place. My view: ""The Rock"" rocks, big time.Just check it out to see.10/10",The Rock
61,Coxer99,Welcome to the Rock!,6,4 March 1999,"Connery and Cage seemed mismatched at first, but then made good as a screen team attempting to take down a devious Ed Harris. From Jerry Bruckheimer and under the direction of Michael Bay, the film is an entertaining mix of explosive action, drama and humor.",The Rock
62,drqshadow-reviews,"Soft, Chewy and Obviously Bad for You - It's a Cinematic Candy Bar",7,1 April 2012,"A perfect symphony of cliché and stereotype that Michael Bay's been trying like hell to recreate ever since. Literally every single shot dips liberally from the well of overuse, culminating in an early car chase with a little old lady, a roving gang of bicyclists and a dozen diving pedestrians in the road, no less than five instantly-combustible parked cars and a Lamborghini that leaps through a plate glass window. Nic Cage and Sean Connery, no strangers to this type of picture, freely toss away their inhibitions and embrace the cheese from word one and, along with a straight-laced performance from Ed Harris, somehow validate the whole thing. The dialog would have been deemed too unrealistic for a Hanna-Barbara cartoon, but through sheer force of will (plus a few blatant winks at the audience) it works too. Top of the mountain for the 'insanely stupid action flick' boom of the mid '90s, it's wildly fast-paced and thoroughly enjoyable in spite of itself.",The Rock
63,alindsay-al,A Great Action Film,8,4 November 2020,"So late last week legendary actor Sean Connery passed away at the age of 90, so I thought in tribute I would review a film of his. I could have taken an easy choice like one of his Bond films or The Last Crusade but I thought I would pick a film I amazingly haven't seen in The Rock and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees an ex-con and chemist have to team up to take down a rogue group of soldiers from unleashing a chemical weapons attack from Alcatraz to San Francisco.Main Character
So onto the man himself Sean Connery and he is fantastic here, this such a great role for him to be a part of. He plays this con, but he just has so much charisma and charm about him that you will like him and root for him. He adds plenty of life to his character and the film making this another fun role for him but with a bit more depth added along to it. Obviously he is a tremendous actor and his role here is another to add to the list and one you should see.Supporting Characters
This film also has a great supporting cast, Nicolas Cage gives a crazily entertaining performance. Anybody else it wouldn't work, but Cage just knows how to give this type of performance and make it highly entertaining. The chemistry between him and Connery is really good and is fun to watch as they are so different, seeing this younger Cage bounce off the experienced Connery is a great idea and provides a great pairing. Ed Harris plays the main antagonist here and he does a great job, he is actually a well layered and interesting character with sensible motivations and some depth that makes him a great part of the film. There are also some other great actors here such as Michael Biehn, Tony Todd & John C McGinley who add plenty to their roles.Story
The story works for the film we are watching, it is mainly because of the interesting characters that it works. They are given depth to work with and the fun pairing between Connery and Cage really carries this film through the fun set pieces. But I will say I thought the last act and the way they treat Harris' character in particular didn't quite work for me and it led to a bit of a disappointing finale for me.Script
The script is really fun, yes there are some ridiculous lines but Cage manages to pull it off. I thought there was a great blend between humour and drama and it made this a better action film then most like it.Style
The style has some good action scenes in it, that are exciting to watch and allow you to turn your brain off. But this film is directed by Michael Bay and his hands are all over the film, some of the action scenes are hard to track, things explode everywhere and the film is too long, luckily this film doesn't suffer as much as his Transformers films but it is still here.Overall
Overall, this is a great action film that is a fun watch and for fans of action films it is a must watch. Also to see another great Sean Connery performance as there are so many of them over his decorated career.",The Rock
64,Fluke_Skywalker,The movie even Bay-haters like,6,7 April 2019,"Plot; A group of embittered Special Forces soldiers take control of Alcatraz prison and hold the city of San Francisco to ransom w/rockets filled w/a deadly nerve gas. W/few options and time ticking away, the government seeks the help of a former prisoner who once broke out of the infamous prison on a mission to retake it and stop the terrorists before it's too late.Michael Bay. No director in Hollywood history has had more success making films that nearly everyone claims to hate. But Bay has one film on his resume that even his harshest critics admit to liking, if only as a guilty pleasure. 1996's The Rock. Starring a rounding third base Sean Connery and a freshly post-Oscar Nic Cage, it has nearly all of Bay's signatures, but like a bad steak smothered in A-1 sauce, they're easier to choke down here. A lot of the credit goes to the cast. Connery is still working at the apex of his star power while Cage is still a few years away from falling into self parody and brings his manic charms bear. The best performance, however, is from the always great Ed Harris as the sympathetic defacto villain of the piece.The Rock isn't great cinema, and for my money it's not Bay's best or even most entertaining film, but it is a slick, lean and fun actioner that scratches a few different itches on a lazy Saturday afternoon.",The Rock
65,jimbo-53-186511,Consistently exciting and engaging thriller,9,6 August 2013,"The Rock is an absolutely brilliant film which is jam packed with excitement, humour, tension and it also contains characters with plenty of depth.The film begins with General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) at his wife's grave apologising to her saying that he 'is sorry and that he has to do this'. Hummel is the leader of the US Marines and we see in the beginning that he gains access to Alcatraz to steal biological weapons under the pretence that they are carrying out a security check. Once they have the weapons, this then sets up the second act where Hummel and his men seize control of Alcatraz by appearing to be on a tour of Alcatraz with a group of civilians. Once inside the prison, Hummel and his men take their opportunity and hold the civilians and the tour guide hostage. Hummel makes his demands to the FBI and the government and demands a substantial amount of money within 40 hours otherwise he will unleash the biological weapons onto San Francisco Bay.What makes the Rock stand out as a good thriller is that this isn't just a case of a lunatic just holding people hostage for no apparent reason? We get to learn that Hummel and his men all feel cheated by the government - members of their platoon lost their lives with seemingly no acknowledgement from the government. They are also angry as there was no compensation from the government for the victims of those men who lost their lives. This sets Hummel and his men up sort of as 'vigilantes'. So whilst what they are doing is wrong, in a way they feel that they are on a 'moral crusade' - they don't see why they should value other people's lives when the government clearly didn't care about the lives of any of their men that were killed. This not only gives the story depth, but it also gives the characters depth too.Due to the intelligence that the Marines have, the government and the FBI know that they need to send the 'best' that they have in order to infiltrate the Marines and free the hostages. They feel they need a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) in order to disarm the bombs, but in order for the weapons expert to be able to disarm the bombs they'll need someone who knows the prison inside and out and thus they also send in the only man to ever escape Alcatraz John Mason (Connery) who has been incarcerated for over 30 years. Mason is reluctant to help at first and only agrees to help in order to get a pardon - a lot of fun in the Rock comes from Mason's numerous escape attempts (which are usually quite creative). It is also amusing to see the 2 men constantly trying to 'out do' each other.Another thing that I enjoyed was the 'tongue in cheek' approach that Michael Bay has taken when making this film. Not only have we got a film with a strong plot and good character development, but it is clear that both Bay and the cast had fun when making this film. There were so many funny moments and great one liners that I just can't remember all of them. Then we come to the acting. Sean Connery is one of my favourite actors and he always seems to bring that little something extra in any film he appears in. I predicted before I started watching the film that he would have some of the funniest lines and I was right. Nicolas Cage is a bit of a hit and miss actor in my book, but I thought he was great in this as well. I felt that him and Connery played off each other really well. This is an outstanding film with lots of tension, plenty of funny scenes, good plot and is packed full of great characters and is definitely not to be missed!",The Rock
66,barnabyrudge,"Standard action picture for the popcorn generation, with a more exciting plot and classier cast than most.",7,21 December 2005,"For his second film (following on from the noisy no-brainer ""Bad Boys"") director Michael Bay gives us ""The Rock"". This pounding, pulsating action flick is full of plot holes and implausible action set pieces, but has terrific energy and a handful of engaging performances which make its flaws forgivable. It is a film that will never win any awards for subtlety, but it is effective in doing what it sets out to do - that being to fill two hours of screen time with spectacle and entertainment. Bay is a director whose work I generally tend to dislike but with ""The Rock"" he has, for once, done a good job (aided in no small part by the excitingly silly premise and the game performances of Connery, Cage and Harris).Disgruntled American war hero General Francis X. Hummel (Ed Harris) and a team of heavily armed mercenaries seize the San Francisco island-prison of Alcatraz. They imprison a group of tourists and set up a series of missiles at various points around the island. Each missile contains a lethal chemical which, when released or exploded, has the capacity to kill hundreds of thousands of people in the vicinity. A team of soldiers is assembled to get onto the Rock, led by Commander Anderson (Michael Biehn). Also sent along for the purpose of disarming the missiles is inexperienced chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a guy who would rather be cuddling up to his pregnant wife than tackling a bunch of impeccably-drilled renegade marines. The only problems is that none of them have any idea how to get onto Alcatraz undetected, so the Government agents have to reluctantly call upon the one man who can help them. Ex-SAS soldier John Mason (Sean Connery), who has been locked away 30 years for stealing a government microfilm and is the only man ever to have escaped from Alcatraz, is temporarily ""freed"" and instructed to guide the raiding party into the underground tunnels of The Rock. The raid goes awry and nearly all the would-be rescuers are captured and killed, leaving just Mason and Goodspeed to evade the bad guys, find and disarm the missiles, and save the city!!""The Rock"" is very much a packaged, polished film. Nothing raw, edgy or unpredictable here. It's a film that plays safe and delivers the requisite thrills and spills in much the same way that a roller-coaster does. As usual the bad guys can't shoot straight, and the good guys can always think of a witty remark at the very moment they dispose of a villain. The action filmed in a dizzying, lightning-fast style with whizzing pans of the camera and furious cross-cutting of camera angles. This makes the action come across as fast-paced and exciting. Hans Zimmer's score is suitably frenetic and adds to the drama. As you would expect there are predictable scenes, moments that require total suspension of belief, chunks of corny macho dialogue, and every cliché in the book (including a wholly irrelevant car chase - but hey! What's a film set in San Francisco if it DOESN'T feature a car chase?!?) In spite of all this ""The Rock"" is a lot of fun and if you watch it for what it is, you'll find it an entertaining slice of escapism.",The Rock
67,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Pure action bliss with a top notch cast.,10,21 November 2015,"Michael Bay's The Rock is one of the quintessential action films of the 90's (many of which Cage has starred in actually), and a blast of rousing energy and adrenaline that careens along in bang up fashion for two plus hours. From a breakneck car chase through the streets of San Francisco, to a furious missile raid on Alcatraz island and all manner of shootouts, fistfight and one liners in between, it's classic stuff. When bitter renegade General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris giving nobility to one of the most brutally relatable antagonists in the genre) hijacks several warheads containing deadly weaponized nerve gas and threatens to launch them from Alcatraz to the city, the powers that be scramble to find a solution. Hummel wants countless unnamed, Dead veterans to receive the accommodation owed to them by a callous, corrupt government. FBI honchos Womack (a snide John Spencer), and Paxton (sympathetic William Forsythe, excellent as usual) recruit rookie chemical analyst Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) to enter with a team of mercs to neutralize Hunmel's forces. They also dig up forgotten British secret agent John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) from prison, since he once escaped from Alcatraz and knows the layout. Connery, cunning, genial and deadly when he has to be, is an absolute joy in the role, playing up the banter and swashbuckle with obvious shades of Bond. His dry wit and laid back, nonchalant nature together with Cage's squirrelly, regular joe exasperation lead the film forward with a momentum based in character as well as fireworks. The a nice turn from Michael Biehn as an intense SEAL Commander in charge of the assault on the island, Tony Todd is scenery chewing glory as evil Captain Darrow, and there's nice work from John C. McGinley, Claire Forlani, Stuart Wilson, David Morse and Bokeem Woodbine too. Set to a thumping score supplied by Hans Zimmer, eye boggling camera work from John Schwartzman and sleekly tied together by Bay's unbelievable ambition and opulent eye for staging crazy action, it's one of my favourites of the genre.",The Rock

69,drystyx,Takes the fun out of movie watching,1,8 January 2007,"""The Rock"" suffers most from bad writing. The script is just bad. It relies on special effects, action, and emotions from characters who the writers feel are superior to the viewer. They take all the fun out of movie viewing. The movie takes all the stock elements of routine movie making and keep the very worst ones. Whatever makes a movie less appealing, they do. The movie is meant for people already coupled, probably making it a woman's movie. Instead of boy meets girl, it copies the formula of 99% of other movies in which boy already owns girl. Its a movie designed to delight only the rich, wealthy viewer with a family. The two lead characters are impossible to like. They have superiority complexes that would even make Sly and Arnie look meek. This might pass if the movie was made as a comic farce, but it isn't. Half of the movie's dialog consists of the lines in which Connery claims ""winners"", which the movie has no subtle pretense to mean ""men who can do the job, perform, survive, understand, etc"", can only be men who were early childhood successes, early developers who were part of early established marriages, who were successes in high school, who had sex with the ""prom queen"". Yes, it is nonsense. Its also the most Republican propaganda ever in a movie. The viewer doesn't care if any of these characters get killed. Even if you live in the target city, you probably won't care. The plot is over the top, which is okay if the people are interesting. These aren't.",The Rock
70,gcd70,Full tilt but no surprises,6,28 March 2008,"Incredibly formulaic thriller from the director of the equally contrived, though not as interesting, ""Bad Boys"". ""The Rock"" manages to borrow from many other films of this genre, and though Jonathan Hensleigh's script has taken a slightly different tack - with an obsessive, determined mercenary who isn't all we believe him to be, and a new, hi-tech deadly weapon - the pic really offers little in the way of freshness and originality.Having said all that, director Michael Bay and his cast do manage to entertain us throughout the movie thanks to some well staged action sequences, great cinematography and special effects, as well as some sprightly thesping. Our director has made the most of the many explosive scenes, and the cast do well, involving the audience in the goings on.Nicholas Cage is likable as the every man come saviour of the world. Sean Connery isn't asked to stretch his talents a great deal, but one can never help but enjoy his presence. Backing these two up is a solid support cast including the little seen Michael Biehn (""Terminator"" and ""Aliens""), the ever strong Ed Harris (""Apollo 13"") and William Forsythe.""The Rock"" comes recommended to those who enjoy full tilt, adrenalin pumping action without too many surprises.Saturday, September 7, 1996 - Knox District Centre",The Rock
71,truemythmedia,Michael Bay's Best,6,13 June 2019,"Well, I can't hate this movie, and that's more than I can say for most Michael Bay (""Transformers"", ""Pain and Gain"") movies. In circles of certain cinephiles, Michael Bay is often tossed around as one of the reasons for the degradation of modern cinema. I agree with that assessment. I think Michael Bay's films are juvenile and ridiculous, and they're often aimed at audiences with the maturity of fourth grade boys. This movie is pretty stupid. It's loud, unbelievable, way over the top, and it's full of cheesy dialogue, but... I can't hate this movie. This is one of Bay's films that manages to get a pass from me, primarily because of its leads and its devil may care attitude.",The Rock
72,Samiam3,Welcome to the Rock,8,25 July 2009,"I've heard one reviewer say about Michael Bay that he is aggressively untalented. This may be true, but as much as we all love to hate him, I cannot deny that he has made a couple of solidly entertaining movies. The Rock is one of them. I think this is his best movie and also one of the best action movies of its decade. With good performances from a sensational cast and rousing action, The Rock a worthy watch.We begin the story with general Frank Hummel, who is angry with his country. He feels that that families of his dead war comrades did not receive proper compensation. He steals sixteen warheads and holds a Eighty San Francisco civilians hostage in Alcatraz. He then gives the American constitution two days to pay (I forget how much money) or it's boom time. The FBI turns to one extraordinary individual for help. John Mason, is the only person ever to escape from Alcatraz. For reasons unknown to us, he has been locked away for thirty years, only released now to help. He is angry and unwilling, but eventually he cooperates. With the help of quirky FBI scientist Stanley Goodspeed, Mason takes a team to Alcatraz, to try and sabotage Hummel's plan from the inside. Is it gonna work?The story may not be super smart, but it holds together solidly, except for one silly plot twist which starts the climax. It has to do with the character of Frank Hummel, who is one of the more interesting bad guys in Hollywood blockbuster history. The script fleshes him out to a fairly large extent, and Ed Harris's performance brings a certain warmth to the character. It was not until A History of Violence came out when I realized that Ed Harris can play a really dirty villain. Compared to that movie, he seems about as menacing as a boyscout in the Rock. Sean Connery plays his role well, and unlike Harrison Ford, his age does not interfere with the character. Nicholas Cage is extremely funny as the typical nerd scientist, but at times he goes a little too far over the top. Regardless of where the characters have occasional flaws, you end up having too much fun with them to care.This applies to the Rock as a whole. It has its idiocies, but it does just about everything that a good action film should. It is almost the Die Hard of the decade.",The Rock
73,davidmvining,San Francisco goes boom,8,12 May 2020,"One of the reasons this movie works so well is the complete commitment to the reality of the film from the actors. From the main three actors to every marine, SEAL, and FBI agent, every actor is 100% committed to the story of a deranged marine general stealing chemical weapons and threatening San Francisco. The style is hyperactive, the music is pounding and propulsive, and the action moves at a high paced clip from beginning to end, almost never slowing down to breathe, but through it all, Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, and Ed Harris sell their characters fully. It provides us with the emotional grounding that we can hang onto through all the insanity that surrounds it.Ed Harris' General Hummel is a really good antagonist. I mean, really good. He's driven by an injustice that he sells to the audience really well. Men under his command, doing illegal missions for the US government, were left to die in the field and their families told nothing while given no benefits. Men he was in charge of and forced to watch twist in the wind to no purpose. His rage, sold by Harris, is palpable, but Harris doesn't overplay it. It's the contained rage of a man who's been fighting battles for his whole life. It's the focused rage of a man who knows how to make a plan and follow through. It's the dedicated rage of a man with resolve. When he and his men storm into a naval base under the guise of an inspection and walk away with fifteen VX gas rockets, we see a man of honor taken to the extreme.On the other end is Stanley Goodspeed. He's a chemical weapons freak who leads a boring life. He drives a Volvo, a beige one. Our introduction to him is watching him use a toy gun to start a Rube Goldberg machine that ends with a hula statue consumed in flames. He's also thrown into a glass room where he has to deactivate a sarin gas bomb against a ticking clock showing how in control he is in a stressful situation involving his area of expertise. It was almost a lab experiment, though. The only people around him he ignored or shoved away in order to work. He was given the weapon to defuse, he didn't have to go out and find it.The third main character is James Patrick Mason, Sean Connery's character. He's a British Intelligence operative who's been in the American prison system for over thirty years, escaping from two maximum security prisons along the way, including Alcatraz where General Hummel has set up operations. I like the little theory that Mason is an alternate universe version of James Bond. It's amusing.Anyway, getting Goodspeed and Mason to the Rock involves a car chase through San Francisco (with plenty of destruction) and an underwater incursion into the bowels of the former prison. It's slick, frantic, and done with good humor to help balance out the destruction. The pair soon find themselves alone on the island against a bunch of marines when the SEALs providing them support walk into an ambush and all die.And that's when the movie distills down to a conflict between three people. General Hummel is trying to smoke out the two last members of the incursion team while Goodspeed is focused solely on the deadly chemical primed to shoot and Mason is more concerned with finding a way to escape everything at last. It's that dynamic that really drives the film up to its exciting, explosion filled conclusion, but the movie makes its one serious mistake in order to extend the movie to its final fight.Hummel has brought a cadre of marines with him. He knows most of them, but not all, represented by two captains, Frye and Darrow. Why a general with decades of combat experience couldn't find a full team that supports him (I'm think of Marco Ramius and his officers in The Hunt for Red October) escapes me, but on top of that, the second they show up on screen it's obvious that they are psychopaths with no interest in the point of the mission. They stick out sorely, and they are there because Hummel is a man of honor and a soldier and not a murderer, so once he flinches in the final act, the threat of deadly force on the city disappears. It has to be replaced with something outside of Hummel, and they chose cartoon characters. I can imagine other ways to extend the threat beyond Hummel (having one marine who believes in the mission, doesn't care about the money, and decides that the lives of the civilians of San Francisco are less worthy than the memory of his fallen comrades), but they didn't go with that. I really want this movie to be a solid fifteen minutes longer (on an already kind of long two hour and fifteen minute runtime) in order to build up this new character I've just made up in my head and sell the final turn better.The action is frantic but clear. The movie clips along breezily as it destroyed half of San Francisco. The actors are all shockingly good in characters that all feel surprisingly believable. All of it revolves around a bad guy with a strong motive. Really, aside from Captains Frye and Darrow, this is just propulsive action filmmaking at its finest.",The Rock
74,Spleen,Who was dill enough to hand such good material to Michael Bay?,6,2 May 2000,"I won't say the script is perfect.  Some of the dialogue clunks - that corny speech the president gives!  I mean, really:  `How does one weigh eighty lives against five million?'  One counts.  -Or my favourite (no doubt I paraphrase a little): `We can't risk letting him loose.  He's an escape artist.'  It's funnier than `You can't fight in here, it's the war room,' but I suspect the humour was unintentional.  And however over the top the action may have been, it all seems much sillier when we're casually informed that John Mason knows all of the FBI's secrets: `The alien ship at Roswell, who really shot J.F.K. ...'; I was surprised they didn't add, `... and the truth about the Cottingley fairies.'  These clunky lines eat away at the script's solid foundation like acid.  It's particularly bad to watch how keen the film seems to be to undermine its two main characters, Mason and Goodspeed.  Sean Connery (Mason), and to an even greater extent, Nicholas Cage (Goodspeed) are frequently called upon to drop out of character in order to deliver some tough-guy sarcastic comment; it's never worth it.  The most jarring moment comes when Connery says, `Your BEST?  Losers always whine about doing their best.  Winners go home and hump the prom queen.' (Actually, he used a different verb; but - and I strongly disapprove of this censorship regulation - the IMDb won't permit me to reproduce it here.)  Not only is this not the kind of thing Mason would say; nobody from outside the United States would ever, in any context, utter the phrase `prom queen'.But these departures from character at least show us that Mason and Goodspeed had characters to depart FROM.  This is something, surely.  In fact it's a good deal.  The characters actually survive the corrosive process the writers have put them through.  There are a lot of ideas - plot and character ideas, I mean - in `The Rock', and they're mostly rather good ideas.  (Okay, ONE of the ideas is, `terrorist threatens to destroy city unless his rather silly demands are met' - an oldie, but a goodie.)  The story is well built and it feels satisfying however much the fascist military sentimentalism sours the palate, however many of Michael Bay's damned music video montages we have to sit through, however the rapid cutting tends to confuse rather than enlighten us as to exactly what's going on during the action sequences.  A good story triumphs - at least to some degree - over poor execution.NB:  Not once but twice a character sticks a syringe into his own heart.  I find this kind of thing MUCH more disturbing to watch than most of the things people complain about seeing in the cinema; I suspect I'm not alone, and I feel it's my duty to warn others.  Notwithstanding this, or anything else I've said, it's an enjoyable movie.",The Rock

Maybe all the amazing actors willed this movie to be better than it should have been. Whatever the case, it is a fun movie. The shaky cam close-ups is annoying but that's Michael Bay for you.

Occasionally, there would be an action movie not starring a 90s action icon. Furthermore, there would be an action movie that had all the right stuff that would make it stand beside Die Hard or Terminator. The Rock may not be at their level, but it is better than most action movies you see.The biggest hit for The Rock is its general premise: after locking down and taking over Alcatraz, a vengeful marine (Ed Harris) and his crew steal a lethal poison and place it in missiles and threaten to destroy San Francisco unless his fellow comrades get royalties they much deserve. Only an FBI chemical weapons expert (Nicolas Cage) and Alcatraz escapist (Sean Connery) know how to save the day.Sure it may sound like just a general hostage story, but knowing Harris' motives really set this apart from other hostage movies. I actually rooted for Harris to make it out alive and/or align with Connery and Cage after all hell breaks loose. He is so sympathetic and steals every scene he is in. He and Sean Connery are the deepest characters in the movie. Although they appear to be bad at first, your mind soon changes. Nicolas Cage is his usual flamboyant self who is not quite as likable as Connery or Harris. John Spencer, David Morse, and William Forsythe are the forerunners and they each help raise the quality of chemistry and plot development.Of course, an action movie has to be fast-paced and well choreographed in order to pass. And by-golly this does! Many awesome gunfights and explosions that cause the stakes to rise and plot to advance.Tremendous!3/4",The Rock

78,philip_vanderveken,One of my favorite action movies and I'm normally not a fan of these kind of films,7,3 June 2005,"Let me start by saying that I'm absolutely no fan of action movies. I find most of them ridiculous and try to avoid them as much as possible. That's of course not a good start when you are about to watch a movie like ""The Rock"". But before you think that you know where this review will go, I also have to say that this is probably one of the few action movies for which I'll make an exception. That's right, I really like this one and there are many reasons for that. But let me start by telling you what the story is about.General Hummel has spent most of his career carrying out covert operations. Over the years, he has lost many men, because they got killed during one of these operations or because they had to be left behind. Since these operations were secret, those men or their families have never received any recognition or compensation. After trying to get them that through normal channels, Hummel now decides that it's time for drastic measures. Together with a group of renegade marine commandos he seizes a stockpile of chemical weapons and takes over Alcatraz, taking 81 tourists hostage. If the government doesn't pay 100 million dollar, he will launch 15 rockets, aimed directly to San Francisco and carrying deadly VX nerve gas. As time is running out, the Pentagon sends in an elite SEAL team, together with an FBI chemical warfare expert and a former Alcatraz escapee...So even though I'm not a fan of action movies, I must say that for this one I'm glad to make an exception. I like it so much because of the very good acting, the good character development, some fine special effects, the believable action and the unexpected twists in this well-written story. I know that's a lot to discuss, so let's start with the acting. With a top cast like this one, including people like Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris, William Forsythe... you can't expect anything less but some top-notch performances, but that doesn't mean that you'll get it of course. Too often you'll see some good actors who don't seem to belong in a certain movie or who just seem to have a day that nothing works. Not in this movie. Every single actor has done a very fine job, which of course is a pleasure to watch. The fact that they had some interesting and believable characters to work with will have helped them with that of course. Think for instance of Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage). He is no superhero who will just walk in through the main gate, shooting every bad guy with his eyes shut and rescuing all the hostages at the same time. No, this is a man with no decent military training, good at working with chemicals, but afraid to be confronted with the enemy. The same for John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), he's no superman either. He's a retired SAS commando, so he knows how to kill a foe, but he's also an old man who has spent most of his time in a prison cell. And it's the same about the other characters. No-one of them is just good or just bad and that's what I like so much about this movie. The characters have a certain depth, which is a rare thing for an action movie.Next to the good acting and the interesting characters, I also liked the action and the special effects. Of course there are a lot of explosions and yes there is a major car chase to be seen in it, but then again: this is still an action movie. If it isn't allowed in this one, where can you use it in then? And it has to be said, it is sometimes a bit much and too prominent, but it is never completely unbelievable like in so many other action movies. The fact that it all looks so good and that it all seems believable also has a lot to do with the nice special effects. Even though this movie is about ten years old now, it doesn't look dated at all. It adds a lot to the tension and the suspense and it feels like it was made only yesterday and that's something that you'll not find in every movie.So now I'm only left with the good story and the unexpected twists. I'm not going to give too much away about it of course, because that would spoil all the fun for those who haven't seen the movie yet. I just want to say that the story is a nice mix of action, drama, laughter and suspense. It's one big whirlpool that will probably suck you in and will not let you go until the end. I really liked that and that's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.",The Rock
79,Muhammad_Rafeeq,( American B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10,9,3 March 2020,The Rock is one of Michael Bay's best films. Sean Connery's performance is the best one out of all the actors. Nicolas Cage's acting is kind of pale.,The Rock
80,mjw2305,Action Movies don't come much better than this,9,29 January 2005,"Brigadeer General Hummel (Ed Harris) has had his fill with government cover-ups in war, and after the death of his wife decides now is the time to act. He recruits a team of Fine US Marines (now mercenaries), and takes over Alcatraz which is now a tourist attraction, so he has no shortage of Hostages, and with stolen chemical weapons at his disposal his threat is very real.CIA Chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), a man short on combat experience, but the only man with expert knowledge of the Chemical Weapons at Hummel's disposal.Comander Anderson (Michael Biehn) is the leader of the US Navy seals Strike team, charged with the task of infiltrating the island of Alcatraz.And Finally John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) an Ex SAS operative and former resident of Alcatraz, and the only man in history to ever escape the prison. Mason was caught stealing the most closely guarded secrets of the US Government and was consequently deleted from existence by FBI Director Womack (John Spencer) until now.Mason and Goodspeed, led by the seal team enter the siege and the battle commences, a battle of extreme skill, wits and power, that is awesome to witness.A Clever balance of Strong, believable characters, action and a strong plot, makes this movie both memorable and very enjoyable.Highly recommended to anyone who wants too see a good Action Thriller, there are not many that are this good.9/10",The Rock
81,sme_no_densetsu,Probably Michael Bay's best movie,7,20 October 2018,"These days, Michael Bay's name is synonymous with big budget action movies that are long on explosions and short on story. While that isn't an entirely fair characterization of his directorial output, it does ring true to a certain degree. ""The Rock"" was just his second feature film and, looking back, it's arguably his best.The story concerns an imminent chemical weapons attack on San Francisco by a rogue group of military personnel. The bad guys are holed up on Alcatraz with a group of tourists held hostage. The government has hatched a scheme to break in to Alcatraz with the aid of a British spy who has been jailed for 30 years. You see, this man has quite a distinction: He's the only man to successfully break out of Alcatraz. Naturally, he can't do it on his own, so a group of Navy Seals accompanies him along with an expert on chemical weapons.The high concept plot is a step in the right direction since the movie has a decent hook to separate it from countless other action movies. What's more, the movie's villains are even treated somewhat sympathetically, which is a welcome surprise. Sure, the movie may get a bit silly and/or unbelievable at times but the core plot is an interesting one that certainly ought to satisfy any action fan.As with most Jerry Bruckheimer productions, the cast is one of the movie's strong points. Screen legend Sean Connery is the obvious headliner in what amounts to his last great action role while Nicolas Cage followed up his Oscar-winning turn in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" with his performance here. After all these years, I'm still not sure if I buy Cage as an action hero but he's an interesting choice, at least. In any case, for my money, it's Ed Harris in the 'bad guy' role who steals the show. Regardless, they were all given fine support by a nicely assembled group of supporting actors that included John Spencer, David Morse, William Forsythe, Michael Biehn, John C. McGinley and others.Again, since this is a Jerry Bruckheimer production, you know that the production values are going to be up to snuff. He and producing partner Don Simpson had brought to the screen the likes of ""Top Gun"" & ""Crimson Tide"", so this movie was right up their alley. Even Michael Bay's direction wasn't as frenetic here as we've since come to expect. Sure, the movie goes over the top at times but, as far as big budget action movies go, ""The Rock"" is one of the last notable successes before traditional stories like this started getting completely overshadowed by fantasy & science fiction.All in all, ""The Rock"" is a pretty good action movie. It's got plenty of spectacle but it doesn't forget to tell an engaging story as well. Even though it may not hold the same charm for me now that it did back when I was a teen, it still stands out as an above average action movie in the traditional mold.",The Rock
82,rivertam26,Explosively entertaining,8,14 May 2020,"Michael Bay's blockbuster action epic began here. Even though Bad Boys came out a year before and was moderately successful. This was the movie that really made his career and even watching over 20 years later it's easy to see why. The movie is fantastically entertaining. Some military dudes that were wronged by the government take some hostages at Alcatraz and demand a whole lot of money from the government for the families of their fallen comrades. Things escalate when they threaten to release a deadly chemical. So they call up scientist fred rookie Nicholas Cage and pair him up with a disheveled but bad ass Sean Connery as the only man whose successfully escaped the rock. The action is brilliant and in true Michael Bay fashion it can be a bit silly at times but overly entertaining. Funny, action packed and edge of your seat with a surprising amount of character depth. The movie also stars Ed Harris, Tony Todd, Claire Forlani, Michael Biehn and David Morse.Budget: $75m

83,Screen_Blitz,"Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery team up in this explosive, fun-filled action vehicle",8,9 February 2017,"In an era of groundbreaking blockbuster action flicks, this film directed by Michael Bay, the master of over-the-top action sequences and excessive explosions galore, places Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage and Academy Award nominee Sean Connery in 136 minutes of frenetic gunfights, hand-to-hand combat, and loud explosions absorbing the screen. Unlike the 'Die Hard' franchise which was a cutting-edge to the action genre, this film is nothing groundbreaking nor does it try to beat. But with likable performances by our leads Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery, adrenaline-fueled action set pieces, and a blissful taste of light-heart humor; the film is quite a bit of fun. Although Michael Bay is not a director who carries interest is soaking his films with sheer intelligence, he still knows how to craft a motion picture with enough mayhem and humor to leave keep our eyes glued to the screen. And who scores a better position in the producer's chair than Hollywood veteran Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson. The film follows a story of Stanley Goodspeed (played by Nicolas Cage), a biochemist for the FBI who's called on a mission to bring down General Francis Hummel (played by Ed Harris) who along his fellow Marines has taken prisoners of Alcatraz Island hostage and set wipe out San Francisco with chemical missiles unless the FBI does one thing: pay him the $100,000 he demands for his military service. Fighting by Goodspeed's side Mason (played by Sean Connery), a prison escapee who assists him on his no-holds-bar mission to thwart Hummel's attack and save the citizens of San Francisco.Director Michael Bay doesn't offer anything out of the ordinary for an action film. Thus, there are no genuine surprises to handed beyond a heavy load of explosive gunfights and hand-to-hand combat sequences which make a good portion of the near 2 1/2 hour runtime. Luckily, Bay succeeds at landing excitement and plenty of fun to indulge all the action film junkies. Nearly every second gunfire and explosions fills the screen, there is plenty of pulse-pounding tension to be handed. However, as the film is Rated R, these sequences do get pretty bloody and there are a few minor characters who meet their ends in graphic way such as chemical burns. In the end, it is all for the sake for drenching moviegoers in sheer thrills. Taking on the lead roles is Nicolas Cage and 'James Bond' veteran Sean Connery to show off some decent chemistry between one another. Their characters sprout a fair share of humorous one-liners and clever banter, and the performances stand fairly strong. Though neither of them meet the qualities of Bruce Willis's John McClane, both of which are surprisingly likable. As for the main antagonist General Francis Hummel played by Ed Harris, he makes for a surprising villain a little beyond your one-dimensional evildoer. He's portrayed as a figure not out for trouble just for the sake of causing mindless mayhem, but simply because of his emotional scars dealing with experience in the Vietnam War and the government failing to honor him and his fellow the financial gratitude they deserve. In the final climax, viewers can almost sympathize with him.The Rock is an explosive action flick glossed with entertaining action sequences, charismatic characters, and a fair share of thrills to feast the eyes for moviegoers. To say the least, it's a bit of fun. Although it may fall short of originality and substance, it works well as an absorbing popcorn flick to entertain those not anxious for anything cutting-edge in the action genre.",The Rock
84,pyrocitor,Solid as its namesake,8,9 June 2005,"When ex-military General Hummel (Ed Harris) takes 80 hostages at Alcatraz prison and threatens to kill the population of San Francisco with nerve gas if their ransom money is not delivered, the US government rushes into action. They deduce that the best way to sneak in undetected is a minimal attack force led by a high profile chemist (Nicholas Cage) and a wily convicted criminal, (Sean Connery) the only man to ever successfully escape from Alcatraz as an inmate.When a movie bears the name Michael Bay, we have now come to instantly associate that movie with ACTION. Fast moving, very thinly stretched plots, pounding rock music, tons of car chases and, of course, lots of explosions are sure to follow. But The Rock is, in my opinion, Bay's best film to this point (we'll see if this summer's The Island will surpass it) because it never attempts to be anything other than one it is - a Michael Bay action film. None of the disgustingly sappy American patriotism of Pearl Harbor, nor the offensive, borderline racism of the Bad Boys films is present here - just a good, solid action movie which never attempts to be anything more profound than entertaining.Sean Connery is perfectly cast as John Patrick Mason, the contemptuous criminal, enlisted to help save San Francisco by the government he despises so, and he fills the screen with his indomitable, natural charisma. Nicholas Cage gives a decent performance as the shy chemist who is finally called on to be a hero. (although he seems to have difficulty determining the difference between loud and dramatic in tense scenes) Contrary to most action movies, Cage's Dr. Stanley Goodspeed and Connery's Mason are actually given some basic character development: Goodspeed fearing throughout the whole movie, not only for his wife's safety, but for the fact that she is worrying about him regardless of if he succeeds or not, and Mason in a subplot involving his long lost daughter. Finally, Ed Harris is also a good casting call as the bitter general, demanding retribution for years of maltreatment during his military career. He is also given some decent character development - almost immediately, we find that despite his bitter attitude the General is a good man, not really intending to fire the nerve gas, and avoiding a body count at all possible occasions. David Morse also stands out as Hummel's intelligent and loyal second in command.So overall, The Rock is just your basic no-brainer action film, made better by the strong performances from the good cast, and Bay's steady directorial hand throughout. It's worth seeing, and doesn't even have a dimwitted enough plot to insult your intelligence! Just keep in mind that even though The Rock requires more conscious thought than the average action movie, it is still a Michael Bay movie... so prepare for explosions.-8/10",The Rock
85,Xstal,'Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious'...,5,16 September 2020,"... and what a vicious and vulgar piece of cinema this is as Sean Connery does what Sean Connery has always excelled at i.e. playing Sean Connery. If two hours of mind numbing nonsense is what you need, and we all need to find our escapes somehow, then this will fill that void perfectly (along with several hundred other examples in the genre, most recently with Gerard Butler playing Sean Connery) - just make those leaps of faith, accept what you're told, and take comfort that 007 had the virtue to save the true patriots after they'd viciously denied him his virility.",The Rock
86,mstomaso,Adrenalized..... yikes,8,27 March 2005,"The Rock is one of my all-time favorite suspense - thrillers. Believability - almost always a problem for this sort of film - is enhanced by a very compelling script, sets, and powerful performances by masters Sean Connery and Ed Harris. Like a good work of fiction, it's the quality of the telling that makes it believable, not the likelihood that it might happen. There are no problems with the way this story is told. The acting, editing, directing and visuals do not slip at all. Nick Cage - in a performance which approaches his best work - adds a bit of campiness and humor to this explosive mixture, and John Spencer, Tony Todd, David Morse, and Michael Biehn all contribute substantially to an exciting, fast-paced and emotionally draining film. Any avid movie-goer will be hard pressed to find a single actor in this sizable cast who has not either become a major star or a fine character actor over the last nine years.The plot takes a number of twists and turns along the road, so to discuss almost any aspect of it in detail would require at least mild spoilers. None of the plot twists are unbelievable if you are willing to accept the basic premise. The story begins with Ed Harris - a Viet Nam war hero and field leader who is now a general and has become fed up with the abandonment of covert forces operatives by the US government. To get what he wants, he recruits some of the best officers under his command to take control of and hold Alcatraz Island, holding 70-some-odd civilians hostage and aiming four missiles loaded with deadly Sarin gas directly at the heart of San Francisco.Biehn heads an elite Navy SEAL team assigned to infiltrate and disable Harris' capabilities. Cage joins him as the FBI biochemical specialist assigned the task of disarming the warheads, and the only man who can get them in to do their respective jobs is an aging British intelligence agent who has been incarcerated for 30 years or so by the government that now needs his help. Connery's John Mason escaped from Alcatraz during his incarceration, and for all intents and purpose - is a much rougher, more real James Bond character without the gadgets and the comic-book super-villains. All of the above is established in the first ten minutes of the film and the next two hours is a wild ride, with some very tense moments and some very intense performances.I'm sure a lot of people will pick this film apart for the occasional unbelievable scene, etc, but it's worth while to remember - as my spouse is always telling me - ""its only a movie"".If you want reality, take a walk outside or go to work! There are no discernible powerful political messages in this film. While it must be acknowledged that the USA does sometimes treat members of its armed forces in an unappreciative and cavalier manner, this film does not really drive this point home in the way that, for example, Saving Private Ryan did. While it is also true that the US government does occasionally cover-up its own illegal activities, or soft-pedal them with propagandistic white lies, these issues are not really the subject of this film. This is made abundantly clear by the oddly out-of-place references to Roswell, New Mexico. The writers either did not want to dignify any perceived political messages by bringing up real-world transgressions and cover-ups - many of which are far more sinister than the secret development of stealth planes. This film is pure entertainment and - at that - a work of art. Treat it as such and you might just have a good time with it.",The Rock
87,vip_ebriega,It's exactly what the title says. THE ROCK rocks!,8,10 November 2007,"My Take: Michael Bay is on the right track in this thrilling, violent and witty non-stop thrill-ride. First we had SPEED, about a mad bomber planting a bomb on a bus, which must speed through heavy traffic and jump gaps or it blows up. Then, it is followed by other action movies including DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE, EXECUTIVE DECISION and BROKEN ARROW. And now, we have THE ROCK, which is the latest of these long line of ""Mad Bomber movies"". I bet you know what ""Mad Bomber movies"" are. Those are the action films which concerns a mad bomber who plans to blow up a bomb until his demands are assured, and the hero/heroes, usually sent by the government, attempt to stop him. THE ROCK is just like that.Here's the setup, this time, our mad bomber is Brig. Gen. Francis Hummel, a well-decorated military officer for the Marines who also happens to be a Medal-of-Honor winner in Vietnam. So why does he want to do away with the country? Well, during the war, his men, who should have received honor, were abandoned without recognition. Now, Hummel demands $100 million to be given to each of the soldiers' families and threatens to launch a rocket containing biochemical weapons, while in the meantime, also holds hostages of tourists in Alcatraz. The government, who wouldn't want to risk too much with his demands, dispatches their own team to infiltrate The Rock, including Biochemicals expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) and a former British spy-turned convict (the only man ever to escape Alcatraz alive) named John Mason (Sean Connery, bringing in a tougher tone from his heroic Bond hero performance).After an escape and car chase scene along San Francisco, which can be summed up as a deluxe version of the chase scene in BULLIT, which is bound to blow up once in a while. After this car chase, upon arriving at The Rock, we are served up with more action and stunt scenes including some wild shoot-outs, a mine car chase (ala INDIANA JONES & THE TEMPLE OF DOOM), near-misses and a climax involving jets and a green flame.THE ROCK is directed by Michael Bay and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and the late Don Simpson, which might suggest where the robust action scenes have come from. Bay, a director who fancies a lot of explosions (including excess), manages to keep every sequence a show-stopper. THE ROCK borrows bits from a lot of favorite action films, and that's why, I think, it's so good.Bay also directed Armageddon which was released then later, which was also an even louder picture than this. Although I did like that picture, I still liked THE ROCK better, since it wasn't only another loud action picture, but also a very good movie. The performances, especially by Connery and bad-guy Harris, are terrific. Cage offers his own charisma as in his other films including CON-AIR (also Bruckheimer/Simpson production). In the case of summer movies (series of films I really love to defend), THE ROCK delivers what it is intended, and a little extras.Rating: **** out of 5.",The Rock

Good cast, story, effect, laughs and so on, but what really struck me here was how great Michael Bay is. This film made me almost cry several (5) times. Bad Boys and Armageddon made me almost cry to, well I even did during Armageddon and that is rare in an action flick. This almost cry thing' is due to Michael Bays directing style of course (colours, slow motion) plus the great sound he uses during the scenes. Almost cry scenes in this film were: the shower  room, Hummel' s speech at the beginning and the green flares. Michael Bay and The Rock ROCK!!!! Michael Bay is going to get gigantic over the years I SWEAR and he will be someone in the lines of Spielberg someday. Why am I so sure, well I downloaded the Pearl Harbor Teaser (due out Memorial Day 2001) and I almost cried, it was great, brilliant.

90,ivo-cobra8,Best performance from Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery ever of their best action film of 1996 hit!,10,17 September 2016,"The Rock (1996) is a classic action film from Michael Bay and one of the best Nicholas Cage films ever! Con Air is his first favorite film of mine The Rock is his second favorite film of mine. I love this film to death and I can watch it over and over again! This is Nicholas Cage's best performance ever, I love his character FBI Special Agent Dr. Stanley Goodspeed who did saved over 1000 human lives in San Francisco while he raced against time to disarm the bombs! Seriously it is one of my favorite action films and Nicolas Cage's favorite film. This film has everything, it has solid cast, entertaining thrill, Die Hard in a prison a lot of action and it is not boring. The practical effects of the film are well done and are realistic, it has a lot of explosions, car chases and so on. There are no CGI in this film, mostly Nicholas Cage is more interesting in here than Sean Connery is.""Welcome to the Rock."" Plot: Nicolas Cage is Stanley Goodspeed, an FBI chemical weapons specialist who is brought into a hostage situation involving a crew of former US Marines, led by a rogue US Marine general (Ed Harris), who have taken over the former prison on Alcatraz Island and are threatening the city of San Francisco with a launch of missiles filled with deadly VX poison gas. Goodspeed finds himself going along on the mission to retake the prison with a squad of US Navy SEALS and John Mason (Sean Connery), a former SAS operative who has been imprisoned illegally for the past two decades, and the only man to have escaped the prison and can use his knowledge infiltrate ""The Rock"".So that is basically the plot of the film. Stanley Goodspeed, an FBI chemical weapons specialist has to take on a group of Former US Marines who took over the prison Alcatraz with 80 tourists who took them as hostages and they are extortion their government for $100 million or they will launch the rockets on San Francisco. Everyone in this film does a great job. Sean Connery former James Bond, Indy's father from Indiana Jones and the last Crusade (1989) is brilliant in his performance as Captain John Patrick Mason, Special Air Service and Ed Harris as Brigadier General Francis X. ""Frank"" Hummel, USMC Force Recon is brilliant and great villain.The script was great and the screen writers did a solid job and Michael Bay beside Bad Boys I and II did a really good solid job ever directing it! Con Air was the action film that really introduced me in to Nicolas Cage films so my beautiful mom bought me on my request Con Air, Face/Off and The Rock (1996) on VHS, which I still have all those films on tapes and I own them on Blu-ray and I still keep the old VHS tapes of those films. I love Con Air and The Rock but I hate Face/off which I think it is one of the worst boring lame action films from John Woo and Nicolas Cage ever! But Con Air and The Rock kicks ass I love these two films I love watching them. It is been 20 years anniversary since The Rock 1996 come out, it is my childhood film and I always cherish my childhood movies to death! Things: I love about this film: Nicolas Cage's character was so caring and awesome, when on the island in prison General Francis X. Hummel's men kill all NAVY Seals team except John Patrick Mason and Stanley Goodspeed, Cage want's to disarme the bombs while Connery want's to get off the island, Cage want's to convince Connery to helps him, which he does on the end. The two fight each other against a team rogue former US Marines to stop them, by killing innocent people. General Francis X. Hummel is not a monster like he was showing in the beginning of the film, he only wanted that government pays the money to the family's for loosing their sons and fathers. I also love the scene in which Sean Connery throws a knife in to one of the marines guarding the rocket, and killing the other marine while firing a machine gun on him awesome! Overall: I love this flick to death I am giving 10 out of 10 for one of my favorite Nicolas Cage action films.The Rock is a 1996 American action thriller film directed by Michael Bay, produced by Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, written by David Weisberg and Douglas S.

91,Angry_Arguer,Lingering,1,21 July 2003,"Like many adolescent males, I hurriedly saw The Rock soon after its release as soon as I could.  Like everyone else, I said it was a great movie, had lots of action, was extremely cool.  Blah blah blah.Then I saw Beverly Hills Cop and Top Gun and realized that Jerry Bruckheimer is the most overrated producer in Hollywood.  It also solidified my point that Michael Bay is both overrated and not talented.  The release of Armageddon and Pearl Harbor cemented that thought so hard in my brain that I will not be seeing another of his movies again.There are ambitious directors like Oliver Stone, Steven Spielberg, and Sam Mendez.  Then there are wannabes like Brian DePalma, Walter Hill, and Michael Bay.  If John Hughes had been able to rebound from his failure Curly Sue with something along the lines of Ferris Bueller or the Breakfast Club, he would be back on my grade-A list.With the Rock we get a by-the-numbers action effort that uses a lot of dialogue to try and get depth out of thin characters.  Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery are fun to watch, but only on surface value.  Both have done better work on better movies.  Ed Harris shows he will never lose his ""tough-guy"" image, even 20 years after The Right Stuff.That brings me to the next victim, Hans Zimmer.  Poor Hans, he is forced into making typical action garbage that proves several things: 1. He is not James Horner 2. He is not John Williams-- Williams' ability to extract emotion from the audience will, probably, never be matched in our lifetime. 3. He is not Jerry Goldsmith-- Jerry has gone through every type of topic known to man and yet he is still the most underappreciated talent in Hollywood. Thankfully, Hans rebounded with Gladiator.  Proving he finally knows how to write music.  As you can guess, he didn't get the Oscar for it.The action in The Rock is all about lingering.  They linger on a crushed corpse, the linger on an impaled corpse, they linger on a ""frustrated"" Ed Harris.  Action is about that, action.  It is about fluidity and motion, not sitting around while something else happens.  If they want to sit around, then that's suspense.Overall, a fair enough action effort that has no surprises or lasting appeal.  John Woo would get it right with Face/Off.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",The Rock
92,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Intense action movie!,8,18 March 2004,"With this movie Michael Bay has proved to us that he can be a good action director. His first project Bad Boys was junk, but it led to the making of this movie and this is one AWESOME MOVIE! Great action scenes include and awesome car chase with a Hummer and Ferrari, explosive shootouts, and a very good musical score. The music really carries this movie and is woven expertly into the on-screen action. That alone is a noteworthy achievement. The performances are also surprisingly good for a movie of this type. Ed Harris gives a very good performance as the rogue marine general and that really puts this movie above the action film crowd. Most films in this genre tend to quickly introduce a bunch of cardboard cut-out characters and then turn to ridiculous action and violence. Action-wise this film is pretty ridiculous (come on, it's a Hollywood movie), but the characters and music and general good production help give it the sense most other films of this type lack. Also Sean Connery never fails to impress with his wit, which almost echoes James Bond. 8/10Rated R: strong violence, and profanity",The Rock

David Weisberg's screenplay (co-written with Douglas Cook and Mark Rosner) rings the changes on an old formula by giving the chief 'villain' an altruistic reason for his behaviour, which renders proceedings all the more compelling when Connery's team (including Michael Biehn, William Forsythe and Danny Nucci) arrives to throw a spanner in the works. Nicolas Cage plays an unlikely biochemist employed by Connery to help defuse the missiles, and whose lack of combat experience leaves him at the mercy of Harris' increasingly volatile subordinates (David Morse, Bokeem Woodbine and a clearly psychotic Tony Todd), though Cage's terrified Everyman character quickly learns how to kick butt with the best of 'em. Slick, sleek, brainless and bold, the movie rarely pauses for breath throughout, and is hugely entertaining from start to finish.

103,timdalton007,"Visually Striking, Intelligently Plotted Action",9,27 July 2018,"The name Michael Bay and the phrase ""great film"" don't often appear together. Bay has proven with films such as Armageddon and the Transformers franchise to be the poster child of the current Hollywood ""wham-bam-thank you ma'am!"" style of filmmaking. That is to say, the kind of filmmaking that emphasizes style over substance. And yet, back in the mid-1990s, Bay got the mix right for one film. That film was The Rock. Part of which is down to the film's cast and, in particular, its trio of lead actors. Sean Connery was having something of a comeback in the 1990s, and the film is a prime example of that. He exudes presence from his first scene nearly a half-hour into the film (despite his top billing) right up to his final shot. Whether he's making quips ala James Bond (perhaps appropriately enough as his character of Mason is a former British agent) or taking on antagonists half his age while being a reluctant father figure to Nicholas Cage's character, Connery is watchable throughout. As are the other two members of the leading trio. The Rock seems to be the film that established Nicholas Cage as a bit of an action star, and it is here that his quirky but reluctant hero persona works best. That might be down to how well the thrown together relationship between his character of FBI chemical weapons specialist Goodspeed and Connery's Mason works. Rounding out the trio is Ed Harris' villain, Marine Corp Brigadier General Frank Hummel, the proverbial ""good soldier"" gone bad. What's fantastic about Harris' performance is that Hummel is in many ways sympathetic, a commanding officer who has seen too many men fight and die for their country without recognition. What he's after isn't some madcap take over the world scheme but a desperate, last-ditch attempt to have his men recognized but going about in a way that can only end tragically. Harris brings all these elements out in his performance, rounding off the lead cast with an underrated villain.The supporting cast is strong as well, often featuring character actors. There's the late John Spencer, on the eve of success in The West Wing (a series created by uncredited Rock scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin), as the FBI director reluctant to bring an imprisoned Mason out into the world again but forced to watch as events unfold. William Forsythe and Michael Biehn both come across well in their roles as the FBI special-agent-in-charge and as the leader of a Navy SEAL team sent in alongside Mason and Goodspeed. The highlights of the supporting cast though lie in the men occupying the former prison alongside Harris' general from David Morse as his second in command Major Baxter as well as Tony Todd and Gregory Sporleder in stand out supporting roles where they offer a considerable amount of menace. They are just a few highlights from a strong cast.Being a Bay film, it's a visually stunning action film. From the stealing of the nerve gas by Hummel's Marines to a destructive car chase across San Francisco, the film's first hour showcases kinetic action sequences alongside its exposition to keeps the viewer's attention glued to the screen. Once the film gets Mason and Goodspeed to Alcatraz in its second half, the film becomes a set of running battles involving the duo against the Marines. And yet, Bay proves he is just as capable of handling somber pieces such as the military funeral that helps form the opening credit sequence or the quieter scenes with Connery. Bay's direction, the cinematography of John Schwartzman, and the editing of Richard Francis-Bruce make The Rock an action spectacle.One with a difference, however. What separates this film from virtually everything Bay has directed to date (and his many imitators) is its script. The Rock is an intelligently plotted thrill ride full of intriguing characters and plot twists from its well-realized lead characters to its conclusion with all the complications that ensue. It also helps that the film is full of witty dialogue from Mason's quips to many of the exchanges between Mason and Goodspeed. In a way, that the script is so good is a surprise given that a team of writers worked on it from the three credited writers (David Weisberg, Douglas S. Cook, and Mark Rosner) to uncredited contributions from Aaron Sorkin in addition to favored Connery script doctors Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement. The result, however, is a better-written action flick than one might expect and the one example I can think of many hands producing a superb script.The Rock then stands as perhaps the single best thing to come out of Bay's directorial career. It was here that he found the right recipe between casting, action, spectacle, humor, and plot. Maybe that's why, more than twenty years later, the film holds up as one of the best action films of the 1990s, as thrilling now as it was then.",The Rock
104,moviesleuth2,Why don't they make movies like this anymore?,10,27 May 2008,"In the past, many summer action movies were geared towards adults (at least in theory) with R-rated violence, and a lot of intelligent plot twists and good characterizations. Some examples were the ""Die Hard"" movies, ""True Lies,"" and ""The Rock."" Sadly, those days are gone, with today's summer action movies being dumbed down and neutered to get every kid from the target audience into the theater (the fact that movies make a ton of money if they are good no matter what the rating still hasn't occurred to the producers).""The Rock"" represents a farewell to this kind of movie. It's very violent, but for the most part not very heavy. The story is compelling, and it has plenty of original ideas and characters that are actually intelligent. The actors do terrific jobs, and the action sequences are tightly done. There are some one-liners to be sure, but not enough to make the movie an action-comedy. It's one of those movies that is the definition of what a summer action movie is supposed to be.The story formula is familiar, but the creators do enough with it that it seems fresh and alive. An angered general takes Alcatraz hostage and aims missiles armed with deadly gas at San Francisco. The US government sends a team of Navy Seals in to take them down. Joining them are a ""chemical weapons specialist"" and the one man who escaped from Alcatraz.With names like Steven Segal and Arnold Schwartzenegger, two of Hollywood's most notoriously wooden actors (Schwartzenegger's ""True Lies"" being an exception), being some of the most famous poster-boys of the summer action movie genre, it would be sensible to guess that like most other action movies, acting is not a plus point. On the contrary, acting one of the reasons why this movie works so well. Every actor is believable in his role. Nicholas Cage, fresh off of his Oscar win for ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" is perfectly understated in the fish-out-of-water role. He's a self-described ""chemical weapons super-freak,"" but he's grounded enough for the audience to sympathize with him. John Mason may be a character that many talented actors could play, but after watching this movie, it's hard to imagine any other actor than Sean Connery playing it this well. I guess it makes sense for the original James Bond to still be doing this halfway into his sixties, but clearly age hasn't taken its toll on Connery at this point because he performs the role with a slick wit and the capability of firing a gun without reading glasses (haha). Probably the most important role here is that of General Hummel (Ed Harris). Though he's a villain, the way Harris portrays the character is key to the movie's success. As villainous as Hummel is for doing what he does, Harris plays Hummel with such passion that the character comes to life and he believes every word that he is saying. This is key because it makes the situation that much more serious, and it sets the tone for the rest of the movie. If you can't believe in what the villain is saying, than who cares? The supporting actors are great as well. John Spencer, William Forsythe, the vastly under-rated Michael Biehn, and a charming performance by Vanessa Marcil (why she doesn't get any big roles is beyond me, cause while not the best actress, she's certainly a lot better than many of the more popular beauties out there).Bruckheimer favorite Michael Bay is returning after directing ""Bad Boys,"" which while not bad, it pales at the likes of ""The Rock"" (then again, not much else can match up to this movie). Armed with a better script and a more compelling story, Bay makes it clear that when it comes to directing action movies, he is a force to be reckoned with. He knows exactly what he's doing. Every action sequence is expertly choreographed, and the pacing is perfect. Though the end has a distinct lack of intelligence that's not present in the rest of the film, I am more than willing to forgive because it's still tremendously exciting anyway. It's hard to imagine a movie that's more exciting or suspenseful than this.As I said before, ""The Rock"" represents the last of its kind: the summer action movie for adults. Though few would disagree that the MPAA is notoriously easy-going when it comes to rating a movie based on violence, even the MPAA knew it couldn't get away with giving this one anything less than an R. There's a lot of violence here, and a lot of it is intense. Some of the scenes are hard to watch. I would definitely recommend at least previewing it first before showing it to anyone under the age of 15. Though this limits the target audience, this is a good decision because in order for suspense and excitement to take place, what happens on screen has to get our attention, and the in-your-face approach that an R rating allows accomplishes this. Additionally, the audience has to buy the premise, preferably within its own context. Sometimes this can be rather disturbing in some sense, but that makes the action believable, which is key for suspense. An action movie like this with a PG-13 rating loses that intimacy, which inevitably reduces the excitement level. This is a shame because some movies with the potential to be really exciting have been ruined by producer neutering (Jerry Bruckheimer has completely ""sold out"" by doing this for EVERY movie that he does now-""Pearl Harbor"" would be a great example of this).Fast-paced, relentless, and terrifically exciting, ""The Rock"" is probably the best farewell to the adult-oriented summer action movie genre that one could hope for.",The Rock

107,Rickting,I'm embarrassed to say I liked something by Michael Bay but...,7,13 January 2014,"I don't like Michael Bay. He's a terrible director, with his sexism, racism, ugly visuals, mechanical storytelling and scripts which could have been written by 5 year olds. So it's embarrassing for me to admit I like this movie, but I do. It's only a 3 star movie (It's very fun but it's not desperately good in many areas) but I was looking for flaws throughout and I couldn't find that many. It's some ludicrous plot about terrorists taking over Alcatraz and planning to use chemical weapons on San Francisco. Nicolas Cage (before he became a joke) and Sean Connery team up and try to stop them. This film knows its purpose: It wants to entertain and do nothing else. With that, it succeeds. Cynical film goers may hate it, but the film is an insane adrenaline rush with some crazy dialogue, huge shootouts, a lot of big explosions and there's even a random car chase thrown in there. It's hard not to feel exhilarated, and Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery have a lot of chemistry.However, as you can expect, Michael Bay's direction is less than stellar, and the film isn't very tense and I consider tension to be the most important part of an action movie. The plot is stupid, and the villain is flat. However, it's an action film so what do you expect? This is a fun, well made although slightly overpraised movie with Michael Bay for once being given a good script to work with and it's the perfect antidote to the Transformers films and Bay's many other cinematic abominations. It's a movie which knows what it wants to be and what it should be, and for action junkies it is pretty much a guaranteed good time. The bottom line: Expect loads of fun.

It seems that now everybody's trying to do a hostage situation in certain movies after the first Die Hard made an impact on audience lives from Cliffhanger (Die Hard on Rocky Mountains), Speed (Die Hard on a bus) and now the 1996 movie ""The Rock"" directed by Michael Bay, who more or less is known for making high octane action movies with a plot for people not to think about. Here Michael makes an attempt to make to mix action, cool characters and an edge-of-your-seat adventure with an all-star cast.The film's premise has General Hummel (Ed Harris) robbing nuclear weapons and using Alcatraz as a base filled with members of a tour where with the weapons he could melt half a city after a big impact and asking the government a heavy ransom before releasing a missile. The F.B.I. brings in chemical specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a neurotic agent who doesn't say bad words and knows everything about every chemical ever made. Goodspeed gets a partner, a convict by the name of John Mason (Sean Connery), an ex-agent for the British Intelligence who doesn't know that his deal of being released is being cut by an old rival of the F.B.I. while serving as the only hope to save the people in the old prison.With this being a Michael Bay movie, expect high action from every direction from a spectacular chase sequence in the San Francisco to the bad guys shooting the good guys with high power machine guns and unexpected surprises with emotion. One of the main reasons the film works besides the action is the relationship between Connery and Cage where despite their character differences in the film, somehow they depend on one another to save each other in certain situations and seeing how there's trust.Overall, a very good action movie.",The Rock
109,thekingsdom,Good Cheesy Fun,7,17 February 2020,"Just watched this for the first time in years. I like the way the film just gets straight into the story and straight into the action from minute one. There's definitely some moments of cheese but it's a fun watch. Man, I'm getting old. I can't believe I first watched this on VHS tape lol! Soon I'll be as old as Sean Connery's character! Anyway, thumbs up from me and overall this film has aged very well. 7/10",The Rock
110,SKG-2,"Good work by leads can't save this ""crock""",5,14 September 1999,"The late critic Jay Scott, from The Globe and Mail, once wondered whether directors Adrian Lyne and Ridley Scott were in fact the same person, given their too-similar-for-comfort styles.  I'd like to pose a similar scenario; that producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Joel Silver are in fact, one and the same person; they both wear beards, and with a few exceptions(ENEMY OF THE STATE and THE REF for the former, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY and THE MATRIX for the latter), they both make obnoxiously loud and dumb action movies.  What's worse, they get some talented people to work for them, and then crush them under the weight.  Sometimes, the actors are able to make it work(Eddie Murphy in BEVERLY HILLS COP for the former, Bruce Willis, Bonnie Bedelia, and Alan Rickman in DIE HARD for the latter), but mostly not.THE ROCK is the latest example from Silver...excuse me, Bruckheimer.  It's about average.  Again, the only distinction is good work by the three leads. Connery probably deserves the most praise, because he's saddled with lines like the ""prom queen"" one, and still comes off looking good.  But for crying out loud, he co-produced this crap!  Cage claims to have taken this so his career wouldn't take a nose dive after LEAVING LAS VEGAS, and he does a good job in the role, but I'm tired of all the excuses actors use to appear in these monstrosities.  Here's a new one; WHY DON'T YOU READ THE F***ING SCRIPT!!!  Yes, what can be good in the script stage can still be screwed up, but if you're not obligated(by your contract or a friend), and you don't need the money, YOU SHOULDN'T DO THIS CRAP!!!  Sorry.  Anyway, Harris, to be fair, has a more dimensional role than normal for these movies, and he does it well.  His scene with Michael Biehn(also good) is one of the film's high points.  Also, there's an admittedly tense scene on the ""rock.""  But mostly, this follows the MO of Bruckheimer/Silver; Thou shalt bludgeon thy audience rather than entertain them.",The Rock
111,Al_The_Strange,"""You're stuck between a rock, and a hard case.""",9,21 July 2013,"The Rock opens with a military funeral, intercut with explosions, and with Hans Zimmer's dramatic score in the background. Yep, it's pure Michael Bay: just about all of the man's films feature huge, overblown action scenes, big fiery explosions, energetic car chases, silly humor, and a hyperactive style. It's made for a rather shallow experience for some of his films, but in his second full-length feature film, all the excesses align perfectly, crafting one of the purest and most thrilling action movies of all time. You can certainly expect lots of action: the shootouts are loud and intense, there is one awesome car chase, and there are quite a few major explosions. Characters often exchange witty lines throughout. And when the bullets aren't flying, the film still maintains furious momentum with its suspense and political intrigue. It's a perfectly loud and explosive picture, but without being too overblown (especially not as much as Bay's Transformers trilogy).Thankfully, The Rock is not all about endless gunfire and pyrotechnics. The film utilizes pretty common elements of action movies: terrorists take some hostages, good guys have to rescue them and stop the chemical missiles from causing widespread death. The Rock offers some clever variations though, especially by having the terrorists take over Alcatraz, turning the titular prison (and in some parts, San Francisco) into a massive action setpiece. Above all, the characters propel the film into above-average fare: the protagonists are an unlikely pair, sharing entertaining chemistry, and each one has likable traits and personal stakes attached to them. The villains are especially noteworthy, because they're not just mindless nameless bad guys: they have a patriotic motivation, and they show surprising humanity at times. The plot overall is pretty well-built and evenly-paced.This film has solid photography, which includes a lot of cool-looking camera angles and movements. It gets really shaky during the big car chase, but it's far from unbearable. Editing can be fast at times, but once again, it's not too unbearable. Acting is solid: Nicholas Cage dishes out a lot of humor, but he's appropriately serious when he needs to be; Sean Connery is at his most badass here, and Ed Harris really nails his role. Writing is pretty good. This production uses some very cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Hans Zimmer's music score is the essence of action-movie music.In fact, the movie overall embodies the essence of an action movie. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)",The Rock
112,markovd111,A very enjoyable and fun movie!,8,7 January 2021,"Honestly, I have no big complaints. It's a fun action movie. Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage make a fantastic duo and there is good humor sprinkled throughout the movie. Only thing keeping the movie from perfection are some plot holes and over the top feel of the whole thing (which isn't weird, when we consider who directed the movie). Even so, ""The Rock"" is a great 90- action movie and a nice blast from the past you will most assuredly enjoy watching if you like Connery and Cage. Another thing worth mentioning is Hans Zimmer's musical score, which is in moments very similar to his later work on ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series. All in all, movie get's my recommendation to anyone looking for a good afternoon fun. 8/10!",The Rock
113,MovieCriticOnline,Absolutely ridiculous,2,16 July 2019,"When I originally saw it years ago, I was fairly entertained and my memory had somewhat fond impressions. I guess becoming more sophisticated this is no longer the case.Besides the totally over the top characters and dialogue, there are just so many plot holes. Tell me again why Sean Connery was needed. You mean the Government didn't have a blue print of Alcatraz? They needed someone who had been in solitary confinement for decades to come with them?Then Ed Harris kept threatening the Gov with detonating the bombs if they didn't comply and as soon as he saw them not complying he didn't even follow up on his threats, instead, there was a senseless shootout.The acting was so atrocious, but what do you expect from Michael Bay. The writing was ridiculous, 40% of it was just unnecessary exposition. If you make an action film, you don't need all the superfluous side stories of the daughter, the pregnant wife etc. They added nothing.Michael Bay is good at action and camera work, however, he is horrible with characters, stories, acting.",The Rock
114,SkullScreamerReturns,Rock solid action thriller,8,23 September 2021,"I saw this movie around 20 years ago and liked it a lot. Now watching again...I was surprised it was actually that good! Probably one of the best action thrillers of the 90s.From start to finish the movie just feels powerful. As Hans Zimmer's epic music sets the tone, it never lets go. Sean Connery, even though getting a bit old at this point, becomes a full action hero (also paying a little tribute to his past in James Bond and Indiana Jones movies). Nicholas Cage is also good as a more nervous guy who must be brave so that together they could save the day. Ed Harris is a commanding villain, and in a smaller role we see a familiar face, that-Kyle-Reese-guy-what's-his-name-again...Michael Biehn.The movie is full of action and thrill but it doesn't become monotonous at any point. That's an achievement I don't see happening often. And it's directed by Michael Bay? Wow. He should have stayed with this kind of movies instead of those cgi robots he is more known for.If you want a movie that puts you full of adrenaline and epicness you must see The Rock.Ps. It would have been funny if the actor The Rock was in a movie called The Rock but unfortunately that didn't happen.",The Rock
115,Cinemaniac1984,This explosive action movie rocks,9,6 February 2015,"The Rock is one of the few action movies with a plot that is excellent from start to finish. Definitely one of many excellent action movies from the 1990's and deservedly one of the top movies for 1996. Michael Bay has never been better and this movie was also notable that this was the last movie that producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer worked on together before Don Simpson's untimely death. Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage made a great, if unlikely, on screen partnership and Ed Harris was top notch as the lead villain. The Rock also started a new era for Academy Award Winner Nicolas Cage as an action hero who would go on to appear in such hits as Con Air (1997), Face/Off (1997) and Gone in 60 Seconds (2000).The Rock begins with United States Marine General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) who orchestrates the theft of several deadly VX rockets from a military base. The following day General Hummel along with several renegade US Marines including his second in command Major Tom Baxter (David Morse) plus Captain Hendrix (John C. McGinley) Captain Frye (Gregory Sporleder), Captain Darrow (Tony Todd), and Gunnery Sergeant Crisp (Bokeem Woodbine) take over Alcatraz prison and take 81 hostages. Their intention: to launch the rockets with VX gas onto San Francisco and kill the hostages unless the US government pays $100 million from a military slush fund, from which General Hummel will distribute to his men and the families of Recon Marines who were killed in action on clandestine missions under his command and whose deaths were not compensated by the US Government.The FBI call upon chemical weapons specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage who has never been better) who is brilliantly intelligent yet is barely experienced in the field and counter terrorism operations. His fiancée Carla (Vanessa Marcil) is also pregnant. FBI Director James Womack (John Spencer) and Special Agent in Charge Ernest Paxton (William Forsythe in a rare role as the good guy) spearhead the operation to take down General Hummel and the renegade marines along with ensuring the survival of the hostages. Director Womack is forced to release a federal prisoner who has been imprisoned for three decades. Former British Intelligence agent John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) who once successfully broke out of Alcatraz prison is called upon to assist the FBI with his inside knowledge of Alcatraz prison in exchange for a pardon. As part of the covert operation, a team of Navy SEALS led by Commander Anderson (Michael Biehn) as well as Stanley Goodspeed's knowledge of chemical warfare and John Mason's knowledge of Alcatraz prison, the team successfully gain access inside Alcatraz prison but its not before long the operation goes horribly wrong and its up to the unlikely heroes Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason to prevent the launch of the rockets on San Francisco as well as take down the renegade marines and save the 81 hostages.In a stroke of brilliant casting, Nicolas Cage as the nerdy lab rat Stanley Goodspeed is excellent. Here Stanley Goodspeed is thrust into the middle of the action and is relied upon to save the lives of the hostages and many innocent civilians in San Francisco, as well as disarm the VX rockets. Sean Connery might be into his 60's, but he definitely still cuts it as an action hero. The former James Bond plays John Mason, an honourable man who has been wrongly imprisoned but must work and use his inside knowledge of Alcatraz to help Stanley Goodspeed take down the renegade marines and save the hostages. Ed Harris as the lead villain General Francis X Hummel starts off with good intentions for his former soldiers who were killed in action, however he goes about it the wrong way by stealing the VX rockets in order to use against San Francisco as well as taking hostages in Alcatraz in order for a $100 million ransom to be paid to be distributed to the families of his marines killed in action as well as himself and his fellow renegade marines. Although General Hummel is not seen as a cruel person unlike his fellow renegade marines, his intentions are still seen as ruthless and immoral.This was Michael Bay's second movie after Bad Boys (1995) and he later has a mixed career with Armageddon (1998), Pearl Harbor (2001), and the Transformers franchise (2007, 2009, 2011 and 2014). The Rock is definitely one of Michael Bay's best movies to date. Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer who were responsible for blockbuster movies such as Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Top Gun (1986), and Bad Boys (1995) have struck gold here with this explosive hit.The Rock is definitely a brutally violent movie that has encountered many censorship issues particularly in the UK and Australia.The Rock is definitely one of the few action movies with a great plot, great action, as well as well rounded characters, compared to the various action movies that ignore the plot in favour of one dimensional characters and large action sequences. The Rock was definitely one of the surprise packages of 1996 and years later, is still a popular action movie that has aged very well. If you love action movies and if you haven't seen The Rock, you are missing out on an excellent action movie.9/10.",The Rock
116,emperor_bender,"""Womack!!""",9,5 December 2008,"Personally I think Michael Bay can't direct his way out of a paper bag. But to be honest, I do enjoy most of his movies. This one is probably my favorite Bay film.Now, I know this movie is on the borderline of ridiculous, but that's why I like it. I've accepted that. Its funny, smart, and action packed.On the ""good guys"" side: Sean Connery gave an excellent performance as John Mason, the aged former inmate of Alcatraz. Nicholas Cage gave a comical performance as Dr. Goodspeed, the wimpy, cocky chemical expert. John Spencer was annoying as FBI Director James Womack but I think he was supposed to be. William Forsythe was good as the tough FBI Agent Paxton. Michael Biehn was convincing as Anderson, the commander of the Navy SEALS team. And Danny Nucci was annoying as Lt. Shephard, oh well I won't cry about it.On the ""bad guys"" side: Ed Harris gave the best performance as Brigadier General Frank Hummel, leader of the Marine team who takes over Alcatraz. David Morse was really good as Major Tom Baxter, the second in command. John C. McGinley was really good as the obedient Captain Hendrix, who endlessly searches the tunnels for the SEALS. Tony Todd was really good as Captain Darrow, the mercenary team member who wants to be paid. Gregory Sporleder was really annoying as Captain Frye, the annoying mercenary who just gets in the way and is really annoying. And Bokeem Woodbine is OK as Sgt. Crisp.Over all, a cocky movie but thats what makes it great.9/10.",The Rock
117,diac228,"With enough energy to generate an entire city, The Rock will absolutely blow you back into the 90s.",9,11 July 2008,"The 90s was home to a slew of great raw, uncut, action flicks that shot straight for the rated ""R,"" despite the guarantee that it would make less money than the money-friendly PG-13 rating. While Die Hard and Lethal Weapon may have jump-started this craze, the peak of this was during the next decade, when we saw the likes of Terminator 2, Speed, Face-Off, Con Air, Die Hard: With a Vengeance, The Matrix, Bad Boys, Point Break, Under Siege, True Lies, Desperado, among others (Quite a list I accumulated, eh?). The 90s was certainly a good decade for action fans, but few movies of this genre can quite top the powerful, gripping, and edge-of-your seat action blockbuster The Rock. The name alone sounds powerful, and behind it is two hours of incredible special effects, superb acting, great action set pieces, and good dosage of writing, and Michael Bay on top of his game.Few action movies carries as much morality and questionable circumstances as this one. In The Rock we follow a furious general (Ed Harris) leading a group of Marines to take control of Alcatraz Island (along with tourist hostages), a location that used to house criminals. Accompanying them are over a dozen missiles that can spell tens of thousands of innocent lives with every blast. However, he isn't just a trigger-happy man gone crazy, he is a man seeking justice for the dozens of lives he saw taken from warfare without compensation. A villain with a ""moral"" agenda, yikes. The only hope for the United States is the only man that has ever broken out of that prison (Sean Connery) and a chemical ""superfreak"" (Nicholas Cage). With the odds obviously against them, the Pentagon is one order away from destroying the entire location regardless of the innocent lives located in the island. Mindless this movie is not, as the stakes are high, there is always a risk of an innocent life going under, and our heroes rarely ever have the scenario under control. It's just enough to make you squeal in frustration.With the tension remaining edgy and the solution never being oh-so-close, we can thank the writers for delivering a slam-bang storyline full of great one-liners, likable characters, and a villain that isn't as simple to figure out as the average evildoer. The writing staff ranges from the writer of the third Die Hard to even Tarantino. A major reason for the film's quality is the casting. Sean Connery and Ed Harris are excellent in their roles and Nicholas Cage albeit a few lines does a good job. The supporting staff helps as well, as we see the likes of David Morse, John Spencer, and Cage's love interest Vanessa Marcil.Unlike Michael Bay's latest films, which run from mediocre to just plain bad, he blends plenty of drama and suspense along with action here. As a matter of fact, the first half of the movie is all suspense, as the situation is developed, and the risks are presented. Disregarding a superb car chase, there isn't much exploding in the first 80 minutes. However, once the protagonists enter the Rock, it all goes on the uphill action swing. We get brutal fights, brutal shootouts, near-misses, double-crosses, triple-crosses, chases, and enough explosions for action fans to sink their teeth into. The funny thing, the two main actors at the time weren't expected to be in such action. Connery was aging, and Nicholas Cage just didn't have the look or the attitude for it. Fortunately for us, they proved us dead wrong.Bottom Line: If you want to see a true action classic, The Rock is a great example. Rising above the average action movie and above the decent ones as well, this is by far Michael Bay's best work and one of the signature flicks of the 90s. Combining tension you can cut with a steak knife with thrills, chills, and plenty of carnage, The Rock has aged well and continues to influence the work of modern action movies and the work of Michael Bay as well. Grab some popcorn and enjoy this ruthlessly clever movie. Recommend to the max, as long as you don't mind a bit of blood spewing onto the screen. They just don't make em' like they used to.",The Rock
118,p-jonsson,Great action/thriller movie,9,6 May 2013,"As far as I am concerned this is a great action/thriller movie. The fact that one of my all-time favorite actors, Sean Connery, plays in it is of course a good start. Despite Nicholas Cage having done quite a few crappy movies I still like him as well. At least when he plays in decent movies.I first watched this movie sometime around when it came out. I did not watch it in a theater though so it must have been on VHS or TV. I thought it was a great movie already then. When I re-watched it yesterday onW9 HD I did not find any reason to change my opinion. I was surprised at how much action, especially the blowing-up-cars kind of action, there are in this movie though. I did not remember those parts but more of the stealth and breaking into Alcatraz parts. But then, considering that it had Michael Bay as director I guess this one have to be considered quite moderate in the blowing-things-up department after all.The story is actually not too unbelievable and the bad guys are not so ridiculously freaked out as they are in many movies of this type. Sean Connery is great as always but the acting in general is of high standard throughout the movie. The dialogue between him and Nicholas Cage as well as other people in the movie is definitely entertaining. The action, as I have already partly mentioned, is great and not too overdone either.It is an action/thriller movie though (maybe with some more emphasis on action than thriller) so do not expect to be intellectually stimulated. The movie is meant to entertain and that it does with flying colors. Despite it being 136 minutes long it certainly did not feel too long. Actually I do not know why this movie is not in my DVD/BD collection. I think I will get it even though I have just seen it on TV.",The Rock
119,EthanBJones_03,Welcome to Bay's last great movie,9,25 June 2017,"'THE ROCK' was directed by Michael Bay, and stars Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery and Ed Harris. ​When ex US General Frank Hammel(Ed Harris) threatens to launch chemical weapons against San Fransisco from Alcatraz, the US government send in Stanley Goodspead(Nicholas Cage), a biochemist, and John Mason(Sean Connery), the only man to ever escape Alcatraz alive, to combat the general and save the city from annihilation.This is the best action movie with mediocre action. It's endlessly quotable(I found that out the hard way) and succeeds purely because of its talented cast of actors and Bay's solid direction(blasphemy, I know). Mason and Goodspeed are the driving force of this movie and elevate it from average at best, to freaking awesome. The action is passable and will please the majority of audiences but that isn't the reason to see the movie.A sentence I never figured I'd have to say when referring a Michael Bay movie is 'The story for this film is well written, concise and provides clear motivations for all its characters'. The premise of setting a movie like this on Alcatraz is genius and Bay builds a genuinely good story around that. There is a first time for everything, and this was apparently also his last.Nicholas Cage is both the best and worst actor in existence simultaneously. He's mental but mental in a way were he's not annoying like Travolta and not intentionally funny like Carrey. He's Nicholas Cage and no one can take that away from him, and that is the reason he was great in this movie as a man pushed to the brink of his sanity. Sean Connery(you just read that in his voice) clearly uses his period as Bond to sell the character of John Mason and anyone that says Mason is anything less than a freaking bad ass is kidding themselves. Ed Harris was brilliant as General Hummel and provided a layered, interesting performance. Hummel was smart, interesting and intimidating, and made a great adversary for the two leads. My main issue with the movie is an aspect of the villain. I won't spoil as to what but I figured it best to mention it, even if you don't know specifically why.The effects in this movie are atrocious but I cannot blame them for that and don't hold it against them. John Schwartzmen shoots the movie very well and the movie was also very well lit. I have issues with some of the editing but not to the point were it actively annoyed me throughout the run time. Both the set design and the costume design were pretty bland. Setting the movie on Alcatraz was genius but I feel they could have done more with the sets.The action is this movie is fine. The comedy is fine. The dialogue is good. The characters are fantastic and amazing and incredible and are the main reason I recommend you see this movie. They are all so likable and elevate the movie from good to great and for that I congratulate them. I highly recommend this movie, and I'll rate it 9 Concerned Hairdressers out of 10.",The Rock
120,HelenMary,James Bond - The Sequel,8,9 November 2014,"The Rock is arguably one of Nicholas Cage's best films and Sean Connery at his absolute best, almost reprising his Bond role. This film is a good action packed watch. Typical of Director Michael Bay, and you can see elements of many of his other films in the camera action ie Bad Boys. The music is typical of Hans/Zimmer (see Speed and Pirates of the Caribbean for similar themes) and packs an exciting punch.The pace of the film is fast, not mentally taxing but it has stood the test of time and stands up to repeat viewings. For a film that is almost twenty years old (and I've seen it countless times) it just doesn't age and is still completely relevant. The premise is believable and superiorly acted by Ed Harris as General Hummel protesting the deniability of black ops military by the US government when they are killed in action... An issue that could quite possibly come true. It's a protest that the viewer understands and can see that the General is a good man, wanting to do a desperate thing for a sympathetic cause. You immediately take to the General, but see that his self imposed mission is more than what it appears to be, and his men - some of them - are barking mad. The FBI calls on their chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) who's a field rookie to go up against some of the best military men in the US. Michael Biehn convincingly plays Commander Anderson - leader of the Seal team on the ""good"" side but you can see his empathy with the General and his respect of him. Lots of military pomp and hierarchy - a great film for military action fans - and the entire story and execution of it is almost faultless. Acting was believable for the most part - many superb performances - with a few ""comic relief"" moments. The action is a little OTT sometimes and a car-chase that is pure Hollywood (complete with lorry carrying water bottles) but a joy to watch. Cage brings some of the one liners and comedy with his over-acting funnies, which lightens the mood sometimes when it would otherwise be quite a dark film.An entirely enjoyable watch, realistically rated 15. Some bad language but it's not unreasonable, and plenty of back-story/human interest surrounding the action and gung-ho machismo. John C McGinley, John Spencer and Vanessa Marcil as good other characters in the story, with a brief appearance from Claire Forlani. Lots of familiar faces, lots of strong characters even in smaller roles and totally engrossing cinema. Excellent action film well worth the watch. Not disappointing at all.",The Rock
121,mOVIemAN56,I Liked It,8,8 April 2005,"Alright, I'm a fan of action film and this started it. The Rock (Referring to Alcatraz) is under new management by the famous, Vietnam Vet General Frank Hummel (Ed Harris). His cause is to avenge the men he lost in Vietnam while the government stood by and watched. With him are three or four squads of Navy SEALS, 81 hostages, and extremely dangerous poison gas missiles aimed at San Fransico. A squad is assembled but a guide is needed and a scientist to diffuse the missiles. John Mason (Sean Connery), the only unknown escapee of the infamous prison is to lead nineteen Navy SEALS into the prison to stop the madness. Along with them Dr. Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) is called in to assist. Soon the SEALS are gone, having been slaughtered, and Mason and Goodspeed are left to deal with the situation. The story for an action film is pretty good and the acting is solid. Connery, Harris, Cage, and Morse make up an excellent cast. The film is more focused on the characters then most action flicks and the outline of the actual prison for the location was pretty fun to watch. The film is loaded with violence and language but is needed at most parts to keep the flow even though mothers won't approve. The Rock.

But this is truly inspired nonsense. A script which 3 different writers have worked on to cram in as many one-liners and explosive situations, an epilepsy-inducing shooting and editing style (circular travelings, sunsets and filters abound)... these are not promising ingredients, especially in retrospect. And yet, a smart dosage of the above and solid commitment from everyone involved make ""The Rock"" far better than it had any right to be.If you can get past the silliness of the premise, not only is this an endlessly fun film to watch, it also has many very noteworthy components: Hans Zimmer's score is often rightfully celebrated as one of the most inspiring and bombastic of any action film, the San Fransisco car chase is among the most energetic of all time... Less commonly for a Bruckheimer/Bay production, the actors also pull their weight successfully: Nic Cage cements his action man potential, Sean Connery displays more fierceness and charisma than any star half his age, and best of all - undaunted by clunky lines - is Ed Harris as a surprisingly likable antagonist.This is the jewel of the Burckheimer/Bay crown. the pinnacle of silly explosive cinema - with a twist - done expertly right.

123,Med-Jasta,One of the best action movies,10,13 October 2020,"I absolutely love this movie. It still has the ability to pump me up like it did when I was a kid. I will a little afraid to revisit this since Con Air, Face/Off and so many other beloved movies of my youth didn't translate to adulthood. But The Rock was actually better.The story is a great idea. And the motivations behind the characters are different than what we're used to. Hummel doesn't want money or revenge, he wants to correct an injustice he's seen. Mason didn't assassinate someone big or something like that, he stole a microfilm with America's worst secrets and wouldn't give it up.Hummel isn't a monster either. But he dances the line and inspires monsters. When his own men turn against him you don't see that coming. It was a great way to resolve his story. He doesn't duke it out with our hero he gets taken out by his own men. He's the reason he gets killed because he started all of this when he never should have.When the SEALs get killed right when they get there you have no idea what's going to happen next and didn't see that coming.The action is so good and pretty non stop. They are brutal and inventive. The muzzle flashes are big and the fireballs of explosions are huge.The music is great. Not only does it bring out the action but also underscores the emotional elements as well. It's really creative with a real blending of sounds. There's the orchestra, electric guitar, synth, unusual percussive things. It's very cool.Almost every shot in the movie will knock your socks off. The extra mile Michael Bay goes to compose these shots is something missing from today's movies. The framing and the angles really go above and beyond to elevate the quality of this movie.The cast is amazing. All the little parts are well cast. Even Xander Berkley is in this and he's one of my favorites. Of course the leads are great, they're some of the best in the business.But Nicholas Cage does an amazing job. These days it's easy to forget how good he really is. Goodspeed could have easily been played really wussy and then action man at the end. But he's played more inexperienced than anything else. He's not a field guy. But he wants to do the right thing so he'll give it his best. And when he does get into a fist fight he's not very good and he loses.The humor is great with only a couple dumb action movie one liners. Goodspeed first talking to Mason is especially good. Buy my favorite laugh is when the trolley gets hit and the conductor says, ""Holy s***t!"" Something about his delivery has never left my mind and keeps me laughing well beyond the intended response.This is Michael Bay at his best. I really wish he stayed more like this. Once he started channeling his inner immature teenage boy things started to come unhinged. In so many of his movies since that I've enjoyed I still have to tolerate a lot.

Nicolas Cage, who has excelled across multiple genres, begins here his ""Action Hero Trilogy"": ""The Rock"" (1996), ""Con Air"" (1997) and ""Face/Off"" (1997). Ed Harris is equally excellent and we are happy to see Michael Biehn briefly again, ten years after ""Aliens"" (1986) and twelve years after ""The Terminator"" (1984).8.6/10",The Rock

The movie would be better off cutting some scenes off... and maybe a little more weighted out... elite commando can't win over the terrorists but than a chemical expert with 3 weeks-long drill and a pensioner who spent last 30 years in prison gets it all done... I wonder if I would be able to jump into a car and drove better than any police if I spent 30 years in prison (an example of a scene, that could have been left out...)...

127,patches89,THE ROCK HAS BECOME A TOURIST ATTRACTION!!,8,7 February 2021,"Im one for cheesey 80s action with great lines and over the top action and even though this was made in 1996 it was a blast from start to finish. Some marines have gone rogue and stole some biological weapons and threaten to unleash it on the city of San Francisco unless their demands are met. Stanley Goodspeed (Nic Cage), John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery) and a team of Navy Seals infiltrate Alcatraz Island to recover the weopons and bring the terrorists to justice. Cage and Connery were a dream, the bounced off each other brilliantly. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack was great and enhanced every scene and this was around the time Michael Bay cared for his work the most. As much as I loved it, there were crater sized holes in the film but you dont worry too much about that when you enjoy the piece in front of you",The Rock
128,ExpendableMan,Like a heavy metal album made into a movie,8,21 August 2006,"Just before the credits roll at the finale, a brief line of text appears on screen dedicating The Rock to Don Simpson, the Producer who died before it was released. Now while he was alive, Simpson was the walking definition of all the stereotypes of Hollywood excess. He hoovered up cocaine by the bucketload, gave jobs to actresses in exchange for 'favours' and had an ego so bloated he cast himself in a role in Days Of Thunder despite having no previous acting experience, so The Rock couldn't be more of a fitting tribute. It is a loud, brash and incredibly fast paced film where everything is done to excess. The action is spectacular, the explosions enormous and the bad guys keep on finding new and more inventive ways to die, all to a pounding military soundtrack.The story is a spin on the old Die Hard formula with Nicholas Cage starring as a mild mannered FBI Chemical weapons specialist who finds himself running around on Alcatraz with John Mason (Sean Connery) the only man to ever escape the prison and facing off against a squad of disillusioned US Marines who are holding San Francisco to ransom with some deadly bio-weapons. And from this we are treated to all manner of chaos, especially as Mason isn't exactly a willing volunteer...Needless to say, the level of violence goes through the roof. It may take a while for things to really start moving but once Mason makes his initial escape attempt to visit his teenage daughter in a truly jaw-dropping car chase, the pulse speeds onwards without stopping faster than you can say ""Hey, we haven't seen anyone go flying through a window in a little while."" And when our heroes and their doomed Navy SEAL escorts finally make it to Alcatraz a whole string of inventive set-pieces await.What makes it work though is that underneath all the violence and macho posturing, the film has a very sly sense of humour as is readily apparent in the numerous daft lines (the brief nod to Roswell in particular is especially good) and the overwhelming bravado. After all, most people would be traumatised if they were nearly crushed in a stolen Ferrari by an exploding tram car, not Nicholas Cage. He just gets up, brushes himself off and tells a bemused onlooker ""It's not mine,"" before punching him in the face and stealing his bike. Not to mention the fact that Cage and Connery make a great double act. Cage has long been adept at playing the bemused everyman thrust into a situation beyond his comprehension but it is Connery who shines. Those who remember him best as the suave, tuxedo clad James Bond may be surprised at the grizzled beast he plays here, as John Mason is an aggressive, foul-mouthed and really, REALLY angry man as ruthless as he is charismatic and capable of quoting Oscar Wilde while being beaten around the head without making it seem contrived.In short then a typical end to Don Simpson's reign as the king of excessive Californian mayhem. With the likes of Top Gun and Beverley Hills Cop to his name, the Producer bows out with a film that not only matches the adrenaline thrill of those classic eighties releases, but also manages to be even louder than they were. Add on a conflicted villain played by Ed Harris who is taking things way too seriously and you have yourselves a highly watchable film with 'guilty pleasure' written all over it.",The Rock

The plot was okay, but it was just the typical action movie plot and it didn't have anything to differentiate from other action movies. Certain aspects of the plot didn't feel believable and there were a few dull moments, mostly during the first half of the movie. The action scenes were decent and thrilling, and I thought the acting was good.

Ed Harris plays the bad guy and he was cool as him and I enjoyed him very much.  The action in this was too cool and some stuff got me queezy but most was just awesome.  The coolest part ,no doubt, was the guy sent off by a rocket. That was really cool.  All sorts of other parts were cool too.  The directing was great.  Everything was great.Overall I love this movie and I found no flaws in this and I recommend this to anyone who likes action.  Rating 10 out of 10.",The Rock
133,basrutten,"Decent, but nothing special",6,18 February 2004,"Since ""The Rock"" is a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, you pretty much know what to expect: lots of action, explosions, chases, one-liners, cheesy dialog, sentimental rubbish, and plot holes. The question is: do the good things (the action and the one-liners) outweigh the bad. In some movies like ""Crimson Tide"" they certainly do. In others, like ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"", they clearly don't. I'd say ""The Rock"" falls somewhere in the middle. It does some things right, some things wrong, and ends up being watchable, although not really special.First, the good things. The acting is generally above par, even though Nicolas Cage isn't very convincing. Ed Harris and Sean Connery makes up for that though. Secondly, the plot is fairly believable (for a mindless action movie that is) and even though there is again a lot of scientific nonsense, the movie doesn't cross the line into ridiculousness too much. One of the really nice touches is that the ""bad guy"" (Harris) is actually a fairly decent guy instead of the usual crazed maniac. The problem was that I cared more for the bad guy than for Cage's dull character or Sean Connery on autopilot. The one-liners could have used some serious work too. Oh well, at least the action is generally quite good. 
""The Rock"" really screws up when it tries to add some depth, though. This movie would have worked as a mindless action movie, but instead (probably to please a larger audience) all kinds of romantic/family sub plots had to be added. These plots are all quite unbelievable and boring as hell. Also, the movie gets way too sentimental at times, for example in the totally unnecessary and very unbelievable scene in which an entire SWAT team gets slaughtered by the bad guys. If all the sentimental sub plots would have been dropped and the movie would have been shortened by thirty minutes, it would have been great. As it is now, it's a mildly entertaining movie with some good action and a couple of nice touches, but also with way too much sentimental scenes that don't go anywhere. ** out of **** stars",The Rock
134,TheHande,Welcome to the Rock...,8,5 December 2005,"The Rock is a movie where old meets new.It combines two great actors of our time, Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage. Connery was already cool as Bond, but now that he's old and angry he's even cooler. Nicholas Cage is one of those actors that you instantly feel sorry for when something bad happens to their character. I don't know why, maybe it's that face of his.Plot-wise the Rock has a nice twist near the end and over-all it is very rough but not too icky. One problem that this movie definitely has is the fact that some action-scenes were filmed a little ""conservatively"", such as Connery's car-chase and the part where Cage gets chased by the marines. You never get a clear idea where either of these scenes are going because they're made up of such tight close-ups and often the camera is pointing in the direction of where they're coming from rather than where they're going.Also I question the use of the soundtrack near the beginning when the marines steal the missiles as it sounded a tad too patriotic (since these are technically the bad-guys).Even with these little flaws the movie is exciting, funny and quite impressive all-around.",The Rock
135,gabriel_sanchez,Action Comedy,7,6 March 2019,"First things first, this is not a thriller flick. Although there are some thrilling moments here and there, most of the movie is a mix of generic action, punch-lines and comedy. Characters tend to spit out some cliché phrases for comedic relief.Connery and Harris steals the show. They are great. Cage is great too, but he's mostly the Cage we know.Overall, OK movie to watch, but no great action masterpiece as it tries to be. It's more of an adult action comedy flick than a thriller. Kinda like an adventure with Brendan Fraser.",The Rock
136,jackgdemoss,Michael Bay has controlled the space to the point that his old films look cliche,6,12 January 2020,"My movie bucket list gift continues to expose my intrinsic negative bias towards old movies! It is clear to me that The Rock was wildly entertaining upon its release. Audiences must have been captivated by its shot changes every 1-4 seconds, its magnificent vehicle explosions, and its big name actors. But viewing it in today's light exposes it as such a meme. Perhaps it is the fault of Nic Cage, because everything he has touched has been memeifyed. Perhaps it is the fault of Michael Bay, for being so revolutionary in the space that enough copy cats emerged to make your original product look cliche. Whatever it is, watching The Rock in 2020 is like watching the most basic action/adventure imaginable, with the exception of the magnificent shower scene.",The Rock

138,Ziya90,A remarkable action film on an epic scale,10,26 June 2013,"The Rock is one of those ""today they don't make movies like this anymore"" movies. A gem from 90's mainstream cinema. The Rock is also Michael Bay's best film by far to date, in my opinion. Bad Boys was a solid action film. Armageddon was almost a disaster for me except for the emotion and a few scenes, despite the cast was strong and the visual effects were jaw dropping I enjoyed Pearl Harbor, but in comparison with ""Tora Tora Tora"", it was mediocre. It was grand on a massive scale, but humdrum in most parts. Bad Boys 2 was better than the first as an action flick, but it wasn't great or remarkable though. As for The Island, it was Michael Bay's the second best for me. It was solid, good story, good action, no Michael Bay extravaganza etc. As for Transformers movies, other than the first installment which was pretty fine and again solid entertainment and breathtaking special effects, the sequels were overblown, uneven, big, noisy, overdone and so on! However, The Rock is a great, stylish, classy and subtle action film. It is almost an epic who can give you goosebumps. Also the movie has an amazing soundtrack. The action is spectacular here. The direction is subtle and stylish. It has an original, very gripping story and the best Alcatraz film ever to date (better than the classic ""Escape from Alcatraz"") Sean Connery is great as always, but also Nicolas Cage does an amazing job here. In those years, Nicolas Cage wasn't an action star, as I remember, his first debut as an action star was Snake Eyes, then The Rock. He is more subtle in The Rock. Ed Harris, what can I say? He rocks! Also we see ""Candyman"" in the movie as one of the henchmen of the villain. The car chase sequence is one of the bests ever! Honestly, I prefer this one over all the action scenes in Transformers movies. Militarism here is handled very well. Bythe way, the film never tries to be politically correct which is good. The moments within the aircraft scene is maybe the best in the movie and now it becomes an iconic moment in Michael Bay cinema. And I will never forget those green balls!",The Rock
139,Christopher_Reid,"A solid action movie, Michael Bay at his most Michael Bay",7,8 May 2021,"Michael Bay is known for explosions and dumbed-down, easy comedy action movies. The Rock appears to be regarded as his best and probably most serious and realistic movie.While a lot of it is ridiculous, at least the overall concept is plausible. And the villain has a ""point of view"" making him more interesting than someone who is evil for the sake of being evil. What keeps the movie entertaining is the high stakes and unpredictable characters. There is a lot of tension, violence and threats and the pace is very fast. So the flaws can be forgiven to some degree because they don't break the overall momentum.All the familiar cliches are here - stand offs, military people shouting at each-other (""That was an order!"", ""I'm relieving you of your duty!"", ""Sir, I cannot do that, sir!""), shoot-outs, bloody final words, one-liners, bad guys making stupid decisions (and not shooting when they have the chance), the part where one guy gets left behind because there isn't enough time, the FBI people in some room looking at displays losing their heads trying to work out what's going on, the part where someone says ""the son of a b*&$h did it"" or something like that, the crying girlfriend, the car chase causing millions of dollars of damage which probably could have easily been avoided, etc.I don't feel like there's much else to say. We know how these movies play out. There's nothing really original here. But the action is well done - some cool set pieces and plenty of sudden thrills. The performances are good - Cage and Connery are likeable with awkward but funny chemistry while Harris is intense and you half hate him, half get where he's coming from. Michael Biehn is an awesome actor so it's good to see him in this as a marine/soldier yet again. There are some nice character moments here and there where little details help develop the characters, most of whom have a soft side. The music feels like typical Zimmer, not unique but it gets the blood pumping.This might be the smartest dumb action movie ever made, if that makes sense.",The Rock

144,ryan_kuhn,"""Define combat, sir.""",7,29 April 2005,"Rarely do I find a movie where logic takes a back seat that I actually enjoy. The Rock is one of those dumb action movies that I did find enjoyable. Nicholas Cage has turned out to be quite the action actor, able to sustain a borderline-nerd character into a kick ass James Bond-esquire action star (Stanley Goodspeed is his name in the movie). Not bad, especially since he's staring in the same movie as James Bond himself, Sean Connery. The Connery character is actually intriguing. He plays John Mason, an ex-British spy who's been locked up by the FBI for years, holding him without ever charging him on anything. We find out later that he found out buried secrets about America's past, so the FBI had to silence him before he spoke. The only problem with that plan is they put Mason in Alcatraz, and Mason became, at least according to the movie's plot, the only resident of the prison to escape. Fast forward to the movie's present day, and a team of Marines, lead by Ed Harris, have stolen VX gas (real stuff, highly poisonous stuff too) and are threatening to launch missiles filled with the gas from Alcatraz over San Francisco. The plan is to have navy seals enter Alcatraz, with help from Mason, and disable the missiles, with help from Goodspeed. The movie plays like a cat and mouse game between the good guys and the bad guys through the bowels of the prison, ultimately ending in grand fashion. The movie is well paced, director Michael Bay knows just when to slow down the pace and when to speed it back up. The special effects and the acting are solid, especially by Harris who plays a tough guy Marine until the moment of truth approaches.

Ed Harris gives a great performance as the not quite but almost evil general who seizes Alcatraz Island for ransom to receive compensation for deaths of his fellow Marines in black ops missions around the world. There is a crap load of action. This cemented Cage as the actor in demand and lead to several other action movies for him. And Connery never looked better in his old age.

It is pure formula ala Die-hard or some other meaningless Willis or WWF star sort of movie. Don't get me wrong, even Die-hard, at least the first one, was way better than this one.To it's credit, it makes no pretensions of class but serves up violence, military machismo and explosive special effects to satiate the knuckledraggers it is aimed at in a professional high budget way",The Rock

I'd have liked to have seen more evidence of why Connery's character had such a feared reputation, while more could have been done to instill a sense of mortal danger from the chemical weapons.But this is quibbling.

Well, it's one very entertaining and thrilling film, but there's not much else to it. Still, I think it's one of the best action films of the 1990s. At times it's somewhat dumb, at times it's inconsistent, the whole package however is so appealing that you can watch it again and again and not get tired of it. It features some breathtaking San Francisco scenery. The performances are memorable, especially by the three leads. Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris are very good in this film. The scenes on Alcatraz are exciting, and the prison was filmed very well. Michael Bay, however, is not a great director. The jokes and action are impressive but tight filmmaking this is not. Bay relies too much on quick cuts and snappy dialogue instead of trying to build truly impressive scenes. The story too is hardly anything to write about. Bay can deliver the visuals though. The score by Hans Zimmer is another strong point. Most of all The Rock is a feel-good film. It's by far my favourite film by Bay, and I recommend seeing it.",The Rock

Although, the actress who played Stanley's girlfriend kinda sucked and holy crap she was annoying.However, Ed Harris really stands out, but that's not a surprise, he's amazing in everything. He brings a lot of intensity and passion to his character whose motivations are ones you can understand and sympathize with.The cast is stellar. It's got Oscar winners and nominees. And there's people here that became somewhat big in the years following, like John C Mckinley and Bokeem Woodpine.The writing is not that great; particularly the dialogue. The sequence of events is also predictable. However, I will give the writers credit that they definitely put forth effort when it came to defining the characters. But I will say this regarding Hummel: Sure, you understand why he's doing what he's doing, but his plan makes you think, ""You're clearly a man of justice, reason, and honor, so this plan of yours doesn't seem consistent with your character. And therefore, I have a hard time believing anyone would be afraid that you would do it. I certainly didn't think you would."" It's like with Killmonger, except you know he's a sadist whose been tortured his whole life and is overcome with rage. So his plan feels consistent with his character. But not Hummel.

He plays John Mason (Another in a long line of action-movie ""Johns""), the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz.  He's grouchy, and he curses a lot.  Nicholas Cage plays a role in which he improvised many of his lines, such as ""Okay, that's just about the most awful thing I've ever seen,"" and, ""This ISn't HAPpenNING!""  He plays Stan Goodspeed, a music-loving chemical weapons specialist who just found out that his girlfriend is pregnant.  He is enlisted by the FBI to disable the chemical rounds in a number of guided rockets that terrorists are using on Alcatraz. Ed Harris, also in one of his best roles, plays Gen.

He won't keep the money for himself, mind you, but distribute it to the families of the soldiers who have served under him.  This is a unique villain role, because it's hard to declare him as the villain. The scenes are well choreographed, including a spectacular car chase sequence between Connery and everyone else.  Since Connery and Cage are both driving expensive cars, every crash is a tragedy. Nicholas Cage delivers a great performance as a regular guy in a series of dangerous situations.  It really helps you to imagine what it would be like if YOU were there. This movie has everything you could ask for.  A great cast, interesting characters, edge-of-your-seat action scenes, heart-pounding suspense, everything. Michael Bay's best movie yet.",The Rock

157,mat-mcnaughton-254-33257,Needed less Michael Bay.,5,6 July 2012,"There was a car chase in this movie for no reason. I don't like it when directors abuse their budgets. Besides being half an hour longer than it needed to be, it also had the typical amount of exploshuns for a Bay film. At one point Sean Connery throws a knife and there's a P.O.V. shot based on the knife. If that's not terrible, I don't know wh--Oh, and there was this one time a bad guy got skewered by falling on a barbed wire fence pole. Wait, don't forget that there's a bad guy who is wearing a hairnet. Yep.

No, these things are not permitted in movies. Take your conspiracy ish somewhere else.Despite all that, I loved the score, and I can tell that Hans Zimmer borrowed a lot from this for The Pirates of the Caribbean.

This movie was made because it is a very entertaining story with a lot of edge-of-your-seat suspense and has the interesting pairing of Cage and Connery. Connery is very cool in his role as an ex-criminal and inmate of the notorious prison known as ""The Rock"". He somehow escaped and now must help the US Marines reverse escape in.Cage and Connery sneak and fight their way through the compound and manage to destroy the guidance systems in the missiles, making them useless.I think Cage and Connery did a very nice job with their characters. This is not the type of movie where they would get any sort of Oscar nod for it, but I think they did really well. The scene in the end where Cage is just barely able to give the sign to the pilots that he is okay is a very memorable one.

159,btm1,Patently unrealistic plot but many spectacular crashes and explosions,2,8 April 2007,"The plot is laughable, with as many holes as swiss cheese, but the acting is good and the action fast paced. The basis for all of the action is an extortion threat against the government. In exchange for $100 million in payments to the families of marines who died on secret missions and thus (supposedly) were never recognized by the government, a bunch of renegade marines led by a highly decorated, capable, experienced marine general will not destroy San Francisco.Before the movie begins this renegade marine combat unit captured the former Alcatraz Island Prison, ""the Rock,"" and has about 80 civilian tourists hostage on the island. They also brought with them surface-to-surface guided missiles and missile launchers(on the Alcatraz ferry or some other unstated means of transport). Although the US military has no weapons with lethal chemical or biological warheads, the missiles in this movie are armed with deadly mass destruction chemical warheads. The missiles apparently have aerodynamic controls, and are not ballistic missiles, because they can radically change direction in mid-flight. As such, US fighter aircraft, if deployed in time, could easily shoot them down after they were launched, but that solution is not considered in the movie. (Perhaps the chemical would be released into the city's atmosphere even if the missiles were destroyed in flight, but the possibility is not even discussed by the authorities. Nor is the option discussed of using the military's knowledge of the missiles' remote control communications to redirect the guidance systems via appropriately coded radio commands.) The major action is then about a seal team's attempt to forcibly recover and disable the missile warheads. A second action sequence is the escape of the Sean Connery character, who is a prisoner held incommunicado by the White House, and a violent chase through the hills of San Francisco with lots of crashes and fireballs.The premise of the script has major problems. In any extortion threat, both the criminal and victim lose once the threat is carried out. That is, once executed, the bad guys no longer have bargaining power. For extortion to work the victim has to believe that whatever he is afraid will happen will occur if he does not comply with the criminal's demands, AND WON'T occur if he does comply. That point is lost on the criminally insane marines commanded by the Marine General, ably played by Sam Harris, and by the inept or uncaring script writer. The bad marines want the money and think that if they launch the missiles after their deadline is up that the government will then send them $100 million, like paying a ransom AFTER learning that a kidnapped victim is dead.Another problem with the scenario is that the script fails to address how the bad guys expected to be able to have access to the $100 million even if the government agreed to give it to them. After all, they would still be on an island in the middle of San Francisco bay. The government could transfer money to accounts designated by the criminals, but the government could also then freeze those accounts or arrest anyone who tried to use the money. The plot outcome is also predictable. The character played by Nicolas Cage is obviously going to be the hero who will survive. Whether Sean Connery will also survive is not as sure, but it is easy to predict that he will not fail in his mission. Also, there is no doubt that San Francisco will not end up being destroyed. In the movie the government elects to keep the threat secret, so as to prevent panic among the citizens. The movie could have been made more interesting by having the government experts argue over notifying or not notifying the public, and, if the decision was to notify the public, whether to recommend evacuation or the alternative of staying indoors with wet blankets covering windows or other places that outside air could get in. (This was what Israel advised its citizens to do in the first Gulf War when under attack by Iraqi modified SCUD ballistic missiles.)I know crashes and explosions are expensive and dangerous to produce in a movie, but having seen many of these I find new ones rather repetitive and boring and not a reason to see a movie.

161,Tin Man-5,Finally an action film about its characters,6,2 May 1999,"""The Rock"" is an action movie, alright, but it's an action move about its characters, and that's what saves it. It has a strong cast and strong characters and therefore the plot, about a militia group taking Alcatraz hostage and threatening to fire bombs into San Francisco if they don't get 100 million dollars, isn't what comes off the best.There are four central characters in this film. Hummel is the man in charge of this hostage takeover. He is a highly-ranked general who is doing this to teach the government a lesson: they've been neglecting forgotten soldiers who died in the Gulf and Nam, and instead of their families being told the truth, they've simply been marked as ""Missing in Action."" He is played by Ed Harris, who does such a good man torn between duty, conscience, and vengeance, he is the best film villain since Jack Nicholson in ""The Shining.""Goodspeed is a computer nerd working for the C.I.A. He's never been in combat situations, but because of his advanced knowledge of chemical bombs, they've sent him into Alcatraz with a group of Navy SEALS, and he has no idea how to react in war-like situations. Played by Nicolas Cage, his performance is believable and powerful.Anderson is the man in control of the Navy SEALS on the mission to Alcatraz. Tough as nails, bound by duty, he freely admits he agrees with Hummel's reasoning, but he says those are risks that are part of the job, and Hummel is wrong in his action because he took an oath to serve his country no matter what. He is played by Michael Biehn, who delivers a top-notch performance, and one similar to his role in ""Terminator.""But the most powerful character in the film is Mason, the only man who has ever escaped from Alcatraz. Tough, cunning, and full of one-liners, he has been caged up in a maximum security prison for years. It's hard to say whether the viewer can trust him or not, and he has many secrets and much knowledge of the facility...which is why he was chosen to go with the SEALS. He is played by Sean Connery, who's performance is perfectly Sean Connery-ish. But who would want it any other way?This film is great, and it is a great character study for anyone who might be majoring in it or just likes to watch films with good casts.

He has spent 30 years in isolation on account of secrets he knows and skills he possesses. He has even successfully escaped from Alcatraz...something that general knowledge states could not be done. After all of this, the ones who have screwed him around turn out to be the ones who need him most when the island is taken over by dis-gruntled soldiers and a past General of the Viet Nam war who have taken 81 hostages. Nick Cage is called in as a chem-weapons expert. He knows that field, but knows little else, as he has never seen combat, and it has been years since he had any weapons training. There's no problem for an audience to adjust their radar to see Connery in a cloak and dagger situation...and one that has high energy. But...with Nick Cage..he seems to be cast some what over his head and out of his element. There is some measure of a modern day ""Horatio Alger"" character to his performance, but to my view the film could have been made without him, or his role could have been reduced. He actually bogs things down because he needs to be rescued a bit too often. And Cage is not the only problem with this film. The twists and turns of this plot defy reality at some points. There are a few entertaining and exciting moments in the film, but these are outweighed by the gaps in credibility of the plot and of some of the characters, especially the General who changes co-ordinates on a weapon of destruction, and claims he was only bluffing, and tries to call off the whole incident. Of course, the people that he has recruited are PO'd to a fare-thee-well. But, plot dysfunctions such as this take the steam out of the sails of the film, and it's hard to take the film seriously. That would be enough to chase off the critical thinkers, but not enough to turn off the thrill-seekers who want to be entertained...and that's probably the only reason this piece of celluloid has any legs at all. Because the film has mostly entertainment value of a destructive sort and does not seek to engage the audience, it fails to deliver. I have given it 5 stars, which I consider to be quite generous.

167,stebird,"Alcatraz has just re-opened, with a vengeance!",10,11 August 2017,"A nifty old school crime/disaster film that reinvigorated and brought out the best in Sean Connery, oh and Nicholas Cage was pretty decent too, decent as in quite possibly one of his greatest ever performances. It was still the 90's when The Rock rolled into cinemas, and you can tell even now as it maintains some of the classic charm that was sadly lost as the millennium turned, in other words it's aged a bit since it was released. To use Alcatraz as the principle setting was a daring move as so many previous films had used the iconic island prison as a location before, but it was a move that paid off in abundance, one of the better Alcatraz based films in my opinion. Like so many top end films, the plot was staggeringly simple, it doesn't make you think too much so you can just sit back and let the action flow, it's exciting and at times, edge of your seat stuff, that's precisely how these kind of films should be. As good as Nicholas Cage was (and he was very good indeed) the standout performance has to go to the iconic Sean Connery, a master of his craft he brought elements of his old James Bond character to the fold, giving this character John Patrick Mason that something extra, for an old man he sure can move!Underlining morals come into play also, General Hummel the film's primary antagonist keeps a stiff upper lip through the bulk of the film's run, but towards the end he has a crisis of conscience, there's still too much goodness in him and he plans on scrapping his dastardly plan altogether..., the beginning of the end for him and his loyal followers, setting up the final act of the film. The Rock naturally gets top marks because I can't see where I can possibly mark it down, it's enjoyable, technically masterful, got a bulletproof story, great character performances, hits all the right emotions, simple to follow and most importantly, it has that iconic 90's feel about it..., great film, definitely would watch it again.",The Rock

You really need to pay attention. The characters are great. There are really no bad-guy. You have sympathy for all of them and you get to know them as they develop through out the movie. The Rock has a couple of plots. The main goal is to put an end to the situation, but there is also Goodspeed's personal sub-plot. There are nice chemistry and interaction between the characters and the dialog is good. The movie has everything you want, drama, action, suspense and humor and it's all put together very nicely.The cast is quite a line up of stars with grand old man Sean Connery in the lead with Nicholas Cage. They fit their characters perfectly and work very well together. Their performance is great. The rest of the cast is nothing less. John Spencer does a good character of Womack and Ed Harris joins humanity and military roughness as General Hummel. All in all this is a pretty strong cast that works well together.The cinematography is great. It captures the variation in the mood very well, from a romantic love scene to an action filled car chase. It all looks great.

171,mystic80,One of the smartest action films made,9,24 January 2000,"""The Rock"" stands out as one of the best action films made.  A film that not only contains the big explosions and quick shootouts, it's faithful to it's storyline. The plot follows marine Frank Hummell, a fed up general angry at the government for ignoring the covert operations he was in that claimed the lives of his men.  Frank, along with his faithful group of marines steal 16 rockets from the government. These rockets contain a very deadly toxin that could wipe out humans in mere seconds by literally disintegrating them. Teaming up with a group of ex-marines intent on getting back in the action, they seize Alcatraz, make the tourists hostages, and threaten to launch the rockets at San Francisco. A worried group of military officials and FBI men enlist the help of an uptight FBI chemist named Stanley Goodspeed and an incarcerated British spy named John Mason who has been behind government bars for years with a knowledge of Alcatraz (a former inmate/3 time escapee).  The two embark with an FBI crew that is later wiped out leaving the two of them to stop the general and his band of marines.  ""The Rock"" manages to deliver the goods with spectacular car chases (an intense daylight car chase through the hills of San Francisco that results in utter mayhem and destruction with a wham bam finale) to excellent performances by the cast, Ed Harris as the disgruntled general, Sean Connery as the wise and wisecracking spy, and Nicolas Cage as the seriously uptight chemist. Other notable performances include David Morse, Michael Biehn, William Forsythe, Tony Todd, John Spencer, and Gregory Sporleder. One of Jerry Bruckheimer's best films.

174,MadReviewer,A First-Rate Action Flick,8,9 May 2001,"`The Rock' effortlessly achieves what most action movies can only dream about  it's paced so well, and has action scenes and characters so good, the weak spots in the story really don't matter.  Story quality is one of the major components behind making a good movie, but it's certainly not the only component, and `The Rock' demonstrates that to great effect.  With great direction from Michael Bay, and with outstanding performances from the cast (especially Ed Harris), what might've been a standard, mediocre film in other hands is instead a fantastic action movie.
The premise:  `The Rock', or Alcatraz, as it's more commonly known, is taken over by a bunch of military terrorists led by General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris), an American war hero.  Instead of issuing the usual comic-book demands of typical terrorists, Hummel wants the United States government to pay compensation to the families of American soldiers who died in covert, officially unrecognized missions  in the amount of one hundred million dollars.  Failure to pay as per Hummel's demands will result in the obliteration of San Francisco with bio-chemical weapons.Enter the geeky Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), a FBI bio-chemistry expert, to be part of the team needed to get onto `The Rock' and defuse the weapons.  He's paired with the renowned spy John Mason (Sean Connery), who's supposedly the only person ever to successfully escape from Alcatraz  the FBI figures since Mason knew how to sneak out of the prison undetected, he'll be able to sneak back on.  Together, Mason and Goodspeed travel to Alcatraz to thwart General Hummel's plansThe action is phenomenal and paced perfectly; director Michael Bay manages to keep a tense, frantic edge throughout most of the film, but seems to know just when to stop or slow things down so that the audience has a little time to breathe.  Many of the action scenes seem to be cribbed from other films  a car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco is nearly lifted perfectly from `Bullitt', for example, while a three-way armed standoff is highly reminiscent of any number of Sergio Leone westerns  but they're conducted with such joyful enthusiasm, that doesn't matter.  Individually, these scenes might seem like nothing but cheap knock-offs of other films, but they're brought together with such skill that the overall film looks great.  Connery is great as Mason, the spy who's seen more than any normal man should ever see, and Cage is pretty convincing as the bumbling Goodspeed, who's more comfortable with a calculator than a handgun.  Both imbue their characters with enough depth to make them a cut above typical action movie heroes.  Ed Harris steals the movie, though, as the gritty, weary Hummel  you wind up caring about him and his band of patriotic renegades a lot, and since he's technically the villain of `The Rock', it adds whole new dimensions to the standard action movie formula, dimensions that both Michael Bay and the screenwriters took the time to explore.  Ed Harris' portrayal of Hummel literally makes `The Rock' an outstanding action movie on his own.  With different actors, would this movie have been as good? Maybe . . . but I doubt it very much.Are there problems with `The Rock?'  Certainly. Hummel and his men, for example, don't seem to understand the concept of `secured radio channels', allowing Goodspeed and company to overhear vital plot information almost at will.  The tunnels beneath Alcatraz are apparently bigger than the Lincoln Tunnel, and better lit to boot.  The list goes on, but these are minor issues that only slightly detract from the awesome ride that is `The Rock'. Grade:  A-",The Rock

178,MinorityReporter,Sean Conney and Nicolas Cage deliver the goods!,8,28 September 2005,"The Rock is the first of Nicolas Cage's action ""trilogy"" and it is by far the best. Not only is it one of the best films with Nicolas Cage I have seen but it is also Michael Bays best film, no contest. The style and goal of the film are clear from the beginning. The style is adrenalized and the goal is entertainment pure and simple and it delivers in the best possible way. People who say that this film is a mindless action film need to wake up and take a closer look because the film may be an action film but it is an action film about its characters.The main character is Nicolas Cage as an FBI science rat and he is actually as believable if even more so as a dorky kind of character than a fully blown action hero as in the other films of the ""trilogy"" (the other films are of course Con Air and Face/Off). He seems twitchy and nervous and he does a good job of it (he uses this nervous energy in one of his best performances in Matchstick Men). Ed Harris does a good job as always and brings his usual energy to the character who seems to genuinely believe in his cause. The rest of the cast is good as well. Michael Biehn is almost criminally underused but the best performance in the film is of course Sean Connery's. He brings his undefinable something to his character who becomes almost instantly likable. He has the Bond wit combined with an older man's wisdom. However, the character is more complex than that but telling about it could be considered as spoiling the film which I have no intention of doing. Suffice to say Sean Connery is brilliant.The action and effects of the movie are top notch even now almost 10 years later. Everything is of course overblown but somehow it still manages to stay within the confines of semi-believable unlike Face/Off, which is also a good film but just too far out. Connery seems believable even in his old age as an action symbol perhaps much more than any other actor could have been except perhaps Harrison Ford who until recently was also a fairly believable action star. Cage is also pretty good as is the rest of the supporting cast in the action scenes.Aside from a few preachy moments the film is pure entertainment which can be watched again and again simply because of the high quality of everything in the film.8/10",The Rock

182,hchais,One of the greatest action movies ever.,10,25 April 2007,"This movie is awesome! This is truly one of the greatest action movies of all time brought to you by Micheal Bay, the director of great action movies like ""Armageddon"", ""Bad boys"", and ""Pearl Harbor"" and the Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of such movies like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Crimson Tide"", and ""National Treasure"". I am not a big fan of Micheal Bay's movies because ""Pearl Harbor"" sucked. But this is clearly his best movie. There is a great story, a great script, great acting, great special effects, its funny, and its dramatic. The music is also great. I think its the same music used in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" but as a good thing. Its good music. Over all, this is truly a great movie. I don't want to give anything away.

183,brianlion,DON'T BE TOO HARD ON THE ROCK,8,26 November 2002,"If you want an entertaining movie, ""The Rock"" will do. Sean Connery plays a James Bond character, and Nicolas Cage gives his usual performance. The setting is great and San Francisco is a nice back drop. I did have a few problems with the film. In the age of Ebay, Cage's character buys the Beatles ""White Album"" for way too much. The Ed Harris character really cops out when he and his men decide to launch a missle. They take hostages, kill several people, and risk all to see their demands met. When the opportunity arises, they bluff and do not carry out their threats. If they were not prepared to pull the trigger, why go to the extreme in the first place? Nicolas Cage also has a bad acting habit of emphasising the last word of every sentence. He does that in about every movie. Lose that, Cage. This is not a great movie, but don't be too hard on ""The Rock"".  There are enough standard car chases, explosions, and mayhem to keep me entertained.",The Rock
184,lwjoslin,Rockin',6,23 September 2003,"Slam-bang high-tech action-thriller stuff.  Ed Harris, as a much-decorated combat commander of legendary status, deploys a hand-picked squadron of elite renegade Marines to take over Alcatraz. He holds hostage not only a civilian tour group, but the entire city of San Fran, at which he's aimed 15 tactical missiles armed with the nastiest nerve gas in the universe. His goal?  To get the US government to acknowledge, with posthumous honors and compensation to family members, about 100 men lost -- and unacknowledged -- in covert operations ranging from Vietnam to Desert Storm.Here come the Feds: they send in a team of SEALs led by Michael Biehn (in a reprise, basically, of his role in ""Aliens""). Their ringers: Nicolas Cage, in a rather John Cusackish performance as a lab-wonk toxic-weapons expert, hilariously short of combat experience; and Sean Connery, as a long-held secret prisoner of the US, a Brit agent who has all the dirt on the FBI.  He knows all the secrets from Roswell (!) to the JFK assassination, and he's the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz. The scripter's inclusion of the presence in San Fran of people who are near and dear to both these characters is more than a little contrived.  It has MOTIVATION written all over it in the case of Connery's character, and UP THE ANTE in the case of Cage's. But what the hell: this isn't drama, but melodrama, essentially an hyperbolic mismatched-buddy-cop movie, and the pace, the action, and the stars' charisma are equal to it.  An enjoyable cliffhanger, if wildly improbable.",The Rock

186,rchrdshelt,The best action movie ever!Poor Jonathan Hensleigh!,10,28 July 2003,"I bought this movie after having it highly recommended by several friends. I did not know what to expect. Their opinions of movies tend to differ alot to mine but they were well on for this one. I have to say when i thought about it before i watched it i was under the impression that the action would not be that good as its set in a prison. How wrong i was! The fact is that this movie has now become my favourite action movie to date. It has everything from non-stop action to terrific characters, a terrific story, terrific actors and some very funny lines. This has to be my favourite movie by Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer to date although i haven't seen Bad Boys 2 yet but i rather doubt i will change my mind. The action is amazing with memorable scenes being a terrific car chase, some brilliant shoot-outs at the prison and some great fight sequences and explosions. Sean Connery and Nicolas cage make a great team and both characters are likeable along with the bad guy Ed Harris as he is not evil, but a guy with a good motive and he is also not a guy who just wants money for him and his guys. Michael Bay should be directing more action movies than disaster movies like Armeageddon and Pearl harbour as they have great action but are overlong and lack a good story and good characters. This movie and Bad Boys were good as they contained great characters and great action which i think he can do best. In conclusion I have to say a huge thank you to Jonathan Hensleigh     ( Die hard 3 and Armeageddon) for writing this movie. He is completely uncredited and very few people know he re-wrote the whole script for this movie but i think he did an outstanding job and should have been credited for his hard work on the script and his contribution to action movies. His over ones which he re-wrote include Con Air and Gone in 60 seconds which he was credited for but not as a writer. I feel so sorry for him though and i cannot wait till his next movie ""The Punisher"" comes out. Don't worry Jonathan I will support you all the way! e-mail me if you like! You are the best action movie writer in the business!",The Rock

If you are not, then only one remarkable scene remains. Halfway the movie Sean Connery escapes to meet his daughter. Then it immediately becomes clear, that Connery is a good actor.

Ed Harris gave it all as General Francis Hummel making this one of the best performances I've seen (perhaps I'm exagerating a bit but I liked it anyway) and that he's done (see also God wannabe Cristof from Truman Show). Besides of what the script and the characters thought and said of Hummel (a good man after all) I was really simpathetic to him to the point I regreted his death a lot.Good props and uniforms and locations too, and an excellent score with that particular tune that is played on every Bay/Bruckheimer film.
Although there was nothing really bad with the script, I was actually sorry for those SEALs that got screwed as soon as they entered the Rock, which anyway was good to the plot.

194,Sisiutil,An action flick with all the trimmings,8,27 December 2001,"Action movies are a lot like fast food. You know: you're not in the mood for something complicated, you just want to satisfy your appetite. You certainly don't want to think too hard during or after the experience. And you want to know what to expect. So you go to Mickey D's, or Steven Seagal--same diff.But every now and then, you get surprised. The fast food joint has a monthly special and it's better than their usual fare. You get what you came for (fast pacing, clever lines, things gettin' blowed up real good), but you get something extra. In the case of The Rock, you get a LOT of extras: top-notch performances by A-list leads (Connery, Cage, Harris) and by some of the best supporting actors around (Morse, Biehn, Forsythe, Spencer, Todd, McGinley); a setting, the decrepit bowels of Alcatraz, that's a visual feast and almost a character in the movie itself; character development (!!!); and an action flick that ain't afraid to quote Oscar Wilde.Granted, it ain't Filet Mignon, or Schindler's List.

This, because people really want to see Nicholas Cage in a Yellow Submarine, miles below the surface where nobody can hear his voice ever again. Satan how ever will have Nick soon enough.

196,bek-12,The Unsung Villains Steal the Show,7,25 December 2000,"This movie is definitely for action junkies. If you enjoy disecting a movie looking for silly dialogue, plot holes, or looking for inner-meaning in a movie, you might want to skip The Rock. This movie is 2 hours, 15 minutes, but the action is almost nonstop and the movie moves briskly. It's typical Jerry Bruckheimer fare, including plenty of action, an implausible storyline, and big stars doing a fine job of acting.Some Bruckheimer characteristic events were obvious, such as the scene immediately after the car chase where Cage stands, and the camera rotates around him. This is reminescent of a similar scene in Bad Boys, another Bruckheimer film, where Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are standing in a similar pose with the same rotating camera view. Also present was the presidential address and accompanying slow-motion dramatic scenes near the end, ala Armageddon. I'm not saying it's bad for Bruckheimer to reuse his old ideas, just that if I was able to spot them, other people probably did as well.Some of the dialogue was way over the top, and tended to get a bit macho and silly. When Mason tells Lomax, ""...you're between the Rock and a hard case"", I felt like groaning. There was plenty of self-referential comments, such as this one where Mason refers to himself as a ""hard case"". There were also other comments where the characters would try to ""build up"" the other characters, such as when Lomax says, ""You don't know Mason."" I hate it when movies do this. They try to make you believe how tough a character is by other characters talking about him. I would prefer to SEE how tough he is by his actions, rather than be told about it constantly using dialogue. Several parts of the movie, such as the stalemate in the shower, seemed melodramatic and reheased. I couldn't imagine Michael Biehn, in real life, giving the ""We spilt the same blood in the same mud"" speech to a general that's holding a gun on him, but that's just my opinion.Cage plays the geek very well, with some very humorous scenes. The scene near the beginning where he's difusing the bomb, and finding the Playboy mags and gas mask, and his assistant screaming about the long needle, was darkly hilarious. I love that sort of humor. There were lots of very good scripting, such as the dialogue between Cage and Connery about the difference between winners and losers, and Cage's ""Actually, I'm a chemical SUPER-freak"" response was a great one-liner.I did feel like there some were plot holes, or at least some weird occurances. For example, when Cage calls his girlfriend and tells her not to come to San Francisco, she yells back into the phone, ""Like hell I won't!"" and hangs up. Why would she do that? Wouldn't she more likely ask something like, ""Why not?"" Or at the very least, maybe start accusing him of being with another woman? Of course, this was the perfect vehicle for her to come to San Francisco against his wishes and have to be rescued. It didn't make sense, but it made the story move along. Also, she runs away from the FBI agent when he comes to pick up her. Why? Because the FBI agent refused to answer her questions about where her boyfriend (Cage) is. Why would she run away? I would assume the FBI agent is there to take me to safety or to her boyfriend. But again, by running away this furthers the plot--now she's in danger and Cage can agonize about her fate, and thus he has motivation to disarm the poison rockets. If she had stayed and allowed the FBI to whisk her to safety, he would not have been motivated to save the city. He'd already been shown to be a bit of a coward in the scene where he's throwing up out of nervousness. Of course, in other scenes he's terribly heroic. His character was a bit inconsistent, but you could explain it as him being thrust into the situation and once there, exceeding his prior limits.The incinerator was another weird plot device. It looked a bit unrealistic. It was obviously something dreamed up for an action movie, with moving cogs (wheels) that would turn and have to be dodged by the hero, all the while fire is rushing through the same area. I've seen an incinerator, and it didn't resemble this monstrosity at all. I have no idea if the motion sensor that detected the marines arrival was accurate and if the military really has something this sophisticated, but I thought it was an ingenius idea.You may feel differently, but I actually enjoyed the villains of the story more than the heroes. Most of the lines that struck me as powerful were delivered by the noble villains, Harris and Morse. I found the combination of Ed Harris, David Morris, and Michael Biehn (admittedly not a villain in this movie) a powerful combination. I consider all these actors excellent, and the stalemate in the shower room was especially powerful, as well as the standoff with the villains near the end. These scenes didn't feature Connery or Cage, or the occasional humorous tension breaker. These scenes showed us that all villains are not the same, and that some villains are evil, and some just misguided. This degree of gray, in an otherwise black and white character movie, added a level of complexity to the film. Thus, a film that I would have otherwise said was ""okay"" became a really good action movie with some characters that I actually cared about.There was lots of violence and profanity, and a brief sexual situation (although no nudity) near the beginning. Despite my problems with some of the dialogue and plot, I found this movie enjoyable and engaging. If you don't mind overly macho acting and some silliness in the dialogue, and you love action, then you'll probably love this movie. If seeing serious characterization and motivation if more your style, you might want to check out Steel Magnolias and leave The Rock at the video store.",The Rock

198,MovieMusings,Good movie,7,8 February 2000,"Great story. Another contribution to the ""corrupt government covering its corruption"" theme (vis-a-vis Outbreak).Ed Harris is awesome. His character for me is the most complex. He is a true sympathetic not-so-bad bad guy (like Gene Hackman in Crimson Tide AND Extreme Measures; they make you not only understand, but almost to root for them...almost. Harris here is about the closest).Connery is standard excellent. Cage gets on my nerves with his whining voice. I can think of several other actors who could have played this role without getting on my nerves. But, anyways...I love when movies like The Rock make us question our assumptions; when they challenge us to reconsider ethical dilemmas, what is right or wrong in life.Plenty of action. Very significant scene when the soldiers squared off.
I'd love some more development of why Hummel's team fell apart as it did. I study social psychology and could write a paper on why, but the movie didn't supply enough info to make it plain enough (or, it did but I must have missed it).One shortcoming -- we never saw the hostages again after they were first locked up during the tour. They were referred to in the presidential soliloquy (which I hated; the portrayal of the president in this film was critical to the dilemma value in the movie; contrast this presidential portrayal with what we see in Air Force One, or, better yet, Independence Day) but we never see them again; how can we feel for them?

200,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,"Pure adrenaline-in-your-heart entertainment, and a smart script too!",9,9 July 2000,"How did such a smart script find its way into this Simpson/Bruckheimer summer blockbuster? Don't get me wrong, the boys always entertain, but this is a bit of a conundrum, don't you think (i'm gonna have to look that word up sometime).Great cast. I mean, a REALLY great cast. You got Cage, Connery and Harris as the leads. Then you got Morse, Biehn, McGinley, Todd and Forsythe in minor rolls. These guys are great! This is about as big a ""guy movie"" as you're gonna find. This movie and Leaving Las Vegas are what rocketed Cage into superstar status. Oh, he was always a star, with plenty of work, but after the critical acclaim he got from Vegas and the box office he delivered in The Rock, in '96 he became a star people actually wanted to pay to see on the screen. Good for him. He does a god job here as the guy who's in way over his head. He gets to be eccentric and a little heroic as he battles the bad guys (and Sean Connery, who makes him look like schoolboy).Connery pulls it off, i have to hand it to him. This guy is old, but I had no problem believing him walking into Alcatraz and gunning down a hundred soldiers like he was Sly Stallone. I guess that's saying a lot for the old Bond.Harris is intense, but isn't he always? This guy gives a glare that could give Clint Eastwood chills. I love watching this guy, and I sympathized with his plight. He's not a villain, but he's not quite the patriot he thinks he is, and he learns it the hard way. The scene with him and Connery is very fun to watch.Is Michael Bay a good director? My thinking is... yes and no. He packs this movie with a lot of interesting shots, but doesn't linger on one of them for more than two seconds at a time. Is that insecurity or just his music video pedigree?

It has an interesting lead villain, great performances by Ed Harris, Sean Connery, and John Spencer; a good plot, and good special effects.It is a ""Turn your brain off"" action flick, but the motives of the villains are actually interesting to think about (to me anyway).There is some stereotyping, but overall the movie is extremely entertaining...EXCEPT FOR NICOLAS CAGE!!! HOW DOES THIS MAN KEEP FINDING WORK!!! I HAVE YET TO SEE HIM ACT IN A FILM!!! Whenever he utters a line, I want to scream ""Shut-up Nicolas Cage!!! Leave!!! I want to see what Mr. Connery's doing!"" (i.e. ""It's you. You're the Rocket Man..."" - Worst... delivery... ever.) Thankfully, the movie doesn't focus on him all the time. There is sufficient diversion with the villains, the other actors, and the special effects to distract from Cage's performance.That said, Cage in a starring role automatically adds a -3 modifier.6/10. Good action, interesting lead villain (Harris), good performances by most of the cast, worth a look if you ignore Nicolas Cage, which you can easily do with everything else going on.A NOTE ABOUT NICOLAS CAGE - The -3 modifier will disappear if I see a film where he engages in the art of ""acting.""

204,james_norman1981,Michael Bay's best...,10,1 October 2005,"To sum up the Rock succinctly is fairly easy: it is a buddy film. This is a movie that brings all sorts of clichés together, but achieves the difficult success of making them seem like they're original and apt.In short, The Rock doesn't have an original bone in its body, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Michael Bay, the film's director who is somewhat notorious due to his penchant for mindless action, clearly hadn't learnt many of the bad tricks he's picked up in more recent offerings. Most impressively, for Bay, rather than spending genuine hours with over the top car chases, helicopter action, foot chases and just about everything else we've all come to loathe in 'A Michael Bay Film' the director succeeds in turning in an extremely tight, well paced movie which thrusts you into the top notch action almost immediately, but doesn't fail to show you the human side of the protagonists. Nicolas Cage is excellent as the lab rat, Stanley Goodspeed, a man who would probably call himself a geek. He's happy, drives the epitome of dull vehicles, has a gorgeous girlfriend and usually lives a very boring life. However work in any department of the FBI during a Michael Bay film is seldom going to be prosaic and it's not long before good old Stanley is disarming bombs, getting sprayed with poisonous gas and finding out unfortunate, ill timed, wonderful news... But that's all in a day's work. What is unusual is when Ed Harris, wonderfully straight laced and sincere, steals a number of rockets armed with a chemical capable of eradicating an entire city in the time it takes to breath in the gas... Harris', or General Hummel's, choice of target is San Francisco and what better choice of venue to launch a battery of VX poison gas, a compound that exists and is genuinely as horrible as described, than Cisco's most famous penitentiary? Hummel turns up with a bunch of 'can do' type marines who all agree that America, particularly the Pentagon, has been screwing the Special Forces for too long... it must stop! Naturally, as a bona fide patriot and all round good army guy, Hummel reckons the best way to achieve this is to take several dozen tourists hostage on Alcatraz, aka the Rock, ring up the director of the FBI and demand $100 million dollars, most of which will be given away in a fairly hefty act of altruism. The fact that none of this rings untrue is the central tenet of the movie and is all down to Harris, whose lined, worried face manages, with almost no overacting, to portray a wide range of emotions. These vary from impassioned orator to reluctant villain and he does it with a wit and skill that Michael Bay might well not have asked for. Regardless, having such an excellent central bad guy is what pulls The Rock away from the pack.It's also helped by Cage's comedic foil in all this, Sean Connery clearly relishing the part he receives and probably amazed that someone decided that he could genuinely be Scottish in at least one major role! With a mixture of twinkly eyes, physical brawn and his typical slurred delivery, big Sean comes away with the lion's share of the good lines and the humour, his best moments coming when he's face to face with Harris or nattering with Cage.The two leads work very well together, the hyperactive, fidgety Cage inhabiting Stanley with just the right mixture of nervous fear and 'let's do it!' attitude. Connery smirks his way through the entire piece, loving every wet, dark, dank moment while Harris is clearly on another plane of acting, imagining himself as the devil's advocate rather than another, bad as sin, Michael Bay villain. All in all, the film cannot be faulted for its three principles, the pacing, the script, the one liners, the quality of acting, the suspension of disbelief or any of the things that have grated, on me at least, with films like Bad Boys (1 and 2), Pearl Harbour, The Island and so forth. This is a tightly wound action thriller that achieves both goals handsomely, throwing in the comedy and happy ending without detracting from anything.That is not to say there aren't faults. One personal bugbear is Hanz Zimmer's awful use of panpipes to indicate moments of emotional growth. There are occasions when Cage's wide eyed mania gets a little annoying and the standard continuity problems are present... how does Connery's John Mason get from hanging upside down on a wrecked mining cart to poised delicately above a pair of marines who are travelling on an entirely separate vehicle? However, these problems are usually over before they've started and seldom detract from the feeling of fun and excitement. Other standouts are the supporting cast, John Spencer on fine, waspy form for example, the limited, well crafted car chase (not chases), including one of the most legendary lines ever committed to film from Cage and the rest.In short, this is as perfect an action film as you're ever likely to see, creating an overall product certainly the equal of, if not superior to, the sum of its parts. I'd advise any fan of action flicks who hasn't seen this movie to buy it, not just see it, at the first possibility. However, there's unlikely to be that many of you!",The Rock

After knowing that he plays a British agent in the movie, I am definitely sure that the director shows us the prisoned James Bond. However, if you want to see the acute fight scene of him in this pic, it will be a little disappointed, after all he is an old man, how can we expect him to do well in the things belonging to youngsters. I think he has already done his best in this performance, gets to the level where an old actor should be.Here I do not want to talk about the plot, as it is a stereotype, gets nothing to tell. There are some words for our main male actor Nicol, his performance is not as good as our old man. Sometimes you can see the scary he expressed in this film seems like not real enough. Of course, some deficiency of the film can not be his responsibility, such as a professional biological chemistry expert can unexpectedly put the most toxic weapon in the sewer. Maybe I can understand if I were in his situation, but I am still feel bad about some details. To my surprise, a platoon of marine can be easily killed by an old man spending half of life in prison and just coming out.Anyway, if I get time and want to see some movies without brainstorms, this one would on my list.",The Rock

Other actors in the film are Michael beihn who plays commander Anderson and John spencer as fbi director Womack They do good with their roles too. Goodspeed first plays a doctor and a chemist who has a girlfriend and mason is first playing a prisoner who later gets free and then he unites with goodspeed and they work togeather to stop the rouge group of force marines from launching rockets on San Francisco.Other events happen like when the pentagon fbi develop a plan to take the island with the u s navy seals. This film has a great concept and entry shows a great depiction of military and a Group of teams in a mission to stop a launch, lots of meaningful action is shot they are all very convincing and very impressive and as always Michael bay always knows what he is doing and shoots it in different angles with more than just fire explosions💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 but also Car chases and shooting🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘🚘 he has a very skilled talent and if you are into very intelligent propaganda action films Michael bay's movies are likely your type as well as if you are a film fan you will love and adore Michael bay he depicts action, story and patriotism.Later the commander hummell is working alongside marines frye, darrrow, and others and they eventually betray him by undoing his orders but they are eventually stopped by goodspeed and mason who part ways and kill them while doing. The film ends with mason faking his death by saying he was killed in a bomb explosion while he wasn't and goodspeed with newlywed wife stealing a microfilm from a church.Again the rock is a masterpiece and Michael bay and jerrry Bruckheimer have made another unforgettable classic and deserve the biggest praise. This film shows great courage, has meaning and a heart and it shows great patriotism as all the other Michael bay films do, the musical score is good hans Zimmer always delivers he is one of the best composers of all time and the script, cinematography were good to. bay is America's most beloved director and we will always love him he is a great filmmaker who deserves 100 percent love and admiration and a big fat 0 percent hatred and criticism he is an approval to Hollywood and one of the reasons cinema is important and great he will always be on our list of best directors ever and best directors in cinema history, he is a skillful craftsman a treasure master, a visual auteur, a brilliant artist, a cinematic superstar and an intelligent genius, as well as the American Federico Fellini. The rock is another example of how he is very good at making movies and always has the pleasantly adorable style that is never confusing and shows what a real action film is supposed to be made this is how it's done we will always love him and Michael bay has done a great job well done man we love you keep going make more movies and never stop you can stay with the film industry forever and never leave 😄😄😄😄😄😊😊😊😊😊👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 and this has also got to be one of few action films that deserve Oscar nominations along with, the French connection, the fugitive, or witness those films were also very spectacular action fests and this is the best of them all it deserved Oscar nominations in these categoriesBest director: Michael bay**********Best picture: don simpson, Jerry Bruckheimer**********Best film editing******Best cinematography**********Best screenplay*******Best original score: Hans Zimmer********Best sound mixing****",The Rock
211,shortround8391,One of the Greatest Action films of all time.......,10,2 March 2009,"It was the mid-1990's and that decade plus the 1980's were perhaps the only times when films had action plus real characters and a real story to go along with it. When it became the 2000's the action genre got dumbed down into 80-90 minute shoot 'em up's and things were never the same.But at least we have multiple films to remember the era when action/thriller films were at their prime, and The Rock is a perfect example to define that.Nowadays, people always criticize Michael Bay for making unwatchable garbage (Pearl Harbor, Armageddon)....but this is before he screwed himself up big time, although 2007's ""Transformers"" wasn't that bad either....but anyway, everything about The Rock is so freaking cool and likable. The casting of Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery couldn't have been any better. Nicolas Cage has usually been getting a lot of flak for being a ""performer"" rather than an ""actor"" meaning he's always been acting goofy and over-the-top. But it's that exact reason why it works so well, 'cause his character is basically a chemical weapons geek, and that's what the stereotypical nerd is like. For example, ""''I just wanna find some *rockets*!''"".....Cage puts in some perfect facial expressions and mannerisms in here.Connery is great and believable as the tough former British spy and frequently verbally abuses Goodspeed (Cage) during their mission on the island. And that makes some pretty good tension which is a great thing to add in a movie along with the action. Also, Ed Harris is great as the moral General who sees using a major threat as being necessary to avenge the forgotten memories of his own former soldiers, and who knows? You might find yourself to feel sympathy for him.SPOILERS- The car chase scene in this one might remind a lot of viewers of the one in ""Bullitt"" 'cause of all the ups and downs.....but since it's the 90's it's a lot more enjoyable. And the action also has some emotion to go along with it, such as the bathroom scene when all the Navy SEALS get slaughtered with all the slow motion and soft music...and the part when the President of the United States gives a heartfelt speech to himself before ordering the attack on the island.I've enjoyed this movie a lot and I'm sure you will too. Right now, I have it on DVD and I consider it a staple in my action film collection. Watch it and be forever amazed.....",The Rock

215,moviescriticnet,"A classic, pure action film, top of it's genre.",9,4 December 2015,"The Rock, directed by Michael Bay (Pearl Harbor, Armageddon, Transformers) is what simply be described as a classic, pure action film, top of it's genre. Though not appreciated by the critics (66% in rotten tomatoes), it got one Oscar nomination the time that action movies where still considered as b-movies by the Academy and won several minor awards (like best actor and supporting actor in Blockbuster Entertainment Awards). It features great performances by Nicolas Cage (a very versatile actor), Ed Harris and of course Sean Connery. As even the rotten tomatoes critics admit ""For visceral thrills, it can't be beat."". Or better put, it can only be compared with the best Denzel Washington films (Training Day, American Gangster, Unstoppable). In a nutshell this movie intended to be a perfect action film and that's exactly what it is, managing to keep your nerves tensed for 136 minutes.Grade: A",The Rock
216,sherbetsaucers,Great Example Of The Genre,7,7 February 2007,"I'm whispering now as just in front of me we can see that most glorious of creatures, the Action Movie, or Carus Spectaculum. This, noble creature is often the prey to the critic. Often we find this lumbering yet majestic beast devoured, picked apart by the savage predator, all that remains left for scavengers of little intelligence to enjoy. Ironically the voracious critic is unable to digest the Action Movie, often tearing it apart simply for the fun of it. Confused by the vivid colours and often loud displays of prowess performed by this simple creature the critic reacts with hostility Don't get me wrong, I don't think that spending 20 million dollars on petrol and a box of matches is good enough, an action movie needs some kind of plot and some level of acting, but on the other hand a well crafted action movie is just as hard to make as some kind of art-house flick about lesbian Jews in the Nazi party. Much like movies are viewed with a great deal of snobbery by certain people, so are action movies viewed with a great deal of snobbery by certain critics. In the case of The Rock, those critics need to shut up.When General Hummel (Ed Harris) decides to hold San Francisco hostage by bringing 15 rockets containing the very nasty VX gas to Alcatraz, it falls down to science-wiz Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), ex-SAS officer John Mason (Sean Connery) and a handful of soon-to-be-killed Navy Seals to go there and deal with the threat. Neither Stanley or Mason want to go to Alcatraz but one is the only man who the government trust to be able to disarm the rockets containing the nasty poison, the other is the only man ever to escape from Alcatraz. I'll leave you to work out which is which. It seems that Mason has spent the last 30 years of his life in prison because in the 60s he stole a lot of very secret information about the U.S. government. He's a dangerous man. Hummel, by the way, isn't doing this for the money. He has taken this drastic course of action because he is tired of the way the U.S. military and the U.S. government conduct themselves. I think we can all empathise. However honourable his intentions may be, he did unfortunately choose The Candyman as one of his henchmen, so we know it's going to come to no good. After many seriously gruesome deaths, the fate of the world is saved, Goodspeed and Mason gain a respect for one another and we leave, picking the popcorn from between our teeth.This is a Don Simpson/ Jerry Bruckheimer action movie. We know that the good guys are going to win. We know that the bad guys are all going to die. We know that a car will explode/ overturn at the slightest provocation, unless driven by the hero. What we don't know is how well the action is going to be pulled off or if the plot and acting will carry us from one set piece to the next. My friends, The Rock delivers. It has a thoughtful villain, someone who is trying to right an injustice. The two heroes are not your typical action movie characters, one is a chemist who is more at home at the office rather than the shooting range, the other a pensioner. In fact let me dwell upon Cage and Connery for a moment here. Cage seems to me to be one of the finest leading men in Hollywood. He is highly versatile, good looking and not afraid to make himself look silly. Anyone prepared to sit in a pair of swimming trunks to play the guitar in a scene deserves your respect. As for Connery well in The Rock the former Mr. Universe contestant still looks pretty big. Lets be frank here, he's basically playing a version of James Bond who has grown old, he even uses a Bond response when Goodspeed tells him his name. (""But of course you are"".) Ed Harris is fantastic, giving Hummel just the right level of intensity and sheer righteous indignation. The supporting cast also seem to know exactly what is expected of them, doing their jobs of getting beaten up by the heroes or standing around looking concerned by the bad guys with great aplomb.Interestingly for an action movie the set pieces do not really stand out. I do not think that this is because they are not any good, but more because the cast are so great that when you leave you think about them more than the stunts. Yet I know I've watched an action movie, it FEELS like an action movie. The stunts are all good, the fight scenes are enjoyable and the gun battles suitably explosive. But when you have two actors who have won Oscars and one who has been nominated four times you have to expect some distractions from the F-18s, explosions and gun-toting sociopaths. I mean that in a good way.Every now and then one of the cast will come out with some blinding lines, the kind which seem designed simply to be spliced into trailers. A few examples are: ""Now Womack, you're between The Rock, and a hard case."" ""What's it gonna take to equip a flight of F-18s with thermite plasma within the next 36 hours?"" ""An act of God."" And my personal favorite: ""Get the Pentagon. And call the San Francisco Office. It seems Alcatraz was just reopened."" Saying that The Rock is one of the best action movies made in the 90s seems like faint praise when one of it's main rivals consisted of Keanu Reeves on a fast moving bus. But it really is a good film, with all the right parts in all the right places. Shame it hasn't got a bunny too.",The Rock
217,Cyniphile,The stupid explosion-based action of yore just cant compete with the stupid CGI retina-orgy action of now.,3,17 July 2014,"Part of the Criterion Collection apparently, must be because it's in the category of ""so bad it's good"" because it is exceptionally bad/goodNot all movies need to be brainy and existential, but do they really need to be so stupid they are baffling? I guess I have hard time shutting off, a hard time trying not to take it seriously. Was it made to be serious? If so then MB must think we're all f-ing retarded. Die Hard was good, this is like, campy, with all the brain eating chemicals, and Nick Cage as perhaps his very very worst, very setty sets, lots of dry-ice smoke.

220,LostInFilmUK,Alcatraz Island has been taken over,8,16 February 2013,"Story/Plot - Alcatraz Island has been taken over by a group of marines led by General Francis Xavier Hummel. They also have taken 81 tourists who were on the island as hostages. He is using these hostages as his leverage in his bid to make the government pay benefits to those who have lost loved ones in secret military operations. His wife died recently and this pushed him far over the edge, hence the hostage taking.An FBI biochemist whose partner has just announced that she is pregnant gets the call that Alcatraz is now under terrorist control. His name is Stanley Goodspeed. Stanley discovers that the general has a selection of deadly warheads containing a gas called VX. The general has threatened to use these nukes on American soil unless his demands are met.Luckily Stanley nows how to disarm these nukes. The only down side is that he doesn't know his way around Alcatraz island.This is where John Patrick Mason comes in handy. An ex MI5 or 6 operative, John is the only person to have ever escaped from Alcatraz so is the best suited man for the job. Although John is currently in prison for supposedly stealing the personal files of ex president Hoover. However John even though he would love to see the FBI fail he joins forces with Stanley to put an end to the generals terrorism.Together John and Stanley enter Alcatraz island with a team of highly trained US Navy Seals. As the move through the prison facility the seal team are killed, leaving John and Stanley to finish this themselves.Will they reach the hostages and free them, will they neutralize the bombs and take down the general and his men??The answer is .........................watch the film to find out.My verdict - Nicholas Cage as Stanley and Sean Connery as John make a perfect pair.

Mason (Sean Connery), is the only person who ever escaped alive, pulled out of Max security to get them in, he is played very well by Connery. Smart, arrogant and full of one-liners you're never quite sure about him.Once in Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), has to disarm them. A chemistry superfreak Goodspeed is way out of his depth and has no idea of what to do in a combat situation, played incredibly believably by Cage this is the character we like the most.

After this film, the names just never sold me anymore.The Rock was a decently executed and produced film. It was not the best action film ever, nor the best written action film, and not even close to the best directed action film, but on the whole, the film worked and had flow. The action scenes actually made a little sense, so the audience knew what was happening. Even the side characters in this film had more depth than any of the cast members from the Transformers films, and any other Michael Bay film for that matter.Thank God, this was not littered with female sex objects throughout. Nicholas Cage's girlfriend was really the only female in the film, and her screen time was quite short.Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery run with this film and actually look like they're having fun with their characters. Ed Harris has a decent performance. John Spencer surprises me as an actor who shows up in this film, and others like Cop Land and The Negotiator, and then basically quit films and dove into his most pivotal screen role in the television drama The West Wing. I thought his character in The Rock was entertaining, but still couldn't believe the same person was playing Leo McGarry on a great television drama (The West Wing was great in seasons 1, 2, 3, and half of 4). John Spencer passed away in the middle of the final season of The West Wing.Anyhow, back to The Rock; overall entertaining film, and probably the only Michael Bay film I liked.",The Rock

228,Benjy,The Best Action Movie of the 90s,9,22 July 1999,"Michael Bay is quickly establishing himself as a director of some standing in the Summer blockbuster market. The Rock is his second feature, the first being the hugely enjoyable if not particularly intellectual Bad Boys. He has since also gone onto direct the similarly enjoyable if completely brain dead Armageddon. The Rock however, is light years ahead of either of those two films. Not only is the action fantastic but unusually for this type of film, the characterisation is well explored and to some extent believable. I'm a great fan of all the main actors, Nick Cage, Sean Connery, Michael Beihn and particularly Ed Harris who is on great form here. Harris is the villain we can identify with and to extents feel sympathy for. He is an honourable man who firmly believes what he is doing is right. The real villains here are the politicians. Alcatraz makes for a wonderful setting and the sets are atmospheric while keeping that claustrophobic feeling.With the Rock, Michael Bay can stand comfortably alongside that other master of the Summer blockbuster, Barry Sonnenfeld.",The Rock

Nicolas Cage is good in this role. And of Course Michael Biehn is brilliant in this role, probably the best film he's done to date. The ROCK is crammed with explosions, shootouts, a fantastic car chase too. The Music score to the film is absolutely fantastic, and really makes the film a great success.

That said, I found this movie entertaining. Perhaps that is because I don't watch this type of movie, so I am not going to see it as a collection of clichés, as one commentator remarked.The key, of course, was Sean Connery. There is wonderful irony in learning he is one of the great British secret agents, yet has been a prisoner for decades. It is almost like learning Superman is still alive, but squirreled away in Guantanamo.More precisely, Connery's character is reminiscent of Patrick McGoohan's The Prisoner. If only the series could be revived with Connery in the lead! At any rate, I am a great fan of Connery, as an actor. Cage, he needs to be in the right role, and this fits him fine. The two together have an interesting chemistry.So it is watchable, even if you don't watch this type of movie.",The Rock

Michael Biehn is the best in this movie.  (He should've had a bigger role. Seriously.)  SEE THIS MOVIE, ACTION FANS!  10/10",The Rock
234,eb-77766,One of the greatest action movies ever,10,6 November 2020,"Undoubtedly one of my all time favorites.It doesn't take itself too seriously and if you look for complete believability this is not for you.But the soundtrack, the plot and the actors all make it very, very special. When I first watched it (in the late 90's) it mostly struck me what the villains were fighting for and that there are a lot of greyzones in this movie.Watched it again tonight and it was as good as I remembered but I have to admit that Ed Harris and Sean Connery (RIP) stole the show. Nic Cage was decent as well but the other two made the movie.Will definitely watch it again some day",The Rock
235,Mac-40,***1/2,10,23 October 1998,"I'm sick to death of action movies with chase scenes, big guns, weapons of mass destruction, and huge bodycounts.  But this movie has all of those things.  So why did I enjoy it so much?  Because the director Michael Bay managed to take all those elements that make up an action movie and polish them to a gleaming shine.When I watch this movie, I get a sense of excitement that is rarely found in movies today.  There are lots of movies out there with just as much, if not more action than 'The Rock'.  But for some reason, 'The Rock' is by far more exciting and entertaining than all those other action flicks.  And the villain is great.  He's bad but not too bad.  I hate it when I see a villain who so evil, that you almost know what his next move is going to be.  If you know what he's gonna do, where's the suspense?I also like Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage as a team.  They make an interesting combo.  We have a nerd who specializes in chemicals who is a major wuss and then in the end is a hero, and then we have a hardass who is also a genius who gets a little soft by the end.  They could fight crime!!It also has its funny moments.  Every movie needs a funny moment.  If it doesn't, the movie will get boring, because there is no break from the violence and action.  A movie sometimes needs a little humor to break the ice.In the end, this movie is near the top of my list.  It has a serious plotline and is very exciting during the action scenes, but is also a lot of fun when things calm down.  It's one of my favourites.  We'll probably never see a movie with as much excitement ever again.  Oh well.  Looks like it's back to old family vacation videos.",The Rock
236,smoothie-4,an all time great,10,14 February 1999,"i was pleased to see that the rock doesn't depend TOO much on guns,missiles and brawlin. ed harris does well as a marine who has tired of the government draggin its feet on giving restitution to the soldiers he has lost during his tours of duty. his only option he sees is to hold san francisco ransom with nervegas missiles or pay several million toward his cause. cage is also well suited as a lab rat recruited by the feds to help bring down ed harris and his hired mercs.sean connery like ed harris also has a dinosaur sized bone to pick with the feds from being jailed for 30 years without a trial for having evidence the g'ment wants hidden.last but not least,lovely vanessa marcil is cages soon to be wife who has just told him of their expected child.although her part in the film is not very large,it only makes you wanna jump through the screen and do the ""grab you cha cha cha"" with her when she does appear. only one person seems to have not enjoyed this film that i saw.perhaps he too has been screwed by the government had has yet to hold a city ransom and meet his demands.oh well.",The Rock
237,itsparsley,Michael Bays best film to date,7,21 February 2009,"The Rock is one of the best action films of the 90's. A great cast, excellent concept, and slick polished look put this movie at the top of its league. This is Michael Bays best film to date (as of now Transformers 2 has not come out, so we'll see if that changes). The cool thing about The Rock is that it manages to win over many who don't care for action movies. It spends plenty of time developing its characters and doesn't rush into things too quickly. The payoff is more than anyone could ask for and there is a decent amount of comedy that doesn't get in the way of the intensity. The Rock is not meant only for the action fan bases but for anyone interested in a quality adrenaline rush.",The Rock

The action was amazing, and the movie was never boring. There were extremely funny lines in this movie, which lighten up the movie so it is not that serious which makes it even better. The best part is the crazy car chase, through the streets of San Francisco, and the amazing explosion with the street car.",The Rock
241,Leonidos,My favorite action movie of all time.,8,10 December 2000,"At first glance and especially according to it's trailer The Rock appears at first to be the generic shoot-em-up, explosion laden, Swiss-cheese plot, mindless action film.  Fortunately, why there is no shortage of action, the film spends enough time with it's characters that is also a half way decent movie.  Nicholas Cage is an FBI chemical weapons specialist.  Sean Connery is the British SAS officer who once escaped from the famed prison.  Ed Harris is the Marine general who is tired of his men being ignored by the Pentagon. (possible spoilers ahead)  Major Hummel (Harris), with the aid of some Marines, hijacks a bunch of chemical weapons rockets which he then places on Alcatraz island with the cover of a large number of tourist hostages.  Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) is called in for his expertise and John Mason (Connery)is given a reprieve from his 30 year prison sentence due to his extensive knowledge of the island prison's inner sanctum.  From here the story moves through mason's short escape from custody, but just long enough to visit his long-lost daughter.  Michael Biehn, my favorite underrated actor, makes an appearance as the leader of the SEAL team sent to free the prison.  Even though the SEAL's are predictably wiped out it is done quite plausibly and Mason and Goodspeed become a mismatched duo that is all that stands between Hummel's rockets and San Francisco.  The rest of the movie is Goodspeed and Mason running around fighting off Marines and disabling rockets.  While we don't agree with his methods the audience (and even the SEAL commander) sympathize with Hummel.  All in all a fun movie with great action sequences that manages to maintain plausibility and a decent plot.

This is the kind of bubble gum pop-rock entertainment with gratuitous violence every single mainstream viewer is waiting for. Big deal if you only watch independent movies. This flick was properly made and genuinely exciting.Adrenaline-pumping, interesting, and just genuinely solid, this movie has great sound effects, visual effects, proper acting, a decent story and bedazzling camera use.Michael Bay has kind of made a whole lot of bad movies after this perfectly entertaining work.

But to think that this same General (who we find is indeed an honorable man) would actually poise the rockets at a city of millions of civilians is utterly unbelievable.The idea that Mason (Connery) would know all of the premises as well as he did, AND REMEMBER the tunnels where he spent three days ""in the dark"" in such detail, is also beyond belief.The actions of Hummel's cohorts in the last few scenes is also unbelievable.Well, I could continue, but in summary the film could have been much better, had it not lacked so much fundamental credibility.But all in all, worth the $.99 rental cost...",The Rock

It has thrilling fast-paced action and music really is great (I got the sound track shortly after) though people in my country are abusing it in all sorts of commercials and programs.This movie details a bunch of navy seals lead by General Hummel (Ed Harris) that take control over Alcatraz, otherwise known as The Rock, so they can force the US government to pay benefits to all the families of the soldiers who died in the wars. Now it's up to another team of navy seals lead by ex-con and the only one to escape Alcatraz, Jhon Mason (Sean Connry) and the ""Chemical super-freak"" Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage) to stop them. So the team gets in (quite marvelously) and all hell breaks loose when everyone in the team is killed except Mason and Goodspeed, so now they have to resolve the situation on their own.I have a classification for all sorts of media that I call ""Cosmic Meaning"", where something impacts me on many levels. This one didn't got in very high but it surely got in. It's a great action movie and if I am not mistaken it's Cage's first action flick, and he does a great job, I tell you.Sean Connry does great as a prisoner who needs to get them into The Rock and so does Nicolas Cage considering this is his first action role.

When I first sat down to watch this movie at the age of 12, I was satisfied with what I was seeing. After the movie ended, I place the DVD back in the box and completely forgot about it. One year later, I would re-watch it and completely fall in love with it.The Rock tells the story of a retired army general who steals a lot of deadly weapons and then sets up his own mini military base in Alcatraz (AKA. The Rock) The Government is soon aware of this and sends in a full SEALS team, along with an FBI chemist (Cage) and an ex-convict of Alcatraz who happened to work in the British Intelligence (Connery) Chessy, Check. Over the top, Check. Awesome, double check.This movie will leave you at the edge of your seat. Not only does it have some of the best Hollywood action scenes of all time, it also has one of the GREATEST action actors in the history of cinema: Michael Biehn. Yes, you heard right. I think he is the main reason why I praise this movie so much. Not only does he deliver a brilliant (as always) performance but he also says some of the best b-movie lines of all time.Besides Biehn, this movie is pure greatness. If you by are a person who enjoys nice action flicks, then you will find The Rock amazing.

Director Michael Bay always gives the audience too much to digest at once like in ""Armageddon"" but here he gives the audience just enough. The car chase through the streets of San Francisco is one of all time best car chases it is amazing. This film also features strong performances from an A-list cast including Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, and Ed Harris. This film shows it's humane side in the characters actions.

Big enough to be one of, if not, the best action movies I have ever seen!  Ed Harris made a perfect patriotic bad guy.  Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery made a perfect match, and it made me laugh.  Cage played the wimp, and Connery played the tough guy, and it worked perfectly.  This movie based around a hostage situation, any hostage type story always drives me into it, but doesn't always end well.  This one did.  I enjoyed every moment, and that's why I gave it a rating of 10/10.  If I had any complaint for this movie, it would be to get rid of that white, hair-slicked-back, mustache guy.

258,nbarlow,The apex of the Bruckheimer action pic,8,24 March 2005,"If 'Top Gun' is the film that defined the Bruckheimer formula, 'The Rock' is the movie that uses all the elements to best effect, before things got too out-of-hand (and too loud!) with Armageddon (and don't ask me what happened with Pearl Harbour...). Everything is there - slow-mo shots of people looking heroic, wailing guitars, big explosions, seemingly impossible task.For an action film, all the main characters are surprisingly well developed, and none of the actors waste the opportunity. Ed Harris is the perfect choice to play the fallen hero baddie, and it was an inspired move to cast Sean Connery as basically an aged James Bond - he seems to enjoy himself too. But the film belongs to Nic Cage, who not only delivers more hilarious lines than i can count, but also comes across as a likable, believable character. The interactions between him and Connery are better than can be found in 99% of 'buddy movies'.The balance between tension and all-out action is about right, and both are well executed. The chase through San Francisco deserves special mention.Personally, i marginally prefer 'Top Gun', but that's in a kind of semi-ironic way, since it's so cheesy. The Rock is an action film i'm not ashamed to say i like.",The Rock
259,stageneral,Why is this rated so highly?,4,10 October 2016,"I don't look at IMDb until after I've seen a movie, but it's pretty rare that the IMDb rating is far off from what I would rate (or at least in the same general goodness or badness range). This is apparently one of those rare cases, though. I had to double check that I pulled up the right title when I saw a rating of 7.4 (at least at the time of this writing).I honestly can't understand what people see here. It's over 2 hours long, and I was watching the clock after the first hour, hoping it was getting near the end. I mean, it's a light enough action ride - I was leaning towards rating it a ""5"", but then the number of things that bothered me just kept mounting, and I finally decided ""4"" was more appropriate. Here's some of those things (I don't intend any significant spoilers, but clicked the spoiler alert just in case):The movie couldn't seem to decide whether it was a gritty war drama (lots of scowling, shooting, and F-bombs), or a slightly tongue-in-cheek action movie (comic relief characters, trying-to-be-witty dialogue). Heck, it even seemed like Nicolas Cage couldn't decide either, because he bounced back and forth between the two.Similarly, a fair amount of carnage during the shooting scenes, but Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery dove, walked, or swam away from everything, no matter how many people were shooting, or how big the explosive device, or how far their bodies were thrown.The characters were wooden and stereotypical. A flamboyant gay hair stylist? Some ""Sir, yes sir!"" Marines, the wronged ex-con, the never-been-in-the-field agent, the trolley driver, ...The plot was predictable and clichéThe drawn out shoot-em-up, crash-em-up sequences. I haven't seen so many cars trashed in a chase scene since the Blues Brothers. And geez, that Humvee didn't even get a broken headlight.In short, it was just one cliché scene after another, strung together over a tired and predictable story line. OK, I watched it in 2016. Maybe it was fresh in 1996 when it came out, but I find that hard to believe.",The Rock
260,dave_472,Great action film!!!,8,20 June 2005,"This was a fantastic film that should be seen by all. I am an action-film fan, and this was by far one of the greatest action films I have ever seen. With great special effects and action, great acting, and a comic-book style story that is intriguing in all its aspects, ""The Rock"" should be seen by all. Ed Harris plays an angry, determined ex-General from the U.S. military who fought in many wars and was respected by many people from high positions in the government. However, he has radical views and believes that the U.S. government never supported American soldiers who fought overseas and returned home and received no rewards for their sacrifice. To prove his point, Harris directs a group of former Marines who steal several chemical missiles from a weapons depot and plant them in an isolated spot that would be hard to invade: Alcatraz Island! What better place for a base of operations than a deserted island with an unused prison? Harris and his thugs threaten to launch chemical missiles at San Francisco Bay (which could kill hundreds of thousands instantly) unless he and other former marines are paid $100 million by the U.S. government. Since when does our government bow to the demands of terrorists? Whether global jihadists or angry domestic troublemakers, negotiation with the enemy is not an option...Nicholas Cage is a young FBI chemical-weapons expert who is sent along with a group of soldiers as well as Sean Connery (a life-long prisoner who is sent in with the soldiers because he knows the layout of Alcatraz, having been the ""only prisoner there to ever escape""). They plan to stop Harris from firing his missiles but they are met inside the prison by an ambush of heavy fire (remember, the ""terrorists"" here are well-trained, decorated former U.S. soldiers) and many are killed. Alone and planning to save many innocent lives, Cage and Connery plot to fight until they win over the prison's occupiers and save America from bowing to terrorist demands....

Why? Everyone in the world knew here they were and what they were doing.A man is kept in prison for 30 years with no charges and no convictions and no one notices?

Standout performances come from Michael Biehn and Ed Harris, but just about everyone who has a line in the film is cast perfectly. The action itself is excellent.

263,muertos,Exhilarating action.,8,29 January 2005,"The Rock is an exceptionally well put-together action film that leaves you completely breathless. It's not high art, but it may be one of the more evolved examples of the 80s/90s action blockbuster, and it's certainly a lot of fun.The whole plot is merely a mechanism to buddy up Sean Connery as a grizzled but still tough ex-antiterrorist operative and Nicholas Cage who plays (tongue in cheek) a lab-bound FBI agent. Ed Harris makes a terrific bad guy as the mad general armed with some really icky chemicals. Why does he choose to take over a prison instead of, for example, hide a VX rocket under a populated street and threaten to trigger it by remote control? Well, because it's in the script! Now carefully add the set pieces. A crumbling old fortress full of lots of pieces of twisted metal where bad guys can impale themselves on. A mine car run obviously designed by the same LSD-tripping mining engineer who designed the one in Indiana Jones. A furnace that belches flame and swishes various sharp metal implements at you every few seconds. (This is the most fun!) If The Rock was a video game it'd be Doom II. Still, it's very exciting to see Connery back in his old form, and Cage bringing up the rear. Every scene crackles with tension and suspense, but you get the feeling it's not totally serious, as there's a comic edge to a lot of the film, especially the dialogue.This movie could only be made in the Clinton era. It disdains politicians in that oh-so-familiar Hollywood way, but it carries a certain amount of venom toward the military mindset as well, portraying Marines as homicidal testosterone-flushed automatons. I can't see a Hollywood producer getting near a script with that kind of subtext today. But, overall, The Rock is a good time, cheap harmless fun.",The Rock

. hummel then argues with his men to abbort the mission while redirecting the rocket to detonate at the sea he is then confronted by darrow and frye and is wounded with baxter being killed he then tells godspeed where the last rockets are before dying the members of the marines Darrow and Faye presume their plan but instently fail as soon as mason and godspeed confront them separately with godspeed tricking darrow into being pushed out by the rocket and making him fall into being impaled by a long pole and pushing one of the poison gas pearls into frye's mouth as well as mason beating throwing Seargent crisp of a building and into crashed broken objects killing him. then jets are sent to bomb the base but godspeed signals the threat as over while holding two flairs but the jets stil drop one bomb causing a mass explosions throwing godspeed in the water with mason rescuing him they then part ways with godspeed faking masons death by saying he died in the explosion it ends with godspeed marrying his fiance carla and then go steal microfirm from the church. this is one of the best movies of 1996 and the best 90s action films it has lots of well filmed action and everything about this movie is good it is without doubt a classic the scnes are shot well and the cast did a very good job with nicolas cage playing as a specialist very well and sean connery playing as a spy agent and ed harris playing as a marine commander everybody did a terrific job with their roles the acting was great, the production design was great, the cinematography was great and the special effects were good Michael bay may well be the martin Scorsese of action movies he Definetly deserved an oscar for best director nomination for this cinematic Goldfest and he could very well have recieved the nomination but lost to anthony Minghella for the english patient Michael bay was definitely robbed an oscar for this masterpiece he is the king of gold, a talented genius, an amazing auteur, an awesome superstar, and a very smart and intelligent artist or whatever you all want to call him he is all of those things and this awesome movie proves he is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time along with, peter Jackson, James cameron, Steven Spielberg, john ford, spike lee, billy wilder, William Wyler, Francis ford Coppola, martin Scorsese, Joel and Ethan Coen, Quentin Tarantino, tim burton, george cukor, alfred hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick Howard hawks, George Stevens, Fred Zinneman, Joseph l Mankiewicks, Werner Herzog, Robert Zemeckis, Clint Eastwood, Sergio Leone, Christopher Nolan, Paul Thomas Anderson Ridley Scott, and many more of those terrifically talented artists and to me he is so good directing that he is worth comparing to other talented people who do other Professions famous or not all that are superstars with great talents and deserving every ounce of strong praise and again with this work of art he deserves more credit and praise than ever and also give thanks to jerry Bruckheimer for producing the film as well as don Simpson who died while this was being released after this is when Michael bay began replacing Simpson as co producer of the next films he made with jerry Bruckheimer they make a good team as always when they worked together and are responsible for the most beloved blockbusters of all time, its no wonder why this received widespread acclaim from most critics and from all of the audiences it is so great of a movie that even bay haters love it Alot. the rock rules it is a fantastic movie that deserves a score of 100 on rotten tomatoes, a Cinemascore grade of A+ and an 8.8/10 on imdb it is for sure the citizen kane of action films i loved it so much and thank you Michael bay and jerry bruckheimer for this amazing masterpiece.",The Rock
267,cjbaker-45009,Sean Connery - James Bond Swearing????,10,5 March 2021,"Where to start....this is one of my all time favourites which also reinforces my debate Tony or Ridley. Ridley epic Oscar winning Titan for which the movies deserve but you have to be in the mood for or Tony Scott....many titles which can be watched and enjoyed time and time again. As you may have read before The Rock is one of those titles to me that if channel hopping and stumble across (no matter which scene) the remote is thrown across the room and I know what I'm watching now. Casting and Soundtrack are vital components of a successful Movie and The tragically late yet still great Sir Sean connery with the still good Nicholas Cage, Michael Beihn, Ed Harris, David Morse, Tony Todd, Stewart Francis, John Spencer and William Forsythe absolutely slay this film with Michael Bays truly last gift to cinema before succumbing to sell out money spinners; put that together with a soundtrack from John Williams equal the great and emotionally intelligent Hans Zimmer and you've got a winner. The Rock debuted in 1996 and I watched it 3 times in a week! and if I ever stumble across it then it's what I'm watching and will make a point of watching it 3 or 4 times a year! Exceptionally quotable......""Your best? losers whine about doing their best,,,"" an out and out action movie with unlikely heroes and yet still comparable to Die Hard where you find yourself not only sympathising but empathising with the ""Villain"" It's got Action, humour, poignancy, tangible values, evokes debate, you won't notice the running time of 2hrs 16mins as it absolutely grips you from start to finish. Once you've seen it tell me you don't see a bit of Stanley Goodspeed, General Frank Hummel or Captain John Mason in you. Highly Recommended.",The Rock
268,knuddelholic,swinging back and forth between silly action and serious plot,5,20 December 2002,"When I read through all this former comments then I see a lot of hip, hip hooray on all the manly behavior and the heroic stuff from the soldiers and how more or less realistic it was. I don't want to go into this part too much as I just find it way overrated. All in all is this movie an entertaining action flick. But the movie gets definitely saved from the good actors and not the action scenes that were sometimes just quite ridiculous. The writer of this action scenes and the script writer for them should better write silly stories like Indiana Jones as many were as unrealistic as those of the Indy movies.Some of the car scenes tried a bit too hard to be cool that they appeared instead silly and ruined the serious mood of the story (e.g. the cable car which was flying like the Bus from Speed like someone placed a huge charge under it.). Another quite silly thing was the whole Dungeon&Dragons like construction, which was supposed to be under Alcatraz. That reminded me from the first moment more of Temple of Doom of the Indy series and again was quite contra productive for the serious plot.Amazing how much activity in form of active leaking gas pipes (or whatever those flamethrowers were) and moving machinery there was under a building complex, which is supposed to be out of order. An old, complex maze combined with a bunch of booby traps from Ed's man had became that part of the movie much better as this extreme cheap excuse for the ex-con Connery to be back in that prison.That all gave sometimes the impression like the director didn't know if he wanted to make a tense thriller or just a fast paced action flick with A-Team or Indy qualities. Maybe the writers for the excellent plot and the action scenes should have talked more with each other.Personally I had preferred less silly action scenes and action sets and the movie had reached easily much better qualities like ""Crimson Tide"".But the actors really save the day in many ways as they are much more believable as the described scenes. And the best of the movie is still Hans Zimmer's soundtrack which produces more atmosphere for the whole plot as the action scenes are, except the so often described shower room scene which was good. No wonder that this soundtrack was VERY often used for later trailers for all kinds of movies.Without the described silly action scenes above would I give the movie maybe a 7 or 8 out of 10. But so the silly scenes cost something and reduce the movie to an action flick, which is barely above the average as it does swing too often between lighthearted and serious atmosphere. So I say 5.5 out of 10. That plot idea deserved a better action scriptwriter.",The Rock
269,Ryno_II,One of the best actions films ever!!!,10,12 April 2004,"-MEDIOCRE SPOILERS-
The Rock is a true classic because it is so well written for a modern action movie.  The characters, the plot and the battles are all at the best they could be.  I did have a small problem with the ending.  The film's writers made up a 'truth' to a real-life historical conspiracy but the truth is never fully revealed in the movie.   The hero(Sean Connery) and the villain(Ed Harris) are told about very deeply.  The story reveals tragic events of there pasts that made them into very interesting characters.  The story itself is a lot better than the average ""kill the terrorists, save the hostages"" scenario.  The movie has a lot of surprising turns, such as the villain turning good and saving innocent people from being killed by his own men, and then his own men kill him because of that.  The action sequences are fairly well planed and executed such as one of the most exciting car chases I've ever seen ripping through San Francisco, followed by an explosive assault on Alcatraz island.  The majority of audiences will probably agree that this was the best action movie of 1996. I rate this movie ****/****.",The Rock
270,rshjaggotta,Hostage Situation that needs to be dealt with,9,9 March 2017,This is one of the best ever action movies. Period! Watch for it for Sean Connery and it's amazing background score that will give you goosebumps. Nicholas Cage and Ed Harris give excellent support and set up one of the finest plots that sees a convict help defend a country which has done grave injustice to him,The Rock
271,oliverz-91768,The Rock - 2.5/5,5,27 September 2020,"Is it weird that Tarantino and Sorkin actually were script doctors on this film? Look it up.The Rock is no means a bad movie. I watched it last night and I have to say, it's an interesting film. It stars Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery as two marine corps members who must infiltrate Alcatraz to stop the release of a deadly weapon.It's a fun film full of Michael Bay explosion action. The fight scenes are quite well done. Adrenaline is pumped, people are blown up, and fist fights also ensue. The fights really do make up for the weird problems I will get into soon. If you're a Michael Bay film, this is the ultimate Bay film for you, as it is quite explosive and intense. There's not much subtlety in this film. It's the ultimate movie for one to enjoy when they're bored one night and want a popcorn flick to watch.Now the weirdly bad. I have to address the over-the-top elephant in the room. Nicolas Cage is such a weird force in this movie. He's so over the top. It is Nicolas Cage, but he seems a little out of place. There are a lot of jokes in this movie, but his overacting ""technique"" is a step too far. He doesn't really fit here. While the film is mostly quite serious (although some jokes are fit in between), Cage sticks out like a sore thumb. Yet as out-of-place as Cage may seem, his performance is oddly mesmerizing to watch. When he's onscreen, you watch. When he's shouting, you listen. I have a huge love-hate relationship with his performance. Even as a kid, I found his overacting to be a bit too much. I have nostalgia for his film, and I still can't get over how bizarre Cage is in the role.The writing is so bizarre too. While mostly serious, there are so many jokes that don't make sense. And they always revolve around Cage. There is a joke about a famous Elton John song at the end of the film. And it really takes you out of it. That's my problem with the movie. It sometimes doesn't takes
itself seriously. Normally that's a compliment, but in this case I can't take this film seriously either. The premise is a bit grim, and yet Cage is cracking jokes endlessly. It's difficult for me to accept both Cage's jokes and the grim situation the characters are in.The pacing is terrible too. The exposition takes way too long, and the ending kind of drags on. The strongest section of the film is definitely its action packed second act. The second act is intense and suspenseful, while still maintaining Bay's signature in-your-face action.Finally, the film feels like a video game. Now that's a pretty great thing, as it leads to some excellent Bay action. But it's also a terrible thing, because the music suffers from it. Or adds to it I suppose. Some scenes feel like levels in a game, and the music adds to the effect. The score is some gaming soundtrack in this film. Sometimes it feels like less of a film and more like a game. But sometimes it allows for the mind blowing action to run its course.Maybe I'm a bit too serious. I probably can't let loose. But there are so many weird writing choices involving humor, along with bizarre overacting, that's it's really difficult for me to accurately assess a score for this film. I'm going to give it a 5. It's not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it's still really weirdly flawed.",The Rock

273,Facade,When will the bad guys learn?,9,25 June 2000,"First off, I enjoyed this movie. As usual, if I had directed it, it would certainly have been better! The actors give very good performances, and the action scenes are exciting, and well shot, even if the locations are a little unbelievable. (Is there really a vast abandoned mining complex beneath Alcatraz? Why do all furnaces have unnecessary cogs and pulsed flames, like the crusher in Galaxy Quest?).My main gripe is with Ed Harris. Why on earth does he give the government so much time? They could effect an electronic transfer in minutes, so 4 hours would have been ample. Mind, this would rather have shortened the film!On a technical note, is that really how chemical weapons are constructed? BAN THEM NOW: THE RISK OF DISASTER IS TOO GREAT! The bomblets would never survive being carried to the launcher, never mind being fired!Facade",The Rock
274,sirensotitan,My favorite action movie of all time!,10,18 April 2001,"I've watched this movie too many times to count and I'm always ready to watch it again.  It combines everything that makes a great action movie. The three top-billed actors do an extraordinary job of taking on the roles of Stanley Goodspeed, John Patrick Mason, and General Francis X. Hummel.  We are offered Nicholas Cage in one of the few action roles that he triumphs in, as Goodspeed.  He may not be the typical tough skinned action hero, but he responds to the threats with a realistic amazement. 
Add Ed Harris in an uncharacteristic action film role as Hummel and it gets better.  We are given a United States General as a villain which leaves us asking, ""Why is he doing this?"".  Like many action movies, one would think that this is where the action simmers down and a bit of drama takes over. In this case, it does turn dramatic, but with the great work of Harris, each line is delivered with fierce conviction that the action truly never stops.Finally, we are given Sean Connery as ex-SAS operative, John Patrick Mason. It could have been a role with no more than one dimension, but that's not what you'll find here!  He is a mythical character who accompanies Goodspeed, and as they take on the evil element, they find that they learn a little bit more about themselves thanks to each other.",The Rock
275,Tivor X-09137,Great cast makes this cool action-flick exceptional.,10,11 March 2000,"This is easily one of the most satisfying action flick of all time.  The plot was decent, action was intense (it's got one of the most memorable car chase scene), and the music is one of the coolest ever.  But the real reason why I give this movie a perfect score of 10 is its wonderful cast.The rather far-fetched motive of General Hummel was so well rendered with conviction by Ed Harris that the audience won't care that it's the lamest excuse anyone has ever come up with to hold a whole city hostage to a deadly chemical weapon.  I mean, the cause itself is noble, but threatening to kill millions with the VX gas??  Even for a bluff, it was pretty lame.  But did I care?  Ed Harris is so overflowing with authority and charisma that I might follow his orders even without the promise of million bucks pay.And the chemistry between Nick Cage and Sean Connery is magical; you just gotta love the dialogue between the two.  All the one-liners and witty comebacks that could sound extremely cheesy by lesser actors are delivered to perfection.  And that little remark about John Mason (Sean Connery) being trained by the best -- the British Intelligence -- brought back the memories of James Bond.  Gotta love it.Even the supporting cast was wonderful at their roles.  The mercenary marines were especially cool in their crazed bloodlust.  And Commander Anderson, played by Michael Biehn, was simply amazing.  I mean, there wasn't a single lame actor who took me out of my suspended disbelief.It ain't a movie that'll make you cry or think or whatever.  This is a pure entertainment movie.  A great action movie cooked to perfection.  Action flicks don't get much better than this.",The Rock

True, I am a bit biased because Sean Connery is my favorite actor.  I thought Nick Cage played a wonderful innocent little bio-chemist who always works in a little couped up room with his chemistry set.  So when he is actually put into a violent confrontation, you truly believe he is terrified.  One of the best scenes is when Nick was forced to shoot and kill one of the mercenaries in order to save Mason (Connery) from being killed.  The excellent blend of slow motion and music during this scene leaves the viewer excited, yet almost startled at the same time because this is the first time Cage has ever harmed anyone!

Its jingoistic bullshit in the extreme, and the lines they come out are cringe worthy.The actual plot is so stupid I'd need about 50 pages to go into it properly; why the hell would Ed Harris go to all the trouble of stealing VX gas when a few normal bombs planted around the city would have the same effect(for blackmail anyway)? Why the hell would they set up on a ISLAND, letting everyone know where they are, so escape would be nigh on impossible? Its SO dumb, that it makes the film unwatchable.

A high testosterone, explosive, funny action film, that puts other action films to shame.The thing I really love about ""The Rock"", is the fact that it's got a really clever and original plot, greatly written dialogue and touching characters, yet we are still entertained by the countless thousands of bullets and enormous explosions that put Hiroshima to shame, that are unleashed within this film. Events unfold from the word ""go"" here. We instantly know something is being planned, and are hooked to the screen within minutes. Not a dull moment goes by where we aren't on the edge of our seats, admiring spectacular scenes of suspense, and most importantly, the story is plausible and cleverly chronological, with two great subplots and amazing twists.We are presented with characters who we can all sympathise with them, whether they're baddies or goodies! (Sorry to use Childish terminology) Every character has a reason for being there, and we learn their histories through the film. The writers have most importantly kept the characters Human! It's too easy when writing Action to throw characters into the film that have no heart or emotion what so ever. However in this film, we even see guilt and remorse from the baddies. This really gets us thinking ethically about who's side we are on, as we know the baddies have a very good decision for their ""terrorism"" but what they are planning could, in some people's eyes, be worse. It's very cleverly done.Some great emotions and facial/vocal expressions were bought faithfully across by a brilliant cast, including Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery. Perhaps there is a small bit of over acting from Cage, but there is nothing wrong with that. It's better than underacting. Thanks to amazing directing my Michael Bay, each cast member knew his character very well.Accompanied by an epic track by Oscar-winning Hans Zimmer, the spectacular array of brilliant sound effects, well crafted dialogue, and brilliant directing is weaved tremendously together with clever and sharp editing.

FBI recruit their top chemical weapons specialist Goodsped (Cage) to help defuse the rockets. They also seek the help of Mason (Connery), a prisoned spy who knows all the government's dirty secrets.

What makes this different to other films is that the actors are superb and there are some great one-liners. I have seen this film about 10 times and it still is great. It has an unusual setting (Alcatraz)but this also makes the film work. It is directed by Michael Bay (Pearl Harbour,Armageddon) and has his usual comic touches.If you liked this film try seeing Con Air and Face/Off (both starring Nicolas Cage) I really would recommend this brilliant film! 9/10",The Rock
292,RichT3,One of the BEST action movies ever made,9,29 November 2001,"This was the first Michael Bay movie I had the privilege of watching on the big screen, and it is still his best (closely following by Armageddon and Pearl Harbour). It has everything you could want from a big-budget action film :- Great story, excellent cast (Sean Connery, Ed Harris, Nic Cage, Michael Bein, David Morse), amazing action sequences, well-integrated comedy moments, and SUPERB direction. The battle scene in the shower-room on Alcatraz is one of the most touching and poignant battle scenes ever filmed, and leaves you close to tears (especially as Mr Harris ""damns"" the Government powers responsible for causing the slaughter of the heroic Navy Seal Crack Insertion Team). Two-and-a-quarter hours of pure entertainment and adrenalin !!!",The Rock
293,face-man,Best action movie of all time!!,9,2 March 2002,This movie is pure testosterone with a huge budget and non stop action. It's highly underrated in my opinion. Everything about the film is great from the awesome action sequences and stunts to the musical score. It is the perfect fun filled movie. The only flaw I can think of is that there weren't any central female characters but this movie was mainly designed for guys I guess. It wasn't designed to win any Oscars but just to provide movie fans with two exciting hours of mayhem and it did just that. Brilliant.,The Rock
294,smobocop,One of the greatest action films ever made!!!!!,10,17 December 2002,"This film is amzing. The actors they picked for the parts in this are perfect.  Sean Connery is the man.  Ed Harris plays the perfect good villain.  And finally michael biehn is in a good movie again(1996).nicholas Cage's best movie i think in the action genre.

296,Vincent Vega-2,One of the best action flicks,8,17 May 1999,"""The Rock"" is one excellent movie. Michael Bay´s direction, the terrific score, nicolas cage, that spectacular chase scene. One of all times best. My favorite part is nic cage waving the flares and the jets passing by him, and dropping the bomb. What a cool movie.",The Rock
297,Buddy-43,Has everything,10,26 July 1999,"I tend to enjoy movies that have loads of stuff in them, if you know what I mean.  Movies with loads of varying characters, exciting action scenes, many different locations, cool settings with loads of possibilities, interesting villains, lots of yelling, one-liners that make you crack up, wickedly cool music, a bit of sex, car chases, helicopters, two-way mirrors, stand-offs, mutinies, hostages, rockets, love, VX gas, revenge, cigars and a bomb disguised as a baby.THE ROCK has it all.  Not only do you get two very different heroes for the price of one, there is also one of the most fascinating bad guys I have ever seen in Ed Harris.  His intentions are not evil or greedy or sadistic or pleasure-seeking like most other film villains but instead, General Hummel merely wants to honour the memory of his forgotten comrades who were killed under his command in Vietnam.  As we are shown in the pre-title sequence, he has tried again and again to get the government to take back the lies told about their deaths to their families and give them compensation.  So, General Hummel is not an evil man.  His intentions are justified. However, what he does next is not so wise.  By taking 81 tourists hostage on Alcatraz Island and threatening to launch poison gas into San Francisco Bay unless reparations are paid, he does not make too many friends.  But the real nasties are his awful henchmen who would like nothing better than to launch the gas and so kill millions of innocent civilians.  One of the best things about this movie is Ed Harris' performance as the troubled General who battles with his conscience.  He is well-balanced by Gregory Sporleder and Tony Todd as the two evil captains who are the real bad guys of the story.So, as well as villains, as I mentioned above, we also have two heroes. They are Nicolas Cage, as the intelligent but weedy Stanley Goodspeed and Sean Connery as the highly dangerous 60-year old convict John Patrick Mason who somehow find themselves in The Rock with the task of stopping the rockets from being launched in time.  Connery and Cage make a superbly funny double act who always seem to be arguing and taking the p**s out of each other while depending on the other's skill in a certain field. Goodspeed's is diffusing the rockets, Mason's is killing the bad guys.The set up is nicely rounded off with a brilliantly watchable array of supporting characters.  Angry FBI director Womack, cool agent Paxton, strict Commander Anderson, loyal Major Baxter and Goodspeed's beautiful girlfriend, Carla.",The Rock
298,kent-35,I loved this action packed movie.,9,27 July 1999,"In my opinion, this was Nicholas Cages' and Michael Bays' last good movie. But it is an excellent movie. Action packed from beginning to end, this movie delivers a believable story and a likable cast. Ed Harris plays the ""villain"", yet he is as likable as any of the ""good"" guys. He is a an army officer who is dissolusioned with the military because of the way it has treated soldiers under his command. The only real ""bad guys"" in this movie are the governmental bureaucrats who have essentially, lied to all of the principle characters in some way or another and a few soldiers who are essentially, mercenaries. Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery are excellent as the team who is chosen to go to ""the rock"" and disable the nuclear weapons the the renegade soldiers have pointed at San Fransisco.All in all, this movie is as exciting as films get.",The Rock
299,diovorez,This movie rocks. (no pun intended),9,5 February 2000,"If you haven't seen this movie, run to your local video rental place and pick up a copy right now! The Rock is hands down one of the best action movies of this decade.The situation: A Disgruntled General from the marines, Francis X Hummel (played by Ed Harris) takes over Alcatraz Island and takes 81 tourists hostage.Sean Connery plays a 60-year-old convict, John Mason, the only man who has ever escaped from The Rock. He reluctantly agrees to lead a Navy Seal team into Alcatraz.Nicolas Cage plays the nerdy but brilliant Dr. Stanley Goodspeed, a chemical weapons specialist for the FBI, a man whose daily life mostly consists of sitting around his desk wasting time. He is assigned to accompany the Navy Seals to the rock, to defuse 15 Guided VX Gas Rockets.This movie not only gives beautiful action sequences, but delivers genious character relationships and drama. Stanley makes a steady transition from being a wimpy nerd to being a ""tough guy."" Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage's scenes of back and forth dialogue are gold.The other thing that makes this movie great is, it's a movie about Alcatraz, yet the producers still found a way to incorporate a spectacular chase scene, including a HumVee a Ferrari, and several cop cars!Did I mention that the movie is produced by the 2 best names in hollywood? Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer are in the commander's seats, making sure this movie didn't stray from excellence.I give it 10 our of 10.",The Rock

The plot is simple, and from the first second till the very last it's very interesting.

302,mccurleybradley,Great movie But...,9,26 October 2021,This is one of the best movies all time imo it has brilliant casting and and a story that is able to benefit from its tone extremely well but sean connery needs to be changed to timothee chalamet and change mr.cage to zendaya to diversify the cast.,The Rock
303,Dolemite_motherfcker,I have yet to see a more recent film that is better than The Rock.,10,17 December 2009,"To describe The Rock in the most reassuring terms: Almost as sensational as Die Hard. That is the calibre of action movie we are looking at here. The production of The Rock was blessed with a $75 million budget, a hard R rating and a veteran movie producer and director Michael Bay has utilised those three assets to their full potential. The Rock is one of the wildest, most breathtaking action movies you will ever see.The Rock shows us the two most beautifully established characters in an action movie since Lethal Weapon. Of course, being an action film The Rock has less dialogue driven scenes than your average movie but that doesn't even matter because the dialogue is so truthful about the characters. The movie also puts a very original spin on the Hollywood terrorist plot. In the end, the main bad guy turns out not be to half as crazy or hypocritical as it first seems and his vicious Cronies turn out be the only real bad guys.So, the plot of the movie: General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris) is angry at the government for their disrespectful treatment of combat veterans who fell in battle and their families. He doesn't like the fact that their families are not compensated and are told lies about what happened to them. He and his Platoon of Marines seize control of a Naval weapons Depot and steal a cache of rockets full of extremely deadly poison gas. Hummel and his Marines then seize control of the former prison island of Alcatraz, take 81 hostages and place the rockets there, pointing them towards San Fransisco. He phones the head of the FBI and tells him that if the US government does not give him $100 million dollars within 24 hours to disperse among the families of all the Marines that he commanded who died in battle and his own men who he brought with him on the mission, he will fire the poison gas missiles at San Fransisco, killing millions of people. The leaders of America's armed forces meet to discuss how to confront the problem. They decide to send in a Navy Seal team to infiltrate the prison. Along with the Seal team they send in the FBI's best chemical weapons expert, Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) who knows how to disarm the rockets and imprisoned British SAS agent John Patrick Mason (Sean Connery), who was held for some time in Alcatraz for stealing a top secret FBI microfilm and not giving up its location and is the only man to have ever escaped. He logically knows how to break into the prison. The team of Navy Seals barely make it inside the prison when things take a dramatic turn for the worse. They are surrounded by General Hummel's Marines in the prison's shower room and mercilessly massacred, but Connery and Cage survive the encounter by staying hidden in the tunnel below. They have less than 15 hours to disarm all the rockets and set up green flares to signal for evacuation before the US Airforce bombs the Island into oblivion.With the exception of a fairly routine car chase, the action scenes in The Rock are all inventive and unique. One of my favourites is when the rogue marines corner Connery and Cage at the end of a mine cart track and they must use all their wits and limited resources to defeat their deadly pursuers. The movie's last handful of bad guys are taken to hell in a spectacular fashion involving such methods as a sphere of poison gas and a rocket. The movie climaxes with what has become one of the most iconic scenes of 1990s action cinema, as our hero played by Nicholas Cage, races out of the lighthouse with his two green flares in a desperate attempt to save himself and the hostages from being blasted into oblivion by an imminent air force carpet bombing.While not achieving the classic status of Die Hard, The Rock is still remembered and respected 13 years on as an elite action movie, one of the finest examples of great action cinema. Coming from someone who has seen plenty of highly praised, ""Important"",""classic"" movies from Citizen Kane to Pulp Fiction, let me say that The Rock is one of the best damn movies ever made.",The Rock
304,H-x-mon,Easily the worst movie of the year,3,4 May 2011,"I mean, I started with titling this review as ""The worst movie ever made"" but then changed it since I realized there are indeed much worse movies. So, alright, it is probably not the worst, probably not even the bottom, eeh..., 100, but it's still pretty bad. I'll list all the ""bads"" in the order of, well, badness:1. The score - horrible, absolutely sordid, I actually had to watch it with subtitles and Pandora on the background 2. Editing - sloppy at best, like that one scene where a certain humvee hits a road pole, head one, and in the next scene the same humvee happily plows through the crowed of bedazzled bystanders. There's many other enjoyable scenes like that when the cutting floor obviously had a party 3. Directing - well, it's not bad in the when it's present 4. Cinematography - they got a lot of grand wide-angle shots but again they spent like $70 mill on it. 5. Nicholas Cage 6. Nicholas Cage is the main character 7. Nicholas Cage survives till the very end 8. Script was just hilarious, I mean, it was probably written for 5th graders 9. Gives you a certain generic feel of distressful creepiness - like, realizing you've been eating a product labeled ""made from natural ingredients"" which was actually made of ground beef. This movie gives you a similar feeling, it is kind of made by people who claim to be filmmakers who in the end turn out to be snake oil salesmen. Kind of like watching good porn, it's almost admirable in it's naive, almost childish attempts, to look like a legitimate film, even though we all know it's all about the double-up scene towards the end.Alright, I admit, it's been pretty mean up to the point, so, I'll mention the good now: 1. They got Sean Connery 2. Sean Connery says: ""I pershonally shink you're an idiot!"" 3. Nicholas Cage almost gets blowen up off the face of the planet.",The Rock
305,Mister-S,Bilge,1,9 July 2007,"What an awful collection of clichés and bilge this is. The characters (using the term loosely) are hysterical and each in possession of several tics of personality. They don't interact, they merely display their own idiosyncrasies with no reference to anyone else. It really is that bad.Like most American films involving the military, there is virtually no indication of any professionalism at all. People lose tempers, shout, go ballistic for no reason and play the maverick which is either the true state of the American military or the Hollywood take.While Sean Connery is competent here, Nicholas Cage is most deservedly not. Perhaps in an attempt to keep up with Connery's professionalism as an actor, Cage shouts all the time and overacts terribly in every scene the two share. The result is Cage looks like an amateur.Don't bother to watch this.",The Rock
306,Fisherandahunter,A very good film!!!!,9,24 March 2005,The Rock was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Sean Connery is one of my favorite actors along with Nicolas cage and Ed Harris. I was however disappointed at how many goofs there was but it was still one of the best movies I have ever seen.It all starts on Alcatrz island with Frank Hummel as a general keeping 81 visitors locked up and demanding 100 million dollars for ransom as coverage to families of soldiers that died in covert operations. If frank does not get his money he threatens to fire rockets armed with VX nerve gas into the heart of San Francisco. Stanley Godspeeds (Nicolas cage) and Mason (Sean Connery) try to find these rockets and try to stop this madness. I give this movie ***** out of *****.,The Rock

It has action from basically beginning to end, a never ending supply of big guns, corny Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery lines that really only they can get away with. Add in Ed Harris and all the other amazing actors that were chosen to play in this movie and it really is the total package! What I believe makes this movie better than other movies similar to it is the depth that each character brings to the table. It's unclear at times who is truly the ""bad guys!"" That makes this movie so much more interesting. The movie came out in 1996 which I believe is around the real turning point in graphics and such. The blood looks like real blood and the explosions look realistic not exaggerated. All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie and it is definitely one that belongs in any action lovers collection!",The Rock

Edge of the seat excitement during the car chase and the climactic shoot-out; laughter when watching Connery and Cage argue back and forth (""Your best? Losers always whine about their best. Winners go home and f#*^ the prom queen!""). What surprised me the most about it though was the movie's ability to make me feel sympathy and affection for the characters. Ed Harris conveys the deep agony of General Hummel's ambiguous actions brilliantly and watching Sean Connery and Clare Forlani as father and daughter together was one of the most touching sequences I had seen in years.

The Rock is an *action* movie. You are supposed to see thing blow up, people shot, cars being crashed. As for the fact that the director changes camera angles often: it adds to the action. It's a boring action movie seeing one shot of an explosion. You want to see the thing being blown up, and then the people's expressions as they run away.To sum up my thoughts: It's an action movie, not a drama. Judge the movie according to its genre.",The Rock

314,K-D,Connery invades San Francisco,9,11 July 2001,"Contains spoilersIf you take Michael Bay, Sean Connery and Hans Zimmer, and mix them together in a big bowl, with a little touch of Alcatraz, what do you get? You guessed right: A slam-bang of an action-thriller. In other words: ""The Rock"".What makes ""The Rock"" a good movie. Of course, you have Sean Connery. But what would have made this movie great without Connery. I think a very important element is the music. Hans Zimmer`s music is so engaging and so full of feelings that it had to leave traces in your mind after seeing this movie. Another important element is the great characters. Almost every character builds up a strong personality during the film, and you feel with them, either they are good or evil. At the end I actually felt more sorry for Ed Harris than I did for Nicholas Cage.Sean Connery is dangerously good at his work, a good example is when he smash half of the city with a stolen car, with Nicholas Cage chasing him.My opinion is that this is one of the best action movies I have seen, so if you haven`t seen this one, you know what movie to watch next... and what music to listen at.",The Rock

This scene is pulsating with potential action until the pivotal moment when all hell breaks loose.  After the gunfire begins, the dramatic music takes hold and all you can do is watch Seal after Seal, go down.  This scene makes so feel proud that we live in a nation where people will sacrifice their lives to protect the innocent people.  After all the bullets are fired, the whole seal team is dead.  The one moment that will forever make me love this movie is when the general says to the camera I did not want this...damn you for forcing me to make this decision.  It was a great moment in the movie because it shows that even though they had to kill them, Ed Harris still thought of the seals as fellow brothers who went down in combat.

Now many would feel that all action movies have an unmotivated ""bad guy"" this film however showed true to life ""villain."" Harris is holding SF and most of the East coast for ransom. Why? Because he feels that America has forgotten the dead war heroes families. Sean Connery was put into the Alcatraz because he was the only one who ever escaped the Rock. An elite team lead by Michael Bien, The Terminator and Tombstone, to save 50 hostages and take out Ed Harris and his henchmen.

320,Hastaman-2,Top Notch Action,10,26 July 1999,"Terrific.  This has got to be my favorite action movie of all time. Director Michael Bay has out-done himself, and it shows.  From beginning to end, the movie is filled with non-stop entertainment.  This is definitely Cage's most likeable role (his new stuff is just crap), and Harris/Connery both do wonderful jobs playing their parts.  Although far fetched, the plot is easy to understand and makes for lots of action.  The car chase and end scene (shootout/bombing) are two memorable scenes in my opinion and alone make the movie worth watching more than once.  But the best part about this movie has got to be the MUSIC!!!!!  This movie's score is the best action score to date.  Although I expected alot coming from 3 very talented composers, I was overwhelmed.  We get more then 10 excellent cues (not joking!) and they all fit their scenes perfectly.

Ed Harris justified the role of brigade general wants to correct the lying in U.S Military. Also the one who played the role of Maj. Anderson who justified the importance of preventing mutiny. Also Sean Connery played great and Nicholas Cage also. My favorite part on this movie is the arguments of Gen. Hammel and Maj. Anderson. I love the lines. You can feel the intensity and the principles they believed. And also i like the explosive scene such as the capturing Humvee's in the road scene.

Bruckheimer has nothing else that compares to this, except maybe Con Air, and, no, it's not a coincidence that Nicholas Cage is in this film. It's obvious that Raising Arizona and Face/Off are his best flicks, but this is unbelievable. So, here's the top four: 1. Raiders of the Lost Ark, 2. Die Hard, 3. Point Break, 4. The Rock. So, the Rock comes in at fourth, but how can you beat an archaeologist(directed by Spielberg) fighting Nazis for the Ark of the Covenant, Bruce Willis fighting Germans to save Nakatomi Plaza, Johnny F---in' Utah fighting bank robbing surfers (with Gary Busey), etc. But honestly, he drives a volvo, beige. This movie takes what Spielberg did with Last Crusade (a wisened Sean Connery) and made it Alcatrizazed to your mother's c--word. I mean, sticking a needle in your chest is hardcore for a non-heroine addict. Okay, Honeymoon in Vegas was good (so was 3000 Miles to Graceland), but aside from Pirates of the Disney World ride, Bruckheimer took some Bad Boys to the edge here and made one of the most exciting action flicks ever.",The Rock

338,citric___acid,Everything wrong with Hollywood.,1,5 June 2005,"I've often heard things about Michael Bay, about how terrible his movies are, and how he couldn't direct himself out of a paper bag, and so on. Now, I was content to not confirm this theory, since I haven't heard a good thing about most of his movies, and cheap over-produced action movies are not generally my cup of tea. But, then the opportunity to watch The Rock presented itself, and I figured I might as well see if Mr. Bay was as bad as some people said.Oh, yes, he most certainly is.See, The Rock is the explosion filled wet-dream of an ADD addled teenager. Chases are often inexplicably overdone, with the characters aiming FOR people and objects, with enough cuts to make the whole thing an incomprehensible mess. Character development is forced, and crammed between the obligatory action sequences so haphazardly one wonders if any thought at all was put into it. Many shots don't make sense in context and look developed for the film trailer, and there are often massive errors in scripting - though many are late in the film and I don't want to spoil anything. Often the film also goes for cheap, emotional moments which simply don't work, especially since the characters are never presented as remotely likable and relatable - in spite of the haphazard ""development"".This film has a rating of 7.0 here, yet I found it almost completely unwatchable. Not only is it bad at being an action movie, it also happens to be overly full of itself. I'll even go so far as to say the more recent Catwoman was better, at least it knew it was crap.",The Rock
339,philmcardl,Rock bottom,1,29 June 2005,"This is a pretty grim piece of effluent. A monument to everything I hate in Hollywood blockbuster trash. Noisy incomprehensible and some of the laziest acting by Sean Connery I've ever seen. The villain (Ed Harris  a great actor completely wasted) is a highly-decorated (aren't they all in these sort of movies) US general who has taken over Alcatraz and is threatening to blow up San Francisco Bay area (pity that couldn't have been the Michael Bay area) unless $100 million is paid in ransom, as restitution to families of soldiers who died in secret operations. This is taking our compensation culture too far methinks. But that's Okay then as far as the plot is concerned as at least he's not doing out of any selfish motive and you cannot have a depiction of a really psychotically evil military man these days otherwise you might have the Right Wing reaching for their assault rifles. Of course the only man who can stop him is a geriatric prisoner (arise Sir Sean) a former Alcatraz escapee and you've guessed the rest. This movie is offensives on just about every level. The nadir of this film, which incidentally gave me the biggest snigger, was the line from Connery when he talks about his anxieties about making it sexually unmolested from the prison showers everyday. The idea that any prisoner no matter how perverted would be interested in Connerys flaccid old ass had me hooting. Is Connery now so old and senile as to not see how dumb and funny that line is. Or is it symptomatic of the hubris of elderly superstars that nobody tells you the obvious. Which is sad because Sean Connery always struck me as a pretty grounded individual with few airs (not to mention hairs) and graces?Rent the Sean Connery classic The Hill (1965) to see what a fine actor he can be and get this dire rubbish out of your system.",The Rock

I used to think that Transformers was his best film, but all of that changed when I saw The Rock. This is a great movie all around. The chemistry between Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage is great, and Ed Harris is great as a villain. (He also does a great job in Enemy At The Gates) Sure there is some cheesy dialog, but then again, what is an action movie without a little bit of cheese? Some of the action is over the top. But once again, that is what you would see in your normal everyday action movie. The only things I can say bad about this movie is the fact that there is not enough of it.

His great feelings for Beatles is a great reminder for us guys that we sometimes need to keep our ""small"" habits for our self. I believe the most of us have something that we spend money on that our girlie's don't know about. It is this small things inside the great action that also makes the whole picture.

346,GK-12,What a waste of acting talent,3,9 February 2000,"This film is a mixture of toxic weapons disaster movie, a mutineering soldiers fighting for a noble cause movie, a conspiracy theory movie, a hostage movie and a James Bond taking on the bad guys movie. It looks as if the writers just jiggled it all up, mixed in as many catchy one-liners they could think of, and called in the SFX people for some pyrotechnics and car-chases.The result is a bumbling film that jerks along with no real focus. The script is contrived to the point of absurdity. Perhaps my suspension of disbelief is not as strong as it could be -  but the film lacked the ""style"" and continuity that makes this possible.Some of the action scenes are good (particularly the shower-room face-off), and Sean Connery does his best with the lines he is given. Nicolas Cage (who I greatly admire) is mis-cast and fails to make much of the awful one-liner ""funny"" replies he is meant to deliver. Ed Harris is solid but sometimes wooden in his portrayal of an Army General, but then again maybe Army Generals are a supposed to be a little stiff.In summary I was very disappointed with what could have been a decent film, had the writers penned a tighter script with less pandering the mass-market. Too many cheap jokes, pathetic plot twists and no real tension.Not recommended.",The Rock

349,eggcr,Bruckheimer's best and a personal favorite,9,21 June 2001,"If you only see only one Jerry Bruckheimer movie, let it be The Rock. It is proof that if the team of Bruckheimer and Bay can get their hands on a decent script, they are capable of making some great stuff. The dialog was suprisingly intelligent and nothing was corny. The humor was well timed,hilarious, and didn't mess up the course of the movie unlike Armageddon. The character development was excellent. The film successfully showed why we should care about them. Although some characters were more developed than others, it is still enough to make to make you feel for the characters who got killed, unlike movies like The Mummy which basically made ""expendable characters"" who's sole purpose was to get killed sometime during the film. What i really liked was how the movie portrayed Ed Harris's character, General Hummel. Unlike most action movies, the villain wasn't portrayed as a heartless ogre, but rather a normal person with good intentions but is trying to get them the wrong way. Harris's performance almost makes you want to root for him. Sean Connery was great, as usual. Although i think Nicholas Cage is a great actor, he can't play a tough guy. I don't know why but he doesn't convince me that the character he is playing is tough and comes across goofy. Fourtunately, he didn't play one in The Rock, he played an FBI chemical who had no combat experience which was a perfect part for him. But he later got type casted into playing tough guy roles like Con Air, Face Off, and Gone in 60 Seconds. The supporting cast was great as well. Michael Biehn did a great job in the few minutes of screen time he got (His argument with Ed Harris right before the shower room shoot out was one of the most intense parts of the movie). David Morse, who played Ed Harris's assistant, had the most underrated performance. The action is intense and the special effects look very realistic.Overall, The Rock is an excellent action flick and arguably the best action film of the 90's. 5 out of 5",The Rock

Yes, the action is great, but the performances are more a reason to watch this movie.Nicolas Cage, coming off his big Oscar win at the time, is Stanley Goodspeed, a bio-chemist for the FBI.  He's pretty much a regular, goofy guy, without any combat experience, which shows throughout the movie, and leads to some funny scenes.Ed Harris, Hummel, is the maniac in the movie, not as typical as you may think as the movie goes on.  He's employed some of his marine friends to help with heist, taking over Alcatraz and taking hostages, while threatening to launch rockets with VX gas at San Francisco.Sean Connery puts in a great performance as Mason, the wrongfully-charged prisoner, who was put in jail without a trial.  He's rightfully pissed, so obviously it takes a little to get him to guide the Navy Seals through The Rock, to overtake Hummel and his men.The movie consists of many action sequences, that do not seem pointlessly thrown in like in other movies, but flow with the plot.  The story is pretty cool and is executed quite good.  Michael Bay really shines as the director, excellently using his low-angle shots, really showcasing what is going on in the scene.

Michael Bay may be criticized for his multiple action scenes in films, but who cares they are done well. Along with its talented cast (Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, Ed Harris), The Rock has a good story and a fast pace, which keeps the audience wanting more. The reason I think Michael Bay is one of the premier directors, is for his vision for action sequences, he hardly uses CGI, unless it's almost unnoticeable or he is doing Sci Fi. The Rock is totally old school and realistic when it comes to the action and you have to appreciate that.

Almost inline with Die Hard, Terminator and Matrix. And the soundtrack.... WOW. Props to Zimmer for having such an awesome soundtrack. Every track is enjoyable even after the 100th time of listening to em.So overall, this action movie has everything you want from an action movie.

Some of my favorite players-- Sean Connery, Nicholas Cage, and Ed Harris-- stared in the movie. Hummel (Ed Harris) played an evil villain. Dr. Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage) has knowledge of chemical warfare and so he arrives sent to Alcatraz with some Navy Seals because he works with the C.I.A. The Rock keeps you on the edge of your seat because of chemical missiles threatening the city of San Francisco, California. Nicholas Cage, the scientist, risks his life to rescue the city, while his girlfriend comes to the city when he tells her not to.One of my favorite scenes is the scene where the Marines wipe out Anderson's (Navy Seals) team. Another scene I enjoyed was the scene with Goodspeed near the beginning, when he is diffusing the chemical bomb. The agent trainee with him didn't know when he squeezed the doll it would send out explosive, poisonous gas. I enjoyed the suspense as I watched the movie again and again.The most powerful character in this movie is Mason (Sean Connery). He has many secrets and an extensive knowledge of maximum security prisons, since he is the only man who has ever escaped from Alcatraz. For this reason he was chosen to go with the Seals. This movie has characters with action. The cast is strong; the film has just the right comedy mixed with suspense. This film is my favorite action movie.

The plot is written for 13 year old boys with hooded outfit bought at the nearest wall mart with FBI written on the back. Embarrassing to watch, and annoying to rethink as an adventurous possibility. Completely out of touch. A true turkey. A gift to the imbecile. How anyone can take pleasure in watching this is beyond pathological human understanding. Not only does the main character lack a focal point, or at least possess something to believe in - the main figures are all turning into clowns while working hard to be the ""bad guys"" and ""good guys"".

Connery is excellent, as are Ed Harris and the occasionally polarising Nicolas Cage but they are supported by strong performances from the likes of Michael Biehn, William Forsythe, David Morse and others.Unusually for a film of this type the characters are sufficiently rounded allowing you to empathise with even the antagonists. The plot is fun and entertaining if a little far-fetched. Performances and script aside there are more than enough action set pieces and special effects to provide excitement and the score is very well done, understandable seeing as Hans Zimmer and Harry Gregson-Williams had a hand in it. All in all, ""The Rock"" is a well made, well acted, blockbuster masterpiece and deserves wider recognition.",The Rock

""The best action movie...ever!"" was the general opinion, with only slight variations. The film started out well enough, but felt overly contrived. In terms of Mr. Connery's being questioned, you were just begging for all persons involved to stop acting, for the good of humanity. There came a point in the film where me and my friend started betting on what cliched action movie scene would come next. One rather memorable disagreement was ""Dude, there is no way they could put in a car chase, it's just not that kind of movie..."" Pausing to look at the screen as a Hummer launched into the air.

The soundtrack is one of the best that I has ever heard (especially during the beginning and during the climax in the end of the movie), the acting is fantastic (why does the Academy totally overlook action-movies?).The movie is Bruckheimer´s best so far!

Nicolas Cage did a wonderful job playing the dorky scientist who ends up being the cool scientist in the end.  Sean Connery made a great come back as the repentant prisoner who realized the right thing to do.

Although a little exaggerated (a US general deserting?!) the story holds you tight in front of the TV. The common way of mocking the FBI and the US defense authorities is nothing new, but presenting Alcatraz is spectacular. Dialogs are great, (maybe not as good as in True Lies for ex, but it worth listening :) ) specially when between the 2 main characters. To enforce the action on Mason and Godspeed, the script slaughters a whole SEAL squad, which I consider highly unnecessary and violent, but suppose the writer just couldn't find any other way to do it... Puting it all together, it is a great movie, everything adds up correctly, nothing too much, nothing missing. You better book a place in a movie close by ASAP... :)",The Rock

William Forsythe could have played one of Ed Harris' Marines, David Morse could have played the Nick Cage part, or Sean Connery the Ed Harris role.  This cast is fabulous. And the plot is tight.

Ed Harris, Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage, and Michael Biehn make up this movie's excellent cast and all give great performances.  Not only does this movie have top-notch acting and directing, but the musical score rocks. I loved the music during the Cage/Connery chase scene.  The SEAL slaughter scene also had great music.

For guys and gals that like a good action, thats laced with humor this is the movie for you. Its a powerful, emotional, original, awesome action movie. It has three well known actors who play eccentric characters very well. Unlike other actions, it doesn't really have many OBVIOUS mistakes or plot holes. And its not one of those movies thats all about people shooting people (although there is a lot of that :P). It has a good storyline and for those that aren't that fussed on car chases (i know my mother isn't), there is really only one in the movie. Its got the most powerful feel to it which is conveyed through highly emotional music that will send ya ears to another world!It has an intense climax and a small twist at the end as well. Now i may be making a bit more of a deal than i should about this but i don't care. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. I Don't CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS.

I do think, though, that it is the most entertaining mix of action, comedy, suspense, and drama possibly ever put on film.  Sean Connery was fantastic in it, even using some lines that were puns on him.  Nicolas Cage, who was, at the time, just making a name for himself as an action star, and was fresh off his oscar for Leaving Las Vegas, is also great as a highly intelligent, but kind of geeky chemical wizard forced into a ""combat situation"".

The film had a lot of good action sequences and some very funny bits as well. I liked Nicholas Cage he seemed to work well with Sean Connery and the scenes underneath Alcatraz were very well done. The film as a whole was very well put together and everyone played a really good part.

The deadliest combination.The Rock is not a shoot 'em up, brainless, action flick. No. It was the movie that both brought the fall of Americanism and the birth of modern Patriotism. This movie has feeling, it lives, it breathes. Mind not what the rotten tomatoes says. This movie is the mother of all movies. It's about honor, sacrifice and courage. It's about the warm summer breeze running through your hair accompanied by the calm sounds of sea while you're on your knees , feeling the warmth of the sunshine in your face....and waiting to die.....It's just that poetic if you can read between the lines....It's just not a thriller.

The entire movie is based on a chemical that can kill everyone in an 8 block radius with just a teaspoon of it in the atmosphere. They have enough of this stuff to kill everyone on earth, and they use it to threaten the government into giving money to families of dead secret service soldiers. During the parts of the movie where we see this chemical released there are many scientifically impossible events that occur. When the chemical is released it immediately burns all parts of your skin, then makes you convulse until you break your own spine, then kills you by destroying your brain. The chemical being able to destroy all of your skin in a matter of seconds is very unrealistic. Also, there is serum that they use, that needs to be stabbed into the heart, that can save you from the chemical. Somehow, something that is put into your heart can save ALL of your skin.

Every aspect of 'The Rock' shines; The performances are phenomonal, Hanz Zimmer's Composing is amazing(I highly suggest going to downloading the main theme off any file sharing)the direction is good, the charactors are well developed, solid, unlike a hulking retard who walks around aimlessly with a huge machine gun such as rambo...Any American will feel compassion about American soldiers losing their lives and not being honored or remembered Which is a the cause of the action in the film. General Hummel ""Possibly the greatest battalion commander of the vietnam war"". A great military leader who was very successful in his aray of missions. For the troops that died under his command during blackOps missions (blackops meaning secret, planned and prepared by the US Goverenment, but never made public) were never given medals, money to their families ""These men died for their country and weren't even given a military burial."" Hummel puts together his own team of troops and takes over Alcatraz with 81 hostages and 14VX Gas Warheads and demands the money from the U.S. Government.

After that I see only great acting and great directing. This movie has even some funny moments, which raise more its quality.Similar movies are ""Con Air"" and ""Face Off"", but ""The Rock"" is better than them, because they don't have Machael Bay as a director.

The grade will be a solid B,8,1 December 2013,"The bombastic director Michael Bay impressed the world with Bad Boys(1995) then to continue with the much better The Rock, with good action, high tempo, Sean Connery and an amazing theme by Hans Zimmer. A group of US marine mercenaries takes over the prison island of Alcatraz, aka. The Rock near San Fransisco. They are led by General Hummel(very good performed by Ed Harris), who threatens to launch chemical missiles on San Franssico if the government do not pay the families of his dead troops, whose deaths were not compensated. The government calls Stanley Goodspeed(Nicolas Cage, when he still was good in the late 90s) an expert at chemical weapons. Because the mercenaries have total control of the island they need a covered way in. They release the only man who managed to escape the prison called John Mason(entertaining played by Sean Connery). There is good chemistry between Nicolas and Sean that follows. This movie is unlike other action movies very entertaining, the atmosphere around the plot works very good with the action that follows and also the story. The movie becomes more thrilling when Goodspedd, mason and some Navy Seals(including Michael Biehn) gets inside the prison. The acting does not contain a lot of deep emotions and moral questions but like always Michael Bay thinks the actors are in the way and goes on with the action tempo. Still a very entertaining blockbuster movie worthy to be re-watched again!",The Rock
416,kjchalmers,Annoying background music,5,6 July 2011,"This is quite a decent film. It is unusual in its inclusion of an American actor playing a baddie (although one with honour). The one thing that spoils it is the incessant and rather annoying soundtrack throughout. At times you can barely hear the dialogue due to the background music. Could it be as a diversion from the dialogue itself? If only the film could be re-mastered without the annoying music, it would be so much better. Nicholas Cage does a good job although Sean Connery's role is rather 2-dimensional. It has the usual mix of predictable elements, with the saving of the world / San Francisco coming down to the last few seconds.",The Rock

There are so many things going on and so much action that you couldn't really get any better. Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage work extremely well together, both being top actors. Ed Harris, plays a disgruntled Marine Corps Major General to a tee. Simpson and Bruckheimer have really pushed the envelope of the action/adventure genre with this collaboration. I rate this movie as a 10 for a few reasons, one being the intensity of the movie and two, the actors' ability to bring the parts together so well.",The Rock

Excellent casting of Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage, interesting idea, ex-military take tour hostage and threaten chemical warfare. But it's all in a days work for the FBI. Scientist risks life and limb to rescue city while pregnant girlfriend looks on. Sean Connery' character is portrayed as a hard ex SAS spy and Nicholas Cage is the mild mannered Scientist/Chemical Expert. Good film, not too taxing on the brain and overall, very enjoyable! A must see for Action Fans.",The Rock

This might be the best action movie by far when it comes to 90's Jerry Bruckheimer.Definitely worth a watch.Nicholas cage gives his best performance and is the least bit crazy.",The Rock
420,maverick20023,One of a Kind Movie --- MUST SEE!!!!,10,12 November 2005,"This movie defines the words 'ACTION PACKED' and 'HIGH OCTANE'. Fast moving, explosions and amazing camera angles, makes this movie a must see. I saw it when it was released in '96 and loved it. Saw it again after almost 10 yrs and still has the same impact. As for the acting goes, Nicolas Cage is pretty good, and Sean Connery, well, he's a thespian, so he's always the good. The last scene, where Cage puts on the flares and three jet fighters fly above him , is personally my favorite scene. As for the soundtrack, the background music is excellent and grips you in your seat for this nail-biting thriller. Deserves to be in the top 250 movies of all time and in the Top 50 Action movie genre of all time.",The Rock
421,tjhopper,A great movie for the action lover.,9,26 September 2004,"This movie could be one of the greatest action movies ever. The Rock clashed Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery together. Now we all know that each actor is on of the funniest yet most adventurous actors ever. I think that if you see it, you will love it. I don't think that this is a must see for the entire family, due to some language and content. In order to like this movie, you must enjoy gassing of innocent people trying to be stopped, Navy SEALS stopping bad guys, and Military personnel that go bad. Once again, this movie is not for the entire family. Sometimes an odd sense of comedy is tied in with this movie, but not much. Also, if you enjoy special effects, this is an awesome movie for you. Overall, I would rate this movie a 9/10.",The Rock
422,south_american_bushdog,i have written a film review for this film.,10,20 January 2005,"Well what can I say? I was going to mention the good and bad points but the small flaw to that plan is there are no bad points! So I will mention the good points for starters the level of acting is superb. A rather tetchy first moments with Mason (Connery) and Goodspeed (Cage) round of to a brilliant complementary duo up in the same league as the original Batman + Robin, no better! The action is not mindless like in some films but witty and has a point to the destruction of fellow human beings.(in very graphic ways such as one of the opening deaths due to a deadly toxic nerve gas) there are many aspects which lift this film to what I believe to the greatest of all time, such as the accelerated pace, the fast action chase scene, the humour between Cage and Connery, the hilarious hair dressing scene, the tension, the action, the violence, the danger, the thrill and the adrenaline of the legend that is the THE ROCK!The Actors give this film its fantastic edge. Such as the bitter hatred between Mason and his Nemesis (FBI Director James Womack). The Cast of actors include Nicolas Cage as Dr. Stanley Goodspeed a chemical weapons expert who has an obsession with the Beatles. He has never really seen any action, but he gets called into service by the FBI Director to diffuse rockets laden with the deadly VX nerve gas. The part is play brilliantly making the character Goodspeed believable and making him a pleasure to watch. Sean Connery as the X SAS agent John Patrick Mason sent to Alcatraz when it was a prison. He was sent there for discovering America's deepest secrets. Such as the Kennedy assassination and the truth about Roswell. Then being rejected by the very agency that he worked for the British. The FBI now needs him as he is the only man to ever escape the rock. Sean Connery displays probably the greatest acting as John Mason I have ever seen together him and Nicolas Cage make this film awesome. Ed Harris is the Hero turned Villain Brig. Gen. Francis Hummel he has decided to avenge his comrade's deaths and demands a ransom to compensate the families of the fallen men he once served over. He has stolen 15 canisters of the most deadly nerve gas VX Gas. He is ready to launch rockets laden with the gas into San Francisco and kill millions on innocent people. But hero to villain is a change too large for Brig. Gen. Francis Hummel a man of honour. John Spencer is Mason's nemeses, FBI Director James Womack the man who originally sent Mason to Alcatraz. Now needs Mason released to get his men into Alcatraz a task of which he dose not agree. Especially after Mason throws him of a building. David Morse is Maj. Tom Baxter, Hummel's right hand man and would follow his word to the end. The Story Line Probably the Greatest story to be invented the basic story is a brigadier General has decided to compensate the families of his fallen Comrades and get money for his team and his self. His team steal 15 rockets and loads them with the most deadly nerve agent ever, VX gas. He then holds San Francisco hostage the FBI get Stanley Goodspeed a chemical weapons expert along with a crack team of navy seals to disarm the war heads and capture Brigadier General Hummel. The team is lead by an X SAS agent John Mason imprisoned by America after discovering their biggest secrets. He was originally imprisoned in Alcatraz but was the only man ever to escape from the top security prison he is now needed by the FBI to get the seals and Goodspeed into Alcatraz. Over View Michael Bay has aspired to produce the greatest film ever. With elements of almost every Genre. With a excellent host of actors, brilliant effects and action and suspense beyond anything seen before. He has combined these to create the most momentously superb film. I salute him.",The Rock
423,bmikequinn,How is this movie rated so highly?,4,1 September 2013,"I don't understand how so many people can say this movie is great. I thought it was terrible. This is the kind of movie where cars blow up for no reason and create unrealistically huge fireballs. Not only that, but the dialogue is cheesy, with typical one liners like ""I'm too old for this."" The plot is reminiscent of one of the not as good seasons of 24, but not as developed. As stated by other users, the villain was the best part of the movie. Perhaps I'm biased because this movie had been hyped up to me for so many years, and when I finally watched it I was extremely disappointed. But regardless, the movie was bad (although there are plenty worse out there). I probably would have rated the movie lower, but it was entertaining enough that I was able to get through it, despite being tempted to turn it off several times.",The Rock
424,charlie-303,An absolute classic,10,31 January 2005,"What can I say other than Connery at his best as usual? It's good to see Hollywood remembers the best. It's also good to see an American film portray us little Brits in such high regard.When else would you see a 60+ year old retired SAS agent who's been wrongfully banged up for 30 years and kept away from his daughter, break back into Alcatraz (after successfully breaking out all those years ago), take out an entire SEAL team almost empty handed, save 81 hostages held at gun point and a city of 5 Million held ransom with 15 deadly poisonous VX gas rockets?? Generally excellent acting by Ed Harris as you could expect and an almost convincing performance by Nicolas Cage....and thats just the half of it.",The Rock
425,qsj1112,"Let ""The Rock"" Rock You",10,2 January 2014,"""The Rock""is definitely one of the most wonderful movie I've ever seen and left me a great beautiful memory. The stars' acting was really amazing. The mysterious spy wearing amazing smiles, the young chemist with a brave heart and the general who loved his country very much but had to fight against it for his soldiers. In this moving story, there was no bad guys but only patriots. Besides, the music of the Rock was the best among all the movies I've ever seen! The background music was really exciting and intense. Without Hans Zimmer's great composition, the Rock will lose 5/10 of its attraction. The Rock is the best action movie in its age and it is still one of the best in this day in spite of the rapid development of film industry. I really think this movie is underrated by we viewers. In my mind, it is an eternal classics and always worth me watching for one more time.",The Rock
426,Maverick_AU,Old School at its BEST.,8,3 November 2019,"This is one of those movies I find myself coming back to even through on its merits its nothing extraordinary. It a great combination of action, comedy and adventure and one that deserves more credit than it received.",The Rock
427,jack-548,Pure entertainment!,8,10 May 2005,"This movie rocks! Pardon the pun. It's what cinema should be about - a pure adrenalin, non-stop thrill ride! Connery and Cage are great.The direction is superb, as is all of Bay's work. You can see he really knows how to use the camera for the greatest effect. He combines great visuals and a music score that really drives to story on and keeps us glued. The characters are about as rounded as they could be for an action film and the exposition is minimal.The script is tight and the editing real slick. This is one of my favorite movies of this genre. The climax and other set pieces are extremely well devised and executed. Bravo!!!",The Rock
428,medo_sandell,Great action with great actors AND great music,8,16 June 2005,"Viewed as an action movie I would have to put this among the top 10 of all times. The story is kind of... not unusual, but the actors make this movie really great. There is NO better man to play an officer with a conscience than Ed Harris. Period. Contrary to the awful Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna at his... well, usual level, I suppose) Harris acting is flawless. Then there is Nicholas Cage who is always good in this sort of role, the guy who is stronger than he thinks, and shows courage when it really counts. Sean Connery is of course great as he always is, but sad to say, the scriptwriters gave him some really cheesy comments, such as ""winners go home and f**k the prom queen"". I mean, that's not the line you'd like an actor like Connery to deliver. Really. Just as we would not like to hear Jean-Claude Van Damme read lines from some play of Shakespeare. Anyway, I have to correct myself. A little. Along side with Ed Harris, Michael Biehn is the perfect guy to play an officer. I mean, do people think of him as ANYTHING else? No, don't think so. Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator, Navy SEALs, the guy is a soldier! He plays the role really good, as always. And the supporting roles of William Forsythe, among others, is also good. Well, enough about the actors. The music gave me goose bumps. Perfect action movie music. In my mind only met by Alan Silvestri's music for ""Predator"". I am from Sweden, and like most of my countrymen, we aren't to keen on flag-waving movies , of which The Rock is a great example, along side with Armageddon and Independence Day. The Americans save the world! Sometimes we get the notion that you guys forget that there are other countries that are just as technologically advanced as you. Well, I had to put in a little criticism in here! Other than that, I give The Rock an 8/10.",The Rock
429,captainfriend,Bush's Favorite Movie?,8,4 May 2006,"I love this movie- great nasty action, cool characters and exciting pacing. I recommend it. But I just wanted to point out a couple of quotes that seem strangely portentous in a movie from 1996.1) The President in the movie, in his one monologue, says that ""we are at war with terror,"" which is why he won't negotiate with the ex-marine hostage takers.2) One of the bad guys tells Ed Harris ""you're either with us or against us"" when they start to differ in opinion about whether to hit innocent people with poison gas. 3) One of the pilots in the plane which bombs Alcatraz at the end of the movie is Jim Caviezel (totally unrecognizable here in aviators). For anyone who may not know, Jim Caviezel played Jesus Christ in ""The Passion of the Christ."" This answers the classic question: what would Jesus bomb? The answer: San Francisco, of course.",The Rock
430,jagkk,Don't listen to these reviews,10,8 April 2020,"This is one of the greatest action movies of all time. It has it all - heartbreak, explosions, a quasi-villain who you aren't sure if you should root for or not, Sean Connery's vintage Scottish accent, and symphony music that rivals the original score from Star Wars: a New Hope. 10/10 for one of Michael Bay's greatest films of all time and my personal favorite action flick.",The Rock
431,Insightful_One,The Rock - the way to make an action thriller movie,10,13 November 2005,"There are negatives to the movie, including some stilted and corny dialogue, and some believability issues, but the acting, the rest of the script, and the action, all sells it.The best part of the movie is the way the plot twists and turns in all the right places. Not simply for shock effect, but in a believable manner that places the characters in tense, suspenseful, and powerful situations. For example, when the Navy SEALS are all massacred, it sets up the villains as a formidable threat, while leaving Goodspeed and Mason alone as an odd pairing against unbelievable odds to save the day. That is a great plot point.The movie itself is a thrilling ride, and though it uses previous action clichés and movie tropes, it pushes it in a fun, polished, and unpredictable way. The tension just gets amped up each act, in ways where you really wonder where the movie is going to go.For instance, when the deadline passed and the Marines launched a VX rocket at San Francisco, I was thinking, No they didn't! It was crazy! The threat was real and you had no idea what was going to happen. It made perfect sense in terms of the story that these hardened Marines would actually make good on the threat, and then finally Hummel in a move that fits the character diverts the rocket into the ocean.The movie did a great job amping up the threat of the VX chemical to a dangerous point. Other thriller directors like Hitchcock would simply have used the VX gas as a MacGuffin, and a looming threat that all the characters are fighting over. But Bay in this movie actually uses it in the final climax, and the audience is on pins and needles wondering the effect of this hyped up threat. This happens when Goodspeed is fighting for his life after disarming the last rocket, and he smashes the VX in the sadistic Marines' mouth. A great moment that just blows the audience away.The scene then leads to Cage stumbling because of his obvious exposure to the gas and managing to stick a huge needle of atropine into his own heart. Bay just took Tarantino's Pulp Fiction moment and just amped it up considerably. What a great dramatic moment, where else but in the movies are you going to see something as crazy as that.Then all the while the threat of complete obliteration by the thermite plasma is looming on the horizon, and so Cage in his delirium after doing all that needs to save the day again. In some great stylistic shots by Bay, Cage remembers that he needs to light the green flares to show the mission accomplished, and the way he pops them and stumbles outside holding them up while kneeling was just a great iconic moment. That's just a dramatic picture at its best. ""I see green!"" ""Abort!, abort!"" True action thrillers like this that take a big premise and are actually able to execute it too good effect are rare. Though Bruckenheimer and Bay have been criticized for their over-the-top blow 'em up action style, you can't deny the excellence of their specific genre craft. Besides the excellent actors and the script, the production values also made this film a true summer blockbuster, that's been imitated many times since, but have yet to be surpassed.",The Rock
432,delt_,Gas mask required,8,9 December 2005,"When you look at the plot outline, it looks like the same old ""nukes stolen by military-turned-extortionist"" formula that's been used in many other movies. One thing that makes ""The rock"" stand out, is that the motives behind the behaviour of most characters - especially the main ""bad guy"" - raise thoughts on very real philosophical and ethical issues. However some of the characters fall into the standard Hollywold mold of being either completely good, completely evil, or completely stupid. Probably the most remarkable asset of this movie is the very intense emotion carried by the soundtrack.One very interesting point is that the chemical weapon referred to in the film (VX nerve gas) is accurately described in most aspects compared to its real-life counterpart, as an extremely deadly and dangerous substance. The effect on its victims was only slightly exaggerated for dramatic effect, citing that VX gas causes the victim's skin to melt and liquefy.Writing this almost 10 years after ""The rock"" was first released, i must say that this is one of the movies that have made a notable impression in the past decade. Its outstanding soundtrack, which was composed and arranged by musical genius Hans Zimmer, is truly one of the best film soundtracks of all time.",The Rock
433,et57,another SaveTheWorld single-handedly,7,17 October 2005,"not very original. Well played by excellent actors, who really save the movie. Take a film set and a lame story, add a big problem (like erasing a city), put in some good actors, a good dose of stunt work and you have got yourself another SaveTheWorld-movie.Of course, it is saved, or else we would not be here, would we ?It's always nice to see Connery at work he overpowers any and all actor in any film. Seen Red October ? there he does it again.Pity, the Americans can't make a movie WITHOUT heroes...
