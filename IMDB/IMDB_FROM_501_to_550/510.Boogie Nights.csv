0,TheLittleSongbird,"How to make a film about pornography, disco and drugs great",10,2 July 2016,"'Boogie Nights' is more than a great film even, it's fantastic and more worthy of even more praise than it already gets.What is immediately impressive after finishing is how it tackles the subject matters of pornography, disco and drugs, very difficult subjects to portray in any media without being too trashy or causing offence but 'Boogie Nights' manages to make a film that commits neither of those things (even with the sex and drug abuse being prominent, they all have their full impact without being over-the-top or trivialised) and instead make one that's interesting and entertaining as well as disturbing and emotional. Few films that include even one of these subjects have succeeded in doing that so well.It looks stunning for a start, with an imaginative surreal touch to the lighting and kinetic cinematography (though also with the trademark long takes and tracking shots that is immediately distinctive of Paul Thomas Anderson) and audacious costuming. Visually the standout is the opening Steadicam shot, it's breathtaking and famous for very good reason. The disco soundtrack is a perfect fit, it's infectious, effectively sleazy, sometimes deliciously ironic and also makes one want to dance with the characters and nostalgic for the 80s.The screenplay was nominated for an Oscar, and with its perfect balance of the hilarious, the poignant and the darkly disturbing it's a worthy nomination. Even with the huge two and a half hour length (it may be argued by some that the film is too long), there is rarely if at all a dull stretch in the story, which explores the adult entertainment industry and the American Dream in ways that are startling, hugely entertaining and poignant.Anderson does a wonderful job directing, not just with the telling of the story and keeping the atmosphere consistent but also in making the characters compelling and in his direction of actors (some of the best of any modern-day director) and their interaction. The acting is one of the biggest reasons why 'Boogie Nights' works so well. Mark Wahlberg has never been better, anybody who doubts his abilities as an actor should see this, and Burt Reynolds is brilliant in one of his career's finest performances in his ""comeback"" role. There are scintillating turns from Heather Graham and especially Julianne Moore (along with Reynolds also Oscar-nominated, again worthy nominations and would have been even worthier winners), and also fabulous support from Don Cheadle, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffmann, a hugely entertaining John C. Reilly (even if the role occasionally threatens to strain credibility but thankfully it never does) and a gloriously unhinged Alfred Molina.Overall, fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Boogie Nights
1,bkoganbing,"""I'm A Star, I'm A Bright Shining Star""",10,4 August 2007,"Although a film like Boogie Nights about the pornography industry could easily have been far more crass and exploitive, what we have here is a decent and sensitive study of a group of people in a field who create and form their own community because of the way society frowns on what they do.The negative side of the freewheeling hedonistic lifestyle is also shown, even the best of these people are far from saints. Boogie Nights covers their lives from a day in the mid seventies when Burt Reynolds interviews Mark Wahlberg, a young busboy with an amazing gift below decks, and asks him to be a star in his new porn film.It's too bad that Burt Reynolds did not win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. He's certainly a man of great pretensions about his work. Also in that same character package is an easy going man who just wants to live and let live, a compassionate human being who's like a father figure to the younger members of his group. It really is Burt Reynolds's finest screen moment.Mark Wahlberg as young Eddie Adams who becomes Dirk Diggler got his breakout part in this film. Of all the characters, he's the one whose background we see. His mother just puts him down, he'll never be anything more than the white trash he comes from. Seeing how she treats him we don't question why he gravitates to Reynolds and his crowd. I'm sure it's the same for all viewers of Boogie Nights, we realize that all who are in that crowd are in some way people who've been wounded and have banded together to do their thing and live life as they want to, and the devil with the consequences.Julianna Margulies realizes the consequences full well. Her pathetic fight for her child's custody is very poignant, made more so by the fact that the audience is saying while we like her character of Amber Waves, her expectations about custody are nothing short of pathetic.My favorite in the film however is Philip Seymour Hoffman at the start of his career as the lovestruck gay kid, Scotty Jay who is completely enamored of Wahlberg. For those who saw him as Truman Capote, this other gay character will be quite an eyeopener. Also Alfred Molina has a brief, but telling part as the rich party boy whose coked up character you will not forget. Boogie Nights follows a group of a dozen or so people from the mid seventies to the mid eighties, just before AIDS came full blown on the scene with consequences for a lot of the Boogie Nights type characters. Still this group is mostly survivors and we like that about them.And it's why we like Boogie Nights.",Boogie Nights
2,Leofwine_draca,"Good fun, but not ageing too well",6,28 June 2011,"I saw this film soon after it first came out and I thought it was brilliant - the kind of multi-layered, multi-storied epic film-making that Scorcese would be proud of. Recently, I've come back to it for a rewatch and I've realised it's not that great - certainly not when compared to the director's later efforts, like THERE WILL BE BLOOD.For once, the story and characters are rather inconsequential. Mark Wahlberg is all right as Dirk Diggler, but his character seems to be a focus for dick jokes rather than emotion, and his going off the rails never really convinces. He just doesn't play that interesting a guy and only has one scene that's really powerful(the bit in the truck towards the end). Burt Reynolds plays a one-note role, and the most interesting characters - those acted by Don Cheadle, William H. Macy, Heather Graham - never really get much of a look-in.Sometimes you get the feeling there are too many stories for even the extended running time to cope with. Take Julianne Moore's character, for instance - the problems with her son are only revealed in a couple of brief scenes, but plenty more could have been made of them. Anderson seems more intent on focusing on the grimier side of his era, with incessant drug-taking and sex instead.Don't get me wrong: I'd be a fool not to realise this is above average film-making, with an expert realisation of era and great handling of story lines that cross in and out of each other. But in places it feels somewhat hollow, and towards the end seems to run out of steam completely, becoming too preoccupied with drug business. It's good, but not quite the classic it once seemed to be.",Boogie Nights
3,SnoopyStyle,Great cast great director,9,14 February 2015,"It's 1977 San Fernando Valley. Porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) gets interested in busboy Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg). Jack is the head of a family of sorts with his cast and crew. Maggie/Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) is his drug-addicted star who is kept from her son by her ex-husband. Brandy/Rollergirl (Heather Graham) is a high school girl. Little Bill (William H. Macy) is the assistant director whose wife (Nina Hartley) openly cheats on him. Buck Swope (Don Cheadle), Becky Barnett (Nicole Ari Parker) and Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) are some of the performers. Maurice TT Rodriguez (Luis Guzmán) is desperate to perform in Jack's porno.Paul Thomas Anderson has created a fascinating alternative family. Everybody is terrific in this movie. Burt Reynolds makes a great comeback. I wish he did more with it in the following years. Mark Wahlberg makes a great leap forward in his acting. Julianne Moore solidifies her acting credentials. Heather Graham is amazing. The whole cast is amazing. In the hands of a directing artist, this is an amazing achievement.",Boogie Nights
4,lee_eisenberg,like it is,8,19 January 2006,"When ""Boogie Nights"" came out, Mark Wahlberg was a has-been rapper (although he'd co-starred in ""Renaissance Man"" and ""The Basketball Diaries""), and we'd never even heard of Paul Thomas Anderson (although he'd directed one movie: ""Hard Eight""). Since then, their careers have proliferated. The movie of course deals with the 1970s porn industry, and the various aspects thereof. We see the decadence inherent in the whole thing, and it isn't pretty. The movie chronicles the rise of Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler (Wahlberg), and his decline as his vanity takes over. Wahlberg is great, as are Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, and John C. Reilly.Oh, and one more thing. That poem in that one scene was S-O-O-O-O-O stupid! Of course, they were portraying it to be so.",Boogie Nights
5,jboothmillard,Boogie Nights,8,8 July 2005,"From writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, There Will Be Blood), this might have looked like a really seedy film, focusing on the porn industry, but it is actually a really good portrayal of the times. Basically, in the late 1970's, high school drop out and bar worker Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) is approached by adult filmmaker Jack Horner (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Burt Reynolds), who wants him to become his new big star. After running away from home, Edie practises a ""scene"" first with co-worker Rollergirl (Heather Graham), then he adopts the new name Dirk Diggler, and his ""talent"" is brought to the screen when he performs with Amber Waves (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Julianne Moore). After many other ""performances"", and winning three awards at the 2nd Annual Adult Film Awards, Jack and Dirk, with co-star Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) create a new sex-filled cop show called Brock Landers: Angels Live In My Town, which gets Horner much more notice. The cast and crew of Jack's celebrate the new year and head into the 1980's, but after seeing his wife with other men, Little Bill (William H. Macy) ends the life of his wife on the night, and then himself. One day though this success is taken away when Dirk loses his temper and flees after Jack is not ready to start filming when he is ""ready"". The various characters are now separating from Jack's world, he is trying to get a new talent off the street, Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) is trying to make it in the technology centre business with his own shop, and Dirk and Reed are getting involved with drug dealers like Rahad Jackson (Spider-Man 2's Alfred Molina). In the end though, apologies are made between Dirk and Jack, and the other characters all come back to continue the success they have lost and want back, and the film ends with Dirk finally showing us his ""big talent"". Also starring Philip Seymour Hoffman as Scotty J., Luis Guzmán as Maurice TT Rodriguez, Philip Baker Hall as Floyd Gondolli and Tomorrow Never Dies' Ricky Jay as Kurt Longjohn. It has a really good all star cast, the script makes it not like your typical sex filled film, and the direction is marvellous, a great sex, drugs and disco filled drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay. It was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very good!",Boogie Nights
6,rmax304823,Mature Audiences Only,8,6 January 2008,"An affectionate look at the Golden Age of porn movies, from the late 1970s to, say, the early 1980s. The cast list is filled with familiar names who deliver the goods with expected skill. Philip Seymour Hoffman is unusually fine but then they're almost all outstanding.No need to carry on about the content. It's not prurient. There's very little nudity and the simulated sex is not as exploitative as it is in many far less ambitious and thoughtful erotic thrillers -- ""Body of Evidence,"" for instance, or ""Masquerade."" I'll give an example of some of the acting talent on display here. Julianne Moore is a splendid performer who has become a familiar name not because of her appearance -- she's hardly gorgeous by Hollywood standards -- but because of the subtlety with which she uses her instrument. In ""Boogie Nights"" she plays the wife of Burt Reynolds, a kind of surrogate mother to the cast and crew of the flicks Burt turns out and Moore acts in. There is an important scene in which she and Mark Wahlberg, as a tyro with a preposterous pylon, a monumental masculinity, make love on screen for the first time. He's a nervous wreck, but she's gentle and real and makes him feel less anxious simply by being accommodating. And then the scene is filmed. (One take. Two would cost too much money.) And Moore adopts the character she's playing in the skin flick. In her filmed conversation with Wahlman she strips herself of her natural talent and becomes the kind of fake with the artificial voice that populates the skin flicks of the 70s. She acts as if she can't act.The porn film that used to be shown in theaters goes out of style in the 1980s. Films are now videotaped and Burt Reynolds, who yearns to make a ""real film"" that he will be ""remembered for,"" balks at the change. Neither Reynolds nor anyone else seems to realize that the social world they've built is as evanescent, as friable, as the disco music that serves as its accompaniment. Everything goes downhill, undone not so much by prudery as by properties inherent in the occupation, the Zeitgeist, and, in fact, in human nature -- political correctness, technology, coke, celebrity, materialism, ego, hoary feminist inevitabilities, and the general decadence to which social movements are prone.The direction? Forget that this is a movie about sex and watch the scene towards the end in which Wahlberg and two of his friends visit the house of a rich rock star with the intention of robbing him of all the money he is said to keep in his safe. Things begin to go wrong. The rock star is high as a kite, he has a big black associate armed with two pistols, the pointless electric guitars and percussion from the stereo fill the air with din, an unexpected Chinese guest is setting off firecrackers and each bang makes the three would-be thieves jump in their seats. There is a generous amount of tension in this scene and it would do justice to any more ""respectable"" movie.In the end, things have quieted down and have become quietly peaceful and quietly quiet. The movie's not a tragedy but the story of a tough and uncertain journey through particularly turbulent times, which not all the participants manage to survive.It's pretty good.",Boogie Nights
7,BA_Harrison,An eye-wateringly huge success.,10,12 April 2016,"Yesterday I made the mistake of watching Heather Graham 'comedy' Say It Isn't So' for a second time, having forgotten that I had already seen it in back in 2007 (boy, is that film a stinker—no wonder I blocked it from my memory); today I decided to wash the bad taste out of my mouth by seeing a Heather Graham film that actually holds up to repeat viewing: Boogie Nights, a film so good that even a starring role for Mark Wahlberg cannot spoil it for me.Graham, looking as hot as she ever has, plays roller-skating sexpot Rollergirl, one of a band of L.A. pornographers led by charismatic adult film-maker Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), who is always on the lookout for the next big thing in porn. And they don't come much bigger than Eddie Adams (Wahlberg), discovered by Horner working in a nightclub: with his massive schlong and enviable sexual prowess, he is a natural. As Dirk Diggler, Eddie quickly becomes an industry legend, but with success comes excess, which leads to the young porn-star making some dangerous choices that almost cost him his life.A thoroughly engrossing tale of decadence and corruption, Boogie Nights is a superbly crafted film in virtually every area: the script is gritty, witty, poignant and shocking, brimming with unforgettable characters and sparkling dialogue; the superb period detail and wonderful soundtrack effortlessly transport the viewer to the carefree pre-AIDS days of the late '70s/early '80s; the stellar supporting cast—which includes William H. Macy, Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, Julianne Moore, Luis Guzman, Alfred Molina and Philip Seymour Hoffman—can do no wrong; and with director Paul Thomas Anderson conducting proceedings with oodles of style, taking a leaf or two out of the books of Scorsese and Tarantino along the way, the film looks and feels fantastic throughout.9.5/10, rounded up to full marks for the hilarious disco dancing sequence and Heather Graham's full-frontal scene (what she lacks in acting talent, she definitely makes up for in va-va-voom!).",Boogie Nights
8,moonspinner55,"Cynical, cathartic, exhausting...",6,26 July 2006,"Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's paean to the porno industry of the 1970s is sadly cynical, artistically cathartic, and moderately exhausting. Mark Wahlberg is very good as a disaffected, well-endowed busboy named Eddie who is recruited by an adult filmmaker to appear in skin flicks, eventually becoming the celebrated Dirk Diggler. Burt Reynolds (in a comeback performance) plays his movie-making mentor, and Julianne Moore is a sex starlet who evolves into a mother-figure. Anderson is a great visual talent, and his film is ambitious and audacious, but his attention-span is minimal (he can't seem to get a grip on the continuity, nor is he able to make the general prurience palatable through either sheer talent or chutzpah). As an actor's director, Anderson could also use some focus. He works a near-miracle with Reynolds, who received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, but he doesn't get anything special out of the normally exciting Moore (she's tough to pin down here: gritty yet alluring, she puts out so much sweetly-nuanced artifice that you're not sure there's a person underneath). Don Cheadle as Buck Swope is another problem: too cool for this school, Cheadle has a hard stoniness and aloofness that keeps us distant from him at all times. At this point in his career, Wahlberg is inexperienced, yet it's not overly-obvious; he's handled in a young-dumb way that is never caricatured by Anderson (this kid Diggler is nobody's naïve hick, and all that wide-eyed stuff is thankfully passed over). There are pedantic pit-stops in the road that slow the film down to a crawl, and yet Robert Elswit's head-swimming cinematography is endlessly interesting (almost hallucinogenic). Is the picture a masterpiece? Some seem to think so, but I found Anderson far too enamored of his own ambiance. The characters themselves are interesting enough to make this world of porno-makers bracing to us--and the bitter, skeptical finish is darkly-comic instead of bold or 'shocking'--but ""Boogie Nights"" isn't the shattering personal experience many critics hailed it as. Then again, maybe that's just hype and that Anderson had no intention of hitting some people's nerves so hard. **1/2 from ****",Boogie Nights
9,Quinoa1984,"Odd, Funny and Touching",10,23 January 2000,"Boogie Night's has to be one of the funniest and oddest films I have seen in a long time.  It is a homage to the pornography culture and to adults who will never grow up in California.  The film also has brilliant acting, writing and camera work and is P.T. Anderson's best work yet.Some of the great stuff in this film is the acting which is some of the best of the decade.  Including Burt Reynolds as the director Jack Horner (this is his best piece of acting since the 70's), Julianne Moore as the struggling mother Amber Waves to the young actors and in a very good performance, and Mark Wahlberg in his best performance yet as the kid Dirk Diggler with something extra (13 inches to be exact) that will make him a star.  Also, the supporting cast is top notch and provides a lot of unintentional and sick comedy.But the real good stuff comes from the director Anderson.  He gives us a look into a subject no one else has seen before (or has wanted to see).  The writing is funny and touching and the length gives the film time to sprawl into the masterpiece that it is.  One of the best of 1997.",Boogie Nights
10,edwagreen,When Porn turns Good on Film ***1/2,9,14 September 2014,"A very young Mark Wahlberg steals the show here in this 1997 film showing himself as a high school dropout at dead end jobs until he has a chance meeting with porn promoter Burt Reynolds, which sets him on a new course. His memorable fight scene with mother, Joanna Gleason, is terrific here.The film takes a look at the porn industry with its cast of the usual drug users, as we step into the lives of a variety of people, all searching for their own identity.Don Cheadle is very good here as the guy looking to use the industry to further his music store ambition.",Boogie Nights
11,Theo Robertson,A Great Film On A Difficult Subject,8,26 September 2005,"Despite hearing all the great reviews about Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS I only went out of my way to watch it due to voyeurism . No not that type of voyeurism you dirty lot , I was simply curious to see what someone has to do to break into the world of pornography . You might like to know that an infamous British tabloid used to advertise for what's euphemistically known as "" Video models "" in its classified column . I had a rough idea what this involved but there was no way I was going to apply but that didn't stop me from wondering why anyone would want to get caught up in this business and after seeing BOOGIE NIGHTS I now know that it's for sad unhappy people desperate to make money This is a sad , haunting , compelling film . Eddie Adams a hustler of sorts works as a dish washer where he has a chance meeting with porn director Jack Horner who eventually makes him a porn star and the film charts the rise and fall of Horner's porn company from the late 70s to early 80s . It's character driven so Anderson has to make his characters sympathetic and memorable . We see the weak willed Little Bill who wife taunts him by having sex with strangers , Buck Swope whose main ambition in life is to open his own hi fi store , Amber Waves who has a drug problem and trouble getting access to her children etc . You certainly may dislike what these characters do but you'll find them gaining your sympathy rather than your hatred due to their sad damaged lives . Being a porn star might sound attractive on the surface , especially before AIDS came along , but it's a career that leads to self destruction Anderson has written a very good script but that's not much use if he can't get the best out of his cast but he succeeds . He has cast very reliable character actors like Julianne Moore , William H Macy , Luis Guzman and John C Reilly who as you can imagine do their best with the script but casting Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds as the two key characters Eddie and Jack seems like professional suicide and amazingly they're both outstanding . I don't think I've seen Reynolds ever give a better performance than the one here and if you just know him via crap like STRIPTEASE prepare to be blown away Obviously this isn't a film to watch with your parents or even with a bunch of friends on a night in . It's not often that Hollywood produces such an intelligent film and it's a pity that BOOGIE NIGHTS seems to have been a victim of poor timing where it was released in between LA CONFIDENTIAL and TITANIC ensuring that it missed out on more critical acclaim and awards . It did pick up three Oscar nominations but it deserved so much more . Perhaps the Academy didn't want to spoil the 27 year old Anderson with too many nominations at such a tender age ?",Boogie Nights
12,grantss,Great second movie from PT Anderson,8,17 January 2021,"Paul Thomas Anderson's debut movie, Hard Eight, was decent, especially for a debut offering. For his second movie, Anderson, as writer and director, goes into an area and industry that most writers/directors wouldn't have the temerity to explore, especially so early in their careers - the porn industry.The result is great. Anderson spins a wonderfully quirky and engaging tale centred around a porn producer, his actors and crew set in the 1970s. Part of the attraction to the movie is the novelty of the subject matter, which then makes for some quite funny sub-plots.Some great drama too, as you see that these are just everyday people, working in an unusual industry.Great performances all round by a cast that, in hindsight, was an all-star one. Some of the cast were reasonably well-known - Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, William H Macy - but this film also turned lesser-known actors into stars: Mark Wahlberg, Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, John C Reilly.",Boogie Nights
13,Boba_Fett1138,The rise and fall of a porn star.- A surprisingly epic movie.,9,13 August 2006,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie at first. I expected this movie to be a fun and non-serious one. After all the movie its premise and concept seems at first sight like fun comedy material rather than heavy dramatic stuff. Overall the movie did had a fun and non-serious feeling and atmosphere all over it but the movie is not without good and powerful dramatic moments as well. The movie and its story even take epic proportions at times, especially in the movie its second halve. You can say that this movie really surprised me in a positive about how good it was and it surely surpassed all my expectations.Basically this movie is a great example of good storytelling. It takes its time to set out the lines. Lots of characters are introduced and the movie takes its time to develop every one of them. The first halve of the movie sets up things and it does this in a pretty lighthearted and fun way, with lots of crazy over-the-top, stereotypical characters. Once the second halve kicks in the movie becomes more dramatic and serious. It all works surprisingly powerful and effective. Surprising, since it's obviously in contrast with the first halve of the movie. ""Boogie Nights"" is a well balanced movie that gets heavy and serious but never without its overall fun lighthearted atmosphere. The characters and situations force you to not take this movie serious, no matter how heavy and dramatic it gets. In this case that is not a bad thing, since it all is so extremely well balanced. It's like the one thing helps to make the other better in this movie, instead of working distracting from- or making it not credible.The movie also does a very good job at recreating the feeling, look and atmosphere of the '70's. It does this of course with its clothes, sets and facial hair but also with more subtle things such as its dialog. It all helps to make ""Boogie Nights"" a very style-full looking movie with a creative feeling and atmosphere of its own.It does a good and creative job at keeping the nudity and sex sequences to a minimum, although it of course is impossible to keep out all the nudity and controversy. That is simply impossible, since the movie is about a controversial subject. The movie provides a good refreshing and I think also realistic(?) look into the world of porn in the '70's and '80's, when the video's and cinematic adult movies were new and popular. It however does this in a respectful way without making really any fun of it. It's highly tempting to turn a movie set in the '70's into a satirical comedy of that era. It does make fun of several things, such as the typical '70's television series but the movie never turns into a full satire.The movie is filled with some wonderful and well known actors, who all give a very good performance. Many big names are involved and that says something about the quality of the Oscar nominated script, that obviously inspired and impressed the fine actors involved. Mark Wahlberg shows that he can handle a big and heavy carrying role. He shows his qualities and skills in this movie. Also really great were Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore, who both were nominated for an Oscar as well. Other fine roles are being portrayed by good and well known actors such as Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Don Cheadle, Thomas Jane, Luis Guzmán and Alfred Molina. Yes, it certainly is true that there are many and perhaps too many characters in the movie. It tries too follow one or two too many plot lines with as a result that not everything and everyone works out quite well enough. This perhaps is the only flaw in this otherwise great, wonderful, compelling and powerful movie. A fun to watch but yet also wonderful compelling and powerful movie about the rise and fall of a porn star in the '70's/'80's. A movie that takes surprising epic proportions! Certainly among the very best movies of the '90's.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Boogie Nights
14,evanston_dad,Boogie Till You Drop,9,25 August 2006,"No one will ever accuse Paul Thomas Anderson of subtlety, and if any one word describes his approach to material, ""excessive"" will do the trick, but the boy sure can put together one hell of an entertaining movie.In a blast of disco and neon, ""Boogie Nights"" comes blazing from the screen in an orgy of dazzling camera-work and funky 70s and 80s tunes (one of the best soundtracks ever compiled for a movie). Anderson with his camera is like a little boy who just got the toy he wanted more than anything else for Christmas, and he goes wild with it. It swirls around actors in ridiculously long takes, follows them on to the dance floor as they do the hustle, catches elaborately choreographed segments in single shots. The camera gives the sense of never wanting to be left behind by the action, and at one point even plunges under water in a swimming pool to follow one of the many extras at a party scene who decides to go for a dip. Anderson wants to do way too much with the movie, and he doesn't know when to quit. He's like a writer so in love with his story that he doesn't want to leave anything out, even when his material becomes redundant. I can't help but feel that a long sequence late in the movie featuring a wild cameo by Alfred Molina should have been left on the cutting room floor, but then another part of me would hate to miss out on this wonderfully bizarre segment. The whole movie is like that. Even when Anderson pushes too far and too hard, you're carried along by his enthusiasm for his own film.Anderson's style is certainly reminiscent of Altman's, but he's not an Altman rip-off. In many ways he's the opposite of Altman; you never feel that Anderson is anything less than in complete control of his movies (and this feeling increases if you watch the documentary of the making of ""Magnolia"") whereas Altman's films seem to come together despite his attempts to instill chaos on his actors. But both share the knack for being able to build a film around a unifying tone rather than any rigidly imposed dramatic structure, and they're both wonderful with actors.And speaking of actors.....""Boogie Nights"" would be nothing without its astounding ensemble. Burt Reynolds leads the pack in the performance of a career, but he's certainly not alone. Julianne Moore and Don Cheadle are terrific here as usual, but even Heather Graham, whose career has gone nowhere, impresses. John C. Reilly should probably have been directed to tone down the jokiness of his performance, as he strains credibility in every scene he's in, but he's so damn funny that you don't really care. And Mark Wahlberg has proved himself to be a fine actor, pulling off this difficult role with aplomb. His performance here coupled with his performance in ""I Heart Huckabees"" convinces me that he may be one of the most promising young actors in circulation. Who ever would have thought that? ""Boogie Nights"" may be a step or two shy of greatness, but I dare you to watch this movie and not have a great time. Groove on, man.Grade: A",Boogie Nights
15,Uriah43,Loosely Based on the Life of John C. Holmes,5,19 October 2018,"""Eddie Adams"" (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school dropout who lives with his mother and step-father and works at a nightclub as a dishwasher. One night while working he is noticed by a man named ""Jack Horner"" (Burt Reynolds) who is a director of pornographic films and is looking for new talent. So when Jack learns that Eddie is endowed with an extremely large penis he asks Eddie to audition in front of him with an aspiring female actress named ""Rollergirl"" (Heather Graham). One thing leads to another and not long afterward Eddie has moved in with Jack, changed his name to ""Dirk Diggler"" and becomes a star in the adult film industry. Unfortunately, like everything else in this particular business, a person can only stay on top for so long and soon Eddie's pride, lack of maturity and his newly acquired cocaine habit begin to take a toll on him--and all of his colleagues as well. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that Mark Wahlberg's character is largely based on the life of John C. Holmes with a number of other lesser-known individuals and scenarios thrown in for good measure. To that effect, this was a highly acclaimed film with both Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore (as ""Amber Waves"") being nominated for several awards for their performances including ""Best Supporting Actor"" and ""Best Supporting Actress"" respectively. Having said that, however, although I thought that this was a satisfactory film, I have to admit that it seemed a bit too long and lost its focus along the way. There were just one too many sub-plots. For that reason I have rated it accordingly.",Boogie Nights

He discovers Mark Wahlberg as the amusingly named Dirk Diggler, a dishwasher and renders him his star player. His success leads to drugs and the fear of replacement as numerous awards. Julianne Moore plays the leading lady undergoing a child custody battle. Heather Graham steals scenes as Rollergirl who roller-skates in the nude. John C. Reilly plays Diggler's co-star in amateur porn, as well as being a magician. Great ensemble cast playing outcasts rejected from society. Brilliantly observant view by director Paul Thomas Anderson who previously tested the waters with Hard Eight. We sense Wahlberg's rejection from home and his longing for acceptance, and Reynolds as director Jack Horner whose frustration to create art out of exploitation. Moore plays Amber Waves who tackles directing as well as provide a mother figure where she failed in reality. Anderson juggles several subplots as this large cast interact but he also gives great vision into the seventies porn industry. Great film about broken lives lead by lust, fame and the desire to matter. Score: 9 / 10",Boogie Nights
17,gradyharp,Re-Visiting BOOGIE NIGHTS,8,20 February 2012,"Though 15 years have passed since the first showing of this 1997 diatribe about life in the 1970s from the darker view of the 'entertainment industry', it still remains one of the better spoofs of how everyone will sacrifice most everything for a moment of fame. Written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson this story is one about a family of pornographers and their antics and relationships and anti-relationships and how seeming innocence can blossom into a wild ride of crime and drug-addled existence.What makes this noisy, overly long (155 minutes) loud mess of a film work so well is the cast of actors gathered for both bit roles and leading character studies. Burt Reynolds is the director head of the porn family who 'discovers' Eddie Adams AKA Dirk Diggler has a prodigious physical attribute that is guaranteed to 'make him a star'. Rather innocently Dirk becomes involved with the porn industry but falls down that road of drugs and crime with the only remaining attribute being the anatomical part that is responsible for his rise to fame. Along the way we met his fellow porn star John C. Reilly, the gay photo crew member Philip Seymour Hoffman, porn queen Julianne Moore, Heather Graham on skates, Don Cheadle as a former porn star who gets caught up in a Tarantino-type murder spree in a doughnut shop, Alfred Molina as a zany coke-head, and other characters played by Thomas Jane, William H. Macy, Nicole Ari Parker, Philip Baker Hall, Melora Walters, Luis Guzman... it just goes on an on.Anderson creates multiple vignettes that allow us, the audience, to understand these wildly crazy people's need for acceptance and for forgiveness and redemption. The film has become a cult project - one that despite how fine he is in this role that Mark Wahlberg would probably rather see just go away (especially his final scene). It is a colorful, feisty, naughty, fun peak at the forbidden. It will be around for a very long time! Grady Harp",Boogie Nights
18,Mr-Fusion,This baby just draws you in,8,20 January 2015,"I wasn't a fan of MAGNOLIA, so I didn't walk into BOOGIE NIGHTS expecting much. But even if my standards were higher, I think this movie would've delivered. It's just that satisfying. Among the things this movie does right (a very well chosen cast, great production design that brings the '70s to life, and an excellent soundtrack), the characters are what really make it live and breathe. These are real people, funny, tragic, naïve, sleazy; they run the gamut. What's more, this is set against the porn industry, so it's disarming when you find yourself caring so much for people who live and deal in sleaze. When things are up, it's exciting. When the chips are down, it's just punishing (Whalberg's assault and Moore's custody hearing, especially). On second thought, I don't even think there's really a happy ending to the story - but just returning to the status quo is enough for all involved. And as great as Burt Reynolds is, playing slime so earnestly, Alfred Molina walked away with the movie.Great stuff.8/10. . . Also, I love that they gave Whalberg a Transformers song in the studio. It's just so random.",Boogie Nights
19,christopher-underwood,"the film works, like some dream",9,4 June 2019,"Very impressive piece of film making from Paul Thomas Anderson. Great spot on visuals and dialogue but it is his ability to guide actors that is probably the most important aspect to this. Burt Reynolds is famously dismissive of the film, the director and his role and yet for me he has never been better. If only he had been encouraged to perform in this more low key and controlled way more often. Others are encouraged to be more demonstrative and Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as the besotted youngster is a little embarrassing but so believable in this mixed up and crazy world. Mark Wahlberg has also been known to be a bit sniffy about his part in this but has he surpassed this role, one wonders. Similarly, Anderson extracts from Julianne Moore, surely one of her greatest performances. Overall, the film works, like some dream, rolling from one incident to another, highs and lows all contributing to the creation of the ultimate sex film at a time when so many were made in such a short space of time. The inevitable toll upon the participants is well illustrated and in such a way that we tend to be sympathetic rather than morally judgemental. Great film.",Boogie Nights

22,StevePulaski,A sprawling portrait of male insecurity and female dehumanization,9,24 November 2015,"Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights adheres to many conventions of gender in terms of the way it portrays women, but subverts its portrayal of men by highlighting masculine insecurity and the fear of being inadequate. The film concerns a young man named Eddie, played by Mark Wahlberg, who has dropped out of high school and is making ends meet working as a busboy at a nightclub and living with his parents. One day on the job, he catches the eye of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), a renowned porn director during the industry's ""Golden Age,"" who admires his natural attractiveness and invites him to come spend time with him at his enormous ranch. Numerous people live under Jack's roof, including a young starlet named ""Rollergirl"" (Heather Graham), nicknamed because of her obsession with her rollerblades, Maggie (Julianne Moore), an older porn actress famous for a long-running series of films, Buck (Don Cheadle), a struggling stereo salesman, and Reed (John C. Reilly), a squirrelly man who seems to just live off of Jack's dime. Upon running away from home, Eddie soon becomes ""Dirk Diggler,"" one of the industry's most famous and acclaimed porn stars almost overnight; he is glitzed with awards, recognition, and more money than he could ever spend, but slowly allows his masculinity and fragile ego to command him as a person. Such concepts heavily adhere to feminist film writer Laura Mulvey's ideas of ""phallocentrism"" and the male gaze. With that, Boogie Nights handles male and female characters quite differently, giving the male characters an inferiority complex that makes them define their worth based on their own personal work, and the two main female characters in the film dichotomous roles, one to showcase attractiveness and the other to showcase the lack thereof.The pornographic industry has always been under fire for its treatment and sexualized depictions of women. Paul Thomas Anderson immediately dismantles that assertion by giving it some equality; in porn, everyone, regardless of race or gender, is a sex object, though most pay to see said films to have their eyes locked on the females in the film. Consider the fact that in Boogie Nights, Rollergirl, while having a name, which you may have missed, lacks a character. Her mysteriousness is part of her aura and that's the attraction in porn, Anderson subtly implies. Because we don't know much about Rollergirl as a character, we, the audience, can appreciate her for her flesh and ability to have sex because we can't look beneath the surface at her character. Her flat characterization, while devaluing her as a person, essentially makes her successful at what she is trying to convey; an empty vessel capable of great sex many men of varying different ages can only dream about. Had we learned about Rollergirl as a person – maybe she had a troubled childhood, did poorly in school, or simply doesn't have a strong and sustainable relationship with her family – she would've become less attractive because she would've had more baggage, and that's not the kind of pleasure we pay to see or hear when we watch pornography. Anderson showcases this by portraying Rollergirl as unbridled sexiness as a porn starlet.Read the full analysis on my blog, http://stevepulaski.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-penis-power-and- predicaments.html",Boogie Nights
23,Smells_Like_Cheese,A terrific and disturbingly truthful movie about the porno industry,10,7 March 2006,"The 70's, a time of freedom and just getting down those groovy nights. There was also, believe it or not(directed to my generation) a porno industry. The cheesy pornos we all can enjoy and mock for their vintage moments. Well, Boogie Nights is the down and dirty truth of what it's like to not only be in the business, but what it does to you and your reputation. How low can you sink even though you promised yourself not to get into that kind of trouble.The acting is just phenomenal, Mark Walhberg without a doubt stole the show with his grisly and naive performance as Dirk Diggler. He wasn't alone though, Burt Reynolds did a great job as a father figure to Dirk and leading director in the business. Julianne was so terrific trying to be a mother figure and a sex goddess at the same time, and Heather could actually act in the film! I'm not kidding, she did a good job. I know I kinda cut this short, but the whole film is just a great one. Please, I highly recommend this movie for a watch.10/10",Boogie Nights
24,MovieAddict2016,Fantastic - one of the best of all-time; Anderson is amazing.,10,9 December 2004,"'Boogie Nights' uses its protagonist, Dirk Diggler, as a metaphor for accumulated celebrities from a decade in America's shameful past, which was comprised of an unexpected rise in pornography, therefore resulting in an abundance of corrupted youth. Its lead character borrows traits from a various assortment of genuine actors, involving himself in many illegal affairs that have been dabbled in by celebrities in Hollywood, and all-too-often exploited by the press. It seems like the sort of tall tale that might appear on an E! True Hollywood Story special. Drugs, sex and violence -- the American Dream. But what goes up must come down, and the bigger it is, the harder it falls.Dirk Diggler's dreams are huge, as is another valuable asset on his body. Dirk's real name is Eddie Adams, a Californian who dreams of becoming a star. He believes that God gives one great talent to every individual on the planet, and his gift is a rather unusual one. After falling out with his mother, Eddie leaves home and meets the sleazy Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), an adult film director who offers him work. Eddie eventually becomes a major porn star, representing the leading ""actor"" in most of Horner's films. With newfound success, Eddie is told that he needs to invent a new alias for himself, and so Dirk Diggler is born.Eddie/Dirk himself is primarily based on infamous porn star John Holmes, whose life story was adapted in 2003 with 'Wonderland', which starred Val Kilmer. 'Boogie Nights' is unarguably the better of the two, proving that movies about pornography can be made without disgusting its target audience: regular cinema-goers.The film takes place in 1977, an era of artistic pornography -- filmmakers truly believed that they could compensate for the low points of X-rated features by adding deep stories and mesmerizing atmosphere. In a way, the film's director -- Paul Thomas Anderson -- implements a very artistic approach to the project, resulting in a gratuitous and artistic movie about a period in American history when smut was indeed both gratuitous and artistic. Anderson's style is so deep, and so distinct, that we soon feel as if we are reliving the era first-hand. Not a moment goes by where we are unconvinced of the time range dealt with in the film.All was not happy on the set of 'Boogie Nights'. Prior to filming, Anderson approached Reynolds repeatedly, asking him many separate times to play the role of Horner. Eventually, Reynolds agreed, but claimed that the film was horrible and the worst role of his career, publicly disowning it, before being nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award and suddenly shutting up. A year before, Anderson had suffered title disputes over Sydney/Hard Eight. He preferred the latter title for his film, and New Line Cinema thought the former was more marketable. He essentially lost the battle, and Anderson wisely avoided title disputes this time around by inserting the words ""boogie nights"" into his movie through the mouth of a character.The casting of the film is one of its finest aspects. The Paul Thomas Anderson regulars are here, as well as a whole top-notch cast of first-timers. To name some of the more well-known stars: John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Luis Guzman, William H. Macy, Heather Graham and Julianne Moore. But the entire movie essentially borders down to Mark Wahlberg, as Eddie, who is surprisingly convincing in his role. Wahlberg, previously known for his singing career and disappointing Hollywood pursuits, has all the necessary traits to portray such a character. This is his best role to date.Anderson knows how to captivate his audience and take complete control of every scene. When Jack Horner first meets Eddie, Anderson slyly uses stars in the backdrop, a sign of things to come, and hidden symbolism as finely acute as it can be. The opening scene is three minutes, a long tracking shot that follows Jack and Amber into a night club, where most of the characters are first introduced. It reminds me of the discussions regarding tracking shots in Robert Altman's 'The Player' -- it works so brilliantly in Boogie Nights, and is the first indication that Anderson knows what he is doing behind the camera. His style is fast-paced in the vein of Martin Scorsese, where shots zip around quite quickly but never seem rushed. Incidentally, Anderson references two classic Scorsese shots -- the closing De Niro mirror speech from 'Raging Bull' and the tracking nightclub scene from 'GoodFellas'. Anderson is a young, growing director who is remarkably mature in story and direction, despite his age. Whereas his first feature film, 'Hard Eight', was noticeably wise and poignant, 'Boogie Nights' is even more so.'Boogie Nights' began as an effort of love on Paul Thomas Anderson's account. Having filmed the extraordinary Hard Eight in 1996, Anderson's film is pragmatic to such an extreme that it almost seems genuine. Boogie Nights invigorates us with its gratuitous content, occasionally bordering on the verge of pornography, only it is far more sophisticated than such trash. It is a blazing, wonderful modern-day masterpiece that is as mind-numbingly explicit as it is wild and stylish. Arguably Anderson's best film and among the greatest -- and most important -- projects of the last decade.",Boogie Nights
25,lasttimeisaw,Boogie Nights,8,29 November 2011,"I first watched this film 10 years ago in the college, and this film literally had brought Paul Thomas Anderson into the stardom as the young peer group of American auteurs, 4 films in 14 years, (BOOGIE NIGHTS, MAGNOLIA 1999, PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE 2002 and THERE WILL BE BLOOD 2007, and his upcoming project THE MASTER is now due in 2013), which comes across as he also acquire the scarce pace of a true auteur in this fast-food generation. BOOGIE NIGHTS is Anderson's self-scripted chronicle narrative of a young porn star Dirk Diggler's up-and-down in 1970s and 1980s and concurrently it depicts a vivid milieu of the entire pornographic ventures. The multi-linear structure is a great bliss of his genius, of course the apex would arrive belatedly in MAGNOLIA. Also well-received is Anderson's laborious long- shots (notably the beginning shot and the swimming pool party shot) do wonders to meet and eyes and synopsize various characters into a neat yet comprehensive introduction. A stellar cast which generated two Oscar nomination for then-veteran Reynolds and now- veteran Moore, which out of my preference, Moore should have won her golden man for her first nomination (over Kim Basinger) and Reynolds' nomination is more like a career recognition for his 35-years-long devotion in the show business. And Mark Wahlberg's nominal main character is sidelined but still it's his best work so far. Don Cheadle, Heather Graham (the unforgettable roller-girl) and William H. Macy (a short but dynamic presence also for Thomas Jane and Alfred Molina) are also among the stand-outs in the film. The film holds firmly within its epic length, 155 minutes, until the curtain call arrives in a final showdown, which is phony, but the amazing integrity of the pace and the quirky but fun- studded sway of the film assure me that Paul Thomas Anderson might go much further than Quentin Tarantino in his brighter pathway as a screenwriter and director.",Boogie Nights
26,Red-Barracuda,"Dynamic, hilarious and hard-hitting - a genuinely great film",10,4 October 2014,"Boogie Nights feels quite similar to gangster films such as Goodfellas in that it is about a close-knit 'family' who exist in a closed-off world, out-with the mainstream. Unlike that aforementioned crime film, the characters here are largely misfits and lost souls. But stylistically, director Paul Thomas Anderson follows the style laid down by Martin Scorsese pretty closely. What with the fluid cinematography with bravura long-takes; the specific period detail captured by way of the colours, dress, decor and music of the time – including some priceless recreations of dialogue scenes based on genuine 70's porn films. But this is no mere Scorsese clone; it has a life and feel all of its own. The fabulous script mixes comedy and tragedy in a highly effective way – the humour is laugh-out-loud funny, while the dark elements pull no punches. There are several contrasts of the porn industry that are examined – the 70's 'innocence' vs 80's cynicism, the porn golden age vs straight-to-video low-rent. All of these dynamics fuel the plot-line which effectively works as a rise-and-fall narrative, with an ending which has some hope yet illustrates the inescapable trap that the porn industry creates.What takes all of this up several levels more is that this is an ensemble film of the highest level. The cast here is quite brilliant. Impressively, many of these actors and actresses, who would go on to make great careers, make their breakthrough performances here. Burt Reynolds wasn't one of those but his role here as porn director Jack Horner was his best since Deliverance (1972) and his measured performance here was rewarded with an Academy Award nomination. Then there is Mark Wahlberg in the central role as Dirk Diggler, he proved himself as more than capable of leading a film and shows considerable skills at both comic and dramatic acting. Julianne Moore puts in a towering performance as Amber Waves the porn queen who fights a doomed custody battle to get access to her child and whose maternal instincts are transferred to others within her porn family. Heather Graham is unforgettable as the super-hot starlet Rollergirl who never removes her skates. John C. Reilly is very funny as the veteran porn actor who takes Dirk under his wing. Don Cheadle is both funny and sympathetic as a bizarrely country-and-western fixated stereo-salesman who does porn on the side. Philip Seymour Hoffman makes a huge mark as the super-awkward crew-member who is in love with Dirk. William H. Macy is the assistant director who is consistently humiliated by his porn star wife's hilariously public infidelities, leading to tragedy.There are far too many classic scenes to mention in this one. It never misses a step all the way. Boogie Nights isn't just very good, it's one of the very best. A triumph in every way.",Boogie Nights
27,paul2001sw-1,Rudefellas,8,24 September 2005,"A life of luxurious excess on the outer fringes of the law decays with the coming of the 1980s amid cocaine-fuelled hysteria: Paul Thomas Anderson's film 'Boogie Nights' attempts to do for the American porn industry what 'Goodfellas' did for the mafia. The scope is broad, the cast is large, the movie is unfailingly entertaining (although a prosthetically-enhanced Mark Wahlberg is perhaps a little too sweet for his role). What's surprising is that, in spite of its apparently sordid subject matter, it's a lot less dark than 'Hard Eight' or 'Magnolia', two other films of Anderson's I've seen; Jack Horner (a grey-curled Burt Reynolds), who wants to make art porn (or at least, porn movies that have real plot and character), is presented almost as an Ed Wood-style idealist, albeit with the significant difference that porn pays rather better than sci-fi. It could even be said that complete absence of social commentary (exemplified by deliberate decision to end the story just before the coming of A.I.D.S.) means that this is fundamentally a film about nothing; but it's still hard not to enjoy.",Boogie Nights
28,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Saturday night fever.,6,15 August 2019,"Ostensibly, 'Boogie Nights (1997)' is about finding a family in the most unlikely of places. Really, it's just about a guy with a really big Richard. The characters don't really change, the side-plots have as much substance as the main story and, generally, it sort of feels like a messy music biopic. Of course, it's not centred around music and there's nothing biographical about it (although a couple of its characters are apparently pretty closely based on real-life people), but it has the same semi-aimless vibe as most entries in that genre. The music biopic often falls into the trap of being baggy because it has some sort of obligation to either the 'truth' or to an estate-controlling survivor, but this picture has no such excuse; it's completely fictional, for starters. The 'true story' feel is more than likely intentional and, in some ways, it creates an interesting effect. Still, the story could've been tightened up a bit and a few tangible themes wouldn't have gone amiss, either. Basically, it's a little like 'Magnolia (1999)' without the bizarrely ever-escalating tension or underlying sense of portentous doom. It's just as concerned with coincidence, for example. While it doesn't seem to be 'about' anything in particular, it is intermittently entertaining. It's also not boring and, while never exactly compelling, it's perfectly watchable throughout. It doesn't pass judgement on any of its characters but, in the process, forgets to get you to care about them. However, it is occasionally fairly funny, primarily when it dips into pseudo pastiche. Look, the film's not great but it's not bad, either. It's engaging and enjoyable enough to be worth a watch, but it's too long and baggy to be counted as one of P. T. Anderson's best. 6/10",Boogie Nights
29,g-bodyl,Great Character Drama!,9,31 March 2014,"The career of Paul Thomas Anderson has been sprinkled with many fantastic films with such unique takes on characterization. Such films like Magnolia, The Master, and There Will Be Blood are all unique this way. Now Boogie Nights can be added to that list. This movie features vibrant storytelling and features lots of sex and drugs. No, this not an adult movie directly but it's more of an indirect adult movie aimed at the mainstream moviegoers.Anderson's film is about a guy named Eddie Adams who works at an L.A nightclub where he is discovered by porn director, Jack Horner. Now Eddie begins his new life as an adult star where he enjoys sex, drugs, and fame. But is this life truly for him? One would agree that this film has an incredible cast. Mark Wahlberg gives his break-out performance as Eddie and it's one of his best performances. Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore give out Oscar-worthy performances as well. The rest of the cast in John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Don Cheadle all create a very fine ensemble.Overall, Boogie Nights is a great film and one that adds a nice touch to the resume of Paul Thomas Anderson. It's a little lengthy especially for something like this source material, but the story is told in such a vibrant way. It's colorful, sexy, violent, and nearly a masterpiece of film.

Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, William H. Macy, William H. Macy, and three Academy Awards nominations grant at least that it's not a bad movie. The screenplay is pretty much cliché story about rise and fall of any star in show business, but acting and characterization are really good and make us bind to the characters real easy. Also, beautiful (and naked) women and good music are always a welcome bonus. But this potential masterpiece is flawed by its length. It is good, but not good enough to hold undivided attention for two and a half hours. Somewhere about half, it has begun to loosen its grip and, I cannot say I was bored, but it simply lost me.

35,tomgillespie2002,"Dazzling, funny and uniquely absorbing",9,18 February 2016,"I must have watched writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights over thirty times in my life. Around 1999, it represented cinematic perfection to me and I would view it repeatedly. Now almost 20 years old - although I no longer consider it as the pinnacle of cinema - I still consider it great and to be one of the best movies of the 90's. This is mainly down to how fresh is still feels, with its show-off yet breathtaking long-takes, moments of off-the-wall humour, and dead-on depictions of the decadent 70's through to the over-indulgent 80's, which all assist the film in sweeping you into its hidden world of glamour, sex and drugs.That world is the world of pornography, though through Anderson's lens it doesn't feel too dissimilar to Hollywood itself, just on a smaller scale. The young, handsome and unnervingly well-endowed Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) is working in the kitchen of a Hollywood nightclub when he is talent spotted by porno auteur Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). Jack knows that ""there is something special behind those jeans just waiting to get out,"" and soon enough Eddie has renamed himself Dirk Diggler and is the hottest porn star in the country. With success comes the big house, the designer clothes and the fancy sports car, but also lots of cocaine.Clearly inspired by the work of Robert Altman, Boogie Nights boasts a fantastic ensemble of interesting characters, all hugely endearing despite their obvious flaws. Jack lives with porn star Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), who doesn't get to see her son due to her lavish lifestyle, and Rollergirl (Heather Graham), another actress fresh out of school who never takes her skates off. Dirk buddies up with Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly), an aspiring magician who idolises his enigmatic co-star. Behind the camera are Little Bill (William H. Macy), the timid scriptwriter whose wife (played by real-life porn star Nina Hartley) openly sleeps with other men, and Scottie (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who becomes smitten with Dirk. There's also Buck (Don Cheadle), a stereo-system obsessive going through an image crisis.Anderson was only 26 when the film was released, hot off the disappointingly pedestrian Hard Eight (1996), and yet despite his youth he pulled of something remarkably complex with Boogie Nights. Not only is it a peek behind the curtain of a business normally portrayed as sleazy and distasteful, seen through the eyes of those who operate it, but also a summary of the shift in social attitudes and values at the time, from feelings of optimism and sexual expression of the 70's, to the greed and paranoia of the 80's. As Dirk's drug consumption spirals out of control, he struggles to perform and falls out with Jack. One standout scene near the final act sees Dirk, Reid and mustachioed sleazeball Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) attempt to pull off a drug deal with a friendly but unhinged Alfred Molina.It's during this scene that Anderson lingers on Dirk's face for a considerable amount of time. Although it probably only lasts about 25 seconds, it manages to pin-point his moment of realisation while allowing the audience time to some up their feelings towards him. And most probably, despite his horrible and selfish actions, you'll still hope it turns out well for him. The camera plays like a character sometimes, whether it be swooping in and out of a pool in one of the many homages to Martin Scorsese, or lingering on producer Colonel James's (Robert Ridgely) startled face as he sees Dirk's prize asset for the first time. Anderson would go on to prove himself one of the finest of his generation with Magnolia (1999), There Will Be Blood (2007) and The Master (2012), but Boogie Nights is still one of his best - dazzling, funny, and uniquely absorbing.",Boogie Nights
36,Floated2,Bold and Engaging,9,3 May 2019,"Boogie Nights has been hailed as a masterpiece and one of Paul Thomas Anderson's best films, and after watching the film, can see why the film is as praised as it is. It is increasingly engaging, entertaining and really never dull.Filled with many unique and interesting characters, and full of great subplots and story lines that everything occurring is quite a unique ride and a must watch until the very end.What makes this film as great is not only the characters of course, or the chemistry between these characters, it's how everything ties together in the end. This somewhat reminded of Pulp Fiction in that sense.Boogie Nights is quite a hard rated R movie, but this was most definitely needed and not watered down in the slightest. It shows the ups and downs of the adult film industry and shows how much work it can take to make it in that industry. A lot of memorable scenes throughout.Overall, Boogie Nights is bold, daring and the performances from each lead (mainly Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds but everyone was great) bring a specific magic that carries the entire picture throughout.Even though the film is quite lengthy, with a running time of over two hours thirty five minutes, but since much is happening, it doesn't feel nearly as long or even boring. We rarely see films like this in today's day, and having watching this for the first time this year- 2019, one can say that this movie holds up greatly.",Boogie Nights
37,TheMovieDiorama,"Boogie Nights tackles a rather bizarre industry, that being pornography.",8,27 February 2018,"Can't say I've seen many theatrical released dramas about adult films, so this is new territory. Pornography is, obviously, very popular and this film showcases the rise of said industry in the 70's and its downhill in the 80's. It centres around the fictional Dirk Diggler (that name...it's just beautiful) and how he finds success through a adult film director named Jack Horner. Being in that type of business, Dirk starts becoming susceptible to the lavish lifestyle and the drugs and crime that follow. A fascinating albeit daring subject to tackle, director Paul Thomas Anderson manages to make it a rather compelling story. Slight tonal inconsistencies, particularly in the third act where it just loses steam but overall I found this to be thoroughly entertaining with dark comedic moments. It's another Anderson movie where his direction takes precedent. Super nice long takes that just lets the characters interact. Whether it be having sex, sniffing cocaine or running away from a shotgun wielding psychopath, the characters resembled the 70's. The disco attire looked fantastically authentic and really made me want to get down and boogie in my lounge (was so tempted...). Acting was outstanding all round. Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds deserved their award nominations. Mark Wahlberg pulled off that sparky confident teenager role well. When it came to filming the pornography, the acting was incredibly cheesy which was sooo good to see. They honestly nailed it. Then seeing how porn progressed to amateur and drive-by within the 80's was interesting. I'm not addicted to porn or anything, but it's a refreshing subject to watch instead of slavery, haunted houses or World War II. So yes, despite the inconsistent tones this was incredibly enjoyable with phenomenal direction.",Boogie Nights

Anderson successfully pulls off the gigantic tale of a young porn star clearly modeled on Long Dong Silver, but aptly named Dirk Diggler for this film.  Lots of fancy music and gorgeous women provide a fun gloss to a story that is essentially sad.  Anderson manages to be almost too sentimental while at the same time not flinching from all the grotesque aspects of Diggler's twisted life.  Reynolds is great in his part, although the script expects him to carry a lot of weight on his shoulders -- he's sort of the father figure for all his ""stars"" and for the movie itself as well.  Good acting overall, talky script.",Boogie Nights
41,Anonymous_Maxine,Confessions of a porn industry,9,2 April 2001,"Boogie Nights is a surprisingly good drama that deals with one man's rise and fall in the adult film industry. Mark Wahlberg delivers one of the best performances of his career as Eddie Adams, the young man who is spotted at his job as a busboy by porn filmmaker Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), and who changes his name to Dirk Diggler, the newest and temporarily most popular porn star in the business. Wahlberg even managed to make the screaming, emotional scene very convincing, which is the type of scene that is almost always screwed up (see about 90% of Chasing Amy). Evidently, Horner's dream is to make an adult film that has a good story, and literally sucks the audience into it. Maybe there should have been some debate about whether or not that was possible, or necessary (who goes to see a porno for the story?), but it doesn't matter that there wasn't. The 1970s are very realistically created, in every way from the outfits to the disco soundtrack to the god-awful interior decorating. Heather Graham is also very convincing as Rollergirl, the high school girl who flunks out of school and works in the adult film industry as well. This, by the way, is one of the roles that makes her performance in Lost In Space totally unconvincing and impossible to take seriously. Poor William H. Macy plays one of his traditional, unenviable roles. Why does this guy always get awful parts in his movies?  This poor guy's wife is constantly cheating on him (in some cases, in the middle of a circle of gaping, nearly comatose people), and she clearly has no respect for him. And to make matters worse, being in the porn industry, no one seems to understand what his conflict is.
(spoilers) The majority of the film deals with the business aspect of adult films  everything from the hiring to the shooting to the big money and drugs and the awards ceremonies. While this aspect of the film was very well done, as was Dirk's eventual fall from celebrity status, there were a lot of things about the movie that were either very badly presented or just didn't make any sense. For example, near the end, when the donut shop gets robbed, the robber walks in with a gun and pays all of his attention to the black guy in the nice white suit while he's robbing the store, completely ignoring the rough looking redneck with the hunting magazine that was sitting in a nearby booth. And then, after all of them have ingeniously shot each other to death, Cheadle's character grabs the paper bag full of money off the floor and runs. Evidently, he didn't see the recent film A Lesson Before Dying (in which he starred), which was about a black guy in the 1940s who did that exact same thing and then faced murder charges in a heavily racist society. And then there is the scene where Dirk and a couple of his buddies go out to sell a large quantity of fake drugs to a big time drug dealer with the intent of robbing him (in a scene, by the way, where Sister Christian is playing, which is Marilyn Manson's favorite song). What the hell was going on in that scene?! There was some half naked Chinese kid walking around and casually lighting off dozens of fireworks in the freakin' house! This was one of the things about this movie that made no sense whatsoever and just should not have been there. Overall, despite numerous weaknesses, Boogie Nights is a very good film that is miraculously able to live up to all of the expected notoriety that it developed, given such facts as that Heather Graham gets naked in the movie and, of course, that infamous, groan inducing final scene. Ironically, I think that the film deserves extra praise because they had enough nerve to make a film about a topic that is not generally accepted by society. The thing that really makes Boogie Nights succeed is that it is based on reality. It's not attempting to use the nudity or the subject matter to pull along a weak script. All of the big porn stars eventually fall from stardom, and return to small and unappealing occupations. And the occasional pedophile winds up exactly where he belongs  in prison getting slapped around and treated like a bitch by a huge black man. Paul Thomas Anderson wrote and directed a film about the porn industry, which is one of the most hated industries in the world, and the film that resulted is not only informative about the workings of that industry, but also very entertaining.",Boogie Nights
42,jzappa,"Boogie Nights Has the Value of Most of the Great Movies, In That It Is Always Buzzing and Animate",10,4 November 2008,"At the heart of Boogie Nights is a group of people that are so cavalier and nonchalant about sex. Julianne Moore has an intensely maternal love for Dirk Diggler yet has no qualms at all about having sex with him repeatedly for a film. They are totally nonchalant about private parts. At one point, for instance, Robert Ridgley asks Wahlberg if he can see his cock, Wahlberg shows him, and Ridgley thanks him. They are extremely careless with drugs. What is uncanny about writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's story is how he portrays a group of people so casual and detached regarding these things that they are cavalier and nonchalant when it is simply amiss to be so, specifically. Macy and his porn star wife constantly humiliates him by frequently having sex with muscular younger men in public places, or when a woman OD's on a guy at a party and everyone but the guy is calm and matter-of-fact about taking care of the situation.PTA isn't afraid to have a lot of peripheral characters that are overlooked by a lot of the central ones, such as Philip Seymour Hoffman's gay, nebbishy boom operator who loves and follows Dirk, Don Cheadle's unlikely black country-western follower, William H. Macy's frustrated assistant director, and Melora Walters's timid porn actress. Some of them bond and find great luck, others remain lonely and find tragedy that serves as omens for harder times for the characters as a collective conscious.I first saw Boogie Nights as a sophomore in high school. I was a virgin. Now that I'm not, it's that much more fascinating to watch scenes like the first time Diggler is before the camera having sex with Julianne Moore, not just because of its admirably unapologetic realism but because of how gifted a porn actor must be. There are so many strangers watching, unexpected interruptions and overall lack of familiarity with the situation, throughout all of which you must maintain an erection, relentless stamina and making the act look as sexy as you can to non-participants who are watching it.In terms of Dirk Diggler's character, Anderson reflects the very intimate and fragile male issue of the fear of impotence by constructing a major character stumbling block out of it. As Diggler grows more and more addicted to cocaine, he finds it more and more difficult to achieve an erection when he needs to, winding up internalizing this panic and frustration and beginning the crumbling of a big house of cards. Anderson has the confidence and humility to portray this obstacle under an inevitable magnifying lens, as Diggler's ""one special thing"" is his thirteen-inch penis.The most resonant talent that Anderson shows specifically as a director is that the film is high brow in terms of production values and the effect and quality of the story and the acting, but it is essentially a movie about a guy's amazing penis, and the film offers hilariously crude sex humor and pitch-perfect individual degrees of stupidity in the characters, and in the uncanny depiction of terrible quality in the porn films within the film, the Brock Landers/Chest Rockwell films for instance, mostly in the cast's hysterical portrayals of horrible acting and the horribly staged and filmed action violence.Paul Thomas Anderson's films are mysterious wonders, because each of them, in their own respective ways, is about so many things. Boogie Nights is a period piece about the porn business. It's about a group of people that coagulate like the hierarchy of a large family through the years. It's about a dense young man whose penis leads him to stardom and leads him into a lot of trouble. It's about the control of less intelligent, less sensitive people over the compliant intelligent and sensitive ones. It's about fate and coincidence. The pleasures and dangers of sex and drugs. The id of the 1970s and '80s. Everything about this dynamite stick of talent is grippingly unanticipated.Not many films have been more blunt, even disillusioned, concerning sexuality. Porn movies are a business to these people, not a distraction, and one of the charms of this period entertainment industry drama is the manner in which it showcases the day-by-day behind- the-scenes routine life of pornographers. The range and diversity is reminiscent of films by one of Anderson's biggest influences, Robert Altman, but there is also some of the consistent charm of low-budget breakthrough films of the 1990s, in scenes that stay poised riskily flanked by hilarity and graphic violence. Throughout all the characters and drama, Anderson's script focuses on the emotional facets of them. Boogie Nights has the value of most of the great movies, in that it is constantly buzzing and animate.",Boogie Nights
43,videorama-759-859391,"A film of greatness in every way, that really gets down and boogies",9,16 April 2015,"Another of these really long films to come out in early 98, the never dull BN is a mesmerizing look into the porn industry, a few sex scenes involving a lot of skin, implied, not as raunchy as a lot of people will expect. Mark Wahlberg, still in one of his best roles, plays the troubled street kid, who earns the name Dirk Diggler, with his discovered talent who's approached by Reynolds, a big time porn director, in one of his best ever acting parts. The two form a friendship, where Dirk becomes a friend among many other crew and cast, and becomes the next big thing. The period of late 70's to the breaking of the eighties is well captured and unhurried. Everyone is great where Wahlberg, competes well against some real acting heavy weights, (you'll know who I mean). Exceptionally good, was Julianne Moore, fantastic as a B porn actress fighting a lot of demons, only finding solace and happiness in what she's doing, while really she's floundering in despair, as fighting boldly to gain custody of her son. This film shows you what happens to retired porn stars, when seeking a new career or dream. One such instance threw me into a shockingly momentary disillusion. But this film is very inspirational, and how it tells you to ""Never give up on your dream"", especially in Dirk Diggler's case. There is a couple of coincidences in this film I didn't buy, and a little of repetition, hampering the great film, but the hampering really just becomes void, as we we don't have to forgive it, the films so good. One example involves a washed up Dirk Diggler getting pummelled by some gay hating punks, in a car park, while just after a limo just so happens to roll past with Burt and hot Heather Graham ( Rollergirl who never takes her skates off- EVER- I like that) getting it on with a high school jock who use to diss her. Shortly after, she in a much deserved revenge, as well as one I lapped up (You go girl) starts mashing the guy's face with her skates, after an offended Burt that is, tackles and punches him. There is some explosive violence, including one shock suicide scene, that's Wild Bill's doing, but like the sex, it's in the small number. My favorite scene is the one near the end, in an edgy, drug/money exchanged with a coked up Alfred Molina, as an young Asian kid, intermittently letting off firecrackers to intensify the nervousness, enwrapping Dirk Diggler and co (mo wearing Thomas Jane, you'll hardly recognize here, in still what I consider his best acting. BN is one hell of a movie ride and one of the best films of 1998. I have so much good stuff to write on this, but this is such a small offering. If you forgive the faults I mentioned, just sit back and watch what is a rewarding and insightful look into a industry was shunned, but it's how we see these shunned people lived, partied and boogied. The stick out hampering part is the ridiculous elongated penis, Marky Mark reveals at the end. Not only is it patently fake, it could do the Markster some mischief if tripping over it.",Boogie Nights
44,Vartiainen,The legend of Dirk Diggler,8,14 March 2017,"Young Eddie Adams, played by then relatively unknown Mark Wahlberg, is a dishwasher and a all-around dropout, who gets noticed by movie director and invited to shoot films with him. The movies just happen to be of the pornographic nature, which doesn't seem to faze Eddie all that much. He promptly changes his name to Dirk Diggler and the film follows his and his associates' career through the late 70s and early 80s. All the way from the golden age of porn right to the onset of video tape.For a film unabashedly about adult entertainment, the film is surprisingly non-raunchy in nature. Sure it's rated R, but there are very few sex scenes and it's more about the things that happen between the shoots. About the business itself and the kind of people it takes to undress in front of the cameras and do the naughty, as it were. It also has a great style and a lot of talent behind the camera. The soundtrack is well-crafted and contains a pleasingly huge amount of hits from those two decades. The costuming, the camera-work and the colours all harken right back to the 70s and it is one of the better period pieces about the decade I've yet seen.The acting is also superb. This is one of Wahlberg's earliest films and definitely one of the ones that put him on the map as someone with great acting chops. But the real star of the show has to be Burt Reynolds as the director Jack Horner, a man anguishing with the changes in his chosen medium, struggling to have his films seen as something worthwhile, perhaps even art.I'm sure this film has its critics solely because of its subject matter. But if you can get beyond that or if it doesn't bother you in the first place, Boogie Nights is a great film. Superbly crafted, well-acted and with a style of its own.",Boogie Nights

46,freemantle_uk,The Highs and Lows of the Porn Industry,10,24 May 2010,"The late 70s and 80s were seen as a Golden Age of the Pornography Industry in America, based San Fernando Valley. This was a period known for pornographers attempting tell a story in their films. With his first major film Paul Thomas Anderson uses this period as a backdrop for his wonderfully told drama.Eddie (Mark Wahlberg) was a 17-year-old high school dropout, working as a dishwasher at a small nightclub. Eddie is spotted by Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) who hears that the kid was well endowed. After Eddie was kicked out his home by his mother Jack and his partner Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) takes Eddie under their collective wing. Eddie quickly makes friends with porn actors Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham). Jack convinces Eddie to become a porn actor himself. Eddie renames himself Dirk Digger and he quickly becomes one of the biggest name porn stars around. Eddie/Dirk believes in Jack ideal of telling a proper story in his porn films. But fame is a fickle thing with the porn industry changing and Eddie/Dirk's own person problems pushing him back.Anderson shows his talent as a director early on in the film with an amazing opening sequence with was a 3 minute long continuous shot. He expertly handles the drama, showing both a colourful party side to the late 70s/early 80s to more darker elements which was bound to happen considering it's plot. Anderson perfectly treads a fine line between comedy and tragedy. Anderson mixes in a lot of style to his film with some well handed shots, excellent cinematography and some stylist camera tricks. There was an strong influence from Martin Scorsese behind this film. The plot does have a similar to films like Scarface and Goodfellas where the protagonist starts from a low point to getting fame, money and power to them losing it because of their own arrogance. Boogie Nights is also shot in a similar style to those two films and the ending was a little like Raging Bull, but Anderson's skill made it seem more like a homage then directly coping those films. Anderson mixes in a few themes into his film: one being an very unorthodox way to fulfil the American Dream and use what ever asset you have available to you. They is of course an in-depth look into the plot industry with Anderson showing that whilst some actors may have a tough or unusual background they were willing and happy within the industry and Jack is made out to be a more noble type of director, wanting to at least tell a story in his films. There is also a darker look into why people get involved and the world of excess that inhabited this world but Anderson was darning to show some sort of a positive spin. Anderson also tackles how the porn industry changed in this period and became more of horrid mass produced product.There is a great cast in this film. Wahlberg, Reilly, Reynolds, Moore, Graham, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy and Robert Ridgely, all offer good performances. Wahlberg is of course very good in the lead role and his character grows and changes throughout the film and showed the emerging talent he was about to become. Boogie Nights was easily Reynolds and Graham's best film, showing the two are good actors, showing their dark side in the process. Moore and Reynolds were very believable in the mentor role of the film and that Moore's character was filled with heartbreak and tragedy. There were simple, powerful scenes in the film involving some of the characters, such as between Reynolds and Ridgely in prison, a wonderfully handled scene and a small scene with Hoffman crying in his car, a bitter, raw scene that was very real. Hoffman is one of the best character actors in Hollywood.An excellent film that shows American film-making at its best.",Boogie Nights

51,MaxBorg89,Perhaps the most touching analysis of the porn industry ever made,10,26 June 2007,"In one of this film's most crucial scenes, porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) explains that his aim is to make an adult picture with a story that's compelling enough to keep the audience focused on the plot and not just the hardcore sex scenes. He wants to move the viewers, rather than arouse them. That sequence neatly sums up what Paul Thomas Anderson has achieved with his second feature, the stunning, oddly heartbreaking Boogie Nights.Set between 1977 and 1984, the picture tells us how lives can change thanks to the adult film industry: it is the golden years of porn cinema, and Jack Horner is the most successful filmmaker in that sector. He gets particularly lucky when he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a 17-year old waiter with an unusually large manhood. After a night of drinks and sex in Jack's house, the young man happily accepts to become his new star, and the results show pretty quickly: Dirk Diggler, as he is now known, is the hottest name in the business, which means he can get whatever he wants, whether it's a fast car, nice clothes, ladies or drugs.Such ""happiness"", however, is not meant to last: being a porn star might change your life, but ""change"" does not necessarily mean ""improve"". The trouble starts when Floyd Gondolli (Philip Baker Hall) tells Jack the future of the industry is videotape, meaning there is no more need for professionals. As is that weren't enough, most of the cast and crew have problems of their own: Jack's leading lady, Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), is in the middle of a bitter custody battle with her ex-husband; Rollergirl (Heather Graham) is uncertain about what to do with her life; occasional collaborator Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) has trouble finding a real job; producer Little Bill (William H. Macy) has to deal with his adulterous wife. But the biggest liability is Dirk: filled with drugs and having an ego the size of his ""torpedo"" (""It's my big d*ck and I say when we roll!""), he and his partner Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) make increasingly dangerous ""business"" deals with the wrong people, slowly making him realize super-stardom isn't that glamorous after all.On a technical level, Anderson gets more ambitious than he was while making his first film, Sydney, and delivers a flawless exercise in style with echoes of Scorsese (the beautiful opening tracking shot, the expert use of music), Altman (the brilliant handling of an ensemble cast, especially in the swimming pool sequence) and Tarantino (some of the characters and the dialogue, plus the off-screen violence). But what impresses the most is how he succeeds in getting a touching story out of an unconventional subject: rather than offering a two-hour montage of explicit sex (there are only two such scenes in the entire film) he focuses on the people involved in the making of this kind of flicks, with particular attention to how their lives are affected by what they do. Those expecting naked bodies are watching the wrong film: this is a chronicle of the experiences of flawed human beings in a peculiar context. Despite the premise, the movie is less interested in hardcore material than it is in the characters: layered, real and affecting, not to mention played by one of the finest ensemble casts in history (the standouts being Reynolds, Moore and Wahlberg), they are the real selling point of Anderson's poignant opus.Sex has always been used as a tool to tell stories. This film's greatness lies in taking that tool, using it to establish the setting, context and characters and then throwing it out of the window: Boogie Nights is not about sex, nor was it ever meant to be. It is a picture about life, loneliness and suffering, and that's what makes it one of the finest movies of 1997.",Boogie Nights
52,Lechuguilla,Disco Erotica,7,1 April 2010,"Writer/Director Paul Thomas Anderson probes the adult film industry of the 1970s in this classy, but imperfect, fictional story that spans the disco years, beginning in 1977, when porn movies were actually shown in movie houses.

Soon, Eddie morphs into ""Dirk Diggler"", hot-to-trot porn star whose got the goods.But the sprawling plot encompasses a vast array of colorful characters that orbit Horner and Diggler. And therein lies one of the film's problems. The plot is overdone. It's too epical. A lot of fat could have been trimmed from the 180 pages of script and the roughly eighty speaking parts. As is, the film exudes a sense of grandiose self-indulgence.Even so, the film clearly paints porn as a for-profit business, a rather grubby, cold-blooded one at that. Horner's detached perspective insures his product's financial success, if not his workers' emotional needs. Splashy disco music enlivens the entire production, though I could have wished for a better selection of 70s music.Casting is fine, except for Wahlberg. I've seen more convincing looking porn stars-to-be sacking groceries at the local Piggly-Wiggly. Burt Reynolds makes an ideal sleaze seller. And sweet Julianne Moore convinces as a 1970s liberated woman.As much a celebration of 1970s disco culture as a primer on cinematic erotica, ""Boogie Nights"" oozes all the glitter of that era, with colorful costumes and funky production design. As such, it reminds me of ""54"" (1998), a film that is to New York City what ""Boogie Nights"" is to Southern California.Energetic, expansive, and chaotic in tone and plot, ""Boogie Nights"" thematically cautions that 1970s porn ""stars"", though superficially attractive, took too seriously their star status, myopic to the reality that times change, and that youth is fleeting.",Boogie Nights
53,davispittman,Very well made film,8,9 November 2017,"Boogie Nights (1997) is a pretty famous film. It received a lot of praise, including many positive reviews and major award recognition like the golden globes and the Oscars. This is also the film that credited with jump starting Mark Wahlberg's Hollywood career. The film stars Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Don Cheadle. The acting from every one of the cast members is spot on, great performances all around. I especially liked Moore, Wahlberg, and Reynolds. Don't get me wrong, everyone else is still very good, but those three just really shined in their individual roles, enough so for Moore and Reynolds to get academy award nominations and Wahlberg to be thrust into a very successful Hollywood acting career. Boogie Nights is all about the pornography industry, well actually its more about these specifics people in the pornography industry, and how it affects their lives. I liked how the movie handled the individual lives of each character, they really gave ample amount of time to every persons storyline. The dialogue is written in a way that pulls you in and keeps you engaged. I wouldn't say that Boogie Nights is a 10/10 or that it's absolutely perfect, but it is a very well made film that deserves a watch. 8/10.",Boogie Nights

It's just so much fun, sometimes it's serious, it shows the problems of 70s porn industry, it wasn't the cleanest business, but it's also a very funny film. You can watch it either for fun or historical importance.",Boogie Nights
55,jfgibson73,You got the touch! You got the power!,8,22 August 2021,"A great ensemble piece, this movie covers years in the lives of its characters, which gives it an epic feel. The first part of the movie is pretty fun, with everyone enjoying success. Then, it gets dark, and you feel like you might never know happiness again. Boogie Nights is not a movie I usually watch back, except for a few key scenes (such as the recording session). It's got a lot of talent, and they are all putting in awesome performances, but they capture the feel of lives spinning out of control a little too well. It was well worth a watch, and I'm sure many viewers will enjoy seeing it back. Just not me, I guess.",Boogie Nights

57,slokes,It's A Family Affair,8,31 May 2003,"There's sex, drugs, and rock n' roll aplenty in P.T. Anderson's ""Boogie Nights,"" but what makes this film stick with its audience long after the credits roll is the strong sense of family. OK, they're a family that makes the Louds look like the Brady Bunch (obligatory '70s ref there), but they are a real family, with a father figure, a mother figure, a distracted daughter, a rebel son, and a ton of aunt, uncle, and cousin-figures that each bring their unique issues to the mix.This is a recipe for overload in any fictional medium, but particularly a movie, where tight is usually right. Any other director would have trimmed away Little Bill and Becky Barnett faster than a disco downbeat, but P.T. Anderson does a very rare and brave thing. He not only puts these characters in, but allows his camera and script to linger on each of them, way past the point of no return in anyone else's movie. But rather than boring you, the result here is a depth of detail and lived-in feeling that brings you aboard for the whole run. It's what makes P.T. Anderson a great director. Yet it may also render him incapable of making a great movie. Discipline is not his strength.""Boogie Nights"" is close, though. It's a very good film, a high 8 in my book, and a movie I can get lost in over and over again. Maybe it's because I came of age in the late 1970s, and see it recaptured here in a way it has never otherwise been, in all its confused, giddy, over-the-top glory. The pace of the first half of the film is languid and measured, never rushed, yet as a whole it chugs along with an assurance that makes it hard to accept the filmmaker was only making his second major picture.People talk about the opening scene, and it's very good, but there's other highlights. The pool party at Jack's, for example, is a marvel of storytelling economy, moving through several episodes without ever feeling like any are being shortchanged. We get an earful of Reed and Eddie's first meeting, awkward pauses and all, then get introduced to the Colonel and his coke-happy date, to Scotty Jay and his crush on Eddie, then Eddie rechristening himself (in a hot tub no less, how SoCal) ""Dirk Diggler."" All that plot is thrown at us, but the biggest takeaway for us is a sense of the characters, because P.T. Anderson is the kind of director who makes character-driven films first.There's a lot of great detail on the porn industry subculture that feels very real and lived in, and the humor is outrageous at times (Dirk's audition with Amber, Scotty Jay's obvious gawkiness around his dream boy, Buck's image issues) without ever feeling pushed or artificial. You get a lot of depth here, the kind that rewards repeat viewings.The second half of the film loses me a little. I understand the story changes with the new decade, but it suddenly becomes so oppressively dire that the viewer, once swept into the story, has to pull away from misery overload. It's hard to pick a single excessive moment, maybe its just the way all of them come together to create a perfect storm of melodrama.That said, the Raheed Jackson sequence is the standout of the movie; a brilliant way of wrapping up Dirk's odyssey and bringing us back home. The suspense build up is incredible, and it's the one time that the film's main co-star, its soundtrack, is allowed center stage, transforming banal pop smashes like ""Jessie's Girl"" and ""Sister Christian"" into something operatic, even anthemic. We know Dirk's going nuts because the guitar break in ""Jessie's Girl"" tells us so.P.T. Anderson is a director I will always watch, but he does let his characters' emotions carry him away (more in ""Magnolia"" than here, but here, too). It's a tribute to his underlying genius that even at his most baroque, he manages to draw you into his world and hold you there like nobody else in the business. He's the kind of talent that will only improve with time, and it will be a pleasure keeping tabs on his development.",Boogie Nights
58,Boyo-2,Great movie,9,6 August 1998,"This movie is memorable thanks to terrific performances, soundtrack and most of all atmosphere.  You can almost smell the cheap cologne Dirk would wear to go disco dancing.  The firecracker scene topped it all off.  Add the wonderful Julianne Moore, and it doesn't get any better than this.",Boogie Nights
59,truemythmedia,Paul Thomas Anderson Struts His Stuff,8,13 June 2019,"Paul Thomas Anderson is amazing when it comes to bringing to life believable characters (I'd argue my three of his films are essentially character studies- ""There Will Be Blood"", ""The Master"", and ""Phantom Thread""). He knows how to take a character and flesh them out so that they all seem to have urges, dreams, cares, and fears about the world that Anderson places them in, and in giving these characters more depth, the world feels far more tactile. The character relationships shift and change as things happen throughout the movie. Almost every character in this movie is dynamic- when we're introduced to them in the beginning, they're one way, and by the time we leave them, they're different. What's so impressive about this film is the way that Anderson works in all of the different character arcs without making the story feel overly complex, complicated, or an hour too long (there are some scenes in this movie that probably could've been trimmed, but for a two and a half hour film, it seems to move quickly). While the main story revolves around Eddie/Dirk's rise to fame, this movie is essentially an ensemble piece- we spend time getting to know each and every character in their own separate scenes, fleshing out the members of the adoptive family that Dirk joins. I do want to mention, that while I think this script is great, I'd say that Anderson's later scripts show a lot more complexity and depth.",Boogie Nights
60,Samiam3,Ninety minutes of fun material in a clunky two and a half hour movie,5,11 July 2010,"It is amazing how a movie can fall apart just as quickly as it comes together. For a while, Paul Thomas Andersson's Boogie Night's recalls Goodfellas; a subjective story about a nobody who becomes a big somebody. Unfortunately Andersson is not content with the movie being that simple. He wants to make it bigger and bolder, and about halfway in, it turns into an ensemble feature. The whole thing doesn't come together very well. The plot grows increasingly stagy, and the characters are given no room to grow. Where as Goodfellas grew tighter and more intense with each chapter, Boogie Nights grows tiresome. Its self-indulgence is frustrating because for a while I was really enjoying myself. But just when things are looking good, Boogie Nights ceases to commit to the direction it started with, so why should we stay committed?.",Boogie Nights
61,triple8,An example of film making at its most incredible.,10,21 February 2004,"Boogie Nights is one of the best films to come out of the 90's and I'd go so far as to say it should be in the IMDb top 250. I can actually understand why many would dislike it, due to the subject matter. I personally feel however as many do, judging from the aclaim this film's received by viewers and critics that it's topnotch film making.The direction and acting in this film surpass good and reach the level of brilliance.There is not one scene in this movie that isn't amazing. The individual characters reach out and touch you. Given that this is a movie about the porn industry, one wouldn't imagine the sex scenes could be handled with such sensitivity but they are. The direction is among the best I've ever seen-and I've seen a lot of films.The film isn't about one particular personal individual's story, it's about many.It's a character study about people who have many layers to them and who maybe in an industry most would find alien but who still dream the same dreams and have both bad and good to them. Boogie Nights draws you into their story from the beginning, and though the film is long(I believe almost 3 hours) you honestly don't even notice. And when it ends you kind of don't want it to....I'm not easy to impress, meaning there aren't many movies I'd give a 10 of 10 rating to but this is one. Beyond the multiple character study, is the use of music in the film. I have never, in all my years of seeing movies seen music tell a story as well as in this movie.There was such flawlessness to it, you know it's not something your gonna see everyday.Burt reynold's performance was perhaps the best I've ever seen him do, and Mark Wahlberg is incredible(I'm astounded there are still people saying he doesn't act well. I don't know how anyone viewing this could possibly think that)but the person who really surprised me was Heather Grahem(Rollergirl) who is absolutely fantastic in her role, in particular the one memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in the Limo, towards the end.Again, I'll echo other IMDb reviewers in saying this movie is not for everybody. But I still think this was topnotch.10 of 10.",Boogie Nights
62,onepotato2,pretty standard movie,4,21 March 2008,"I never saw this when it came out, so I didn't drink the P.T. Anderson Kool-aid. I haven't liked his other movies so there was no rush to rent this. Hard 8 while being miserable, bleak, and nothing I ever want to sit through again, was at least competent movie-making. This is Anderson's first big success and he's already gone Hollywood. It's an empty viewing experience. I'm not a prude by any standard, but is there any other place Hollywood movies about drugs, sex and porn go other than descent and misery? Gee, with such ignorant characters, I thought things would always be swell. The idea that somehow plots made porn more valuable before the industry moved to videotape is utterly ridiculous. Plot has always been in the way in porn movies. This didn't need to be 3 hours. It puts no ideas into play that do not issue directly from the mouths of one character or another. Long before Magnolia's contrived epiphany sequence Anderson was so uninterested in decent storytelling that he did it here too. All three characters have epiphanies compressed into a single day. I guess that was simpler for him to grasp. But hey, the ""long movie must be respectable"" gimmick worked and this garnered a bounty of nominations. So he's done it twice since.",Boogie Nights
63,RainDogJr,"First his name was Eddie Adams, later Dirk Diggler and finally Brock Landers",10,2 April 2008,"Sometime ago I watched a video of Paul Thomas Anderson in which he express the big interest that he has in porn films and how this industry could've produce better films and in consequence a complete genre and not just sex in video tape. Paul Thomas Anderson put his own believes of porn industry in the character played in a terrific way by Burt Reynolds. His name is Jack Horner, a director whose biggest dream is to make a ""real"" film that can keep the viewer in suspense because of the great dramatic story and, at the same time, exciting with the beauty and with the ""big cocks and tits"". Soon as he meets Eddie Adams (Mark Walhberg), he believes that he has found the new star for his films. And that's how the story of the young Eddie in the porn industry begins.The film begins with a sequence inside a night club where we can see all the persons that will be part of Eddie's life and later we can see them outside the porn industry, living their daily routine. But soon we can see them inside the porn industry and after only one party, the story of the new Eddie begins, the story of Dirk Diggler. All of them will taste the real success with Dirk as the main star, winning lots of prizes and helping Jack to make real his biggest dream with a series of films about Brock Landers, the new character of Dirk. This sort of exploitation films are an amazing success and for Jack are his firsts ""real"" films. But here is the beginning of the end and the beginning of the ""horrible 80's"" when there is going to be $ex, DRUGS and Rock & Roll for Dirk and pals. But we all know that the excesses can destroy any person and the erectile dysfunction can destroy any porn star and here the film focuses in their lives after the total success and how everybody is having a real bad time with many problems due to society's bad look to porn industry and to a period with many excesses. In Dirk's decadence, after trying and failing in the music industry, there's a brilliant sequence that can resume in a perfect way how the things are going for Dirk and his friends. That sequence is the one of his first drug deal, with the appearance of Alfred Molina, which ends in a total mess. Is funny for us and a terrible experience for Dirk and pals but there's always a solution if you get back in what you know and when Dirk is back, Brock is back.Well I haven't mention most of the characters in my sort of a summary but I must say that all are amazingly well developed. The cast is just superb with the best performance that I have seen of Mark Walhberg. Julianne Moore has a powerful performance in a really moving character; Reilly, Macy, Hoffman, Heather Graham, Guzman, etc are just memorable, all of their characters with funny and sad moments.Finally, I really love the amazing cinematic style of Anderson here with a unique view to the porn industry of the late 70's and early 80's. I used to say that ""Magnolia"" was my favourite of Anderson but right now, after watching all except ""Sidney"", I can't say that I have a favourite because I love them all!PS: somewhere I read that this film is the ""Scorsese film"" of Anderson so I'm more than sure that if you love ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino"" you will love this one too. I f*cking love ""Boogie Nights""!",Boogie Nights
64,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Boogie Nights,10,20 July 2014,"Boogie Nights remains to this day, my favorite film of all time. It's a firecracker of a movie and a kaleidoscope of colorful, 70's pop culture. Paul Thomas Anderson pays homage to a host of brilliant directors like Martin Scorsese, Stanley Kubrick, Robert Altman, and Quentin Tarantino to guide his camera and volt forward, his supreme storytelling style. With a plot that involves the trials and tribulations of everyone involved in the adult film world, Boogie Nights has a cast here that is full of interesting, quirky characters, it has a couple of enthralling (not to mention elaborate) steadicam shots, and it possesses a soundtrack that tracks gleefully, the rhythms of all the fabulous, energized jump cuts. Mark Wahlberg as the lead and well hung male adult actor (Dirk Diggler), gives a startling, breakthrough performance. But it's Burt Reynolds who bests him as his go-to porn director. Burt's star never shined so bright as it did here (and this is over a 50 plus year career). Look for a drug deal scene gone amuck, a donut shop scene posing as a Mexican standoff, and a disco dance sequence that gives you your Saturday Night Fever fix.Overall, this is what invigorating, epic, staunch film making is all about. A giddy masterpiece!",Boogie Nights
65,raulfaust,Hahah you crazy people,4,22 April 2011,"I'm so disappointed after seeing this film... it went nowhere close to where I thought it would go.Boogie Nights, although having an interesting subject, executes it very poorly. There are no big happenings in the film, there are many unnecessary characters like the stereo guy, there's NO SUCH pornography (it shouldn't even be Rated R) and there's a clearly plagiarism of Pulp Fiction.Furthermore, it gets to that famous point that you don't care for any of the characters anymore. Even thought it kind of entertain, I wouldn't give a second shot neither recommend it to anyone.",Boogie Nights
66,eric262003,The Shortest Three Hours of My Life,9,13 February 2012,"In a nutshell, ""Boogie Nights"" is a rare movie in that steps out of the lines in terms of categorization. The movie surfaces around the pornography business. Even though there is a fair amount of steaming seductive scenes, it's content is not overly gratuitous. There is a lot of humour delivered here, it's mostly dark and at times a bit hard to swallow at times. A plethora of the settings and situations were not intended to be entertaining, but one couldn't help but to be intrigued by the scenes as they were very entertaining in spite of it almost three hour duration.The structure of the film is not very perpendicular that makes this movie stand up above the rest. There is no spoon-feeding in terms of delivery by director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson, instead it's customized to play with your mind which is obscure in the film business. Can anyone name me a moment in a movie where they install a very lustful sex scene and turn it into one very mundane effort that continues on for so long? ""Boogie Nights"" succeeds in its attempt to show how unglamourous the sex industry really is as it's nothing more than all in a day's work.Set in the 1970's and 1980's, principal characters in the movie include Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg who was very dominant in his role), who is taken by awe by a porno guru Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds who was also quite impressive) as he transforms Adams into a porn star and goes as far as to change his name to Dirk Diggler.Diggler's rise in the porn star business is weaved by other performers that share the world he's gotten himself into. There's the doped up porn queen Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), who's like a mentor to Dirk because she is off limits from seeing her own biological child. John C. Reilly was a standout as Dirk's best pat Reed Rothschild. Heather Graham was brilliant and beautiful as Rollergirl and feels her comfort zone is when she performs using her roller-skates. Then there's Buck Swope (Don Cheadle), who likes to dress like Gene Autry and has further ambitions to open up a video store. And finally there's Little Man, (William H. Macy) who has bottled up anger because his wife constantly commits infidelity on a regular basis and shows absolute no remorse for her actions. Director Anderson follows his narration much to the tradition of Robert Altman by executing his story in a vignette approach.The constant rags-to-riches story as a whole is both funny, terrifying, melancholy, but still succeeds in lifting your hearts at the the right time. One of the more engaging scenes is when Dirk cuts a deal with a druggie. The problem is the crack he's selling is superficial and the dealer's pad is filled with goons while this is happening, firecrackers are being lit all to the song of Night Ranger's ""Sister Christian"". This scene was perfectly executed that the fear and tension comes to life and while you're watching the scene the fear takes charge into the rooms you're sitting at. If thats not top notch directing, than what is? The performances were brilliant, but it was Reynolds and Moore that had the strongest performances. The feeling of the 1970's and 1980's looks very authentic (even the poster of Cheryl Tiegs on Dirk's wall looks groovy), and the music is truly far out. It definitely is one of the best films of the 1990's and though Anderson may have patted himself on the back a little too much, all the flaws can be forgiven easily due to the vibrant energy and the engaging performances.",Boogie Nights
67,Sandcooler,"I'm a star, I'm a star, I'm a star",10,29 July 2013,"""Boogie Nights"" is one of those rare movies that manages to find the perfect balance between comedy and drama. I mean, there are a lot of laughs throughout, but you always laugh with a lump in your throat. This movie just bathes in a general feeling of false optimism: occasionally it looks like everyone's having the time of their life, but it's all just an illusion. Particularly the ending, which I can't go into too much detail about, captures that idea perfectly. At first it's pretty fulfilling, but the ending gets less happy with every second you think about it. Apart from being a great, bittersweet character study, the movie also creates tremendous amounts of tension when it needs to. The scene with the drug deal that goes awry might just be the most bone-chilling scene I've ever watched. Everything about it is just perfect, right down to the use of silly 80s pop songs as the soundtrack. I was drenched in sweat after watching that part, magnificent how it gradually builds up to its unexpected climax. The only bad thing I can really say about this movie is that the practical effect in the last shot is laughably unconvincing, but even that's not really a criticism given that I can imagine them doing it on purpose. Awesome movie, one of the best movies the 1990s had to offer.",Boogie Nights
68,gangstahippie,Brilliant movie,9,1 April 2009,"I saw Boogie Nights on IFC a few nights ago.I must say, this film is great.From the excellent acting, the characters to the soundtrack & plot, this is a great film.It has an all star cast featuring Mark Wahlberg, William H Macy, John C Reilly, Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Luis Guzman and a few others.It's pretty graphic in terms of sex/nudity(it's about the porn industry).Also has quite a bit of drug use and some strong violence, but if you can look past that, you will see a brilliant film.It starts off in 1977, Mark Wahlberg is a dishwasher looking to earn a few extra bucks.A porn director then takes him under his wing and introduces him to the world of being a porn star.It starts off all glamorous and whatnot, however later on the consequences show up, just like in movies such as ""Scarface"", we see the consequences of the seemingly great lifestyle.The film spans from 1977-1984 and has an excellent soundtrack and some very good scenes! Boogie Nights is just a great movie! I recommend you watch it.",Boogie Nights
69,lewiskendell,Proof that there are very few directors better than Paul Thomas Anderson.,8,24 April 2010,"Paul Thomas Anderson has only made a moderate amount of movies, but each one of them that I've seen has had a common effect on me. I couldn't wait to watch them again, after they were over. My first impression of Boogie Nights was that it started off fairly slowly. For the first hour or so of the movie, I was under the impression that it was going to be the first PTA film that I didn't absolutely love. And then, a few absolutely fantastic scenes turned my opinion right around. I was so impressed, that I immediately watched the entire 155 minute film again. There are very few movies that I've had that reaction to, but in this case it was both pleasurable and enlightening. I still think that the second half of Boogie Nights is the stronger part, but the first half is also very good. This is a great example of a fantastic writer being paired with a dream cast. The main characters are all expertly written and acted, and that's to be expected. Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Thomas Jane all gave the best performances of their careers here, in my opinion. But even the minor characters get powerful moments that stick in your mind after the movie is over. Actors like Don Cheadle, Alfred Molina, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and William H. Macy didn't have nearly the screen time of Mark Wahlberg or Burt Reynolds, but they were just as instrumental in making Boogie Nights as good as it is. Nearly every character is given an opportunity to make an emotional connection with the viewer, and that's astounding. As far as I'm concerned, this movie was overflowing with iconic performances, and there are two or three scenes that are easily some of the best I've ever seen in ANYTHING. Anderson is undeniably gifted at both writing, directing, and choosing the right music to enhance his work. I don't know if I like Boogie Nights quite as much as There Will Be Blood or Punch Drunk Love, but it really says something when a movie that's longer than average, never drags for a moment and leaves me wanting more. It benefits greatly from multiple viewings, and I'm sure my fondness of the movie will only grow.",Boogie Nights
70,sme_no_densetsu,A Star is Porn,9,8 April 2009,"""Boogie Nights"" takes us back to the late seventies where we trace the path of a rising star on the porn scene. We are treated to an intimate look at the ins and outs of the porno industry as we follow Dirk Diggler from overnight success to inevitable decline.The first thing that must be said about this film is that the cast is outstanding. It's character actor heaven with the likes of John C. Reilly, William H. Macy, Luis Guzman, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Philip Baker Hall and more. Not only that, there are others (like Mark Wahlberg) who deliver the best performances of their careers.However, all of this acting talent would have gone to waste if the screenplay wasn't up to snuff. Luckily, Anderson's script was good enough to snag an Oscar nomination. It contains plenty of humour although the tone of the film gradually darkens until the characters hit rock bottom. Overall, the story is nicely balanced and presents a fascinating view of this 'family' of pornographers.Anderson's direction is well handled though some might feel that he was just a little flashier than necessary. On the audio front, the soundtrack is yet another component of the film that deserves high praise. Vintage songs are featured prominently and the selections show a keen sense of taste and aptness.All in all, I'd rank this as one of my favorite films of the 90's. However, I can see that the subject matter and approach may not appeal to all. Nevertheless, I think that this is Anderson's best film (so far).",Boogie Nights
71,michaeltrivedi,Good Movie,8,2 January 2020,"I really enjoyed Boogie Nights. I would normally think twice about giving such movie an 8, but I think it was well deserved. One of Wahlbergs early performances that put him on the map. He kind of played the young dumb stupid up and comer. The rest of the cast was funny. It was a pretty deep movie. I enjoyed it a lot.Highly recommend8 stars",Boogie Nights
72,Screen_Blitz,"A smart, provocative piece of work by Paul Thomas Anderson",9,26 June 2016,"Paul Thomas Anderson isn't just any Hollywood director, he's a filmmaker with a provocative sense of style and writing, and this comedy-drama period piece effectively proves so. This film stars a brilliant ensemble cast in what may seem like a solid non- documentary examination of the pornographic industry during the 1970s but is actually an inside look at the characters' adventures through the controversial entertainment business. With the stylish script, direction, and realistic depiction of the social satire in the 70s by Anderson; this film comes be a sassy and powerfully clever picture. Set in San Fernando Valley, California in the late 70s, this film introduces Eddie Adams (played by Mark Wahlberg), a seventeen-year old high school dropout who spends his nights working as a bus boy at the Reseda Night Club. There he meets adult film director Jack Horner (played by Burt Reynolds) who sees talent in the young man. After a meeting with Horner, his star Amber Waves (played by Julianne Moore), and a young runaway named Brandy (played by Heather Graham) nicknamed ""Rollergirl"", Eddie is driven into the eccentric world of the porn industry where he meets actors Reed Rothchild (played by John C. Reilley), producer Little Bill (played by William H. Macy) who struggles with his wife's infidelity, and music executive Bucky Swope (played by Don Cheadle). Adopting his stage name Dirk Diggler, Eddie ventures through the highs and unexpected lows of the Californian porn industry.From the exhilarating screenplay by Paul Thomas Anderson, the sassy disco soundtrack and costume design to represent the 70s (and 80s) settings, and the ambitious performances by the cast; it is easy to consider this Anderson's career-defining entry. Venturing through the lives of the characters and their ups and downs in the adult film business including infidelity and troubled fame, this film delivers plenty of surprises and wit from the hands of director Anderson, and the story falls nothing short of engaging and sweet, though it feels somewhat uneven in the second half. Of course, as pornography serves as the central point of the story, there is a heavy amount of sexual activity, raucous dialogue, nudity, and abundance of cocaine abused throughout, let's not forget the unexpected violence that breaks out between certain scenes; all of which can be significantly uncomfortable for sensitive movie-goers to sit through. But thanks to the stylish cinematography by Robert Elswit and the sharply written dialogue, it's all done in a way not meant to be gratuitous. When the story suspends from it's emotional heft, viewers are granted with some hilarious (and vulgar) dialogue, slick social commentary, and light- hearted gags, mostly from the mouths of Mark Wahlberg and Burt Reynolds, both of whom are deeply engaging in their roles; standing out from the overcrowd of underdeveloped characters. Though Paul Thomas Anderson may suffer a bad case of ""ensemble cast syndrome"" that results in some characters that fall shallow, his stylish quality in filmmaking and writing are effective enough to shade over these flaws.Boogie Nights is a smart, provocative piece of work that can be called one of the best films made by the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. This film is full or surprises and intelligence that scale high above its vulgarity and rawness. Though this doesn't pack the same kind of popular status as other 90s film like Quentin Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction' or James Cameron 'Titanic', it makes an important piece of modern cinema.",Boogie Nights
73,Sirus_the_Virus,"To be perfectly honest, amazing.",10,26 January 2010,"Boogie nights, in short, is amazing. Truly amazing. I know that the plot doesn't sound that interesting, but it's a great film. Paul Thomas Anderson has done some of the best films I have ever seen. I mean the man is a genius. His films are occasionally funny, very dramatic, and at times kind of odd.Boogie nights is one of those films. The film focuses on a high school drop out bartender named Eddie(played fantastically by Mark Whalberg). One night, a porn director named Jack(Played fantastically by Burt Reynolds) offers him a job. At first he doesn't accept it. Thewn the next day he gets to know the cast, and has sex. Then once he gets home his mom freaks out on him. So Eddie runs away. So after that Eddie goes to meet Jack and the cast. You get to know the cast. William H. Macy plays a guy who has been cheated on three times. Don Cheadle plays a guy who is trying to get into a stereo business. John C.Reilly plays an actor on set. Julianne Moore plays an actress that is fighting in a custody battle for her son. Eventually, Eddie comes up with his own porn star name Dirk Diggler. Also, Dirk becomes very famous. Winning many adult film awards including best cock and best actor. But as his career continues, his life begins to fall apart. Once everyone quits the business, their lives fall apart. Their lives are ruined by porn.I love the film's soundtrack. I also love how it shows how ridiculous the porn industry is. I also love how the film has a very happy ending. I still have yet to see Paul Thomas Anderson's Hard eight and Magnolia. Where I have I been for the past couple of years. These are amazing movies. how could this movie not be nominated for best picture? It was amazing. After seeing a movie like There will be blood, or Punch drunk love or especially, Boogie nights, someone should send Paul Thomas Anderson a letter saying "" Please, make more"".

74,Spuzzlightyear,Boogie Nights,10,24 January 2013,"Man, ""Boogie Nights"" must be like ""The Breakfast Club"" of the 90\s. Take a bunch of actors on the cusp of stardom, and put them into a multlayered complex movie. This movie just happens to be about the Porn industry in the late 70's-early 1980's. When I first saw this when the film just came out, the only person I recognized in the cast was of course, Burt Reynolds and that rapper-turned-actor, Mark Wahlberg. Nowadays, I can recognize everyone and just be agog at how much pre-starpower there is: Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C, Mcginley, Don Cheadle, William Maxy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman etc etc, This film just gets better and better with each viewing, and the firecracker scene at the ending becomes more hilarious then nerve wracking ( not that it doesn't lose it's power - After maybe 3-4 viewings, I always forget the conclusion of this scene, which increases it's brilliance because it's the firecrackers you remember, and it keeps you wondering.. what happens after this?",Boogie Nights
75,lambiepie-2,An Excellent Mainstream look into Pornography in the 70's/80's,10,28 April 2003,"What a bold undertaking to present a film to mainstream audiences showing them a tad of what the pornography industry was about in Southern California in the 70's/80's. This is when Pornography was going...""mainstream"". This is when those doing these films wanted to prove this genre was more than just sex -- that it was no different than major motion pictures and the actors actually saw themselves this way.I think if a theme like this was done by others, it would have went way off base..some Producers/Directors trying to weed in social commentary or their beliefs -- while others just getting ""down and dirty"" in telling the tale...which would have indeed turned me off from seeing this film.Director Paul Thomas Anderson didn't go either route. He just let you decide what to make of it, all he does is show you the lives of these folks at that time when so many changes were happening to that industry, to the characters and the world around them. You learn that these actors/actresses were regular people, real folks. They hurt, they bleed, they wanted real love and committment, and they wanted to party and be ""famous"".Some had problems, but the idea that ""hookers"" and ""morally bankrupt people"" were all that made up this industry, you see here that's not all true. At this time, that was all being turned around.In ""Boogie Nights"" you view these characters reasons for getting involved in such an industry. The way its done is good. What happens to these characters are good to see as well, how much money and power they get, how it all goes away....all the things they get involved in...and what for? I love the transition from the 70's to the 80's when Video makes this industry grow even more mainstream. The challenges of those who do NOT want to change.
Not all good things happen to these characters. Southern California -- The Valley -- is known for its adult films NOW. This shows you how all that probably started and how ""stars"" were made out of those who acted in it. It is a closed knit industry, everyone knows everyone else and from what I understand, its hard to ""progress"" from adult films to Hollywood Films/Series but some have done so.I really like the 70's feel of the film, this is one of the only films to date that actually captures late 70's styles, clothes, hair, attitude which made it also fun to watch. The transition into the early 80's was nice too, leaving out one main event that eventually plagued the adult sex industry, but this film wasn't about that. It really stops at a certain time because it only goes through the main character's rise and fall in a very taboo industry. The casting of Burt Reynolds was smart as was sprinkling the movie with real adult film stars. Excellent performances from the leads Mark Walhberg and Julianne Moore and such memorable performances from Luis Guzman, Don Cheatle, Phillip Baker Hall, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Heather Graham, Ricky Jay, John C. Reilly, Robert Ridgley (Just wonderful!), Nicole Ari Parker, and Thomas Jane -- who looks like they just picked him up right from the 70's Male Stud Cosmopolitan Center Fold Spread and threw him in there!Boogie Nights is not for everyone, and its not for those looking to get a cheap ""buzz"" from porno-light. It's a smart film with smart acting and directing that makes it way above the pack for its theme and well worth seeing.",Boogie Nights
76,Jeremy_Urquhart,Cinema perfected,10,5 September 2020,"This is without a doubt one of my all time favourite movies. While Paul Thomas Anderson has arguably matured as a director (and many would say his later films like There Will Be Blood and The Master are better), I don't think any will replace Boogie Nights as my personal favourite from him.I first watched this back in 2012, when I was maybe just old enough to watch it, at the still pretty young age of 17. I loved (and honestly still do love) Tarantino, Scorsese, and De Palma, and you can clearly see that these directors were a big influence on Paul Thomas Anderson for this film. Some may see that as a detriment, but I don't think it's too derivative of anything else (though the opening shot does flirt with being very comparable to a similarly lengthy one-shot early on in Goodfellas).Anyway, the first time I watched this, I remember loving the movie so much that at about the halfway point, I felt that it was going by too quickly. So I paused the movie, did some other stuff for about half an hour, and then came back, because the movie felt too good to finish; I didn't want it to be over. Since then, I've never done this (admittedly odd behaviour) with any other film. Not even with the ones I've loved on the same level as Boogie Nights.What we have here is an ensemble cast- one of the best ever assembled- all operating at the top of their game, working with a young but incredibly talented director, and with an excellent screenplay and fantastic soundtrack carrying the whole thing along. Everything moves at a great pace, every actor and actress gets at least one extremely memorable scene to shine, and the film seamlessly flips around between being funny, sad, introspective, uncomfortable, and tense.I think I could give this close to a perfect score for the Alfred Molina scene alone. Without saying what happens, it's just 10 minutes of filmed perfection- so funny, so intense, so insane, and incredibly edited and scored with several 80s hits to boot. Most filmmakers won't make a scene that good in their entire career, and Paul Thomas Anderson did it in just his second feature, and managed to put said scene in a movie filled with countless other scenes that are almost all just as good.Boogie Nights is a must watch, for its great acting, stylish direction, memorable soundtrack, fantastic depiction of both the 70s AND 80s, and for its taboo yet always interesting subject matter. The fact that movies this good exist gives me an odd sense of hope, as if we can't be living in the darkest timeline if this timeline has blessed us with Paul Thomas Anderson, and he himself has subsequently blessed us with Boogie Nights.Watch it and rewatch it and rewatch it again. It never gets old, and it almost feels as though it hasn't aged a day. Boogie Nights is absolute perfection on celluloid.",Boogie Nights
77,sharky_55,It's my big d*ck and I say when we roll.,6,23 March 2016,"Burt Reynolds immediately grounds us within the 70s world of pornography that seems to be at first all glitz and glamour. He is the most assured of this wild, sweeping cast - a porno king played straight. He takes his porn serious, thinks of it as an art-form, and aspires to elevate the medium to new levels even as the technological shift threatens to move from big screens to small. Not only is he the overseeing director, but he is the daddy of this f*cked up family, and even as his kingdom falls around him his arms will be wide open welcoming back his children and telling them to clean their rooms. But of course, this is not about him, but about Wahlberg's Eddie who strives to make it big after years of emotional abuse from a stunted upbringing. Anderson makes the porn star life as frenetic and glamorous as possible - from the opening take that sweeps around and unveils the crowded bar, to the whip pans and frantic zooms and camera light- bulbs flashing from all directions in the frenzied montage that says ""you've made it"". Of course, it's nothing that Scorsese hasn't already done before. And it seems that Anderson likes to pick and choose his tragedies as he pleases in order to serve the narrative; early on there is a hilarious encounter with a washed-up star that has just seen his second OD in just two days, and although this is foreshadowing, Anderson can't help but show this through a comedic lens because of the hazy, orgasmic high from Dirk Diggler's rise to stardom. Later, when the script calls for his fall from grace, drug addiction is again the vice, but it doesn't unfold in any real capacity. It's like Anderson needed a stereotypical plot device to engineer the darker moments and just throws cocaine at the screen without actually engaging with it at any deeper level. And that goes also for Macy's character, who exits with the most self-indulgent little nod you might see from a suicide scene. The rest of the 'family' have their own f*cked up problems, although the theory that leaving the family results in tragedy doesn't seem to hold up when you point the camera at Julianne Moore. Her own storyline is tragic enough; having lost out on custody of her actual kid, she spends her days codling and mothering Dirk as a way of compensating for her previous loss. But Anderson feels the need to condescend these heart-wrenching emotions by focusing on her sobbing after another failed attempt to win back visitation rights. How can we pity someone when we do not know the whole story, but are merely pushed into the act of sympathy because pornography is somehow being demonised? It works a little better for Don Cheadle's Buck, where we see the visible frustration at being not taken seriously because he acted in a few pornos.It seems that Anderson grows the story from these characters, the live-wire humour, the zany, half believable situations they find themselves in. There are smaller moments of characterisation that are allowed to stand for themselves. The sweet little ""ki-yaa"" that Buck and Jessie share in the car, both having somehow escaped from the toxicity of the family and made a life for themselves (although even then Anderson has to shove the most inexplicably coincidental bit of violence to kickstart it). And Heather Graham's Rollergirl, a bundle of sexual energy that glides around everywhere in her skates and almost makes us forget she is just a kid still in school. But if you pull away for the bigger picture it seems all too inconsequential. Philip Seymour Hoffman has a heartbreaking moment, and then just sort of disappears. Wahlberg's rise and fall seems completely determined by the script rather than actual cause and effect in the narrative - when he can no longer get hard, the cause is because of his drug addiction, but this hasn't been expanded on, but merely presented as a symptom of burn out in the high stakes porno industry. And Anderson adds dissolves to the crucial scene, instead of letting the built-up frustration from Wahlberg take its natural toll (this might be because Wahlberg has never really been a great actor, but at the time he seemed fresh). Why not let the film roll, like he does in that tense cooker-pot situation where the fireworks keep making the group jump and they slowly realise this is a bad idea? Wahlberg sits there frozen for a good 45 seconds as he comes to the realisation. It's also one of the only scenes where Anderson's use of 80s pop hits doesn't seem like an ironic touch (although that just might be because of Molina's fantastically unhinged performance - ""He's Chinese...). These are the worn out tracks from the jukebox, the tunes that everyone knows even if they didn't experience that era. It's phony.",Boogie Nights
78,aciessi,Ranks Among My All Time Favorites,10,9 December 2013,"P.T Anderson hit the Hollywood scene in 1997 with ""Hard Eight"" and ""Boogie Nights"". But it was ""Boogie Nights"" that launched his career into the mainstream, and earned him several Oscar nominations. But it was robbed, BIG TIME, for at least a nomination for best picture. ""Boogie Nights"" is hands down one of the best American movies in the last 25 years. P.T Anderson is an undeniable master of drama, and he (really) should stand among the ranks of Tarentino and Scorsese. The way he weaved this tumultuous narrative was groundbreaking for any filmmaker of the time. The story is essentially a young man finally finding the love and affection he always needed from a new family. The only problem is, this family is in the smut business. It's a story as provocative as the centerfold of a Hustler magazine, but as thought provoking as ""Citizen Kane"". The performances are some of the best I've ever seen. Mark Wahlberg's screen debut as Dirk Diggler is arguably his best performance to date. Burt Reynolds is captivating as Jack Horner, the pornographer who dreams of making Oscar gold. Julianne Moore deserved her Oscar for her performance of Amber Waves, a former mother who finds her sense of family with the people she sleeps with, and not with the children she birthed. Also, you've got Heather Graham as Rollergirl, Don Cheadle, the always funny John C. Reilly, the even funnier Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Then, you have William H. Macy as Little Bill, or what can only be described as the ultimate cuckold. His shattering performance ranks with Steve Buscemi's Donny from ""The Big Lebowski"" as one of the funniest characters in all of film. Who else could forget the scene at the drug dealers house with the firecrackers and the.? OK for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet, I might be getting ahead of myself. I just get so excited talking about this film! Its scenes like that that make the entire film an unforgettable experience. This film clocks in at 155 minutes which is precisely one minute longer than Pulp Fiction, but like Pulp Fiction, every minute is enthralling. Its the greatest 2 and 1/2 hours you could possibly spend on Netflix. My love for this movie grows every time I think about it, and I want to share that love with all of you. Enjoy!",Boogie Nights
79,rockman182,Boogie Nights,8,26 July 2012,"I put off watching this film for a while, and I'm not sure why. The film explores the golden age of pornography which went from the late 70's and into the 80's. The first half of the film is nice, vibrant, sexual, and just a great time. Paul Thomas Anderson has a bunch of actors that he uses in most of his work, and its a great bunch that don't fail. What starts off as a fun look at the porn industry, then turns into a dramatic and emotional tale that takes a look into the negatives of the industry. Won't give anything away, but you can see PTA's brilliance especially as the film winds down. Overall, its a very good film that is very much worth a look.8/10",Boogie Nights

The Film is about a young man ,Dirk Digler(Mark Wahlberg) who finds himself being recruted into the pornography buisiness by a film maker,Jack Horner(Burt Reynolds) because of his huge talent,and i'm not talking about his acting ability!. The movie takes us through his innocent beginings into porn and how it goes very wrong. For me this film is not so much about the story but it is about the acting,Mark Wahlberg,Burt Reynolds ,Julianne Moore,Heather Graham and William H Macey are all magnificent. At the start of the film you cant help but really like the people, they all have there own personalities. They all start of as a sexy group of people and after the drugs kick in they become inwardly ugly. In a way the film does take a down turn when their personalities change simply because you dont quite like them as much as before and that says a lot for the cast.

81,gbheron,"Interesting, Well Made Movie",10,8 May 1999,"Boogie Nights is an uncritical look behind the scenes of the porn industry as it moved from theatrical films to home video.

Julianne Moore stars as the porn veteran cum mother-figure to Dirk Diggler, teen-age discovery of Jack's whose god-given endowment leads him quickly to the top of the porn industry.Aided by an excellent ensemble cast, the film follows the entertwined lives of this little band over a seven year period, 1977 - 1984.

82,KnightsofNi11,Another masterpiece from Paul Thomas Anderson,9,16 May 2011,"After being stunned by the subtle artistry of Hard Eight everyone knew that Paul Thomas Anderson's sophomoric directorial effort would have to push cinema limits. And boy did it ever. It not only pushed aesthetic limits, but the limits of what you can actually get away with in movies. Boogie Nights is a film set in the 1970's adult film industry. Dirk Diggler wants to be somebody and he gets his chance after finding his way into the porn industry via a director named Jack Horner. Jack is a director with vision and he wants to elevate pornography into an art form rather than just, well... what porn is intended for. The film spans about ten years, chronicling the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler and the various characters he meets along the way. It's a fanatical ensemble piece with all sorts of spunk and nuance to it that sets it apart anything we've ever witnessed.The IMDb page for Boogie Nights wrongly categorizes it as a drama. This film is absolutely a comedy that poses as a drama at times, and it knows it is doing so. You have to face facts. The characters we are involved with here are all sorts of shady people. They are a bunch of sex crazed, coked up, short tempered sociopaths, and thats what makes it all so much fun. There is nothing like watching a coked up Alfred Molina run around in his underwear shooting at Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reily. The film does get dramatic at times, but there is that constant subtle undertone that says, ""None of this is really supposed to be taken seriously. It's all for the pure insanity and the fun."" Anderson has really done something ingenious with his script here. Jack Horner wants to create pornography with a story in order to draw in his audience in a different kind of way. He wants to enthrall his audience in the story and then entertain them with the porn side. But the result of his aspirations is the most hysterically awful plot lines and characters that you would expect from a porno. And what is even more hilarious is how the talented actors in the film pull off God awful porn acting perfectly. And the great irony of it all is that everyone else in the film is blown away by it and they treat it like master class material. There is a scene at the Adult Film Awards where Dirk Diggler wins multiple awards for his work, while we have just been witnessing how hilariously awful the acting is. The satirical levels on which this story works are just brilliant.But not only does Anderson show off his script writing and story telling abilities in Boogie Nights, he also proves that a great script can be raised to all new heights when it is directed so incredibly well. Anderson's eye for long tracking shots and aesthetically fantastic pans is displayed here in every fashion. The film's opening shot, which starts outside of a night club, follows Jack Horner and his wife in, then proceeds to show many of the main characters in the night club is almost three minutes long. But he doesn't use all of his talent up there. We are treated to plenty more of these brilliant shots throughout the entire two and a half hour film which never gets dull and never lets up on the crazed hilarity.Boogie Nights is a film that is driven so steadfastly well by everything in the film. Anderson's script is fantastic and it tells a wildly entertaining story. His direction moves the film along at a brisk yet deliberate pace which develops every subplot just as fully as the main plot. And he also directs his fantastic actors with the same level of keen poignancy. Every performance in this film is incredible, even the brief cameos from huge names like Phillip Baker Hall or the great Alfred Molina. There's never a dull moment in Boogie Nights, probably due to the fact that every last bit of the film is unlike anything you've ever seen before. Paul Thomas Anderson took some major risks making a film about porn, yet he does it with so much satirical class and hilarious playfulness that it is difficult to dislike the film whether you find the subject matter offensive or not.",Boogie Nights
83,Bob-45,The Three Stooges Go XXX in a Daze,5,30 June 2000,"BOOGIE NIGHTS starts with virtuoso camera work and goes down hill from there. Loosely based on the career of John Holmes and the erotic film business in general, the film is alternately harsher and gentler than reality.  As a former connoisseur of erotic films, I can tell you MANY of the 35MM erotic films made in the 70s and early 80s are better than BOOGIE NIGHTS.  Even many of the erotic film actresses were better looking than anyone in BOOGIE NIGHTS. I was appalled at how stupid everyone was presented to be.  Anyone who has listened to interview with many of the top flight erotic film stars of that time (Paul Thomas, Ron Jeremy, Annette Haven, John Leslie, Jamie Gillis, Gloria Leonard, Sharon Mitchell, Georgina Spelvin, Harry Rheems) can tell you, ""These people are NOT stupid."" I did notice a couple of adult film people in this movie. Nina Hartley plays Bill Macy's wife (my, what goshawful makeup! Was that intentional?)Forget the gross errors (Burt Reynolds smoking a cigar near the camera while filming; references to FRESCA, when the product was off the market during those years; Bill Macy's blown line, ""My wife has her a** in a d**k"").  What about the shot in the bar when the camera is pointed off into space while Reynolds speaks, then pans over to him?  What about the terrible framing on Mark Wahlberg during the ripoff that climaxes the movie?  What about Don Cheadle's horrendous ignorance of stereo, even though he becomes obsessed with selling it? What about the guy telling Wahlberg to ""get in his car"" when he is driving a pickup?) My gosh, this stuff is amateur night. There IS some things to like in BOOGIE NIGHTS: a great performance by the late Robert Ridgely as Colonel James, and notable performances by Don Cheadle, Burt Reynolds and whomever the actor is who played Reynold's cameraman, as well as really fine period music. Anyone interested in the TRUE story of John Holmes (far more horrific than BOOGIE NIGHTS) should watch the special on E!  But I would like to make two points before I close. The box score on erotic film stars is not good.  Many die in their 30s.  The primary causes of death appear to be (in order) suicide, drug overdose, cancer and AIDS.  Second, does anyone besides me care that civil liberatarians seem more interested in cable TV and adult magazines for prisoners than whether prisoners are raped, brutalized or murdered by other prisoners?  I bring up that point because that appears to be the fate of one of the characters in the movie.",Boogie Nights
84,TOMASBBloodhound,A gutsy effort... and extremely well-made.,9,22 May 2005,"P.T. Anderson's Boogie Nights is basically a character study of porn industry participants between the years of 1977-1984. We see much of the film through the eyes of a young man who takes the industry by storm at the tender age of 17. We see his rise during the care-free innocence of the later 70s and we witness him bottom out in the early 80s. We are also introduced to several other performers, filmmakers, hangers on, and criminals. Cocaine seems to be the catalyst behind much of the action. This type of film might have been laughable if made by a director with less talent, but Anderson's unique style and skills make it a winner.Mark Wahlberg plays our young stud who takes the name of ""Dirk Diggler"". He's apparently a high school dropout with an enormous penis who catches the attention of a porn director played by Burt Reynolds. Wahlberg's performance begins as properly understated, then seems to grow with the character. Reynolds hasn't been this good since Smokey and the Bandit. The rest of the cast reads like a ""who's who"" of the more respected actors of our day. Don Cheadle is outstanding as a young man who takes pride in his ""acting"", but really wants to open up a stereo store more than anything else. Julianne Moore is is also very good as the maternal figure of the troupe who has basically adopted the younger actors as her own children to replace her real son lost in a custody dispute. There is simply not enough space here to give credit to everyone who acted superbly in this film.Anderson's skill with the camera is on display in numerous shots. Many have been used elsewhere, but he knows how to work them into his story. Many of the scenes take place in crowded rooms or at parties where all kinds of interesting things are going on. His technique often takes us from one room to another, then perhaps outside so we don't miss a thing. The use of soundtrack is perhaps the best of any film I've ever seen. In fact, it IS the best. With so many great songs of the period at his disposal, he works two discs worth into the story. Nothing seems excessive or out of place.If one fault can be found with this film, then I would have to say it would be too much violence in the last half hour. Any industry that deals in sex and drugs to that extent is bound to encounter violence in some circles, but Boogie Nights over does it. I counted no less than five extremely bloody scenes. In one, a VERY young woman overdoses on coke and breaks a blood vessel in her nose. There are several gunshot victims. But the most over-the-top scene would have to be the one where Heather Graham stomps on the head of a young man with her roller skates. The manner in which she comes in contact with him is contrived to the point of hysteria, then the scene ends in such a brutal assault that you'll hardly be able to control your skepticism. The fact that the consequences of the assault are not even revealed to the audience (at least not in any version of the film I've seen) makes you wonder why Anderson thought to include it at all. It was just a means for the young woman to get some revenge on a guy who made fun of her way back in high school. Nothing more.The film lacks any scene which inspires any true sexual feeling from anyone I've ever talked to. This was indeed intended. The sex in the film is all about business, though Graham's brief nude scene was well appreciated. The film is also lacking in any kind of judgment or moral lesson. We are merely introduced to these characters, then we see what happens to them. Despite a near documentary point of view, the film never bogs down or fails to keep one's interest. The film didn't make that much money, but it has earned the distinction of being one of the better films made in the 1990s. A reputation well-deserved.9 of 10 stars from The Hound.",Boogie Nights

You see my point here either there is a lot of action, effects or comedy in a film, otherwise it is not good (at least at the box  office) and that is why this one did not get huge sums into the cash register. OK this is maybe not as good as Titanic and some of the others, but I think you can watch movies like this more often than for example MIB or Air Force One, which are enjoyable at the cinema and then become boring fast.

88,agmoldham,Exploitation,7,1 December 2003,"The director and much of the cast are also responsible for Magnolia so it's not surprising this is a great movie. The film follows the film career of Dirk Digler and is apparently loosely based on the life of the porn star John Holmes. Although not quite as disturbing as 8mm this certainly shows the dangers of being sucked into the world of porn. The people that make the money from porn ruthlessly exploit the people that star in the movies. Why Burt Reynolds didn't win an oscar for his performance is a mystery. Other notable performances are turned in by Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C Reilly, William H Macy and Mark Wahlberg, but that isn't surprising as these are some of the finest character actors plying their trade in Hollywood. For anybody who just wants to see what all the fuss is about, just watch the last 30 seconds and apparently it's not Mark Wahlberg !",Boogie Nights
89,FilmOtaku,"Stylish, thought-provoking and amazing",9,23 October 2003,"Paul Thomas Anderson's epic film about the origin, rise and fall of fictitious porn star Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) is an incredible contribution to film, hands down.  While many of his `regular' actors (Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Phillip Baker Hall and Ricky Jay among them) are excellent actors in their own right, he squeezes hilarious, ironic and gut-wrenching performances from them. Probably the most effective performance of course is by Mark Wahlberg. While this was not his first film, it was his first starring role and when the film was over he was `Marky-Mark' no more.  A lot has been said about this film, and there are far too many reasons to mention to illustrate why this film has very solidly remained in my top 15 favorite films of all time, but one scene I would like to mention is the scene near the end of the film between Wahlberg, Reilly, Thomas Jane and Alfred Molina.  Set in Molina's living room and involving a drug deal, Anderson directs this scene with such incredible finesse that it goes down in history as one of the greatest moments in the last thirty years of film. Between the palpable tension, the brilliant choice of music and the unbelievable acting by the primaries, this scene is important to watch more than once to experience how a scene should be written and blocked to tell a story with both unflinching imagery and subtlety at the same time.  I will see a mediocre movie and then put on this scene after to renew my faith in *good* filmmaking.This is obviously not a film for everyone due to its subject matter, but it is such an incredible and important film, it should not be overlooked.--Shelly",Boogie Nights
90,Pedro_H,Smart and original script - that runs out of stream early,7,15 October 2002,"Life and times of the 1970's porn setWhatever you say about Paul Thomas he is original. Who else would make a drama about the heyday of porn and cast Burt Reynolds as the lead? Not me, that's for sure.Despite what you imagine you don't see a lot of sex in this movie. And most of the sex you do see is cold and mechanical and not at all lovely. Wahlberg is fine as the young slow witted stud who is transported from dishwasher to stardom - only to come apart.(How much this is acting and how much is the real Wahlberg I couldn't tell you.)Reynolds is a revelation - the man can act. And even more surprises, he plays a porn director with a heart! The problem with this film is that having set the scene (and very well it is done) there is nothing left but to tear the scene apart. The movie is almost perfectly 50 percent good time - 50 percent hard times. Sliced right through the middle.The dialogue is good, but not good enough to heard twice and the whole thing slides away in to morals (people in porn have a stigma, remember) and murder.

92,petarmatic,One of the best films about porn.,8,4 February 2014,"This film left me breathless. It was so good that I watched it several times over.It is rare that film industry makes a film about porn film industry. They usually do not like each other. Better to say ""regular"" film industry looks down on porn film industry. When I wanted to study movie directing, now famous film director Jasmila Zbanic said that I can not study since I watch too much porn???!!!??? First of all how did she find out that? Well I assume because Sarajevo was during my teen years and still is such a small town that all the owners of the VHS rentals of those times knew each other and shared information of customers interests. Zbanic owned one of the VHS rental places but she never had porn films for rent. Her mother was a big Muslim believer and she would not permit anything of that in her store. I rented those films from a different VHS rental places and she still found out. So to make the long story short twists and turns of history turned us so Zbanic became award winning film director, while I hm, became a IMDb amateur reviewer.I am so glad Ron Jeremy contributed to this film, he is such a great guy! I met him once briefly, very nice guy. Philip Seymour acted in this film. One more time R.I.P.Now this is a must see! Film portrays adult film industry well. It is very entertaining and full of interesting and funny twists and turns. No wonder it received so many awards, it really deserves.

This was a terrific film in every way, and although I found it to be a little long, it was worth the effort to sit through the rare slow spot.  The ending was particularly entertaining, as it had an intensity that really got my heart pumping.  But even when the film had a more leisurely pace, it was no less compelling, thanks to an intelligent script and an outstanding ensemble cast.  And of course, the best thing about this movie was Burt Reynolds, who finally got some well-deserved respect.",Boogie Nights
94,vostf,A 2h 1/2 gracious limp jumping over 8 years in the porn industry,2,11 May 2008,"I've seen 2 other movies by P.T. Anderson, Magnolia and There will be blood. All three are brilliantly crafted but disturbingly empty while the story lingers on and revels in distressing characters. So my opinion is P.T. Anderson should not write and be content with directing movies. As such it feels like a man-who-thinks-he-is-an-artist's work, with a lot of self-indulgence for the subject matter, and very little substance.In Boogie Nights the pornography business is seen as a nice family, with some occasional violence and an increasing drug consumption. Actually it could have been about a rock band or small time drug dealers. The pornography industry may be fascinating from the outside but it is more about people living from day to day and is thus not the least interesting, especially with the un-gritty look and feel P.T. Anderson gives his movie.Poor boy Dirk Diggler and his friends are neither bad nor nice, nor clean, not dirty. What they do has no meaning (sure, they are living from day to day) and they learn nothing, build nothing. OK some just happen to suddenly disappear in the process while one of them eventually gets a wife, a baby and the money to settle a 'real' business. Nobody's saved, nobody's doomed, everybody is just normal people: who cares about a movie like that? It is just episode after episode, starting 1977 and ending 1984, a patchwork of anecdotes making up for a story: style shall never be an excuse.",Boogie Nights
95,DarthVoorhees,Sex with all it's subtleties,10,6 October 2010,"Who would have thought Paul Thomas Anderson could have created the masterpiece of porn? 'Boogie Nights' is a superb effort in directing. It is a fully realized and brilliant film. What I admire most about Anderson's vision is the scope. He has created a fully constructed world and placed well rounded and interesting characters to inhabit it. The dialogue has spunk and bite and the picture is perfectly casted.Sex is hard to make a picture about, pure and simple. What makes 'Boogie Nights' a masterpiece in my opinion is that it portrays sex in such a blunt way. Whatever sense of spiritualism and individuality achieved through sex is completely gone from these characters. They merely go through the motions. If I had to choose a central motif of what Anderson tries to convey in this picture it would be the dehumanization of sex. Julianne Moore, who gives the finest performance of her career as Amber Waves, has a brilliant moment in the film when she first experiences 'penetration' with 'Dirk Diggler'. She asks Wahlberg's character to come inside her. I'm actually somewhat taken back from having to write this down but this is the crucial moment of the film. There is a line between bodily fluids and seed and 'Boogie Nights' plays with that line, debates it.One thing about 'Boogie Nights' though is that it doesn't damn the porno industry, nor should it. The Burt Reynolds character Jack Horner is brilliantly written and has clearly understandable motives. He views himself as an artist and why shouldn't he? One person's porn is another person's art. There is some sympathy to be felt when Horner's craft becomes nothing more than home videos. To go from the glory of celluloid to fuzzy home video is a long fall. Horner is in his own delusional world and is brought out in an extremely well crafted scene. Horner says that he will find the next adult film star on video tape. The scene leads to a rape of the adult film star 'Rollergirl' on fuzzy scratchy tape. It isn't art and it isn't 'sexy'.'Diggler' is nothing more than a stupid prop in these porn films. He didn't get to where he was with his acting skills. He has one thing in the world and it really is fascinating how Paul Thomas Anderson creates a character around that notion. 'Diggler' has to be a thoughtless tank for the picture to work. He has to have the base animal instincts of what sex is. It makes the picture all the more tragic for 'Diggler' to truly grasp even the slightest bits of maturity through whoring himself out. 'Diggler' is forced to go through hell. Anderson is blatant in his subtleties about what plaque 'Diggler' and his sex life. The character isn't really complete until the moment when he is paid next to nothing to jack off in a car. In many ways 'Boogie Nights' is a tragic film but I think it's more than that. It has an extremely satisfying conclusion where 'Diggler' questions his existence and his role in life better than almost any cinematic character that preceded him.",Boogie Nights
96,moviesleuth2,Rich ensemble drama,8,29 July 2009,"""Boogie Nights"" is the feature film debut of Paul Thomas Anderson, the young writer/director who has in the past decade taken the independent film circuit by storm to the acclaim of critics and audiences alike. If this sounds like Quentin Tarantino (albeit half a decade later), it's not meant to. ""Boogie Nights"" isn't as strong of a film as ""Resevoir Dogs,"" but it's close.Calling Anderson's film a Hollywood story isn't really truthful (the film revolves around the pornography business), but it follows a more-or-less similar plot trajectory to any ""rise and fall of a star in showbusiness."" In this case, the film revolves around Eddie Adams, a seventeen year old who is spotted by hotshot porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). After agreeing to ""act"" in one of Jack's films, Eddie, now known as Dirk Diggler, becomes an instant sensation and becomes king of the porn film industry. But with every rise there is a fall, and it's usually much harder than the rise to stardom.Actually, ""Boogie Nights"" is more than a biography. It's about a group of friends and coworkers who work together making pornographic films. Dirk is clearly the center of the film, but the other characters are not forgotten. The other characters are given due attention to their own little dramas. This is the film's biggest problem; there's way too much of it, and it causes the film to drag. In fact, many of these characters could have been written out entirely.The acting is outstanding all around. Mark Wahlberg is not an actor with a broad range. But even though he had to wait nine more years for an Oscar nomination, this is his best performance. At the beginning, Eddie is innocent and eager to please. But as he becomes Dirk, his ego gets inflated, and drugs start to take hold. Burt Reynolds is brilliant as Jack. For once, the big Hollywood type is not a sleazebag who would throw someone out on the street once they stopped making money. He's a father figure to Dirk, and although in the beginning his world seems brimmed with danger and uncertainty, but Jack's warmth makes it feel homey after a while. The rest of the cast is great as well: special acclaim has to go to Julianne Moore (has she ever given a bad performance?), Don Cheadle, and John C. Reilly.Paul Thomas Anderson is unquestionably a filmmaker, not a movie director. His style and his technique show a much greater skill than something you would see in a given movie at the multiplexes. He has a keen eye for detail (the setting is impeccable), and he makes sure that each shot is perfect. Not everything he does is perfect (the film needed a better editor-many scenes run for too long, and some just don't need to be there), but what is there is very good.",Boogie Nights

It's epic in so many ways and crams a lot into its 2.5 hour runtime - most of which is awesome.You can't help but get caught up in the infectious party atmosphere of the late 70s setting. The fashion, the lifestyles, the music, the sex, the drugs. It's all here in large amounts. The soundtrack for Boogie Nights is one of the best you'll come across.It features so many big name actors delivering some of their best performances at once. The characters are unique, real and often quite likeable. Drugs, guns, sex, violence, darkness, humour - there's really a bit of everything here for everyone.Burt Reynolds was perfectly cast in his role as Jack Horner. Mark Wahlberg delivered his best career performance and made his character surprisingly likeable. I think I fell in love with Julianne Moore in this - her intimate scenes with Wahlberg were standouts. William H Macy, Don Cheadle and Philip Seymour Hoffman through in ample doses of hilarity whenever they were on screen too.Many memorable moments, and at the same time a complete blur too - which is fitting for the time and place it's set.

But the thing is, the whole film isn't really about porn. Well halfway through the film is about the porn industry but the other half is about the character development and the bad situations these characters go through. The actors played there roles perfect, especially Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly, and William H. Macy.

102,Antagonisten,Dirk Diggler,7,14 September 2005,"Boogie Nights is one of those few movies that can take a difficult subject and do something with it that most people can watch and appreciate. The porn-industry is a mess in more ways than one and there is much to criticize, and i know this movie has been considered to glorify the business. Something i don't agree with.The story about Dirk Diggler and his exploding porn-career in the late 1970's - early 1980's bears considerable similarity with that of John Holmes and the fact that Holmes has been an inspiration is obvious. The thing i most appreciated about this movie is the way that it shows both sides of the business. At first the upside where the young kid is introduced to a world of sex, drugs and rich friendly people. Then later the backside with crime, abuse and crashed lives. And it's all done with an excellent mix of comedy and drama as well as a distinct feeling when it comes to style. Visual as well as otherwise.Despite being a movie about the porno business, Boogie Nights is not very explicit. A correct choice in my opinion since more explicit scenes wouldn't have added to the movie, rather it would instead have run the risk of feeling like exploitation. Paul Thomas Anderson is a talented director and he manages to balance many talented actors in a good way while still letting it be his more than their film. Also i don't know what he did with Mark Wahlberg, but suddenly he could act! I don't like Wahlberg at all otherwise but here even he performed well.Boogie Nights is well worth seeing even if you completely despise the porno industry. There is room for more than one opinion here and Anderson doesn't really state his own. I rate this 7/10.",Boogie Nights
103,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: movie about misery, lacking nudity",2,13 April 2002,"Can we talk? Really talk?I figured this might be a good film to watch for some nude scenes. Sort of like ""Striptease"", which delivered plenty... er, so I am told.It is a story about how the porn film industry, while it has an air of festivity and fun, is actually loathsome, destroys people's lives, and is generally miserable. Well, guess what. The characters in the film are loathsome, their lives get destroyed, and it made me fell as miserable as watching the downward spiral in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (where at least the characters were interesting and well-acted).I was not looking for a good story, good acting, good much of anything. But the film was STILL awful, and at rock bottom a movie about porn should have had more than few seconds of nudity. (There is a quick shot of Heather Graham.)Who should see this film:-- Nobody, even if you think you might want to.I'll give ""Boogie Nights"" a generous 2 out of 10 for Heather Graham's sake.",Boogie Nights
104,asda-man,PTA does MDMA,9,9 December 2015,"Paul Thomas Anderson is renowned for making weighty films filled with masterful directing, writing and acting. There Will Be Blood (my first taste of PTA) almost immediately became one of my top five favourites, resembling one of Stanley Kubrick's very best. I gave Magnolia a watch more recently and the whole thing astounded me with its emotional depth and richness. I'd been saving up Boogie Nights as many consider it Paul's greatest film. At a mere 26 years old, he created a critically-acclaimed masterpiece that blew his debut (which is still a pretty good film) out of the water. I couldn't wait to give Boogie Nights a watch and it didn't disappoint.I know it's not a popular opinion, but I still think There Will Be Blood and Magnolia are far better than Boogie Nights. However, that just shows how talented our Paul is as a filmmaker because Boogie Nights is a seriously terrific achievement right from the opening sombre music. We're then hit immediately by a blasting 70's pop track and a sweeping camera which takes us into the mind of Madonna when she was working on Confessions on a Dancefloor. A beautiful retro disco with all the main characters being introduced with perfect camera timing I don't know how Paul managed to do it but it's a fantastic piece of camera-work and it almost feels as though he's showing off a bit.The film is a rags to riches tale, with more than a touch of irony to it, of a young and naïve dishwasher who's whisked away by Burt Reynolds to become the biggest porn star there's ever been! The first half is the more entertaining and funny half. It's full of infectious energy and memorable characters who jump off the screen. For a film about the porn industry, there's surprisingly little smut aside from an extended sequence where Mark Whalberg films his first sex scene with Julianne Moore. It's extremely lively and full of fab scenes such as another impressive Steadicam move around a pool party and a fun montage showing Dirk Diggler's rise to pornographic stardom.The darker, second half is the more interesting one for me. We're suddenly plunged into the 80's and watch as everyone's lives go spiralling towards hell. The once friendly Dirk has turned into an egotistical cocaine-addict and Burt Reynolds has become a desperate director pimping his surrogate daughter out to strangers on the street. It's a sad chapter which adds weight and morality to the tale. The film could've been a terrific comedy in the vein of the Wolf of Wall Street, but the second half offers a lovely bleak balance and shows us that pornography is not an industry to aspire to get into. The seemingly fulfilled characters become much deeper and more tragic figures.There are some lovely scenes. One sequence which I really loved was a montage where all the characters are at their lowest. The music suited the scene so well and it felt very unsettling and intense. I also liked the moment where we're given a glimpse into Julianne Moore's life as she discusses getting custody of her child with her ex-husband. The film stops being fun and starts to become a much more serious beast set in a real world more closer to our own. Boogie Nights handles its many characters so expertly, kind of in the same way Magnolia did, although to a slightly lesser extent.Just when you think the film can't throw up any more brilliance, the best scene pops up towards the end. It involves Dirk's pathetic gang trying to orchestrate a drug deal at Alfred Molina's house. Everything about this scene is pretty much perfect from the acting to the music to the tense, unpredictable atmosphere. Even the firecrackers are a masterstroke! It erupts into a Quentin Tarantino styled shootout and the unpredictability of it all makes for a thrilling watch. In fact, the entire film is filled with so many terrific scenes that it makes for a very high rewatchability factor.My only complaint would be that, like Dirk's manhood, it's quite overlong. I think I would've preferred more of a focus on the 80's segment rather than the 70's. However, Boogie Nights is still a really great film. The thing that stands out the most is the masterful directing by the young Paul Thomas Anderson. Some argue that it's a Martin Scorsese rip-off but I'd argue that his style is even better than Martin Scorsese. It's a fantastic ride which leaves you with a lot to ponder about. So get your glad rags on and hit the dancefloor kids!",Boogie Nights
105,elicopperman,It Ain't Called Boogie Nights for Nothing,8,10 September 2018,"For more than 20 years, Paul Thomas Anderson has proven to be quite the unique filmmaker for his themes of alienation and loneliness, flawed characters, and distinct visual styles. So it's no surprise that I'd be discussing the film that helped kickstart his claim to fame, Boogie Nights. Although the title might suggest a film about disco, do not be fooled, for this is more about the pornography industry. In spite of such a crazy idea for a film, it actually works well in its favor, because a film like this could not have worked well enough without a little bit of craziness.The movie centers around a teenage busboy named Eddie Adams, who gets discovered by porn director Jack Horner and becomes a world famous adult-film star, Dirk Diggler. Despite succeeding in flying colors, Dirk begins to develop a severe ego and drug problem, which results in his downfall. Admittedly, the story itself is the typical underdog turned superstar plot where a nobody is turned into a somebody overnight but then enters a decline due to certain issues, making the viewing experience a little predictable. However, what elevates the film from its premise is how it depicts the porn business. As the film is set in the late 70s and early 80s, it displays a certain nostalgic representation of how the industry was when it came to classic exotic features. By depicting the business side of these movies, the viewing experience is set more in the shadows than the spotlight, and it's admirable to see the behind the scenes debacles of porno filmmaking.In terms of characters, Eddie is a pretty good representation of aspiring low-key actors who let their career get the best of them, and Mark Wahlberg carries enough charisma to make him charmingly energized in spite of his shortcomings. However, the character who steals the show is Jack Horner. Played wonderfully by Burt Reynolds (may he rest in peace), the man presents himself as sort of a father figure for a bizarre family of porn stars, yet he often seems more subdued with the idea of it, down to never shown having sex himself. In addition, Amber Waves is a former housewife turned porn star who is in desperate need of seeing her child again, and Julianne Moore is able to carry as much sympathy towards her character as she does with her seductive presence. Whenever Amber is with Eddie, she practically becomes a mother figure towards him, even becoming generally concerned for him during their sex scenes.Despite being about adult features, Anderson cleverly limits the nudity in the film, making the reveal of Eddie's dynamite dong all the more surprising. It's often funnier when you approach things like that subtly without revealing much, and the film takes full advantage of that, including a particular scene at a pool party where Dirk shows the financer of the features his thing offscreen for only a few seconds. My only main complaint with the film is the few subplots revolving around the supporting cast. I understand the influence of Nashville and Pulp Fiction with the variety of characters displaying differentiating human qualities in a louche world, but I personally found them to be a tad distracting and rather fluctuating in pace. Then again, at the end of the day, this film is about the fluctuating unpredictabilities that life can offer in such an infamous industry, so I suppose it fits within the context of the story.We'll probably never get another movie like this again, and we don't need to. Overall, Boogie Nights is a great commentary on the adult-film business that paints itself with a bizarre story about the crazy ups and downs of making a living, a cast of highly flawed albeit understanding characters, and a wonderful tribute to the glory days of porno. If you're into films that beautifully explore and comment on a particular subject of art and film, then this is just for you. Although given its subject matter and dark content, just be warned that this is not a movie for the sensitive viewers. If there's one thing you will get out of this movie though, it's that those who live by the sword also die by it, because people like Dirk Diggler may end up selling their dignity for the right and wrong reasons.",Boogie Nights
106,ronakkotian,"A period piece that's fun, atmospheric and expertly made",9,2 March 2021,"Paul Thomas Anderson is a director I have a lot of praise for. I thought Phantom Thread was great and I really loved Punch-Drunk Love. Boogie Nights is one of his best.Boogie Nights focuses on the porn industry during the late 70s to 80s and takes us through a range of characters involved the line of work.Paul Thomas Anderson's examination of this industry and the period it's set in is a winner all the way. There's so much to appreciate and so much fun to be had with Boogie Nights. The opening scene alone had me hooked and transported me to its flashy and glamourous world. The use of long takes during some scenes tell me so much about the time period and the lifestyle these people lived. Despite this being Anderson's second feature, he displays a lot of confidence behind the camera by capturing the spirit of the 70s and 80s in great detail. This is a very atmospheric film where you soak in the beauty of the scenery. The soundtrack is easily one of my favourite aspects. Not only did it sound great but it contributed so much to the mood of each scene. The song choices fit extremely well for the time period and the variety of them kept me entertained and engrossed throughout. The camerawork is slick and stylish. There are incorporations of various long takes with action taking place at every corner which is not only impressive but also purposeful in terms of developing its characters and worldbuilding.For its subject matter, Paul Thomas Anderson manages to handle it in a very smart and mature manner. For a film about the porn industry, the film wasn't as sexual as I thought it was going to be. The second half of the film takes a much more dark turn which I didn't expect. The script is fantastic in every way. Dialogue plays a large role in the film and some of them are really funny. Anderson introduces us to memorable characters with interesting personalities. We learn more and more about them as the film goes on. The darker second half plays a great contrast to the first as it peels back the glamour and shows us how troubled these people really are. The acting by everyone involved and Anderson's direction helps us identify with these people during their highs and lows.Mark Wahlberg in his breakout role delivers one of his performances here. His character goes through a range of emotions and Wahlberg proves himself to be a worthy actor by conveying that range brilliantly. There is one scene however where Wahlberg argues with his mum and the acting seemed a tad off then but he did really well during the rest of the film. Burt Reynolds is amazing here and is one of the standout performers in the film. Julianne Moore and Heather Graham are also terrific. John C. Reilly surprised me by how good he was. I've gotten used to seeing him as more of a comedic actor but there are a handful of serious scenes where he shines. I loved Philip Seymour Hoffman here. He's consistently impressed me and once again he shows how good of an actor he is. Don Cheadle is also great here. The entire ensemble cast bring their A game here.I cannot wait to see Boogie Nights again. It's a very entertaining period piece that captures the industry and time period with immense detail. There are many memorable scenes and characters that are fun to watch and go through a rollercoaster of emotions. Paul Thomas Anderson demonstrates his skill and talent as writer and director once again and I hope he continues making great films like this.",Boogie Nights
107,beresfordjd,Is this what the fuss was all about?,3,15 January 2012,This film is awful. I cannot believe that so many people thought it was wonderful. Trite and ponderous with few likable characters it seems to me to be floundering in its attempt to portray the 70's. Mark Wahlberg is an OK actor but does not convince in this and as as for it being a glimpse of Burt Reynolds best work I will stick with Deliverance for that. A good cast has been tragically wasted in a movie which should have been better written and edited. The constant music soundtrack of 70's hits does not make it any more authentic- feeling. It really just goes to show that actors are only really as good as the scripts they are given to work with and the direction they are given.,Boogie Nights

It is not surprising that this film and the actors were nominated for so many awards, and even won a lot too.It felt like a bit or a roller coaster of a film. The emotions of the movie were all over the place. One minute I was laughing, then something would happen and it just shocked me. The drama kicked in... but then the comedy would come back.The film was set in the 70s and 80s... the clothes and hair was great. and the film also has a pretty good soundtrack.There was a lot of nudity in the film too. I don't know why I was surprised at this. After all, the film is about the porn industry... but for some reason I was shocked to see all these Hollywood actors and actresses flashing it all... and as for Mark Whalberg... he wishes his dong was that big! haha. Apparently, the fake willy that you saw at the end of the movie was given to Mark Wahlberg when filming was finished... he still owns it to this day... but it is not in the same condition anymore. haha.I will give this film 7 out of 10.I really liked it, and it really put me in a time machine and took me back to the 70s/80s. :)For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Boogie Nights
109,socrates4,"A Fine Film, Not His Best",7,28 January 2019,"BOOGIE NIGHTS is a good movie about the adult film industry in the 1970's. It's portrayal of those films is fairly realistic. Some people will love this movie and some will hate it based on the subject matter alone.I thought it was very well done, as I've come to expect from director Paul Thomas Anderson. It's not his best work, but it is certainly good and intriguing. Even at more than two and a half hours it doesn't seem a bit too long. The story and the acting are wonderful. Burt Reynolds gives a terrific performance. Recommend to all but those who would be offended by the topic.",Boogie Nights
110,SKG-2,Excellent film about industry I don't care for,10,16 February 1999,"I've only seen one or two porn films, enough to make me know I don't want to see another one, and yet I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  Although it's set in the porn film industry, in a surprising way it's more about the extended family that develops among all these people who work together, and how things like drugs, fame, and money may have stretched those bonds, but not broken them completely (except for William H. Macy's character).  Another nice thing is how much affection Anderson has for these people, even when he acknowledges some of the bad things they may do (like how Dirk acts like a jerk because of his ego).  And the use of period music was inventive, like the 80's songs during the scene with Alfred Molina, which add to the tension of the scene.I wasn't a fan at all of Mark Wahlberg until he turned to acting, and then he started to show some talent, especially in this movie.  He acts on everything he feels as if it just occurred to him.  I'm also not a fan of Burt Reynolds, but he comes through here, because he doesn't condescend to the movie.  But of all the cast (who are really good), it's Julianne Moore who stands out, playing, in effect, the den mother, who is looked up to by her co-stars, but can't get custody of her own children.  She also pulls off the difficult trick of playing a bad actress, and she's the most convincing at it.",Boogie Nights

113,chrisbrown6453,"Let's get one thing out of the way before discussing Boogie Nights. Yes, it is a prosthetic device. Ah, the wonders of make-up.",7,20 July 2001,"Mark Wahlberg plays Eddie, a well-endowed teenage busboy in a San Fernando Valley nightclub. One night he is discovered by blue-movie director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). Jack takes one look at Eddie's unwrapped package and, presto, a huge star is born. Eddie assumes a nom de porn, Dirk Diggler, and the ""acting"" jobs start coming his way. His own family life is far from ideal, so Eddie/Dirk is more than happy to move in with his surrogate parents, Jack and Amber (Julianne Moore). Amber, as in Amber Waves, is a porn star and the mother figure little Dirkie needs. He even gets to sleep with her. Soon the '70s become the '80s and the heavy drugs start taking their toll. Video has changed the porn business forever and Dirk's enormous, uh, ego has become even more engorged. Bad times are a-coming. Ambitious young studs are being groomed to take the star's place. Must he resort to hustling? Can he keep performing on cue? By 1983, poor Diggler's just one more limp Dirk. All of this sounds pretty lurid, but young director Paul Thomas Anderson keeps the heady material from dragging us down with the characters. It is all surprisingly buoyant and, at times, even affecting. Boogie Nights does take an awfully long time (152 minutes) to reach a climax. Some serious issues get the skin-deep treatment, but a more diverting R-rated fairy tale would be hard to find. The cast is near perfect. Reynolds has never been better and former underwear pinup Wahlberg shows that there is plenty to life after Calvin. Moore scores the most emotional moments, while sterling support is provided by Don Cheadle, Heather ""Rollergirl"" Graham, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Alfred Molina. The disco-heavy soundtrack is a treasure trove that will have you shaking your own groove thing, prosthetic or real.",Boogie Nights
114,Flagrant-Baronessa,Atmospheric ensemble piece,7,22 September 2006,"Someone once told me that when looking at old photographs and portraits they could not help but think the people in them were dead and that this was a funny feeling. Well, I'd imagine that looking at porn from the 1970s and early 1980s would give the same feeling. This film is like a long, continuous reel of behind-the-scenes footage from old pornos  there are long-drawn shots, shaky and intimate camera movement and it all presents a very 'objective' view of its subject, eliminating the narrator factor in the product.It's an enjoyable product too, featuring an impressively cast all-star ensemble as the broken, bruised, decaying 'old' porn-stars, snorting coke and not really giving a damn about anything besides the art of film-making. Being a portrayal of an era rather than a plot-driven piece, there is really not much else to the story than that, unless you want to count Dirk Diggler's (Mark Wahlberg) claim to fame in the adult industry. ""Boogie Nights"" is, in spite of its upbeat title, a harrowing film that navigates the themes of decay and out-of-date values. For example, the once big-shot adult-movie director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) is at the height of his career when the film first zooms in on him, but toward the end he is fatally fading which culminates when a frat-boy screams at him: ""Your movies are sh it nowadays."" He snaps, beats him up, but returns a broken man.Because the film deals with such a 'fun' subject (sex, and the porn industry) in such a tragical way, it manages funny and heartbreaking at the same time. I do not know of many other movies that accomplish this, but ""Boogie Nights"" perfects it. The scene in which a fantastically broken, defeated and soft-spoken Julianne Moore sits on the bed with Heather Graham  both high as kites, and snorting  and the latter asks her if wants to be her mom, it is a scene so harrowing and simultaneously funny that it's nearly too much to take.The best description I can give of this film is that it is a 2 and a half hours long orgy of sex, drugs and pornstars walking around in a bubble of out-of-touch values, fading fame and a life that will disappoint them. It's well-acted, occasionally poignant and often funny but ultimately it lacks too much direction and a clear sense of point. It leads me to thinking that if you strip it of its sex factor, then would people enjoy this film? For instance, if director Anderson had zoomed in on the car-selling industry during the 1970s-1980s, would we even give a damn? I doubt it.7 out of 10",Boogie Nights
115,majikstl,"Sex, Lies and Video Tapes...",9,16 April 2004,"BOOGIE NIGHTS tells a lie, a big fat whopper of a lie. You know it's lying and it probably knows its lying. But you listen to the lie and are mesmerized by it, because it is a sad, dreamy lie. It's like the uncle who talks about what coulda-shoulda-woulda happened had he not started drinking, or the cousin who wistfully tells of what she plans to do once she wins the lottery. It's a lie you come to believe in because, well, it's just nicer and easier that way.The big lie in BOOGIE NIGHTS is the whole concept of the story. The film is about making porn films in the 1970's. The film somewhat romantically suggests that the ragtag band of filmmakers involved at this one little studio are somehow a family. They also believe they are creating art as pa rt of a family business. The film almost makes you believe it too. The idea that the porn industry is basically opportunistic and exploitive is somehow tucked away in a corner somewhere, vaguely visible, but never pointed out or discussed. To do so would interfere with the sense of community that exists between the characters. And the characters need that feigned innocence in order to justify the way they survive.Don't get me wrong, I have no moral qualms about porn -- to each is own -- but I don't have any delusions either. Porn is a business as cold and impersonal as the sex it depicts. Some pornographic filmmakers may, indeed, take pride in their work and strive to make the best films possible, but that is like striving to make the best hotdog possible. Porn is a product, ground out for fast and easy consumption. And the people who work in porn do it for the money, or to satisfy their own particular sexual kink, or because, well, they haven't anything better to do with their lives. I just don't believe that a life in porn is something anyone aspires to, let alone turns to for social acceptance.But for a few hours watching BOOGIE NIGHTS, you simply accept the lie, just as the characters accept the little lies that make up their lives. You believe Mark Wahlberg's Dirk Diggler really believes the he has found his special place in life by using the special gift God as given him. You believe that Heather Graham's Rollergirl believes that she has attained true stardom. You believe that Julianne Moore's Amber Waves is convinced that you can be a drug using porn star and that shouldn't affect your right to have custody of your children. You believe that Burt Reynolds' Jack Horner truly feels he is making ""art"" films. Such is the magic web that Paul Thomas Anderson weaves in his long, meandering and amusing slice of the low life.
Alas, reality sets in and naturally things go awry. Everyone must face their lies and the film's characters have to pay. Ironically, the film itself replaces its central lie with an even bigger one: Anderson's Altmanesque epic of off beat reality suddenly gets sidetracked near the end and becomes a Tarantino-like mess of lurid plot twists. The dream world of casual sex becomes an unconvincing nightmare world of violence. The film gains its footing again at the end, but this large chunk of BOOGIE NIGHTS is just unbearably bad. Sex and violence become bedfellows. Anderson loses faith in his lie, just as his characters do.But when it is good -- in a sexually naughty sort of way -- the film is most endearing. Anderson explores a world rarely even acknowledged in polite circles and introduces an intriguing cast of characters. Reynolds possibly gives his best screen performance as the film's father figure and he is backed by a fine cast, especially Wahlberg in the role that moved him into the realm of stardom.A secondary, but relevant, theme in the story is the love of film as a medium. Like ED WOOD and BOWFINGER, BOOGIE NIGHTS celebrates the basic allure of making films, regardless of how questionable the finished movies might be. In a strange way, this is where the film's real honesty lies. A turning point in the film is the realization that film as a community event is fading. Tape and video are forever altering the way films are made and seen. Adult theatres, like the neighborhood movie house, are facing doom as video moves film from the public to the private sector. In wistfully mourning the passing of ""classic porn,"" the film makes a statement about the way technology has demystified cinema: efficient multiplexes have shut down the movie palaces, VCR and DVD changed movie watching from something special to something banal, computer effects are passed off as drama, and anyone with a video camera can be a director.I guess one could be offended that Anderson uses pornography as a metaphor for all that film represents, but then again he wouldn't be the first. But in the end, he uses the alternate universe of the skin trade to make a profound and insightful observation about an art form. What begins as a lie becomes the truth.",Boogie Nights

117,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,A Filmic Opus by Paul Thomas Anderson,10,27 November 2007,"Paul Thomas Anderson's 1997 film ""Boogie Nights"" is a breathtaking ride through seven years in the pornographic film industry. This was a huge undertaking for this filmmaker's sophomore foray into picture making, but as seen with his prior effort, ""Hard Eight"", he has a knack for garnering career-making performances from his actors and for interweaving story lines on par with Robert Altman. He seems also to have no qualms with wearing his influences on his sleeve, as is clear by the often spoken about three minute long opening shot that hearkens back to Scorsese or DePalma.The film follows the journey of a young man, played by the previously under-appreciated Mark Wahlberg, who yearns for a life beyond his Southern California suburban nowhere. Once he meets up with Burt Reynolds, in the finest performance of his career, and his pseudo-family of skin flick makers and performers, the story is just getting revved up. What follows are two and half hours that wiz by with the deft hand of a filmmaker so attuned to the needs of their story that the frequent subplots and meanderings only add texture and aesthetics to the piece. Though it is basically ""42nd Street"" with a porn twist, it's surprisingly subdued in its expression of on-screen sex, because the film is about so much more. Although their business is sex and pleasure, it is the variation on the family unit and the hopes and dreams of the characters that are really at the core.Put simply this is brilliant film-making!",Boogie Nights

I used to work in a video store in the olden days and its trailer was on a coming attractions VHS playing constantly in the store. I saw the movie as it was released and was floored. I've seen it a bunch of times since then, the last time a couple of days ago.Paul Thomas Anderson released the lackluster Hard Eight just one year earlier, but Boogie Nights feels like it's made by an entirely different director full of confidence.This movie has an amazing energy and is teeming with visual playfulness. It has real characters and great acting all around. I've read about the other actors considered for Dirk Diggler, like DiCaprio and Damon. But they come off as too intelligent. Dirk Diggler has to be a little dim, and in that regard Wahlberg is a perfect fit.It's quite long. I wouldn't have minded if they had tightened the second half dealing with the 1980s.",Boogie Nights
121,culwin,"I agree, overrated",6,17 January 1999,"This was not a bad movie, but not as great as many other reviews I have seen.  The main problem is that the movie tries to make you sympathetic to the characters, but none of the characters are sympathetic.  I mean, it is basically about some people who do a lot of dumb things and suffer the consequences of their actions.  At least in movies like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, the characters weren't looking for your sympathy - they were just interesting, unique people in an interesting story.Otherwise, I'm not really sure what the point of this movie is.  Every time I expected some interesting new twist to happen, they went back to the original theme.  Once again I compare: the scene in Pulp Fiction, with Travolta and Jackson and the 3 rip-off kids, with the scene in Boogie Nights where they try to deal the fake drugs.  In Pulp, it has a point.  It adds to the story.  The Boogie Nights scene is interesting, but is really unrelated to the rest of the film.  The whole movie can be described like this - every scene is a mini-movie that does not necessarily have anything to do with the big movie.As far as sex, I'm actually impressed that a movie about pornography had this little sex.  Bachelor Party had as much.  Which is good or bad, depending on what you're looking for :)I gave it 6 of 10.",Boogie Nights
122,valis1949,Pictures of Lily,10,12 July 2013,"BOOGIE NIGHTS (dir. Paul Thomas Anderson) This is an unquestionable film classic that concerns a most unusual subject, 'The American Adult Film Industry'. Anderson has directed and written a film of great emotional depth, and the subject of porn is an area where most people would assume that emotions and human feelings are far less important than clothing at a photoshoot. The film boasts a cross section of America's finest character actors, and Anderson took an extremely big chance on a couple of actors who must have seemed like very questionable choices. By the mid 90's when BOOGIE NIGHTS was released, Burt Reynolds tabloid personal life exemplified the most lurid aspects of The Seventies, and his inclusion in the film might have detracted from Anderson's nuanced presentation of the film industry's impact upon sexual liberation. But, Reynolds delivers a perfect characterization of an American businessman who is only satisfying the public's nascent hunger for cinematic knowledge of the country's changing sexual mores.And, casting Mark Wahlberg in the lead role of Dirk Diggler was risky at best. At the time, Wahlberg was primarily known as a member of a boy band and an underwear model, but who really knew that he could be such a convincing actor? The film is very long, but never lags, and there are really far too many fine performances to note. MUST SEE",Boogie Nights

But this movie proved that he was a sure bet, earlier than Tom Cruise could say ""Respect the cock"". Here, stars are born - on and off the screen. Even though he did an unique and superb job in ""The Basketball Diaries"", Mark Wahlberg suceeds here in creating the ultimate boy-turned-porno-stud icon. But he never gets away with the movie, because the cast is so damn good: from William H. Macy's failed husband, Burt Reynolds headstrong director, Rollergirl's empty blonde, Amber Waves' failed mother, Philip Seymour Hoffman's repressed homosexual to Don Cheadle's hearty, honest character, they all have their chance to shine. Anderson's direction is filled with flare and lust, reminiscent of Scorsese (the frenetic cutting, the abrupt close-ups) and Brian De Palma (those steadycam shots), depicting with an exquisite detail the sensitive era when home movies turned to video, and coke was the big thing. This is a must-see, and a perfect example of how a director's vitality translates in cinematic results.",Boogie Nights

I'm glad that Paul Thomas Anderson made a film like this and really had the guts to show just how the porn industry is. Mark Wahlberg is great as a struggling teen just trying to find his way, so he has to take an offer he can't refuse and join an X rated film producer who is played perfectly by Burt Reynolds. This was certain the comeback moment for Burt he's as nasty as ever at the same time a loving man. Julianne Moore and Heather Graham play the roles of porn people so good that it really shows you the life these types of people live with all the sex, drugs, money, divorce, and many social problems they experience. Boogie Nights is one of the better movies I've seen in terms of taking a character like the Mark Wahlberg one and showing the upside with success in the 70's and the downfall to drugs in the 80's I like how it spans two decades. Boogie Nights is one of the best movies for pop culture it really shows reality of how the 70's happened even though I wasn't born till 78 I well know about the disco and styles plus the music from that era is terrific! The two volume music tapes from Boogie Nights is a must buy! Each time you watch this movie you feel like you are right with these characters because it was popular times that we all remember and with liking these characters so well who have the guts to make money from a controversial subject like pornography makes Boogie Nights all that much more of a classic that we want to feel the emotions of.

We see them rise to success and fall to their knees. We see the hypocrisies (the porn star film maker who is upset that his porn star wife is having sex with other men).It has a lot of weaknesses, but enough strengths to rise it up above many other movies. Most importantly it loves the idea of good pornography. It doesn't get bogged down with much of exploitation that occurs now and before in the porn industry.

It all makes sense now. One of the most star studded movies you will ever come across except that most of them were not stars yet.Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) has an exceptional natural gift which is spotted by Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) who grooms him, gives him an opportunity to show the world of his gift and also help him achieve his dream. Can Eddie control his ego that came along with his newly successful life, is Horner just a man who exploited his talent or something more? Answering these questions form the rest of the story.Now let me rephrase my synopsis as it sounded more like a parallel story of Rambo 3. Horner is an adult film maker who spots Eddie with a large penis and an ability to go all day long. Their synergy builds a successful run for both along with the entire unit who treat each other like family. One fine day Eddie's ego gets the better of him and the entire unit crumbles with it. Their road to darkness and resurfacing to light forms the rest of the story.I hated Paul Thomas Anderson when I watched Magnolia. Though it had a moving story and filled with excellent performances, it was flat out depressing. I feared a similar approach in this movie too not minding the energetic title. There were quite a few movies that follows the exact same storyline, most of them has either dealt with musicians or athletes but none with porn stars which stands out here. It has its moments of being awkward, cheeky, innocent and informative. It has a number of lengthy purposeful cameos by talented actors, researched portrayal of how the business of adult film industry is run, an excellent background score especially when Eddie, Horner, Rollergirl (Heather Graham) and Buck (Don Cheadle) hit rock bottom.

The script is only O.K......nothing to get excited about. The use of background music...almost right through the movie is tedious. Tarantinos use of music is EXACT and brilliant.

Despite the sexual subject, there's actually very little sex and nudity going on and none of it is particularly arousing or exciting. In this movie, the porn industry is seen as a mix between business and family. This is a ensemble drama with some comedic elements or an ensemble comedy with some dramatic elements. For me it worked more as a comedy with the best moments coming in where the the ""porn"" industry is seen by some artisans as an artistic endeavor (cue bad acting or cheesy concepts in the porn films). It's idealistic, rather misguided and a bit touching but mostly amusing. The dramatic elements come mostly from their ""real"" family ties, adapting to society in the real world and drugs.I thought some scenes were overlong but in retrospect, I see the genius in making the audience cringing or unnerved and without the proper setup it would not have been as effective. There's a very good ensemble cast with the highlight being Julianne Moore who plays the anchoring ""mother"" to the rest while being rather fragile herself. Roller Girl played by Heather Graham in her break-out role was certainly pretty to look at but was a bit over-hyped as she only shows real acting chops near the end (the bedroom with Moore and the car). Mark Wahlberg in the lead was solid and Burt Reynolds as the director/producer was a nice surprise in a dramatic role. What I particularly enjoyed in this film is that it does not focus on just one character and it shows us a particular inside look at something most of us know very little about and that doesn't exist like that anymore. Keep in mind that several people from the real porn industry of that time have come forward to criticize the accuracy. Be that as it may, it's probably one of the only fiction films made on the subject by an A-list director and that's special in itself. The movie does elicit a gamut of emotions though the comedic elements work better than the dramatic elements.Rating: 7.5 out of 10",Boogie Nights

The combination of genres, different camera angles and a great cast made this a very high-quality work. I'm not one hundred percent sure, but I felt the impact of Pulp Fiction, purely my impression. However it seems to me that the porn industry is the main character here and everyone else is just there to assist. It bothered me because this film seemed to me like a set of good scenes that don't always have to be connected.

Lurking behind some well-written dialogue is a mess of a movie that tries to go in too many directions.A hypnotic and continuous camera can't make up for a muddled story. I don't understand the choices the director made on the final cut. This movie is too long and lacks focus. It's a mood piece, full of dramatic irony without any real drama for balance. When SOMETHING finally happens to make things interesting there is no basis for it - no setup, no motivation. Just a plot point that is supposed to happen to move things along. Director Anderson knows how to handle a camera, but he should let someone else write the script.",Boogie Nights
135,nesfilmreviews,Redemption and forgiveness expressed beautifully through Porn,9,29 December 2012,"Everything about ""Boggie Nights"" is sincere and straightforward, and with an wide array of unforgettable characters, it is one of the most distinctive American films made in the late 1990's. Everyone's born with one special thing, and Eddie Adams (Marc Wahlberg) uses his ""special gift"" and is poised to take the world of porn by storm. Eddie Adams, (also known as Dirk Diggler), is discovered by porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) and soars to the top of the pornography industry. After achieving great success in the industry during the 1970's, the 80's did not fair so well for Dirk. A change of culture coupled with a drug addiction, he quickly hits rock bottom not knowing anything else to turn to. At the heart of the story is a group of eccentric, outlandish group of characters, an unorthodox ""family"" if you will. An incredible collection of actors and performances keep this lengthy film completely engaging throughout the 155 minutes. Despite of what you may think of these people and their profession, you can't help but be drawn into their lives and personal stories. Paul Anderson's attention to the fine details; decor, style, culture, and social attitudes of the era are spot on. It is heart-rendering and darkly humorous with an message of redemption and forgiveness.",Boogie Nights
136,ldavis-2,The Emperor Has No Clothes!,2,3 March 2008,"Finally saw this on IFC. Ten minutes in and I knew that Paul Thomas Anderson knows squat about the porn industry. The power is wielded not by the male performers, who are a dime a dozen, but by the female performers, who approve their on-screen partners.Anderson couldn't be bothered to do any character development, either. Why is the mother a harpie and the father a wuss? Why would Little Bill (another wuss) marry a nymphomaniac (another harpie), and assume that she'll be faithful? Why would she marry him? There is no hint of anything remotely like love between them, and his ""solution"" to his woes comes out of absolutely nowhere.How The Colonel's dalliances with underage girls is more repugnant than Jack recruiting an underage boy to have on-camera sex is beyond me, but when The Colonel is thrown into the poke, Jack suddenly gets a moral compass? Give me a break!How does the banker know that Buck does porn unless he was stupid enough to put that on his application? The donut shop scene was so silly and incredulous, I couldn't stop laughing!Amber wants her kid back, but does zip to show why she should regain custody! But not to worry, to Jack, she is still ""the foxiest bitch in the whole world"". How sweet!Rollergirl drops out of school because some bozo makes a crude gesture, then proves why she is unworthy of the respect she thinks she deserves. To add ""insult"" to ""injury"", she gets no ""foxiest bitch"" kudos from Jack. One other thing: why do wee see Dirk do white girls (and only white girls), but Anderson oh-so-modestly cuts away from Reed and his ""Chocolate Love"" just before they get their freak on?",Boogie Nights

Julianne Moore is great, and this is the best performance I've ever seen Burt Reynolds put forth.The subject matter is gritty and sleazy, but the characters (for the most part) are not. It's not often in a movie where the average viewer is rooting for someone to get back into the porn business! I found this movie down-right excruciating to watch in parts. Some of the more painful ones seemed to last forever.I can appreciate that this movie is well done. It obviously hit a nerve with me.I'm glad I saw it, I didn't enjoy it, and I don't want to see it again.I'm giving it a seven because the acting was good, and the movie was well made.

138,Alex-372,Great exposé of seventies culture,7,29 November 2000,"Boogie Nights is a great movie, and gives a sugar coated insight into the late 70s subculture of the Californian porn industry, before vds became deadly and when porn was shot on film. This is very much a picture of a world after the sexual revolution of the late 60s, inhabited people who are all slightly eccentric, to varying degrees. There is Roller Girl (Heather Graham), who literally goes through life (and school) on roller skates, there is Eddy Adams/Dirk Diggler (Marc Wahlberg, who's character seems like a combination of John Holmes and Jeffrey Stryker) and who has ""one special talent"" (his humongous dong) and is obsessed with Bruce Lee (who isn't/wasn't), Maggie/Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Buck Swope (Don Cheadle, based roughly on the famous porn actor Johnny Keyes, from among many other films, ""Behind The Green Door"", and/or Jack Baker).I especially like Don Cheadle's character (a great actor), who in an epitome of the way all the characters don't fit in with society, is an almost perfect stereo salesman, who falls down because of insisting on playing the customers _HIS_ (rather than their) favorite music, Country & Western. Buck Swope is continually one style behind, insisting that ""country will make a comeback"" throughout the seventies, and at new year's eve party 1979/1980 being decked out in an afrocentric/outer space outfit that makes him look like one of the members of Earth, Wind & Fire. He finally finds his style, though, in early eighties Hip-Hop.Rather than being simply a showcase of seventies culture, all of the characters are amalgams of several porn characters, and many of the situations are similar to actual events.For instance, the drug situation at the end of the movie is similar to what happened to John Holmes (he was interviewed by homicide detectives - see the movie ""Wonderland"" with Val Kilmer). John Holmes, though, in the end died if AIDS, caught in a gay video shoot, rather than just being beaten up by a gang of homophobes (without ill effects).Which is where the sugar coating comes in. In this movie, most of the characters in the end find their places in society, whereas in real life, several ended up dead. Another example, in this movie, the drug of choice seems to be cocaine, but in reality, it was heroine, probably so we don't have scenes of people shooting up. So, you have the situation of several characters overdosing on coke, which is a rare event, whereas od'ing on heroine is quite common. Also, no one ever catches any std.Anyway, the structure of the movie is almost very similar to Oliver Stone's Vietnam movies - the viewer is swept along with the progress of history and time, rather than depending on intricate plotting. The characters do develop, though, but predictably.Either way, this is a unique movie. Go and see it if you haven't already.",Boogie Nights

At first I thought that I ain't gonna like this film and at the beginning it was kinda dull, though even at that time it didn't seemed like an usual film. The best thing about this film is that it has many twists, some of them unexpected, some of them were pretty predictable but still it was very interesting to watch. This film tells stories about few different people from adult movie industry. Probably the most shocking story to me was about Julianne Moore's character. There were many good actors in this film but probably I was the most impressed by Burt Reynolds, I used to see him in comedies and I thought that he isn't suitable for that role, but I was wrong, he did a great job.",Boogie Nights
141,son_of_cheese_messiah,Interesting but unfocused,6,2 June 2011,"One can admire the writer/director's ambition in wanting to encapsulate the entire ""golden age of porn"" in one sweep and, while this film has many things to commend it, some interesting characters, imaginative direction and some memorable scenes, it lacks focus and could probably do with at least an hour's worth of pruning.Too many story threads vie for attention and several get lost in the mix. Among a number of potentially interesting sidelines which go nowhere are a paedophilia strand and a male co-worker who drunkenly kisses Dirk Diggler. A lot of fairly famous faces appear but are underused.Some scenes are not convincing such as the very contrived confrontation between Diggler and Jack (excellently played by Reynolds) leads to Diggler's prolonged bout of ostracism from the porn family. And there is a strange vacillation between comedy and brutal reality. For instance, the graphic William Macy shooting scene is followed not long after by a video tape sequence in which Diggler refers to Napoleon as king of the Roman Empire, an example of stupidity which Diggler does not exhibit elsewhere. These scenes seem to come from two different films. The scene in which Don Cheatle is the sole survivor in a bizarre robbery and ends up with the cash also strikes me as implausible at least in this contest. Boogie Nights does manage to capture some of the mood of the times in these video tape sequence, but certain details elsewhere do not ring true, such as the presence of silicon implants (too early in 1980 surely?).",Boogie Nights

The ensemble is handled really well with a sense of each character who are perfectly cast and played right across the board. Its also very funny in parts in the first half especially before it all turns nasty in the blizzard of coke and crack of the 80s.It could have possibly have lost a few scenes in the latter half and i did feel not particular connection to any of the characters as they were pretty unlikable on the whole.

But also handling it so vividly, funny AND moving is quite an achievement- I really care and feel for these characters! Peppered with a big-name cast that really delivers is another treat.

But instead, I got lots of beautiful photography, in-depth character development, a story of broken dreams, and the disintegration of members of the pornography industry. All the acting is fantastic, there is not one bad actor in the lot. My personal favorite was Heather Graham (who does have a few eye-catching nude scenes). Mark Wahlberg is surprisingly good considering he used to be Marky Mark, Burt Reynolds makes a well-deserved comeback, and Julianne Moore is both sexy and sad, something I haven't seen her portray since this movie. Supporting roles by William H. Macy, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, and Nicole Parker add to the masterpiece that this movie is. Don't go into this movie expecting sex, sex, sex like I did. The soundtrack is classic, too, and 2 CD's have been released of music. They are both well worth seeking out.

Just gives you a glimpse of it is to be a part of the porn industry and how can you branch out into doing other things after that.It is not a great film, just because it is about the porn industry, as a matter of fact it contains far less nudity than one might expect from a film like this. This movie achieves its goal of showing the careless lives of these people. It does not stress you with many problems, fights and whatever, it just gives a careless vibe of the reckless 70's and 80's.The story might look quite blatant and not really that grasping, but the vibe this film has makes you not care about the story or how good or bad it actually is, it feels different. The first half of the film is more centered around the porn industry and Dirk's success doing what he loves, but the other half is all about character development and barely touches on the porn industry. So all those people who pass up watching this movie just because they dislike porn or porn industry, should know it is not all about porn and is a lot more likable than you might think.

148,Tiger_Mark,The Finest Film of the Past Decade!,10,29 March 2002,"I cannot remember seeing a film that blew me away as much as this film did. So entertaining, so creative, so funny,so tragic, so detailed and so smart. P.T. Anderson has staked his claim as the finest director in the business with this film, which was only his second work. The movie involves a bunch of misfits, each with serious problems, past and present. However, in a way, these misfits are able to come together as a happy family, in the porn business. Not to say that their lives are perfect, but they are much improved. The star misfit is one Dirk Diggler. Dirk has a natural feature that makes him a porn legend. However, as Dirk rises up the ranks of stardom, he and his happy family of misfits start to fall apart. In a sense, the characters start to forget what made them happy and get trapped in the pursuit of money and drugs. What I liked so much about this film are the creative tactics and methods used by Anderson. There are so many underlying themes going on here, that you will pick up new things as you watch it. Moreover, the characters are incredibly well developed. I have trouble describing this film, because it is just too overwhelming, trying to describe all of the many great things in it. No scenes are wasted and many creative twists are happening all the time.This film is a must see for all fans of film. How Anderson and this film were denied an Academy is beyond me. However, certainly the adult themes of the film did not help it with some. That is unfortunate, because there are some very positive themes in the film. This film is not for children, but at the same time it is not a ""porn film."" I believe that has been the biggest misconception. The film does not glorify the industry and it does not throw stones at it. It simply tells a great story about people involved in it. Perfection!",Boogie Nights

Every scene is special, every action and line has meaning, a true labor of love. So detailed, yet so entertaining and easy to follow. The story deals with a young man named Eddie Adams, who has aspirations of greatness. Sadly, Eddie has minimal abilities at best. He is not very bright and makes a living washing cars and bussing tables. Ahh, but he does have one great attribute (try to guess what it is). He will use his one gift to climb the ladder of success very quickly. The only problem is that Eddie or Dirk Diggler (his new porn name) does not have the maturity or life experiences to handle so much at such a young age. The downfall is inevitable. Anderson shows you the meteoric, positive rise, then the depressing, sad fall of the Adult Entertainment Industry's ""biggest"" star.This film features the talents of so many great actors. Each is given an in-depth character to play. In a way, the wacky characters help form an extended family, that is very supportive, at first. The music is brilliantly worked into the story. The creative camera tricks and angles are evident from start to finish. Guaranteed that you will discover new things every time you see the film.

150,MF210,The Movie That Made Anderson,9,14 November 2003,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Boogie Nights will be remembered as the movie that made Paul Thomas Anderson into a successful director. He got critical acclaim for this film and received an Academy Award Nomination for Original Screenplay, which was well deserved. Boogie Nights ended up on top ten lists for 1997 and one critic called it, ""The Best Movie of the Decade.""Anderson's films always have some unique look to it. Boogie Nights is no exception. The film gives off a seventies feel that is undeniable. This is mainly due to the set designs and the cinematography. The feeling also changes very well when the film moves into the eighties.
There was alot of hard work put into writing this script. The Academy saw it that way too and gave Anderson a nomination for his writing. The writing is what Anderson receives a nomination for in his movies, he received another one two years later for Magnolia. Boogie Nights has a well written script that only contains a few flaws. Those flaws are mostly overlooked when watching the film, except for one. Acting is a strength in Anderson's films and it definitely is here. Mark Wahlberg gives the least impressive performance but hes still good. His performance is uneven. During the beginning he seems a bit stiff, but he warms up to it and turns in a solid performance. Burt Reynolds received alot of attention for his performance (A golden globe win and an oscar nomination) and he does do a great job here. William H. Macy does some scene-stealing work, in fact I wished he had a little more screentime. Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, Nina Hartley, Alfred Molina, and John C. Reilly all do solid work. However, the standout here is Julianne Moore. This represents her best performance to date and it shows why she is so talented.
Like I said, Boogie Nights is not a flawless film. The most glaring flaw I found in the film came at the end. I did not like how Anderson decided to end this. It was unsatisfying and it also seemed somewhat-immature. However, Anderson does so many things right its possible to overlook the few flaws. Alot of his fans say this to be his best film. Personally, I prefer Magnolia, I thought it was a more mature picture and Anderson put one of the most creative endings on the screen. Boogie Nights is still very good and I give the film a strong recommendation.",Boogie Nights

Burt Reynolds plays the porn director in a great career comeback performance. This film is really well shot, some great camera angles and movement you really feel immersed in this world. The soundtrack is amazing. Julianne Moore is also great as a porn actress who has a son she can not see. Her performance is really heart felt.

For the first 40 minutes or so I was actually quite intrigued with the story of a young bus boy (Mark Wahlberg) who meets a top porn film director (Burt Reynolds) who sets out to make him a star in the seedy world of pornography, drugs and disco. The problem is that after 40 minutes the story takes a nose dive and the result is a total mess. From then on you have to sit through over 2 hours of total mishmash as Wahlberg and Reynolds get more irritating by the minute.  Not even the presence of screen beauties Julianne Moore and Heather Graham make you care what happens as the script plods along through the years. All in all another film which is very over rated.

153,imbluzclooby,Why it is cool and not cool to like Boogie Nights...,10,5 March 2016,"I remember seeing Boogie nights when it first hit the theaters. I was blown away and absolutely fell in love with this movie. To begin, we all have reasons why we like and dislike movies. For that respective reason i will not criticize anyone's review since they all tend to of a personal nature. Much like the reasons i like Boogie Nights is due to the personal way it hit home with my childhood memories and how effectively it registered as truthful and vivid recollections of my youth. Having grown up as an adolescent in the late 70's and early 80's I can relate to Boogie nights that would be hard for me to explain to those who didn't experience them in my eyes. Boogie Nights is a masterpiece. Not only does it represent the desperate human nature of people yearning to be accepted, loved and appreciated, but it also captures the wasteful time of American history where some people actually earned a living without ever doing anything of any value. The 70's for young adults was when some people abandoned any sense of social responsibility. Being a morally upstanding person was disrespected and regarded as uncool, because being risqué, daring and promiscuous was en vogue. As decadent as Anderson presents his characters and the sleazy lives these people lead it is apparent that he shows his characters as people who believe in themselves and their self delusion. Anderson doesn't judge his characters, but rather makes them very real.Boogie Nights is fun and exciting to watch. The story never lags. Anderson uses great angles, jump-cuts and effective usage of popular songs of that era for ambiance. It looks kitschy, slick and vibrantly paced. At 2.5 hours it seems to fly by.Why is it cool to like this movie? For those who can appreciate the period and setting that the story takes place is enough to draw your attention. The characters are also oddly interesting if even completely despicable. The humor is also good when it is harsh as well as uncomfortable. it's also a historical representation of the 70's that beautifully depicts the mentality of people in that time. People were far less socially aware of their faults, hangups and personal flaws back then. Today, we still have decadence and immorality in all of its numerous forms, but at least social media has kept us in check. The younger generation of today is far more informed and reminded on a daily basis the consequences of their actions. In the 70's, being promiscuous and drug addicted was upheld in pop-culture and used to separate the hip from the square by means of peer pressure. In post Y2K America we have learned the ills and setbacks of such a lifestyle and how that leads to self destruction, STD and pain.Why is it not cool to like Boogie Nights? All the characters in this movie are sad and damaged people. They are the losers of society who have chosen a soulless and hideous lifestyle devoid of any positive or meaningful aspirations. Their goals are short-term and have repulsively unsatisfying outcomes. They are all bottom-feeders who have clung together under the patriarch, Jack Horner. Exploitation, moral decay, human desperation, addiction and promiscuity are themes explored in Boogie Nights. This movie serves as a human and historical lesson. Don't watch this movie thinking you want to emulate any of these people, because you should react on the contrary. Yes, the movie does a great job with acting, plot development and authenticity. The purpose it should serve is that what a parable or Biblical story does.",Boogie Nights
154,danielll_rs,"The best film of '97- should have won the Oscar instead of ""Titanic""",10,10 March 2000,"Sometimes the Academy doesn't recognize the potential of some films, or doesn't nominate them because they are controversial or strong. Sometimes they are nominated, but don't win anything (I hope this doesn't happen this year with ""American Beauty""). This is exactly what happened with ""Boogie Nights"", which was the best film of 1997. The Academy preferred to give the best picture Oscar to ""Titanic"", a purely commercial and hollow film, and other awards to the overrated ""Good Will Hunting"" and the irritating ""Full Monty"". The other pictures which were nominated in the main category were ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""As Good as it Gets"", great movies, but ""Boogie Nights"" is still better and should have been remembered in more categories.This amazing film tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, in a surprisingly great performance), a 17 year old barman who takes the attention of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, in a redeeming acting), a director of porn films. Eddie has a special 'gift', and this helps him to get into the world of porn movies. He changes his name for Dirk Diggler and starts to make a huge success. But fame... doesn't last forever. Other characters also have their parallel stories- Amber Waves (Julianne Moore, perfect), Buck (Don Cheadle) and others, including Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actress who accepts to do anything, but she has to be wearing her roller shoes.What could have been a banal, trivial film, turns into a perfect, memorable one in the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. What makes ""Boogie Nights"" such a great film is its execution, added to a clever, well written screenplay, great soundtrack, etc. Each character is very well developed, and each of them has his/her importance in the context. Each feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, resulting in a masterpiece of the modern American cinema.""Boogie Nights"" is a strong, impacting picture that should be seen by everyone who really likes cinema. Under a plot that seems banal at first impression, there is a wonderful story of highs and downs, things that we face in our lives. It is an amazing portrait of the end of the '70s and the beginning of the '80s, exactly an age of highs and downs. That's what makes this film so special and a true masterpiece. 10/10",Boogie Nights
155,merrywood,A Parade of Low-Tide Humanity,8,4 September 2003,"Instead of a script with an engaging plot and meaningful theme Boogie Nights presents nothing more than a list of scenes connected only by subject matter.  Some are not really attached to anything, like the wife of one of the film crew fornicating with various partners surrounded by onlookers, all without apparent purpose.  Ostensibly we are supposed to read meaning into this.  Eventually the man shoots her and one of her lovers.  Is this a stab at comedy, tragedy?  Perhaps, we are finally urged to consider, it is metaphorical of the film or the world of Porn.  Ultimately we are left without the real answer.The only thing this distasteful concoction of a film achieves is to push the envelope of probity and civility out a bit further.  Thus, many critics and audiences have shouted, ""Brilliant,"" despite the fact that nothing is brilliant at all here.	Once again, we see the emotionally damaged and others of borderline intelligence trotted out and drawn to Porn, the artificial world of make-believe filmmaking.  This form of filmmaking reduces for us all the quality of life and steps on the triumph of the human spirit.  Indeed, Boogie Nights itself joins Porn and becomes a part of this phenomenon of the declination of the value and meaning of life and the ascendance of barbarism.",Boogie Nights
156,bazdol,A REALISTIC PORTRAYAL OF THE ADULT FILM INDUSTRY?,9,26 June 2000,"Since having seen this film and in a previous review where I thought it ""realistic,"" I have made a study of the adult film industry. As a result, I have found that this highly regarded and most entertaining film conveys some misconceptions about that industry. Firstly, if you look at the films in that period (the late seventies), you'll find that much of the acting is quite good and the production values were quite high (it was not unusual for a porno film to be budgeted at $200,000).  Sex scenes and nonsex dialogue or plot scenes ran about 50/50, unlike todays films which are almost all sex and have very few accomplished actors in them. Often foreign locales such as London were used as settings (see Marylin Chambers in ""Insatiable,"" for example)., and the sets could be quite elaborate.  ""Boogie Nights"" suggests that only the cheapest of sets were used and the performers were a pack of semi retarded dolts, and that was just not true.Secondly, for the most part the performers did not congregate in well-knit groups, although some of that was done.  Most went their separate lives after a scene or a film was shot.  Some just went home to the wife or husband and the kids.  Christine Fugat, in her recent documentary ""The Girl Next Door,"" tells of how much she was impressed by how ""normal"" these people seemed to her.Next, generally the women were not  dumb and forced  to work for menial wages; many of them were quite intelligent and just chose to work in that industry and aspired (unsuccessfully for the most part) to get into mainstream films, mainly for the money.  Today, it is taken for granted that women rule that industry often setting the conditions under which they will work, the things they will and will not do, etc.Probably the most accurate depiction in the film was the debilitating effects video tape had on the quality of the films produced. There was a period in the 70's were ""porno chic"" was prominent.  Even Roger Ebert gave a favorable review to ""The Devil and Miss Jones,"" as I recall.  People, often prominent ones, would wait in line to see such productions as""Deep Throat"" and ""Behind the Green Door.""  Marylin Chambers was treated as a true star and stayed at the best hotels and appeared at grand openings, searchlights and all.Next, although cocaine use was widespread, that tended to be true of many professions in that era, including mainstream.

I still say his commentary track is one of the worst I have heard on a DVD.",Boogie Nights
157,bazdol,TWO COMMENTS,9,20 January 1999,"First, I think one has to have seen a number of porn films to appreciate what a great take off Boogie Nights is.  It captures just how tawdry and explotive these films were with many of the porn cast sincerely believing that they were ""actors,"" and no just porn machines. Next, how many appreciate how what I think is a marvelously effective score the movie has?  Many scores in movies are superfluous, even unwanted, but not this one.  It adds to the actions displayed in a way that heightens that superbly heightens them.  For example, the bells in one of the later sequences of scenes starting with Dirk getting in to a car to pitifully earn a few bucks.  Or the penultimate scene in the house where the boys go to sell some talcum powder as cocaine. The rock music, although not really a part of a superimposed score, blasts at us to the point where we want to scream, ""Turn that damned stuff off.""  When it finally is shut off, what a great relief.  This technique I found in some Spike Lee movies, particularily Jungle Fever, although I'm sure other have noticed it in different films too.",Boogie Nights
158,schroeder-gustavo,The Greatest film about porn,9,14 July 2016,"Perhaps the greatest story about the porn industry ever committed to a motion picture? Probably. In Boogie Nights, a movie filled with outstanding performances and pop culture for days, Paul Thomas Anderson shows us a movie in which he is truly and utterly in control of. Every single shot in this 2 and a half hour celebration of excess exists for a purpose and Anderson shows us his skill as a director. Like I said, it is a film filled with great performances, but really outstanding work from Mark Wahlberg in a truly committed performance. The movie delivers in a great use of music, filled with popular songs of the 70s and 80s and an amazing use of volume in the music (when to make it louder, quieter).All of this brings me to the ultimate flaw of Boogie Nights. There is a fine line between paying homage to a certain movie or a director and for a while, Boogie Nights rides this line with Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. But after about the first half of the film, Anderson bluntly just rips off Scorsese. The story in itself is essentially a Goodfellas remake. A story about a young man joining a frowned upon business, starting from nothing, the film explores the inner workings of this business and we see it through the eyes of our main character (fish out of water) and we see his rise and ultimate fall through addiction and excess caused by the very business he started out in. In Goodfellas, it's organized crime. In Boogie Nights, it is the porn industry. Of course, there have been several movies to use the cookie cutter provided by Scorsese's seminal film (including two by Scorsese in Casino and more recently The Wolf of Wall Street), but Anderson also copies many of the shots used by Scorsese: Many tracking shots, the snorting of the coke then rapidly zooming in on the character's face, etc. The use of music (not the songs, but its use in the film) is nearly identical. But the similarities do not stop there. Anderson goes further in copying Scorsese's technique in using almost the same film shots used in Mean Streets. And the one that was just too much for me, personally, were the parts where Mark Wahlberg talks to himself in his dressing room, then by the end of the film it's the same thing but he is now a much different person and he starts shadow boxing (right after showing his giant c**k to the audience, of course). It is literally the exact same camera positioning (or nearly identical) as in Raging Bull. Like I said, this may be purely seen as homage to many, but for me it took it a bit too far.But overall, I can't really not like this film. Sure, Scorsese's framework is used in Boogie Nights, but as its own story it is truly gripping and compelling. It's not only a movie about the porn industry in the late 70s and early 80s, but a movie about addiction, the troubles of life and overcoming them. I have to confess, even after all of the similarities, I really like Boogie Nights and it is definitely worth a watch. The movie is two and a half hours long, but it flies by because it is insanely entertaining to watch. This is a sign of a pretty good film.",Boogie Nights

Boogie nights is one of these enjoyable, partly documentary, partly ""well build story"" type of movie, where you can just sit back and really get a feel of the era representing it. The biggest credit goes to director (P.T. Anderson), who has picked the right actors. Always sexy Heather Graham, surprisingly talented Mark Wahlberg and all the others. Well done. Beside that, there is a great music theme that really gets you in (funky) 70's mood. In it's genre is certainly classic and a movie you'll most probably like to return to. 7 out of 10...well almost 8:)",Boogie Nights
162,azanti0029,One of the strongest debut's of a brilliant director in the 1990s...,8,20 November 2012,"Boogie Nights is a film that should sit with pride in any collection. Its a film about so much more than fly on the wall look at the Porn Industry of the 1970s and the character types that inhabited that world, its a statement about the excesses that permeated the end of one decade and the beginning of another. Mark Wahlberg brings in a confident performance, demonstrating once again, that it can all be about the material that the actor is given. He plays Eddie Adams, a bus boy in the valley of Los Angeles at the club of Luis Guzman who is soon brought to the attention of adult movie director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in what is probably his best ever performance) and soon turned into super porn star thanks to his considerable talents below the waist. Director Anderson made no secret that the story was partially inspired by the late John Holmes, but here he seems to be represented also by a supporting character, played by a young Thomas Jane.Though initially the journey is that of Eddie into porn star Dirk Diggler, Anderson very capably gives all his supporting characters flesh on their bones and their own stories which endear us to them all. John C Reily, Nicole Ari Parker (Massively underrated actress) Don Cheadle, Melora Waiters (Superb) all bring life to the ensemble of the piece as the rest of the adult stars in Horners circle of friends, all of their characters have flaws and weaknesses, but all of them too seek something beyond the porn industry that they find themselves. Julianne Moore is the mother of the group taking on Dirk and Rollergirl (Heather Graham) as her siblings in place of her estranged son, who her ex husband will not let her have contact with because of her involvement in the industry - She copes with this by consuming vast amounts of drugs and showing her affections on her co-stairs instead. Anderson uses a number of interesting techniques to make dialogue scenes a little more interesting and the film, though long, passes through the 6 decades it covers at a bouncy pace. The production design here must be commended too as its all spot on, and the colours of the film make you feel like you are watching a movie from that era. Anderson manages to blend both the tragic and hilarious moments of very life seamlessly as they often are in reality to great effect here. The fact is the porn industry here is used as the catalyst to study the excesses of the era, but you didn't need to be in the porn industry to be involved them. Although the ending maybe a little unsatisfying, showing you that some characters have moved on while us are much where we found them in the first place, it is true to life and the study of character here is first rate. Every single supporting role has a pitch perfect cast too which include a young Seymour Hoffman, already showing his metal and William H Macy as Little Bill in one of the first roles I remember him in. A recent re-watch of this on DVD encouraged me to leave this review and at first I was thinking 'God this hasn't aged well' but actually yes it has, I just forgot that I was suppose to feel like I was in the 1970s, then I remembered, that is the point. Put this with Studio 54 on in one evening and you will feel you have lived the end of the 70s on both coasts of America. A time before the shadow of AIDS and HIV came into the heterosexual world.",Boogie Nights
163,ScottAmundsen,"Utterly Fascinating Look at the Porn Industry, Warts and All",10,21 August 2012,"1997 was not Oscar's best year, particularly in the Best Picture category, which consisted of three lousy movies (TITANIC, GOOD WILL HUNTING, and AS GOOD AS IT GETS) and two that were mediocre at best (THE FULL MONTY and LA CONFIDENTIAL). As it turns out one of the lousy ones won, while one of the best pictures made that year unaccountably failed to even make the nominees list. I am referring to Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant, no-holds-barred, and unflinchingly frank look at a ""family"" of pornographers (everyone from the producer to the stars to the film crew gets face time here) from the days when ""adult films"" were made with actual film and often financed by organized crime to the legal but undoubtedly cheesier days of direct-to-video movies.While this is mostly an ensemble piece, the central figure is Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, sensational here), a slightly dim-witted young man with a huge ""endowment"" who attracts the attention of porn producer Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in perhaps his best performance since DELIVERANCE) and is soon a member of Horner's company, renamed ""Dirk Diggler"" and bearing more than a passing resemblance to the late John Holmes.Anderson makes big movies, and they tend to run long; this one takes a little over two-and-a-half hours to tell its story, but there isn't a frame of wasted film here; this is an exciting, involving, and utterly fascinating film from start to finish. Even if you find the subject matter objectionable, you will not be able to deny the power Anderson brings to every moment of this film.The ensemble deserves mention here as well, because this is a film loaded with some of the best character actors in the business and every performance has greatness in it. One of my particular favorite scenes is a cocaine-fueled stream-of-consciousness dialogue between porn actresses Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) and Rollergirl (Heather Graham) that is as harrowing as a train wreck and quite as impossible to avoid looking at.There is a lot of other great talent on hand here: Luis Guzmán as an aspiring producer; Don Cheadle as an aspiring porn actor with the peculiar quirk of dressing in cowboy outfits that make him look more like BLAZING SADDLES material than a porn star; William H Macy as a member of the crew whose wife (Nina Hartley) enjoys ""doing it"" with every available male whether or not the cameras are turning, and a slightly stereotypical but nonetheless compelling turn by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a gofer with a major crush on both Dirk and his ""sidekick"" and frequent costar Reed Rothchild (John C Reilly); and two brilliant cameos: Joanna Gleason as Eddie/Dirk's hateful mother, and Alfred Molina as a highly-placed drug dealer whom Dirk and Reed make an abortive attempt to rob, nearly losing their lives in the process.This is a great film, rich in both form and content. There isn't a bad performance or a single scene that fails to hit the mark in the entire movie, and if you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to get it. It is proof that great movies are still possible even in this day and age when we are drowning in remakes and silly action pictures.Final note: the most interesting and compelling thing about this film is that Anderson makes no judgment calls about his characters. He shows them for who they are, the good, the bad, and the in-between, giving the film a depth that is rare in Hollywood.A work of genius.",Boogie Nights

A solemn little piece of music placed right into the 70's adult industry is in front, just to get cut off with a solid funk act... known and placed in the 70's. Really nice!There is a sense of a theme park during this film as it begins and stops with a typical theme taken from the late 70's and the early 80's adult industry. A little charming and careful tune as from a barrel organ that sets the entire tone for the movie. There is things going on all the time during the around 160 minutes of movie... something around every corner.Is this sarcasm to the adult industry? Is it a show off in how the stars and crew behind the scenes acted and acts? It can be both. It 's all in the eye of the beholder.The naive and total lack off integrity in the adult business is shown off in a huge comic sense during the whole motion picture. A lot of examples could be taken care of here... see for yourself. Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg is excellent together and touches that ""fake innocence"" that the adult industry tries so hard to develop and force upon the viewers.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Good work and well performed production. ""Best written screenplay written directly for the Screen"", Academy Award nominee. Amazing excellence in the costumes and the surroundings during the era of 70's and 80's. - The actors : Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds nominated for Academy Awards. Burt Reynolds won a Golden Globe for his performance. - The story : As it is almost 20 years ago since the movie settled, it was and is an important movie. Before the global phenomenon of the internet ""amateur adult"" industry came into the light. About this time, there were documentaries about the adult industry and business getting television time globally. Yes, an important movie and I would say the time was right. Maybe there could be a Boogie Nights 2 now with the same actors to shed light on today's industry in the same business. - Entertainment : Tragic, sad, little laughs here and there. All in a positive entertainment way. - Age : 15... or 18, depending on the sexual explicit, language and violence.7,4 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

167,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,A Poor Man's Magnolia,7,4 January 2014,"I enjoyed Boogie Nights, but it seemed to be a less successful precursor to the 1999 film 'Magnolia', recounting the stories of various characters that we're supposed to fall in love with and then marvel at, shaking our heads at their respective ill-gotten fates by the end. Most of the characters were wholly likable but far too shallow to really care about - worrying about superficial values, appearances or how many lines of coke they can snort at a time.Initially I was wary of the impact of Boogie Nights, expecting a sordid, dark, sinister type of experience, instead of a frivolous tale with tongue-in-cheek humour throughout. I new I was going to like it right from the start, with it's star-studded cast, excellent soundtrack and visual style, but it started to lose steam after an hour because of the non-discernible plot progression and novelty level that had worn off.The film has lots of swearing, epic amounts of cocaine abuse but not that much nudity or pornography, surprisingly. It's also graphically violent in places, but didn't shock or affect me in the way I expected. In fact, Boogie Nights is a film about gullible, often charming, not very sensible people that ultimately lose their way in life, later trying to redeem themselves, accepting that they're ultimately pretty f**ked up as a whole.But somehow it didn't gel together well enough, emotionally, by the end.Definitely worth a watch, but not as shocking or ground-breaking as you might think.",Boogie Nights
168,Don-102,Simply one of the best films ever made...,10,27 December 1998,"Boogie Nights is a modern classic and, quite frankly, one for the ages. This is a bold statement to make, but this will surely be a movie that will be studied and remembered for years to come.  Some people I have spoken with regarding ""Nights"" consider it appalling and unwatchable.  They cannot be further from the truth.  It is probably the subject matter they find awful, hence, they trash the movie.  You must watch the film with an objective attitude towards pornography, or miss one of the most truthful, realistic films ever presented on-screen.  Brutal, perceptive, sad, hilarious, tempting...it's all here!Dirk Diggler is the epitome of misled youth, as well as a prime example of taking advantage of a situation that presents itself to you.  The film's tag-line rings very true, saying everyone has something useful.  Diggler's something happened to be very marketable back in the late-'70's madness that was the porn industry.  Aside from this, the film must be looked at as a slice-of-life, historical document because of how sex is portrayed and thought of then and now.  Porn, of course, is still booming.  I don't think as many people are being hurt.  Boogie Nights shows both sides of this world where love is hard to come by and you can lose it all in the blink of an eye, yet, it is an extremely tempting lifestyle to so many.",Boogie Nights
169,Filmdokter,"Great first half, mediocre second",6,16 October 2021,"Boogie Nights can be divided into two halves: the rise and fall of a porn actor. In that it follows the same kind of structure as an archetypal gangster film. And, like with most gangster films, the first half of Boogie Nights is a feast for the eyes and ears. Anderson lets the camera swoop through one entertaining scene after the other, accompanied by a terrific soundtrack. All actors are in top form but it is Burt Reynolds that steals the show as a totally believable porn director. The second half of the film is less impressive. The story at times gets too far fetched (the Molina cameo although great, the scene is a bit too much), too Hollywoodesque and subplots (like Cheadle's) that are not interesting only distract from the main plot. First half an 8, second half a 5. So a 6,5 is my final verdict.",Boogie Nights

Boogie Nights gives a glimpse into the world of skin flicks in their hey day in the San Fernando Valley. Writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson is masterful in capturing the energy of this time with disco scenes, parties with the right clothes and music. But better than this are the quirky characters. They believe that they are terrific actors, artists and musicians. What they will not admit is that they make poorly made porno films. The pain of life is too strong for them but it can only be held off for so long. Time and again the facts come crashing in finally leading to an ending which feels like a bad hang over. Paul Thomas Anderson's style is impressive. It sometimes looks like Scorsese with the long tracking shots and a great Raging Bull dressing room scene. There is a little bit of Tarantino also. But better than this is how well the actors perform under Anderson's direction. This is Burt Reynolds' best work since Deliverance. Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, Don Cheadle are great portraying people who have turned their back on much of the world, trying to create their own. These characters grow on you after a while. They are there for each other including taking in Mark Wahlberg's Dirk Digler who is the most convinced of his ""greatness"". I can't help but think of Ed Wood when I see this film. He also brought together a group of misfits that struggled to create movies. When the B movie business died, he went on to make porno films which was the only place where a person with his ""talent"" could go.Boogie Nights wrestles with the question about how people express themselves.

Macy as the obsessed husband , Burt Reynolds as the sleazy producer. As a 70s child, I have a deep acceptance that the rules were not that defined and there's this transition from the flower power to the hippie era where the borders of sex are oftentimes too open and too easy to abuse. There is escapism to easy money but at the same time aspiration to make it better. Philip Seymour Hoffman is true to form as member of the film crew who lusts after Dirk Diggler ( Mark Wahlberg) .

173,nixskits,"Heatwave MIA, all else A-OK",10,4 December 2009,"When a film's title comes from a song, you just expect it to be in the film! I don't know why this eponymous tune isn't, but that's a very minor quibble. Paul Anderson has demonstrated since this masterpiece came out that he's no one trick pony, with one bold story after another and no treading on the same terrain like some other directors we could name.His script is sprawling, in the best sense of the term. So many people looking for happiness and finding it interwoven with pain, boredom, cyclical frustration and growing, if not wiser, certainly older. The song titles are like what silent movie insert cards were so many years ago and push the drama along. ""Fooled Around and Fell In Love"", ""Do Your Thing"", ""Ain't No Stopping Us Now"", ""Brand New Key"", ""Livin' Thing""... they pretty much speak for Dirk Diggler/Eddie Adams and his voyage.The barely old enough to shave youth takes all the tests the world has to offer and with his wide eyed self absorbing it all in, he becomes a person who gets in over his head before his head even leaves his pillow in the morning. Mark Wahlberg ended any doubts as to whether he was a gifted actor with his firecracker performance. Eddie became ""Dirk"" and nothing is ever the same for him and the motley crew he adopts as his new family.Burt Reynolds gives a beautifully philosophical touch to his Jack the director. Having reached an age when he can look back on his half decade stint as the top box office star with some wisdom, now a lifetime of seeing the rise and fall of many actors (including himself) gives the role great depth. Who understands the excitement, ennui, despair and release of stardom better?The late, great Bob Ridgely appears as the Colonel, the ever reliable Wiiliam H. Macy plays Little Bill like his life depends on it and the incomparable Philip Baker Hall lends his regal presence to a tiny, but huge in impact appearance. Heather Graham, Joanna Gleason and Julianne Moore are more believable women than 99% of the female roles other actresses get to play.

174,Det_McNulty,"""Boogie Nights"" Remains An Enlightening Masterpiece Of '90s Film-making, While Viciously Exposing The Other Side Of The Film Industry",8,24 January 2007,"Boogie Nights charts the story of infamous porn star Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), a young man striving to become something in the wide world. He is not the sharpest tool in the shed, but he has a talent on one side of the life spectre and quickly becomes a media icon. Boogie Nights shows the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler and the close-knitted friends he works with. Generally speaking, the film is based around the real facts, capturing the needed essence and realism of the porn world. The core of Boogie Nights is that it is a reflective character study that entertains, amuses, shocks, thrills and educates the viewer.Boogie Nights is a film where you become part of a journey, this journey is one that shows you just how exploitive and derogatory the porn industry is Think ""Goodfellas"", but instead of gangsters you have pornographers. You can tell Paul Thomas Anderson has been influenced by Martin Scorsese's '90s cinema because there is an edge of Scorsese-flair direction hanging over Boogie Nights. At first look I thought Boogie Nights would just be a highly entertaining study telling the story of the porn industry, however Boogie Nights holds a message and rather than just being a film, it becomes a deeply insightful study.Boogie Nights pulls the viewer inside a world fuelled by casual sex and drug abuse. At heart, Boogie Nights is extremely anti certain elements of the porn industry. Boogie Nights slowly changes from being a highly enjoyable drama to becoming a demeaning study of wasted life and a lesson in social history. The film depicts everything, it does not hesitate to show the truth and reveal to the viewer the fascinating warped lifestyle that some people live.Everything is so fast, a plunge into a new lifestyle, a new culture, a new group of people, who at heart are a new family and the people who represent the confidence that Dirk Diggler never had from his parents. You are supposed to pity Dirk Diggler because he never had the love and care that he needed. There was not enough hope for Dirk Diggler before his success in the overpowering porn industry. But porn was his freedom and his route away from his mundane life. Yet, does it make him a better person? The answer is a simple, no, because he soon becomes a nasty person, controlled by his self-indulgence and loss of respect. You see, Boogie Nights is not about sex, it is not meant to turn us on because what it is about is a business that has shattered many people's lives.Boogie Nights is not a sleazy film, nor is it not a lurid film; however it is an extremely honest film that is not afraid to educate the viewer on what the porn industry does to the people. Boogie Nights made me think that porn is not just ""fun and games"", but it is actually exploiting people who have very few options in life. Another sad fact was that the actors and filmmakers consider what they were doing to be excellent and they truly felt they were making good films; it saddened and amused me to see them considering their work to be ""well made"". It made me sad to see just how ignorant they all were, what at heart is nearly as bad as an Ed Wood film.Paul Thomas Anderon's talent bursts onto screen with a vivid and colourful spectrum of material. He gives a script that pulses with hysterical humour, quotable dialogue, brilliantly structured narrative and a raw edge. The story layout is glorious and has many twists and turns, showing every little effect. One of the film's most memorable film-making characteristics is the use of tracking shots, arguably the finest to ever be put on film. Boogie Nights has that authentic vibe that captures '70s and '80s pop culture with a delicate force. The use of tracking shots gives the film a needed documentary effect. It is a visionary experience and one where Paul Thomas Anderson loves his wonderfully flawed characters which he has carefully crafted. The film also sums up the contrast of how violence becomes a trial for the lives of the characters, it is a perfected transition. Paul Thomas Anderson captures the pop culture with excellence and hilarity, by using a variety of '70s and '80s iconic songs you feel pumped inside the era. The editing is amazingly clean-cut and with the use of quick shots, close-ups and a variety of unique techniques we become plummeted into the world and introduced to many characters through incredibly '90s film-making.The ensemble cast is awe-inspiring, it adds to the mixture of quirky comedy and emotional driving force. There are so many talented actors and actresses who deliver career defining performances, which are some of the finest in modern cinema history. The entire cast light up the screen and create amusingly likable characters, who you manage to feel sympathy for. The actors and actresses control the viewer and help draw you inside the underworld of the porn industry, shedding light on what really happens and the unpleasantly genuine effects.I would consider Boogie Nights a depressing film, yet one that also has an element of hope and edge of inspiring attitude because it shows that some people are able to change the nastiness they have dug themselves into. It works as a brilliant comedy, an insightful drama, a detailed study and an entertaining work of art. It has everything a true masterpiece needs. Many aspects of Boogie Nights are unpleasant One of the best films ever made, there is no questioning the sheer force and wonderful charm of wit which Boogie Nights holds. I guess Dirk's motto is true to Boogie Nights, and much more, ""everyone is blessed with one special thing"".",Boogie Nights

177,A-Ron-2,An impressive trip through the 70s and 80s,8,11 July 2000,"Boogie Nights is one of those movies that you never expect to be good.  The previews look OK, perhaps even funny, the cast seems attractive, but overall you simply cannot imagine a movie about pornography will be very good. Well, you would be wrong.  Boogie Nights is quite simply one of the best films of the 90s, and definitely one of the best period pieces I have ever seen.  Given the 70s and 80s were not that long ago, but writers and director really demonstrate a reasonable understanding of not only the porn industry, but the societal changes that turned it into a profitable business.While Boogie Nights does not seem to glorify pornography in any way, it also does not fall into moralizing mode and become an indictment of the people of the industry.  Most of characters managed to expand beyond their conventions and become living, breathing creatures.  Wahlberg is phenomenal in this film, surprisingly so, he really brings a sense of pathos to an otherwise stupid and unsympathetic character.  The scene where his mother is taunting him and ripping his posters down is genuinely moving in a wierd sort of way (although she is not ultimately wrong).Most of the characters are equally as complex and engaging and the plot is beautifully done and ends on a rather strange kind of upbeat.  Overall, I would advise this film to anyone who was genuinely interested in the 70s or 80s, and to people who have sort of an off-beat sense of art.  Boogie Nights transcends the conventions of the biopic drama and brings something very interesting to the mix.",Boogie Nights

180,Putzberger,"The ""Godfather"" of Porn!",10,8 February 2006,"Epic in scale, brilliantly acted and utterly mesmerizing to watch, ""Boogie Nights"" is one of the greatest American movies I've ever seen, a rival to the ""Godfather."" I don't think it's a coincidence that both films are about criminal empires (the mob, the porn industry) and there are some heavy Oedipal undertones to both (Michael and Vito Corleone, Dirk Diggler and Jack Horner). Only when we're watching underworld figures can we confront the ruthlessness necessary to succeed in American society: we can understand why a gangster like Michael Corleone will have his own brother-in-law killed, we accept that a semi-literate hustler like Eddie will prostitute himself to fame and fortune, but it's a bit more disturbing to think that people who conquered on the right side of the law might be just as vicious or amoral (witness the sanitized, vulnerable Howard Hughes of ""The Aviator"" or the noble ""Patton""). As for father-son conflict, it's a staple of storytelling and film-making and what's remarkable about both ""Godfather"" Pt I and ""Boogie Nights"" is that the breach is healed . . . and that's not necessarily a good thing.Where ""Godfather"" was visually grandiose, with vivid, almost lurid uses of shadow and color, ""Boogie Nights"" has a sunny, bleached-out look appropriate to its Southern California setting, a nice illustration of a point made about that particular region of the country, and all the nefarious industries that occur there: the weather is so nice you don't really notice all the evil. Anderson's boldest move is his deployment of the soundtrack to underscore the narrative, which harks back to opera and its use of leitmotiv: the songs playing always comment on the action either blatantly (""Driver's Seat"" when Floyd Gondolli enters) or ironically (""God Only Knows"" when Amber Waves drags Dirk Diggler into his house for a cocaine binge). Anderson also uses montage, which would be trite except for the way he subverts the cliché by making the characters look silly (although it's probably impossible to retain too much dignity when ""Boogie Shoes"" by KC and the Sunshine Band is playing in the background).As for the actors, well, they're all pretty damn remarkable and they all throw themselves wholeheartedly into these anti-heroic characters. Mark Wahlberg exposes himself in every way imaginable (and yes, I mean emotionally). It's hard to imagine a braver performance, especially when he sings (oh yeah, he sings). Julianne Moore is charming despite the fact that she's playing a psycho, and this film dates from the period when she couldn't get noticed without taking her pants off so you can look forward to that, too. Heather Graham is both cute and scary (and sweet Jesus, is she hot). As for Burt Reynolds, I'm not sure the entire film wasn't an excuse to make him look good -- he's Burt Reynolds playing Burt Reynolds, but in this case, it just f**kin' WORKS. The movie is a brilliant achievement, perhaps underrated because of its sleazy subject matter -- but honestly, is there a better metaphor for capitalism than the porn industry?",Boogie Nights

183,evilmatt-3,I really wanted to like this movie,4,15 September 2000,"I like P.T. Anderson a LOT (_Magnolia_ is one of my favorite films of all time), so it hurts to admit this: _Boogie Nights_ is not a very good movie. This is a mystery, in light of an excellent director, an excellent cast, and excellent camerawork.  In fact, nearly everything about this movie is perfect, EXCEPT the script.  To put it nicely, the script just plain stinks. While I can see that the film is supposed to make some sort of point about loneliness and interpersonal relationships, the story is completely jumbled and just doesn't make very much sense.  Characters never really develop as well as they should and are not very interesting.I'm not really sure why anyone does anything in this movie; motivations are never an issue.  Although the film certainly succeeds in evoking certain moods, I was never sure why I felt the way I did about a particular scene and ended up getting annoyed.  Finally, the ending, which could have saved the entire film, kind of petered out and left me feeling disappointed.
I can see why this film made money.  It contains excessive drugs, sex, and pornography.  It's not that these ruin the film for me; it's just that the film never really gets beyond these into any meaningful story. 
In summary, this is a nice technical film.  However, _Magnolia_ is superior in every way (incidentally, not only to this film, but to many others as well.)",Boogie Nights
184,chiguy17,Self-serving and pedantic,2,31 August 2019,"The camera work is amateurish (to the point of being comical in parts), half the acting is laughable (esp Wahlberg - his performance in the actual film is as stiff and unnatural as his performance in the adult films they're supposed to be shooting). It's basically a low budget film, trying to be an independent artistic film, but only succeeding in being so far up its own behind that (despite the number of truly talented actors like Julianne Moore), it manages to succeed only in patting itself of the back for bringing the shallow vision of a depraved pervert to life.
Don't get me wrong, I'm no prude, but there's zero artistic redemption here - just an excuse for ""actors"" to pretend they're making porn.
How this garnered any sort of accolades or attention beyond ironic laughter is beyond me.Literally, as I'm sitting here, re-watching it, every time Mark Wahlberg is on the screen, I'm taken out of the moment and reminded that he's just a horrible actor whom Hollywood is trying desperately for everyone to consider a star.Pure and utter tripe.",Boogie Nights

Burt Reynolds, like fine wine, gets better with age. He has gone far beyond his Smokey and the Bandit days and keeps the focus of the film. The music was a big part of the 70's and is a big part of the movie as well. Don't expect Shakespeare, but overall, this is THE definitive disco era porn industry picture.",Boogie Nights
186,MadReviewer,"Dark, depressing, and beautiful",9,17 April 2001,"A richly told, compelling, fictional look at the porn industry in the late 1970's/early 1980's.  Somewhat surprisingly, the film isn't particularly glamorous or sexy  in fact, at times it's incredibly sad and depressing. The overall story deals with the successes that the characters enjoy within their own secluded little world of adult films . . . and the failures they encounter when they dare to reach for more.  The rest of the world views them as perverts, as criminals . . . or, worst of all, as pathetic jokes, which probably hurts most of all.The ensemble cast of `Boogie Nights' is nothing short of awesome.  Mark Wahlberg is Dirk Diggler (loosely based on the real adult film star John Holmes), a man endowed with a rather large gift  unfortunately, it isn't a brain.  He puts in a great performance as a very earnest, self-deluded guy who hasn't the faintest idea how to deal with his own success.  Frankly, I'm amazed he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for this role, and I never thought I'd ever say that about a guy who used to call himself Marky Mark.  Julianne Moore is terrific as Amber Waves, the porn starlet who acts as a mother figure to the other people (particularly the men) in her films.  William H. Macy is pathetically funny and tragic as Little Bill, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as Scotty, the production guy who hangs out with these porn stars as his sad little way of being close to fame.  Don Cheadle, John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, (even Nina Hartley, an actual porn actress!). . . the list of knockout performances goes on and on.  I'd also be remiss if I failed to mention Burt Reynolds' turn as Jack Horner, the porn producer who likes to think he's making quality films for the masses.  Watching Reynolds in this film put in a quiet, understated performance without his typical mugging or hamming it up for the camera was a real treat, a remind of why Reynolds was once considered a truly great actor.Director P.T. Anderson is clearly a fan of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese  their influences show up not only in how Anderson deals with an ensemble cast, but in his choices of sweeping camera shots, of music, and how he often chooses to unfold his story.  That's okay, because he also manages to take those influences and make something quite original  and very gut-wrenching. `Boogie Nights' is a marvelous tale.  Watch it.  A",Boogie Nights

The second was ""Magnolia"" Obvious parallels can be drawn between the two in terms of style and presentation.""Boogie Nights"" is an awesome achievement and is the first movie you come to realize just how good an actor Mark Wahlberg really is. This movie elevated him from more than just another pretty face to a true actor courtesy of a magnificent performance. It was actually heartbreaking to watch at times. Of course, the fact that he was surrounded by a stellar cast certainly contributed to such an impressive performance.This is a biting look at the porn industry of the 70s and is supposedly loosely based on the life of real-life porn king, John Holmes. Nonetheless, the performances are positively phenomenal. With a cast including Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Burt Reynolds, John C. Reily, the often overlooked Luis Guzman, Heather Graham; need I say more? It is an unflinching look at the industry and a rather disturbing one to be sure. There is also no real or structured ""plot"" per say, but the focus is on the impact this particular lifestyle had on the personal lives of the participants and those closest to them.This is an excellent exercise in character study and is most worthy of any movie collection.

189,jmverville,Risqué & Amusing Portrayal,9,8 December 2004,"I remember when initially wanting to watch this film I thought it would be very juvenile and risqué for the sake of being risqué, but in the end I found something different: a great film that was entertaining and at times fairly meaningful. It was very well-written, well-filmed, and a sad, dark portrayal of how the world can be as a place. Although this film is undeniably for mature audiences, it is the sort of film that has enough meaning built into the shock to really justify the shocking nature of it. Not to mention that, but it is the sort of film that satisfies the curiosity into the world in which Dirk lived. Throughout the whole film the acting is exceptionally well, being such an easy film to get sucked into. I think that the wide appeal for the film comes from its' thoroughness in character portrayal as well as the depth that each character has when it is cultivated in such a short amount of time; each person who appears in the film is more than just an image on the screen, but with the passage of time, you really see them as actual people. It is a movie that, while watching it, you simply forget it is a movie due to the perfection that Paul Thomas Anderson achieves in his realistic, no-holds barred film. I especially enjoy how Dirk Diggler is portrayed with his beaming innocence and simple mind: it makes one see nothing sinister about him, but it lends to the viewer an air of a certain objectivity and lack of judgmental sentiment as they watch the entirety of the porn world unfold around this character.Overall, I recommend this film to everyone who can appreciate good film and has the stomach for sometimes rather edgy and racy material.",Boogie Nights

The plot is beyond boring, characters are shallower than any of the Marvel Comics, and the pacing is so bad that I had to fast forward through most of the scenes, The film actually starts around the 2 hour mark, but even that is hardly made worth of a big screen or any screen at all.
Funny, I've been wanting to see it but something always made me leave it for later, Now, 24 years after it came out and I finally saw it, I wish I never even knew about it, it is that bad.

193,RJBose,"Interesting Story, Interesting Characters",8,27 January 2003,"There are a lot of familiar faces in ""Boogie Nights"" which combine with an interesting story and imaginative directing to make for a very good movie. Set in the late seventies in ""the Valley"" (across the Santa Monica Mountains from LA) the movie chronicles a small group of people who have found themselves in the business of producing pornographic films; in particular a young man who assumes the stage name of ""Dirk Diggler"" (Marky Mark himself in a surprisingly earnest performance).A high school drop-out busboy at a nearby nightclub (not unlike the set-up for the vastly inferior ""54"") Marky Mark is noticed by an ""Adult"" film producer (Burt Reynolds) for a specific anatomical aberration conducive to a career in pornography.  Leaving an unhappy home situation, he joins the film making family of Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, among other actors who have since become ""stars"" in their own right.  (Luis Guzman and Don Cheadle also appear, foreshadowing an appearance together a decade later as the detectives in ""Traffic"").As this group struggles to maintain some sense self amongst their failed lives, false celluloid intimacy and cocaine induced escapism we follow their stories and the (mis)fortunes of their industry.  There is no overwrought preaching (or rationalization of drug use) and the harshness and sadness of their lives is somewhat compelling, and even touching as they try to move on. The hokey dialogue and cheapo sets of the porno films are convincingly reconstructed (or so I can only assume...) and the tawdriness of their lives made transparent without resorting to becoming what it describes (although Miss Graham and Miss Moore are briefly shown ""at work"") or alienating the audience from the people of the story.It is a brilliant piece of film-making, and very well worth a look, not only as the recreation of an era (very well done with music and dancing of the period) but also as a very human story.",Boogie Nights

What I was expecting and what I got were very far apart, but I liked what I saw better than the preconceived notions I had before seeing the film. Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, and the rest of the ensemble cast put on a great performance for this movie, and I liked how it told a cohesive story from the good beginnings to the tragic middle to the sort of redemptive ending. I liked the whole main narrative, but of particular interest to me was the subplot that surrounded the character played by Don Cheadle. I think that one could've been a story of its own. For a movie about the 70's sex industry, there was surprisingly, a lesser amount of sex than you might have thought there would be. I think the decision to do the movie that way paid off in more than avoiding an NC-17 rating. With the sex not as explicit, there was more time to focus on character development and plot. I remember thinking to myself that although not exactly the two parents, 2.2 kids, picket fence and garage stereotype, that the characters were a family, with all the good and bad events that happen in a time frame, and they for the most part managed to survive all that was thrown at them.",Boogie Nights
196,Falcon-51,Stylish Film Captures the Period,7,19 April 2000,"The three names that mean the most to this film are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, and Julianne Moore. These three deliver the strongest performances, but the entire cast does a wonderful job. The film although about the porn industry does not let itself get out of hand with it's own sexual premise. On the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters lifestyle, I think there was some overkill in this department. Paul Thomas Anderson has not done a great deal of directing, but he may have been picked for this film based on his 1988 work ""The Dirk Diggler Story."" One thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family like atmosphere between the characters as they work, live, and party together. Although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other. The wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period during a time when disco was the rage. There are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well.The story is about a gifted young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) that gets invited into the porn industry. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes and adult film star almost overnight. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director that takes his films very seriously as he believes his work is more than just pornography, but that they are true art. However Dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon heads down a dangerous road where he stands to loose everything. Although a greater focus is placed on the character Dirk there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life. You will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve.

198,shrine-2,Porn forlorn,4,12 January 2000,"There are only two reasons why a movie like ""Boogie Nights"" would draw anyone:  for the pleasure of seeing people having sex (of which there is--strangely-- very little) or of garnering some insight about the people who work in the porn industry.  Paul Thomas Anderson fails on both counts.  The movie opens with a very long panning sequence, but besides getting us acquainted with some of the characters, the camera's movement lacks any deeper meaning than that Anderson wanted to see if he could do it.  This would be fine, if the rest of the movie had this same gliding, spinning spirit about it, but Anderson has chosen a darker, more cynical approach.  He doesn't judge the people he creates, but he doesn't really know how to tell a story about them, either.  He is reaching for new insights about the porn industry, but the only times he avoids its banality is when he catches the humor in the situation.  And this doesn't happen too often.  Only the marginal characters have any freshness to them; John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, and Philip Seymour Hoffman shine.  The principals--Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, and Heather Graham--are dim, and porn stars that I've ever seen in interviews have a sharpness and resilience that they lack.  The women in this business are tough and clever.  If they ever are maternal like Moore is, it's not evident on camera, and only the pretentious ones harbor thoughts of being filmmakers.  For this movie to touch anything close to greatness, it would need to be more comic in tone or go all the way with its sights on the dark side. Instead it chooses to remain somewhere in between, and the sensual promise of ""Spill The Wine"" overflows in vain.  What a waste!",Boogie Nights

Boogie Nights is a bold and sprawling story about stardom, family, and the porn industry. Anderson shows the late 1970's as a fun ride that the characters enjoy, and the 1980's as the fun that fades away while things go downhill for everyone. I'm not a huge fan of Mark Wahlberg but he really impressed me with his role as Dirk Diggler. Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore are also incredible as their characters feel like true parents to Dirk.

200,ramsfan,Great Film Making,10,9 December 2014,"Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights is a bold and accurate representation of the adult film scene in Los Angeles during the late 70's and early 80's. While it primarily chronicles one man's rise and fall within the industry, the story is so much more than that, juxtaposing the similar fates of several principal characters during a six year time period. Anderson's fascinating and brutally honest character studies allows the viewer to overcome reservations toward watching a movie about pornography. The result is a truly outstanding film on every level.Seventeen year old Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) has a chance meeting in a nightclub with porn film maker Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). Disenchanted with his life and spurred by a violent argument with his abusive and alcoholic mother, Adams moves into Horner's home and joins his stable of adult film actors which include veteran porn queen Maggie/a.k.a. Amber Waves (Julianne Moore) Horner's daughter and aspiring starlet Rollergirl (Heather Graham) and fellow actor Reed Rothschild (John C. Reilly). As a well-endowed new face in the industry, he achieves quick stardom. However, Adams (now ""Dirk Diggler""), eventually falls victim to the temptations of fame and becomes addicted to cocaine. As newer actors emerge and the medium changes from film to videotape, he becomes a bitter, drug-addled liability. After a heated confrontation with Horner, Diggler gets kicked off the compound and spirals out of control. Unable to ""perform"" due to his drug use, he is reduced to turning tricks to support his habit. After a brush with death during a botched robbery of local drug dealer Rahad Jackson (Alfred Molina), Diggler tearfully reconciles with Horner and cleans up his act but clearly faces an uphill battle in reaching the heights he once climbed within the industry.Anderson clearly shows us the devastating consequences many of these ""actors"" suffer as a result of their career choice without beating us over the head with a morality play. This is a sad story about sad people: Diggler bottoms out. Jack Horner, who fancies himself a film maker is reduced to churning out low-quality garbage on video. Amber's career choice and prior drug arrest prevent her from gaining custody of her child and must substitute true motherhood with playing the ""mother"" role to Rollergirl, Dirk and others at the compound. Porn star Buck (Don Cheadle) cannot secure a business loan due to his affiliation with adult films. A film director (William H. Macy), humiliated by his wife's public infidelities, kills her, her lover and himself at a New Year's Eve party. And Financier The Colonel James (Robert Ridgely), who fronts the money for Horner's productions is jailed on a child pornography charge. What was once hedonistic bliss is now an unmitigated disaster. There is no happy ending.The styles, fashion and music create a mood that successfully transforms the viewer into a 1970's time warp. And excellent characterization of the drug dependent and open-sex lifestyle popularized by many in the entertainment industry lend the movie authenticity. There are so many subtleties and great scenes- the (purposely) bad performances in the ""Brock Landers"" feature films, the cheesy interviews, the awful recording sessions by Diggler and Rothschild, the delusions and self-deceptions by the many characters who are not very smart, totally insecure, largely uneducated yet fancy themselves as much more than they really are.The acting is first rate. Burt Reynolds, whose career stagnated for years after a decade of box office stardom in the 70's, returns to greatness as film producer Jack Horner. Mark Wahlberg, under-appreciated by many who remember the ""Marky Mark"" nonsense is totally believable in the title role. Julianne Moore, as good an actress as there is, doesn't disappoint as a popular yet tormented porn queen. John C. Reilly, the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (as a shy, gay crew member), Heather Graham and the wonderful Phillip Baker Hall all shine in support roles.

I really cannot understand what it was that made people so into it. ""Boogie Nights"" started out ok, with some strange characters and an interesting set up for a decent movie. Unfortunately for whatever reason, it deteriorated into a jumbled mess that became actually unwatchable. The scenes near the end with people getting shot or shot at were totally ridiculous or pointless. I have never walked out on a movie and only a very few times have I ever stopped a tape. I came very close to pressing stop on this turkey after about 2 hrs. Had I known it would go on for at least an agonizing half hour more, maybe I would have. A waste of some good talent and attractive people. Is it that today's movies are so bad that this at best mediocre film would get all these stellar reviews on here?

203,chez-3,Best Film of 1997,10,16 February 1999,"""Boogie Nights"" is the best film of 1997. It tells the story of various characters and their jobs in the pornography business. That, hopefully, will not turn you off to seeing this masterpiece of storytelling. Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson is able to interweave a dozen characters so clearly that we know them all equally well by film's end. True, it isn't easy to watch at times but the rewards are there.Burt Reynolds gives the performance of his career as a film director just trying to do the best job he can. He was robbed on Oscar night by Robin Williams which is a shame. Burt will not likely ever match this performance.Lastly, this film has the best soundtrack of hit songs since ""American Graffiti.""

EASILY my favorite from PTA. There Will Be Blood was really good but just not as good as most people say for me. The Master was also very well made but was just a tad disappointing considering how much praise it gets by people. THIS however, is more like it. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year. It kind of reminds me of a Tarantino movie; A great, fun story that was extremely entertaining and still found a way to be very intense and unpredictable. The best I've watched in July 2021 for sure. I'll explore some more Paul Thomas Anderson and maybe rewatch There Will Be Blood someday.",Boogie Nights
205,contronatura,Very entertaining,7,20 February 2000,"Boogie Nights is a very entertaining, yet ultimately very shallow film about the San Fernando Valley porn industry in the late 70s-early 80s. The performances across the board are terrific, with Burt Reynolds and John C. Reilly standing out in particular. The direction by Paul Thomas Anderson is energetic, the writing is alternately funny and touching, and the cinematography is excellent. But, the film is not original and it has little to say. It's obviously modelled on Goodfellas, not to mention Raging Bull. It takes place within the porn film industry, but I didn't learn anything about that industry, and the way the film sugercoats the entire world the characters inhabit is a little ridiculous. That said, the film is well worth seeing, for it IS very entertaining and very well acted. But it's not an important or deep film, nowhere near as deep as the films it models itself on.",Boogie Nights
206,andy-933-696608,All you need is love.,9,7 November 2013,"Pornography has always been a delicate subject to tackle, and with the bold approach of Paul Thomas Anderson, it becomes even more surprising in its modern portrayal. Most people when they hear about pornography, they immediately regard those responsible with disdain and unapologetic hatred. Their humanity, as well as any sympathy is stripped from them by the very people judging them, as if they don't recognize their own flaws, when really that's the whole concept beyond this story. Boogie Nights is a multiple character study about a group of people, who each bare a unique quality within them, despite all the doubts and fears they hold in their struggle for survival. The film's direction is raw, and the scenes are long, as they capture the emotional aspects of each character in both their triumphant and tragic moments. It goes beyond a more conventional subject, as Anderson, both writer and director of this film illuminates these characters in a 6 year period from 1977 to 1984, initially finding a more empathetic definition for family, outside its traditional biological standards.Beginning in the year 1977, upon the discovery of a 17 year old Eddie Adams (Wahlberg), adult film director Jack Horner (Reynolds) takes the troubled high school dropout in the hopes of making more influential and meaningful pictures. Along with the gifted Bruce Lee fan, comes Roller Girl (Graham), a mellow porn starlet who never takes her skates off, during or after sex. Ginger (Moore), Horner's girlfriend immediately fills the role of surrogate mother for Eddie, seeing him as a second chance for her to be an actual mother, knowing her addictions prevent her from ever seeing her own for even one weekend.This film is really all about second chances for everyone. Early on in the film as Eddie makes love to a young woman named Cheryl (Holloman), she compliments his penis, and how he uses it so well to make love. Eddie then smiles and says, ""Everybody's born with something special."" The optimism that Mark Wahlberg that gives off in his performance, along with his youth give his character Eddie Adams an authentic sense of idealism. In this life, we all have this desire to make the best of it, and knowing that our time is short, then do we dream of being great. We hope to succeed in our lives, with the very talent we were born with. Call it God, destiny, or the Universe, wherever these talents emerge from, we all hope to use it as a means of defining ourselves more profoundly in this temporary journey. Boogie Nights captures this idealistic ambition through its assortment of characters. Ranging from the well-endowed Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler, the country/hip-hop artist Buck (Cheadle), the aspiring filmmaker Jack Horner, to the cocaine addicted Amber, Anderson portrays these characters sympathetically, thus taking influence from his own family's involvement in the porn industry, as well his own personal feelings towards the familial aspect that aspires towards a new definition.Aside from that many critics have often discussed the oedipal complex looming its shadow over the course of this film, and it can be clearly seen within the interactions Eddie has with both Amber his surrogate mother, and his biological mother played hatefully brilliant by Joanna Gleeson. A scene where Eddie returns home after his initiation at Jack's, he is confronted by his mother, who questions his sex life. This interrogation instantly turns into a brutal and humiliating argument as Eddie is berated to the point that he whimpers like a helpless child and desperately begs for his mother to stop. Within the comfort of Amber, comes a unique benevolent and innocent bond, and it is clearly seen within the graphic sex scenes they engage in, as the mother and son infatuation is explored against the more conventional standards of morality incestuous morality.Long, and raw to the point that with each instance of change in its documentary essence, Boogie Nights beautifully captures the end of an era, as the 70's head to the 80's, and society turns to new direction. The cultural changes of drugs, music, and clothing attire constantly shift in the world Paul Thomas Anderson has created. A bright and colorful opening introduces the audience to a variety of characters each with a unique trait, soon to be fully open that we see their ambitions, as well their weaknesses. Anderson's writing style conveys a realistic interpretation of each his characters. In both their positive and negative qualities, the camera gives enough focus, rendering their reactions as authentic and polarizing to the degree that we can't look away as they run around going crazy. Boogie Nights is inspired from Anderson's 1988 mokumentary short, The Dirk Diggler Story, which chronicles the life of a well-endowed model, Dirk Diggler. Following a similar story pattern to the short, Boogie Nights expands its story more, with its variety of characters as they experience an era that challenges their own places in the world as human beings. Its captivating in its performances, and even touching within the themes tackled, as Anderson captures a more empathetic portrayal of family, escaping the biological roots that people often cling to despite the dysfunction, and delivers a more open minded concept, without demonizing the more traditional idea of family. The surrogate family, although they are in pornography, they all have love, and that is all that is required to brave an ever changing and indifferent world.",Boogie Nights
207,brainofj72,A Modern Gone With The Wind,9,4 May 2006,"There are certain taboos a director doesn't dare touch when he wants to become a ""respected filmmaker"". In my opinion, it takes a truly gifted director to incorporate such themes in their work while still keeping widely acknowledged critical credibility. For instance, Stanley Kubrick was a master at this. He touched on subjects as pedophilia, rape, and even the horror genre, and he never lost an ounce of brilliance nor credibility. Coming off his modest, low-key debut Hard Eight, Paul Thomas Anderson made an extremely bold decision on the subject matter of his follow-up: the adult film industry.There is a certain indefinable mastery that seemed to flow through the veins of young directors in the 1970s. Films like The Godfather, Chinatown, and Apocalypse Now had it on rampant display. Anderson is one of the very few modern filmmakers with this mastery within him.Boogie Nights opens with an explosion of color and sound as the camera glides through a bustling street of '70s nightlife with liquid ease. We are introduced to the cast one by one in a nightclub before finally arriving at a young busboy (Wahlberg). Adult film tycoon Jackie Treehorne (Reynolds) spots him and immediately knows he is something special. He is correct, as this busboy is endowed with an enormous ""talent"", if you will. Treehorne takes him under his wing and nurtures him into the biggest thing in the industry (no pun intended).Never before has a modern film encapsulated the spirit, fashion, and sound of the 1970s as well as Boogie Nights. The soundtrack is incessantly infectious, the sets and wardrobe vibrant, and even the cinematography is lush and colorful.The 1980s start off with the bang of a suicide on midnight of January 1st. Thus begins the fall of class and decency (if that's what you want to call it) in the porn industry. I would say that the early half of this decade is nothing but drugs, sex, and debauchery, but those were the '70s. Those were the good times. No, the '80s are filled with violence, serious drug addiction, despair, and the general fall of the mighty.As I have said, Boogie Nights is a fantastic sensory experience. However, its real strengths lie in its characters. It may sound odd to hear Boogie Nights described as an epic, but it really is. In a lot of ways, it's a modern Gone With The Wind. It doesn't make itself big through massive sets and thousands of extras, but through the journey it takes us through with the characters over the span of two decades: the rise, the top, the fall, the bottom, and the triumphant return.And Anderson orchestrates it all with a presence, ease, confidence, and mastery atypical of a director on his second film. The music is perfect. The visuals are perfect. The acting is perfect. The editing is perfect. The writing is perfect. The direction is perfect. Anderson makes his cinematic influences subtle yet apparent, and even his obvious influence Martin Scorsese could not have pulled this film off as impeccably as he.It would have been easy for a filmmaker to turn Boogie Nights into a parody of the pornography industry. After all, it's not exactly held in high regard. But Anderson crafts a loving portrait of these characters, and the audience likes and cares about them just as much as he does. Boogie Nights is a funny, depressing, uplifting, exciting, heartbreaking, and strangely beautiful film. It truly is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.",Boogie Nights
208,DavidLindahl,A dark and emotional portrayal of the late 70's and early 80's porn industry,7,11 May 2016,"If you are wondering what it would be like to be a porn star during the late 70's and early 80's, you should watch Boogie Nights. It may seem shallow and objectifying but the story actually goes deeper than that. Paul Thomas Anderson's film is about Eddie (Mark Wahlberg), a misfit soon to be 18 years old, who works as a dishwasher in a night club. He meets Jack (Burt Reynolds), a porn film director who can offer him a chance. Eddie leaves his messy home environment, takes the name Dirk Diggler and heads straight into a tough industry.Anderson's Boogie Nights is a dirty film and not really a glamorous story. On the surface it may seem easy and tempting considering Dirk's quick and easy way to success, but behind the curtains it's not a pretty tale. Lies, deceit, infidelity and selfishness grow beneath the surface. The story focuses and is mostly about Dirk, but also Jack and his team in the industry. Julianne Moore plays Dirk's co-star and fights for the custody of her own child. Heather Graham plays the young Rollergirl who quit high school to enter the porn industry. Each character has his or her own emotional baggage. Paul Thomas Anderson's style is visible even this early in his career and the film is made of long takes, a lot of characters and a plot sometimes not really knowing where it's going.I claim that in some way the essence of Boogie Nights lies with the characters' own approach and attitude towards the industry. It is embraced but everybody still sort of wants a way out. Someone dreams of a family and parenthood, another wants to be a magician or a salesman of stereos. Even Jack dreams of directing his masterpiece and constantly tries new ways to get there. In some way they all still gather in the industry because it is the easy way. I don't think Anderson's purpose is to smear the industry but at the same time he doesn't want to glorify it either. There is a will to portray these bleeding people in a serious and emotional way while feeling neither sorry nor praise for them. It is about the understanding of other people's life choices even if they feel wrong for others. Boogie Nights is a few years old but still stands well today as an emotional portrait of a group of people that took a different path than what society called the normal one.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",Boogie Nights
209,framer94,"average watch, but full of Hollywood influence",5,16 February 2009,"This movie is meant to have been influenced by the life of porn star John Holmes/Johny Wadd, and the character played by Marky Walburger dude in the movie, Dirk Diggler, was actually a real life well-endowed porn star himself. The 2003 movie 'Wonderland,' which is actually based on the life story of John Holmes and his connection to the Wonderland Murders in LA (which WAS a true story), I seen before Boogie Nights, and I can honestly say it is M I L E S better and more realistic than this movie.Mark Walberg is just another douche actor to me the likes of Matt Damon or some douche like that. But yeah, the movie is okay or a watch but the structure of it is very close to the foundations of most Hollywood films. Imagine any old Hollywood movie about a guy rising to the top from a young age who just decides 'f''k it,' and then you have the success, and all the lights and ladies and this that and the other, then things start to go down hill (Hollywood is always bad at capturing this and good at censoring cold hard reality) and you have some of the character's lives going pear shaped, but then in the end everything works out happy. Oh yeah, and a the end, Marky Walberger gets his penis out while talking to himself infront of the mirror (obviously it is fake) and that is the point in the movie where we're all meant to laugh, only it's NOT that funny.5.0/10 being generous.",Boogie Nights

In my opinion I don't think he is a very good actor. He always plays the same part in every film he stars in. The directing and writing in the film are absolutley outstanding.

So I rent it. After I finished watching it I was in shock of how good it was.This movie just touched my heart. Everything in it was so amazing. The stories, the actors, the dark humor, the MUSIC!!! Oh don't get me started on the music in this film. PT Andderson is one of the greats. Definitely the best thing to come out since Quentin Tarantino(a god.)After I finished the first viewing I watched it again with Anderson's commentary (I was suprised on how such a cool guy he is.)Anybody who is interested in movies at all should watch this movie, if they haven't already. Anderson is obviously a film lover. In the movie he rips off so many other directors tecniques. Such as the pool scene with the camera following the girl through the water. Obviously ripped off from ""I Am Cuba."" But I have no beef what so ever with that. The film is very respectable with it's ripoff's.I recomend this film to anybody who can deal with some of the content of the film(porn.)10/10",Boogie Nights
212,j_graves68,I Can't Believe it's Not Scorsese !,8,8 July 2005,"I gave this movie a eight because I later discovered that certain shots and dialogue were plagiarized from other films. That's not saying though that this wasn't a kick-ass, well-executed film! I heard so many opinions (a lot of them negating) over the years. And it never occurred to me ever to write a review about the most profound film that rocked my world since the original ""Star Wars"" did when I was six. I read numerous reviews on this site that were both good and bad, but they ALL said that this was a powerful film.To this day, I always feel as if I'm in a sudden time-warp when viewing this, and that this is actually happening within the years of 1977-1984. There is so much attention to detail and dialogue in this movie, and there are never gags or contrived period-piece references for the sake of telling the audience ""hey, this is in fact 1977! Look at the hair! Look at the disco ball! Listen to the music!..."" Films like ""The Wedding Singer"" are just loaded with them! The film is about the rise and the fall of Dirk Diggler/Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg)- a high school dropout working a dead-end job with a care-free attitude that helps him glide into the porno industry with ease. Discovered at a nightclub by Jack Horner (played by the charismatic Burt Reynolds), he quickly meets and associates with other actors at Jack's house, who are in fact damaged goods with porn as their guise. They have been outcasted from society at one point in time, and really hold on to their dignity through this and drugs. It's not long before Dirk makes it big because of the size of his tool, and his notoriety continues throughout the first half of the film. William H. Macy's actions on New Year's Eve of 1979 set a darker tone for the bottom-half of the movie, and each main and supporting character is systematically ""punished"" in some way. Beginning with the slow, pudgy grip/gopher Scotty (Phillip Seymour Hoffmann), who makes an unsuccessful homosexual pass at Dirk; the beforehand mentioned assistant director, Little Bill (William H. Macy) suicides; their producer/distributor, the Colonel James (the late Robert Ridgely) is jailed for statutory rape; Dirk himself gets subsequently fired (for exploding into a volatile, verbal, drug-induced outburst with Reynolds); Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) is punished by accompanying Dirk in his downward spiral with cocaine and bad luck; Buck (Don Cheadle) is turned down for a loan because of his involvement with porn; Jack is subjugated to making movies on videotape instead of film, thus the films seem to lose their zest and become numb and banal. Amber (Julianne Moore) loses a custody battle with her son; Rollergirl (Heather Graham) is raped and degraded by a former classmate; Dirk is beaten up (another honorable mention); and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) is shot and killed.The film has numerous subplots, long takes and long-shots, a phenomenal music score (where they play almost the whole song in every scene), day-glo dialogue from everyone (you feel as if the actors aren't acting), and it is all an infinitely a sad story. After Dirk's expulsion, he crawls back to Jack and is forever enslaved back into the porno industry. The film also echoes pieces of John Holmes's life (not to mention pieces from his films), Martin Scorsese's movies along with Jonathan Demme.This is the only picture from P.T. Anderson I really like. To me, I thought ""Magnolia"" and ""Punch-Drunk Love"" were just bores. He has an affinity with good dialogue, but I notice that he brings in the same team (both cast and crew) to each film. It's good and bad, but when a director is comfortable (which he seems to be with his little gang), they're not good directors. Those movies seem to be proof of it. Nevertheless, ""Boogie Nights"" is a powerful and important film that both filmmakers and critics should use as a template to continue with their careers.""Ever see that movie 'Star Wars'?

217,jakespick,An Original Cliché: Boogie Nights Review,10,2 January 2009,"The Following is a review of the P.T. Anderson picture, Boogie Nights.Everyone has one special thing...and, apparently, Mr. Paul Thomas Anderson has found his in both writing and directing. This is a rare piece, which is simply a giant cliché with multi-layered originality beneath the surface.It is quite polished in all aspects. The acting is so fun to watch, and the film itself is, on no rare occasion, a good-hearted fictional biopic of a Holmes-inspired porn star, spanning over 6 years from 1977 to 1983. It is fun to watch, and you don't feel guilty for enjoying every second of it. This, I might say, has to be PTA's ONLY film that doesn't attract only one type of crowd...this attracts everybody, and all for the same reasons, and also for the right reasons. You do not go to this wanting to watch the porn they make, you go to see how they do, why they do it and what their take is how its done.In a simple conclusion, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. It may not make you cry and it may not make you laugh...but I can guarantee one thing it will do, it will make you care for the characters from the first moment you see them. PTA is a major actors' director, along with his own cameraman, editor, producer and writer. He is, on technical terms, the next Stanley Kubrick. Yes, this film has its flaws, but not one of them is a character flaw. Every character is perfect. and I say that with full knowledge and self-awareness.There's another point, honesty. This film is honest in its entirety: it shows the ups, the downs, the hilarity, the irony and the happiness of life. It goes full-force in the Crime aspect, the Comedy aspect, the Drama aspect, and the Romance aspect. My favorite part of this story, I think, would have to be the four most innocent, good-hearted people in the entire story: Jessie, Buck Swope, Scotty J and Little Bill. I became excited whenever their faces would pop-up on screen.There is something else that PTA does here...he not only makes you care for all the characters, he also makes you like the actors playing them thru careful examination. Now, two of my least-favorite actors are Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore and Heather Grahm. Now, in Wahlberg's case, this is the ONLY film I've ever liked him in (literally). This and Magnolia are the only films I liked Julianne Moore in and this is ALSO the only film I ever liked Heather Graham in.This IS a PTA film you only have to watch once, due to it's simplicity. But (according to rare reviews of his other films), for a LITTLE SUM of you, this is PTA's only film you would WANT to watch more than once. I've seen this 9 times, Magnolia 16 times, Punch-Drunk Love 7 times, There Will Be Blood 6 times and Hard Eight 2 times......so that leaves me on one positive note: I can't get enough of this director...and his use of An Original Cliché...",Boogie Nights

220,sixtwentysix,"a big, bright, shining star.",10,3 May 2004,"This is a story about insecurity, family and character flaws set in the sleazy porn industry world. It is very stylish and realized from a graphic standpoint and filmmaker outlook. The culture references are tight and never intrusive, the dialog is intelligent and the film itself has a heart lurking somewhere deep down. It's not as warm as the film would like to think of itself.The acting in this film is absolutely top flight. Without a single weak link in the cast it steamrolls you, keeping you riveted on even the most trivial characters. Not only is this a career making role for Wahlberg but one that did for Burt Reynolds what Pulp Fiction did for Travolta. Ask anyone what who has seen this film and the usual response is ""Burt is great"". That misses the point however, EVERYONE shines in this film. The director has a lot of actor/actress weapons and he doesn't fail to bring out every single one in this film. Tight interweaving stories bring this family closer to your heart and make you care for what happens to some of these what society considers lowlifes. It humanizes and dehumanizes characters at the same time. With all the sexual posturing and the nature of the business you find the human thread in all of their insecurities as the central axel turning their drive. Sure this story is unlikely but at least it tells a human story to an inhuman business.After re-watching this film after a few years it still has one of my favorite scenes in any film ever. This scene known as ""Long Way Down (one more thing)"" is involves a long camera shot of Mark Wahlberg staring off into space sitting on a couch contemplating his life. I can't explain why but it was like magic on film that you just don't get anywhere else in my opinion. Sad in a way, that more people remember the film by the `money shot' delivered in the final scene than a few of the others great ones. People might find this film pretentious in it's over the top way, even see it as having a bit of a Napoleon complex, as ""the big little film that could"" but Boogie Nights is a film that is designed by nature to invoke a strong emotional response. It's successful. 9/10",Boogie Nights
221,he_who_leads,Was it Good For You?,7,16 January 2007,"All the characters are in the porn business. But this movie isn't really about porn, it's about family, and we care about all of the family members. Every single one of them - from the main players down to the supporting ones played by the likes of Don Cheadle, William Macy, John C Reilly and Heather Graham. These are interesting people every moment they are on screen. Since they deal in skin flicks, all they have is each other to lean on as the outside world turns their backs on them.It's a testament to the actors, under the sure hand of Paul Thomas Anderson, that everyone is so compelling. Julianne Moore, one of my favourite actors, is sympathetic and heartbreaking as Amber Waves. Mark Whalberg, former rapper and model, who was ridiculed when he decided to get into acting, successfully shows the long journey of a lost boy desperately trying to matter. Technically, the film is vivid and interesting in its depiction of the 70's and 80's, plus it has consistently inventive camera work.The relationship between the characters, and what they do for a living is explored with patience, subtlety, breadth and depth. There are no saints or sinners but people just trying to get by. As we start in the 70's and move to the 80's (memorably), each character has to adapt to a world and industry that is moving away from what they have always known. Overall this movie just feels so authentic, speaking volumes over many other under-baked films. But despite the praise I've heaped on it, it isn't a classic. I didn't feel restless during the 2 and a 1/2 hour running time but by the end you feel that there are things left unsaid. A little too much is left open. I'm not just talking about a lack of resolution to the characters' story lines but a lack of resolution of the themes that Anderson has been juggling all along. Less is more to be sure, and the future of the characters is clearly in the balance, but they are all so closely linked in situation and destiny that there seems to be a definite way to end the film that wasn't tapped into. This lack of conclusive unity makes the film seem more bloated and over-baked.Put another way, the weaknesses in the film are magnified in Anderson's next film after this one - 'Magnolia.' 'Magnolia' was so long and had so many story lines that its impact was severely muted. It felt Robert Altman (rip) light. Anderson exercises a lot more control in 'Boogie Nights' and its definitely worth seeing if you like meaty and dramatic films that makes sure the little details are taken care of as well as the big ones. There's sex, drugs and violence but its not gratuitous.",Boogie Nights
222,axile007,summarizing the overview of 70's & 80's adult films,8,17 June 2008,"Boogie Nights deals with the adult movies of 70's and 80's.Some may take it as rather iconoclastic because of its topic,but what I conclude is that the movie demands mature audience,one who loves true cinema.Director Paul Anderson has kept the content quite straight and tried to explain the ups and downs of adult films & characters related with it in 70's & 80's.What really significance is as the storyline progresses we tends to observe the change that director has tried to show in the pornographic industry with growing days..............The story is about 17 year old Eddie(Mark Wahlberg)who rocks the adult film industry in late 70's.Latter emphasis is given on how his life changes and his relations with characters around him.The film has other big casts too.Julianne Moore is quite effective as veteran pornstar.Heather Graham too fits in her role.The running time of movie is around 160 minutes,but its being effectively managed which has prevented the audience to get bored. Overall the movie is being quite successful to analyze this topic,and by far I don't remember any movie handling this subject quite effectively as done by Boogie Nights .",Boogie Nights
223,Pinback-4,One of the 10 best movies of the '90s.,10,8 October 1999,"This film is a masterpiece.  It was exhilarating from beginning to end. Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's story about a porn star is told with style, grace, humor, even poignancy.  The actors and the characters they play are all first-rate, including Mark Wahlberg in the lead, who proves himself a solid actor and can carry a film.  Burt Reynolds gives perhaps his best performance ever as a porno director who discovers Wahlberg.  The film recreates the late 70s and early 80s with dead-on accuracy, from the disco scene that begins the film to Wahlberg's Don Johnson ""Miami Vice"" outfit that he wears in the final scene.  Most regular moviegoers who see this film will no doubt compare it to PULP FICTION, but it really has much more in common with the films of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese.  The film is a triumph in style.  The opening tracking shot that begins the film is just as impressive as the ones in THE PLAYER and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS.  The editing by Dylan Tichenor is simply phenomenal.  I couldn't believe the editing didn't receive an Oscar nomination (GOOD WILL HUNTING was a better edited film?!). The best scene in the film has to be the one with the firecrackers.  I had butterflies in my stomach because the scene is incredibly intense.  When I saw the film a second time, I had the exact same reaction to the scene. Unfortunately, it may not have the same impact on TV as it did in a theater with good stereo sound.  It's a shame that many people didn't see this movie during its theatrical run, because it is the best way to watch it. Anderson's use of widescreen will suffer on TV (so get the DVD or a letterbox tape).  It is amazing how easy Anderson makes it all look, because this is only his second film.  The music, sets, costumes, photography, offbeat characters, sex, violence, happiness and heartbreak are captured by a guy who is clearly in love with filmmaking.",Boogie Nights
224,hardeep-pathak,A classic movie that established PTA. Might just surprise you.,8,17 May 2012,"Easily a 4.5 star movie if we delete the ending scene which is the only sad part in the movie. Its a pathetic rip off of the famous Raging Bull ending scene with the mirror. If only the movie would've ended a little early.P.T.Anderson gives due respect to all the characters and impresses us with his story telling skills. He solidifies himself as a filmmaker through this movie. The techniques he uses with the (moving) camera in almost all the bar scenes like the opening set in a club, are quite unique and mesmerizing. The script is handled in a terrific way such that the film never loses any of the energy it has right from the beginning. He managed to assemble a perfect cast too and to get the best of performances from them all.After watching a lot of his movies recently and specially this one, PTA has just made it to my list of top 10 filmmakers alive. Mark Wahlberg too impresses by his acting, a career defining movie for him. Overall, an enjoyable and sometimes disturbing movie. Don't be put off by the content of the movie about the adult industry; the movie might just surprise you. A classic, undoubtedly. An epic that won't be soon forgotten. A low class subject handled in a high class way. Highly recommended.",Boogie Nights
225,cathyyoung1,"Quite simply, a modern masterpiece",10,15 May 2000,"SOME SPOILERS""Boogie Nights"" may well be the best film of the 1990s.  I cannot remember the last time I was so overwhelmed by a new film.Interestingly, I was not planning to see it.  I knew nothing about the director, I've never cared for Burt Reynolds, and the only thing I knew about Mark Wahlberg is that he had been an annoying boy singer and Calvin Klein model.  Nor was I all that interested in seeing the story of an extremely well-endowed porn star.A couple of months ago, I tuned in, about 20 minutes into the film, when ""Boogie nights"" was on cable -- and I was hooked.  I have seen the entire film twice, and it has become one of my favorites.First of all, P.T. Anderson is brilliant ... it's daunting to think he was only 27 when ""BN"" was made.  Despite the ""borrowing"" from Scorsese and Altman, I believe he brings a profoundly individual vision to his work. What sets him apart is that his keen observation and satirical vision are enhanced by warmth, compassion, indeed love for the people who populate his film.Is Anderson ""judgmental"" toward his characters?  A friend who watched ""BN"" at my suggestion said that one thing he loved about the film is that it's moral but not moralistic.  Anderson makes it clear that these people's lifestyle is often destructive.   The critics who complained about the abrupt shift from hedonistic fun in the '70s to horror and disintegration in the '80s were mistaken.  The first half has many intimations of darkness: the girl who ODs on coke at Jack's party, face streaked with blood, limbs twitching; Amber's son trying in vain to reach her at the party; Little Bill's anguish at his wife's infidelities.  Clearly, too, most of these people aren't very smart, and their pretensions -- Dirk's belief in his stardom, Jack's belief in his ""art"" -- are ridiculous.  Yet we never lose connection with their basic humanity.  When Amber/Maggie is denied visitation with her son, we know it was probably the right decision yet we sympathize with her anguish.It's the ultimate cliche to say that a film will make you laugh and cry. With ""BN,"" it happens to be true.  The ""Brock Landers"" clips and the preparations for Eddie/Dirk's porno debut are just two of the riotously funny scenes.  On the other hand, the confrontation between Eddie and his mother or the scene of Dirk coming back to Jack asking for help have more genuine emotion and poignancy in a few brief minutes than there was in all of ""Titanic.""  And some scenes are both comical and moving (Amber and Rollergirl talking as they snort coke, Scotty making a pass at Dirk).This film will also make you think, without beating you over the head with a message (the way ""Three Kings"" does, for instance).  Many say that its theme is family; but equally important is the theme of self-deception.  Most of the characters are prisoners of their dreams and delusions.   For Jack and Dirk, it's the delusions of glory and greatness; in Amber's case, her self-image as a good mother.  (Right after telling Dirk she sees him as a son, she introduces him to cocaine -- his eventual undoing.)  Why do Jack and Rollergirl unleash their fury on Rollergirl's former classmate? Because, with his comment on how squalid their lives actually are, reality intrudes on their self-enclosed world of illusion, and they can't take it.There's no real ""happy ending,"" either.  At the end, Jack has reconciled himself to being a rich hack.  A wistful-looking Amber sits at her makeup table; while Jack tells her she's the ""foxiest bitch in the world,"" clearly her looks will be more and more difficult to keep up.  As for Dirk, he has presumably kicked the drug problem and is back working, looking slick yet somehow lifeless.  Note that in the infamous final shot, when he exposes his penis in front of the mirror, we don't see his face.  He has been dehumanized, reduced to a sex machine -- and that's all there will ever be for him.  (Think of the early scene of Eddie telling his girlfriend, ""I'm going to be a star, a big bright shining star,"" his eyes gleaming, his voice aglow with hope, and contrast it with him saying at the end, ""I am a star. A big bright shining star"" -- his voice flat, his face invisible ... the real ""star"" is his penis.)Despite the film's setting in the porn industry, I think ""BN"" has something to say about the larger culture of media glitz and celebrity-seeking.A word about the acting.  Burt Reynolds is superb; Julianne Moore truly shines.  (It takes courage for a female movie star to take on a part where she often appears physically unattractive.)  Philip Seymour Hoffman, Alfred Molina, John C. Reilly and Heather Graham stand out in a supporting cast that doesn't have a single bad performance.  As for Mark Wahlberg, he proves himself to be one of the finest young actors working today.  He is utterly convincing as he shows Eddie/Dirk's evolution from an eager-to-please, innocently amoral kid with a dopey but radiant smile to an obnoxious, egomaniacal, paranoid prima donna, and then the despair of his downfall. During the drug-deal scene, there's a close-up of his face for more than a minute, with no dialogue, and he conveys a complex range of emotion as Dirk ""spaces out"" listening to ""Jesse's Girl"" -- obviously thinking of better days, then of how low he has fallen -- and then snaps back to reality and is terrified.""BN"" is not without weaknesses.  A few scenes are too long; the theme of Amber's ""mother"" role is overemphasized; a few plot strands are left unresolved (were there any legal consequences to Jack's and Rollergirl's assault on the guy in the limo, or to the drug deal/attempted robbery that ended in two dead bodies?).  But these are minor flaws in a near-perfect work.",Boogie Nights

It is a disgrace that it was overlooked by the academy for best picture because of the subject matter.  This movie is not profane or vulgar, it simply shows the every day goings on of an adult film maker and his cast and friends. The subject matter is dealt with professionally, just like in the real world. The real message of the film is one of hope and acceptance. Everybody in the picture is seeking some kind of acceptance and they eventually achieve it by working together in the adult film business. Keep in mind, that during the 1970's, adult films were seeking to compete with mainstream movies as a viable form of entertainment. Keep an eye out for the character Todd Parker, his performance was especially great. Also Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reilly were great as Chest and Brock (a.k.a. Reed and Dirk). Fantastic movie.

This movie manages to be simultaneously brilliant and very fun. I'm sure its under drama at the video stores but you could just as easily put it under comedy (especailly John C. Reily's character). Although it is extremely sad to see Mark Whalbergs character go from an extremely nice if somewhat stupid young man into a total asshole jerk, but at the same time I'm sure that transition is what made the movie so fun to watch, and I suppose that is the most likely thing to happen in this situation.

231,qljsystems,An excellently delivered slice of amorality,2,22 September 2012,"Imagine if you bought a beautifully bound book with the right font-size and easy-to-read chapters to read to your children, but as you read a chapter each night it became clear that it raised more moral and ethical questions than it answered - would you be pleased? I dare say there's a few who will read this who will argue they would out of sheer ideological defiance; but the majority of parents wouldn't like their children to be exposed to moral filth.Boogie Nights is an amoral movie - by that, I mean that it is a semi-docudrama screenplay about a young man's entry into the porn-industry and the chaos and upheaval that lifestyle creates in both his and other peoples' lives without providing any moral perspective. Throughout the movie, the only people who object are narrow-minded bigots, and those who embrace it are intelligent and enlightened.Yet, it depicts a movie-making scene peopled by morally-ambiguous characters, who swing and sleep around despite being married, and are entangled in pornographic pursuits to one degree or another. This has got to be - yet again - another example of Hollywood money thrown at a movie to reinforce relativistic, amoral values and mock principles and anyone who lives by them.All the actors deliver utterly convincing roles, along with all their fetishes and sexual openness. The movie portrays victims of the porn-industry along with its winners. The only thing it fails to show is the absolute consequences, and those who suffer consequences do so only by virtue of being caught in the act.",Boogie Nights
232,Dr. Nick*#3,"A funny, dead-on, period masterpiece",9,25 July 1999,"This movie is a beautiful, nostalgic, thrillride with some of the funniest, slyest deadpan comedy I've ever seen in a movie. EVERYONE in the cast sparkles and creates a believable, engrossing, character-from Jack Horner, played with supercool pomposity and grace by Burt Reynolds to Don Cheadle's Buck, the vulnerable artist trying to find himself and everybody in between. They perfectly capture the goofy, decadent cluelessness of the late 70's and early 80's.  If you don't like this movie because it's ""idealized"" or doesn't truly capture the porn business, you miss the point-this movie is about a group of slightly deluded outcasts brought together for dubious reasons but finding themselves in the midst of a family. Paul Thomas Anderson was the real star of the movie, however. The period touches were so dead on and he was successful in capturing the palpably different vibes of the late 70's and early-mid 80's. Julianne Moore was totally robbed by not even being nominated for her performance and Burt Reynolds was a shoo-in, in my opinion. This is one of the most exhilarating, satisfying, and creative movies of the 90's and it is highly underrated, just like the director's first movie, the superb Hard Eight.",Boogie Nights

236,crendine,Must've Missed Something,2,7 April 2015,"Check me if I'm wrong, but isn't this movie supposed to be a loosely-based biography on the life of John Holmes and at the same time, an in-depth view of the sleaziness of the porn industry itself? Perhaps I missed something but the parallels to the character Dirk Digler are unmistakable: Holmes was discovered working as a carpenter in Ohio by a low budget filmmaker (if I'm not mistaken). He began his career in photos and worked his way into the film industry. He was later involved in the Laurel Canyon murders (scene where Digler is in the producers home), his massive use of cocaine and alcohol, abuse of his girlfriends, his detective porn series, etc. Aren't these all somewhat portrayed in this movie to some degree as it ventures through 2 decades of this industry? I gave this movie 2 stars only because of its originality in tackling a very difficult topic. However, the acting for the most part , is absolutely unconvincing. Perhaps I just associate Burt Reynolds too much with the Smokey & The Bandit movies and The Longest Yard to take him seriously as an adult film producer. Mark Wahlberg just doesn't impress me as an actor at all so it's difficult for me to accept him as a porn king. The supporting cast is OK but I must agree with those IMDb reviewers that believe this storyline simply does not move along and is in fact, a bit boring. And the grand finale: Mark Wahlberg's narration as he reveals himself from the chest down is just plain stupid. My summary of this film: a sleazy account of a sleazy industry.",Boogie Nights
237,crazychap,underrated emotional film with highly-praised performances,9,4 June 2005,"This movie-- who's title is based on a 1977 hit disco song by the Heatwaves-- talks about someone's rise to fame and the consequences that go with it.Eddie Adams is a charming high-school dropout who wants to make it big, but has little to show for it until the porn industry comes along. As a result, he uses the stage name Dirk Diggler. Armed with his charisma (as well as his private parts), he skyrockets to fame circa 1977. He manages to achieve wealth and prestige beyond his wildest dreams. But then comes the twist: His egotism, his arrogance and his drug-use (many of his friends and co-stars are also victims of such vices) led to his downfall by 1982 and 1983, temporarily living a life of crime before finally pulling his act together.Unlike many films of recent times, which tend to script the past in a very biased and cartoonish manner, this movie shows the true mentality of the late 1970s and early 1980s. The use of the trends of the time as well as contemporary songs in the soundtrack show the feeling that you are actually there . The story is dead-on realistic as it shows the two sides of the porn industry, without any really obtrusive sex scenes. The cast is also dead-on perfect as well, with Mark Wahlberg giving an unusually impressive performance (He needed to take a number of Drama Lessons in order to audition for this role), a performance which he never lived up to in later films. Julianne Moore was definitely Oscar and Bafta material as the leading porn figure who pays the price for her involvement with drugs and the industry. Burt Reynolds also impresses as Jack Horner, the egotistical and ambitious director who is surrounded by an equally egotistical and greedy crowd. To put it down in a few things, there is good and evil in every one of us, and this movie shows such figures as being both influential as well as vulnerable.The movie is flawed only by over-length-- some scenes feel like they're forcefully extended to make way for the soundtrack-- and and is at times a little too exaggerated and far-fetched, but the acting and direction as well as the storyline are unusually brilliant. Although it fared decently in the US and flopped in the UK, it fulfils all the requirements of being a masterpiece",Boogie Nights
238,niteman,Size Does Matter,6,15 January 2000,"I would love to report that Boogie Nights is a great film.  Clearly, many IMDB users believe it is.  Indeed, for the first two hours, it is engrossing, beautifully and originally shot, and contains great performances by Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham, Julianne Moore, and Mark Wahlberg.What happens to Boogie Nights is a bad case of director's overindulgence. As the movie grinds into its third hour, Anderson runs out of ideas and the cracks in the characters begin to show.  Wahlberg goes from tortured to merely whiny.  A botched drug-deal subplot comes out of nowhere and Tarantinos around for awhile before going *back* to nowhere; if it weren't for the characters, you'd think it was from another movie.  My friends kept turning to me and saying ""Is it over *now?*  How about *now?*""  Not even the sight of an obvious prosthetic in Wahlberg's fly felt like a payoff.Anderson is a wizard with visuals and excellent with casting, but needs to take a few lessons in storytelling (there is practically no plot to speak of) and work with a judicious editor.  Until then, he's merely good, with gusts up to genius.",Boogie Nights

When you get past all the sex and drug use, you see a story about being on top one minute, and falling back to earth when you become cocky. i don't know much about the porn industry of the 70's and early 80's, but this movie is very detailed. Paul Thomas Anderson captures the very essence of the 70's. The one thing i enjoyed the most about this film was the music. There is a really good dance sequence in this film as well.The acting is good across the board. Mark Wahlberg gives a good performance as Dirk Diggler.

This is really something, because from a technical point of view, everything is well-put together. The photography, scenery and lead actors are all great. Even though, the film's running time is almost three hours, the deep development of the characters and the clever plot gives more and more tension to the viewer. The editing of the movie but the story as well, is a mature look on a world which is unacceptable and offensive for many people. You can decide to not judge the strange family of Dirk Diggler but familiarize with them, even like them and maybe, try to understand them. This film refers to the 70s and 80s when the industry of porn was still evolving fast, when film was replaced from videotapes and when people used to watch soft porn movies in public theaters.

242,lilballa08,Great movie with a tight cast,10,22 August 2006,"BOOGIE NIGHTS is the most famous porno film, in part because it was the first legal porno film. There were previous softcore porn films that snuck some hardcore action in (i.e., THE PIGKEEPER'S DAUGHTER, PLEASE DON'T EAT MY MOTHER), but this was full-on, deep sexual penetration here.Heather Graham (actually a rather good actress) plays herself, a woman unsatisfied with her sex life. After consulting doctor Burt Reynolds (the first male porn superstar and another good actor), he discovers her clitoris is deep down in her throat, meaning she must give ""deep throat"" oral sex to pleasure herself and her partner. She practices on Burt, then becomes a nurse for him, aiding his patients with sexual problems (including a ""Coke addict""). Meanwhile, Burt has sex with his nurse in many positions, with Heather in many positions, and Heather's friend has group sex.A lot of the sex in the film is not very erotic because it is filmed like open-heart surgery: up close and personal. The best sex scenes are the deep throat blowjobs, Heather's friend's gangbang, and Heather having sex with Burt to cure his broken penis (!). Anyway, BOOGIE NIGHTS is legendary and should be seen by anyone who is into either a) hardcore sex or b) waiting to be introduced to the world of hardcore pornography. It is not a very good erotic aid, but it works well as a comedy above all else and features rather good performances by the cast (especially Graham, Reynolds, and the actor who plays Linda's friend, Don Cheadle) and an ingenious plot (for a porno film).",Boogie Nights

I have no affinity with any of its main themes, the music means nothing, the porn means nothing, the location meant nothing, the drugs meant nothing. Now I understand that that alone isn't a reason to not enjoy a film but somehow with this film it meant that there was nothing to pull me in.Maybe because, for me at least, looking at a ""scene"" that was totally alien to me meant that I couldn't work out whether it was ""real"" or a parody or charicature of ""real"".Some of the acting was fine, Reynolds in particular, and the diretion was pretty lush, but that just wasn't enough to make this film seem any more than an overlong, over-violent and unnecessary poke around in a subject matter that I feel was perhaps better left alone.",Boogie Nights
244,Garys1266,A brilliantly scripted and acted film...,9,9 June 1999,"Everyone that sees this movie has to chuckle at all of the characters. Take a bunch of ignorant porn stars who forget what they are there for, to make smut, and they all end up taking themselves way too seriously as actors. For example when Dirk started thinking he was the second coming of bond as Brock Landers and when Buck, the black porn star went to the bank to get a loan and called himself an actor to the loan officer. Also notice how Dirk was practicing his lines in the first porn scene as if the lines really mattered anyway. I also noticed how much Amber wanted to be a mother figure having lost her real children in a custody battle. She first turns to Dirk, Dirk then leaves and she takes Rollergirl as her ""child"". The coke scene Where Rollergirl states to Amber, ""Amber will you be my mom?""The most brilliant scenes were when Dirk was in the recording studio trying to do some Loverboy rip-off act and the drug scene gone bad at the end ""die you puppies!!!!!!!"". What amazes me is that these actors were able to all act as ignorant as they appeared in the film.Everything works out at the end though and Jack Horner ends up being the good guy taking everyone back who helped him in the beginning. Even though they were virtual losers in every other aspects of their lives, although outcasts maybe a better description. An example of Jack Horner's charity the next time you watch the film, is when Jack allows Buck to install a stereo hi-fi system even though Jack doesn't show much interest in the hi-fi system. Jack Horner at the end of the film if you notice, becomes some type of paternal figure to all of these people taking them all back in as though hey are some tight knit family.9 out of 10

I went on opening night not knowing what to expect. I wanted to see this movie mainly because of all the stories of wild, care free party life that my parents always talked about (disco, Studio 54 etc) and wanted to see how it translated to film.I was surprised by some of the things that they depicted from that era, but nonetheless, it was well done.My favorite character in the film is Jack Horner who is brilliantly played by Burt Reynolds. His desire to make ""The Great American Adult Film"" is what drives him to be the top director in the business. However, as time goes on and we enter the 80's, he is forced to come to terms that with the advent of the cheaper and easier to film and edit ""videotape"", not to mention the VCR, people no longer care about plots in a porn movie. He also sees that with this technology, people will soon be able to film a porn movie from their own basement for practically nothing and make big bucks. He reluctantly makes the transition, yet, that soon becomes the least of his worries when the 80's begin and life around him and his ""family"" slowly begin to unravel.The saddest point in the film for me is when rollergirl (played wonderfully by a very sexy Heater Grahm) encounters someone from her past( you have to see it for yourself) and the brutal scene that follows her encounter with this person. The other Characters in the movie were well picked for their roles, most notably Julianne Moore. Mark Wahlberg's character was terrific also but I liked the supporting characters more.Mind you, this is not a no-hold barred film about porn, but a story of people involved in the porn scene in the 70's and 80's. See This Movie!!!",Boogie Nights
247,Baghdaddy,Not Great,4,15 January 2014,"Despite the high ratings in Meta Critic and on this website, I thoroughly did not enjoy watching this film.Firstly, it's too long, and the plot is very simple about a man who is a college dropout and picked up by an Adult Movie director whilst working in the kitchen of a nightclub. He is blessed with a large penis and being very good in bed.The movie sees this man rise to the top, then his addiction to Class A narcotics and fall from grace. As the 4 main porn stars get addicted to the drugs, their characters change a lot which is indicative of real life however the film portrays in a very annoying, egotistical way which is frustrating to watch.As a movie, this is not particularly thought-provoking or meaningful, and the final scene is thoroughly confusing where they attempt to rob someone and then it fails.Then the movie all seems to correct itself, magically, in the end with just an apology, which is not indicative of real life drug abuse.",Boogie Nights

Never knew all that was going on when I lived near L A during that time and later I'm sure it does to this day.  but the movie itself was just so so.  it had its good points again the soundtrack but just the fact of seeing the rise and fall of these people lives and how they came back some what is interesting and goes to prove that it can be a dirty business whether porno or reg movies people get money and start making very bad choices and I'm sure people said ""thats what you get from doing those filthy movies""  Not to stereotype anybody.  it would be easy with movie.

249,Left_Hand_of_Dog,"Chop some lines, let's get this party started!",10,15 July 2021,"Party time, my baby muffins! Slap on that 8-track, bust out the cocaine, and let's get wild!You know, I've seen Boogie Nights many times. Like a number of Paul Thomas Anderson movies, I end up revisiting it every few years or so. And it just gets better. This movie is an orgy in more ways than one. Yes, it's about the porn industry, and pulls very few punches regarding it's strange mingle of glamour and seediness, but it's also a feast for the senses as regards acting, photography, music, plotlines.... It's a wild and crazy smorgasbord of excess.I almost don't even know where to start with this beautiful monstrosity, so let's start from the top with the plot. The film shadows many characters, but mainly focuses on young Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), who meets porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) in the late 70's, and begins his rise and fall as the world's pre-eminent cocksman, Dirk Diggler. Fun times turn into desperately uncomfortable times as the 80's commence, interspersed with hilarity, suicide, overdoses, friendship, and a lot of really genuine love. And sex, of course. Lots and lots of sex.The cast is, in a word, ridiculous. Let's go through the list, because why not? I'm not writing for an employer; there's no word count here, so we can be leisurely.Mark Wahlberg (Dirk Diggler): This may still be the greatest role Marky Mark has ever played. Dirk is sometimes irritating, but moreso just loveably dumb. From the open, he displays an open-hearted, boyish sensitivity alongside his lack of intellect, which makes for scenes that endear him to the viewer on both ends. He comes from the background of an emotionally abusive home, which lends itself to his search for family and self-value, which he finds both in pornography and in other members of our cast.John C. Reilly (Reed Rothchild): I love John C. Reilly. In anything. As the idiot best friend of Dirk Diggler, he especially shines here in Boogie Nights. The dynamic between the two of them is emblematic of the comedic side of the film, and I challenge anyone not to have a smile on their face as these two affable morons get along like innocent 10 year olds.Burt Reynolds (Jack Horner): Perfectly cast. This wealthy, affluent director of all things smut is the father figure here, given to delusions of grandeur apropos the ""art"" he creates. His vision to ""keep people in their seats"" and be a real director leads to some of the best moments of the film, not just in his performance (which would net him his only Oscar nomination), but the amazing montage of serialized porn films, starring Wahlberg and Reilly as 70's style detectives who have mustaches and do karate. You heard that right. 70's porn detectives. Can't you just hear the soundtrack already? Listen closely.Julianne Moore (Amber Waves): Let's get one thing straight. Everybody in this film is brilliant, but Moore tops them all. Porn actress, girlfriend of Jack Horner, and a mother figure to the whole menagerie, she displays a heartbreaking sensitivity, openness, and hidden vulnerability that propels her performance to the top of the heap. She's denied access to her own children, taking on Wahlberg and Graham as her surrogate offspring. Whether she's weeping in a parking lot, flying around the room on a ripping coke buzz, or having Wahlberg cry on her lap after a breakdown, she is what I consider the heart of the film, were I pressed to choose just one.Heather Graham (Roller Girl): An ultra-blonde ditz on roller skates, and ""actress"" as well, Graham nails both the fun-loving vibe and the ultra sad, lost in the wilderness aspect of a confused young girl. She is wonderful in these powerful scenes with Julianne Moore, where she asks if she'll be her mom (furthering, along with Dirk, the theme of finding family wherever one can), and some genuinely uncomfortable scenes later on, when everything starts to fall apart. When she's in the limo with Jack, trying to find people from the street to have sex with her, it is just about the worst feeling ever. This movie is fun, no doubt, but it can also punch you right in the gut.The list goes on. You've got Luis Guzman as a nightclub owner, Don Cheadle as an actor who desperately wants to break away and open a hi-fi stereo business, William H. Macy as a pathetic lighting technician whose wife (played by Nina Hartley, real life porn actress) is banging everybody but him, the great Philip Baker Hall (who played Sydney in Hard Eight) as a rival producer, the vastly underrated Thomas Jane as an exotic dancer/junkie, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffmann as Scotty, effeminate camera man and number one Dirk Diggler fan. This movie is absolutely stacked, my friends, and everybody, I repeat, everybody, is perfect.Let's talk direction. After dealing with the budget constraints of Hard Eight, which was a very understated film, Paul Thomas Anderson is reveling in his production here. This movie is absurd, high octane, disco-night crazy. It has its powerful, quiet moments when appropriate, but generally the film feels as high and wild as a cocaine party, with the appropriate hangover as things start to deteriorate for the characters. This grandiose quality is apropos the direction, as well. Make no mistake, PTA is having a great time, reveling in his talent. He's definitely showing off, but when you're this skilled, I consider it a plus. The camerawork is complex and inventive, with a lot of those ""Goodfellas"" shots. You know the ones, the long, complicated, intricately choreographed takes that make film nerds like me giggle. From production design to camerawork to the gloriously 70's musical score, the filmmaking is top notch, and just as showy as the events it's focusing on.I can't say enough good things about Boogie Nights. I love it more every time I watch it, revelling in the performances, the atmosphere, the dualling elements of good-time parties and general discomfort, particularly in the last hour. I love how Dirk is said to have an enormous cock, but when he whips that sucker out, all you get are gut-bustingly funny reaction shots of other characters' faces. And I also love the atypical trajectory of its character arcs. It's very rare to have an epic, and I would call this a weird epic, where nobody learns anything. The characters are basically the same when the picture ends as when it begins, and this is oddly endearing and comforting in a way I can't quite place. It speaks of a core of innocence within a world of absolute, unapologetic sin.FINAL TAKE: Boogie Nights is a movie about many things. It's about a dumb guy with a huge dick. It's about an ensemble of weirdos making their way in the world, with no reservations. I hate to use this cliche, but it's also about family, where people who can't, or couldn't, find love anywhere else, create their own crazy little slice of home. It's fantastically fun, gut-wrenching, enormously funny, and horribly uncomfortable, all at different points, and often folded in together. The direction is awesome, the performances all winners, and the vibe of the 70's and 80's crashes over you like a garish, neon wave. Boogie Nights is one hell of a film.",Boogie Nights
250,Mark-201,Porn stars struggle for acceptance and self progression,10,31 December 1998,"Boogie Nights is one of the best films I have ever seen.  Director Paul Thomas Anderson does a superb job of putting this film together.  A few things that stand out include the little shots of coffee being poured and film turning, the mix scene of Dirk's beating and Jack's beating of the limo guy, and the characterization elements. Throughout, we see little signs of the people's ambitions outside the porn business.  We see Reed doing magic in the background, Buck talking about stereos, and Amber showing signs of motherhood.  Julianne Moore and Burt Reynold's performances stand out the most in this excellent film.",Boogie Nights
251,dynagirl,A superbly crafted film,10,4 February 1999,"Never before has the essence of a genre been so perfectly captured and portrayed on screen. Yet Boogie Nights manages to handle the subject matter quite tastefully, without glossing over its crudity.The ragtag gang of characters were surprisingly well defined and performances were above-average across the board. Burt Reynolds, for one, really impressed me with his character strength. I've never been a big fan of his work, but he gave an undeniably great performance as the anchor/father figure that held everything together.The directing is outstanding as is the script itself (one particularly great moment is the masterful transition from '70s to '80s). The film's soundtrack is perfectly laid to each scene and even gimmicks, like fast choppy cuts, slow motion and long uncut shots work well, enhancing the feel of the movie. Boogie Nights just pulls you in immediately and never lets you go.",Boogie Nights

253,JThomas-2,Totally Awesome!,9,6 August 2000,"Boogie Nights ranks in my list of top ten films!  Now, I'm a bit prejudiced: I lived through the same era depicted in this film at about the same time and age as Dirk.  I wasn't in the porn industry, but I supposed I had the same wide-eyed innocence that he has in the beginning of the film.  It was like a time capsule for me watching this film.  I was transfixed and transported back in my own life.  The music, the characters, the direction, everything was right on!  There were a couple of unnecessary scenes, but overall, I think it was a brilliantly made film.  (So why did the director's next film rank as the worst big budget film I've ever seen <Magnolia>?)  The language is often rough in Boogie Nights and the nudity and sex blatant  - but you know, hey, we're dealing with the porn industry here.

254,ladylynch,"A groundbreaking, original story",10,4 August 2000,"Not for those easily offended, this movie breaks new ground with its look at the dark AND light sides of the porn industry.  The first time I watched it, I really didn't like it.  But after the second watching (getting over my initial shock) I LOVED it and have seen it over and over since.  It encompasses so many different emotions, while evoking sympathy for people (i.e. Dirk Diggler) see themselves as ""stars"" who are making a good life for themselves.  It is very realistic and covers everything from drug use to suicide to homosexuality to child pornography.  The movie truly opens one's eyes to many aspects of this type of lifestyle.  Burt Reynolds, for once (in my opinion, sorry if you are a big fan) is brilliant, Mark Wahlberg is brilliant, as are Phillip Seymour Hoffman, John C. Reilly, and William H. Macy.  The movie is a must see for those who can deal with very direct and realistic language and graphic sexuality.",Boogie Nights
255,dmwhite50,The first film of the rest of my life,10,29 April 2004,"The first time I saw Boogie Nights it was on cable ( I know,...tsk tsk).I had heard it was horrible so I didn't bother to go see it in the theater. The I got to thinking something that provoked that strong of a reaction had to be worth my time. What an understatement that is!Boogie Nights is the first film I saw that was able to combine Comedy and Drama equally and effectively. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie,(the TK421 scene) I knew two things. This wasn't going to be just another T&A flick and that it was going to be a great parody of the porn business in the 70s. When the 80s were ushered in (dramatically), I realized there was more to this film than comedy. As the final notes of what P.T. Anderson referred to as ""broken circus music"" faded, I wanted to go through the whole journey again because while watching Boogie Nights I go through the whole gamut of emotions. That is why this movie is so much more than just ""worth your time"". Finally. as kind of a side note another thing about Boogie Nights that makes it such a superior film is that it is able to employ Tarantinoesque style (hip pop culture references etc.) in a very humanistic manner. For example you won't hear Reed Rothchild say "" I just shot Dirk in the face."" in this movie or any other PT Anderson picture for that matter. That is why I will never be disappointed or feel cheated after seeing a PT Anderson picture.",Boogie Nights

I have only two complaints. The fight scene between Eddie and his mom seemed a little pushed--but still good. And the final scene seemed like an add-on.

Anderson is a great writer and director and BOOGIE NIGHTS deserved an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and Best Actor - Mark Wahlberg, and should have won Best Supporting Actress - Julianne Moore.BOOGIE NIGHTS is filled with many different types of characters. Mark Wahlberg turns star in this picture with twelve inches to his name. As Dirk Diggler, he becomes a great porn star with the help of Jack Horner - Burt Reynolds, Rollergirl - Heather Graham, Amber Waves - Julianne Moore and many more. BOOGIE NIGHTS is centred around all these characters and the hardships they go through to be porn stars and what happens to them when their stardom and lives collapse.With drugs, nudity, and violence, BOOGIE NIGHTS is an all right movie. Of course it's not for children, but it is an interesting sight to see. Even if you take away the sex, if you think about it BOOGIE NIGHTS has an interesting story line. Thumbs up to PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON. I hope the best for him. MAGNOLIA and HARD EIGHT are interesting and I believe that Anderson, by the end of his career will have a couple of Academy Awards.

The extended takes moving from character to character give the film a visual energy and the performances feature the who's who of character actors (Macy, Moore, Reilly, Hoffman, Cheadle). The acting highlight though, comes from Burt Reynolds as porn director Jack Horner. For all of the acting power in the film the real treat is the realism of the mise en scene.

It's a mosaic of outcasts desperately searching for acceptance and finding it in highly unconventional places. For all of their character flaws and amorality, Paul Thomas Anderson crafts and presents them in a brutally honest, yet non-judgmental manner. Anderson empathetically captures both the glitz of the roads they choose, but also harsh reality. By the end I'd fallen in love with a seedy cast of characters ostracized by family and society.I was not expecting a movie like Boogie Nights to tug at the heartstrings, but the final act of the film always gets me. It's a wonderful payoff that more than justifies the buildup and runtime.Wonderful steadicam sweeping walk-and-talk cinematography, and a phenomenal soundtrack, Boogie Nights is right there with There Will Be Blood as Paul Thomas Anderson's masterpiece.",Boogie Nights

Like Scorsese, he has shown himself able of doing something that's truly rare in american films: he has made a movie, where everyone is a bad guy, and still you watch it. From the beginning it is clear, that it is going to be a ""rise and fall""-type of film, and I think the biggest fault of the film is, that the ""rise""-part is too long. Sure it captures a lot of seventies-atmosphere, but at length it gets boring, until the last part of the film finally saves the day. The anarchistic end of the movie is in many ways a parallel to that of Raging Bull - the star who - no longer a star - refuses to realize, that he's finished.

Even on my favorite films, I had a bit of confusion in some areas, but not this one. Another thing to note was that this was Paul Thomas Anderson's 2nd film and he was only 27 when this was released (25 when he wrote the script). In spite of that, this film manages to be much better made than some filmmakers twice or thrice his age. I don't really even have a problem with this movie.

It has to be one of the most mature films I have ever seen. The only compliant is that there were times where I wanted to know more about the minor characters, especially at the end. at the same time, that is part of what makes the film work so well. William H. Macy, not Burt Reynolds, as great has he was, gave the films best supporting performance. His was a persona which captured the tone and flavor of this films dark spirit. the other notable performances came from Mark Wahlberg in a break-out role, and Julianne Moore, as heartbreaking figures of self destruction. As I viewed the images before me, I was stunned, moved, captivated as I have rarely been during a modern film. there are scenes in this film which finally show people as people, that life is life, and that the good times perhaps aren't always so good, but they may be all you have.

But slowly it dawned me that this overly long movie was a morale tale. Everyone of the characters, who all work in the blue movie biz, end up in the gutter. No-one seems to make a fortune, earn respect, or even have fun. No, they are all junkies, coke-heads, losers, and even dumb. The only world they can make it in is their sinful trade. What a hypocritical way to look at things. I assure you there are plenty of careers in Hollywood based on some involvement in the adult film market. This film tries to get the reputation of a ""daring and groundbreaking film"". Nonsense! Is it daring? Nope. Just take the scene in which Julianne Moore and Mark Wahlberg are filmed on 16mm. We can see the footage they shoot. It's supposed to be a hardcore flick, right? So why does the director only shoot from the waist up? Repressed. And this infamous shot of Wahlbergs Willy - it only shocked the uptight American critics. There was no need to show it that late in the film. It just wanted to gain attention in a cheap way at the end of a very long film. It is a shameful film, in more than one way.

Burt Reynolds and Mark Wahlberg got the most praise for this, but I felt the true stars were Julianne Moore as the cocaine-sniffing mother wannabe, Don Cheadle as a black man struggling with identity as pornstar/stereo-salesman in some wild getups and William H. Macy, who's wife is the ultimate slut.  Not to mention a nearly unrecognizable Alfred Molina.  Macy's new year's eve bash and Cheadle's chance for a better life after a donut shop robbery gone wildly wrong are probably the two best scenes in the movie, or at least the two best shot.

Not since Orson Welles made Citizen Kane has a young director shown such a command of the film-making medium.Like Citizen Kane, Boogie Nights is a thinly-veiled biopic of a famous figure, in Kane's case, William Randolph Hearst, in Boogie Night's case, John Holmes. Both films mock particular film-making styles, in Kane with News On The March, in Boogie Nights porno films. There is even the revelation of the heart of the character in the final ""money"" shot -- Rosebud is revealed in Kane, Dirk is exposed in Boogie.

276,yodaschoda,An ode to porn stars of the 70s,8,31 January 2005,"This movie is not an adult title. It's really an homage to the late John Holmes. Boogie Nights takes place at the start of the 70s disco craze, where polyester, sequence and coke ruled the night scene. We meet Eddy Adams, played by Wahlberg a young kid working in the back of a night club with big dreams of being a star. Eddy gets his chance when he meets Jack Horner, played by Reynolds, and adult film producer who's very interested in Eddy's ""gift"". Jack lead's Eddy away from his dysfunctional home by luring him with the promise of money, fun times and lots and lots of sex. As the movie progresses, we meet many other characters, all with their own quirks and short comings. Eventually the party must end and the characters are left to face their vices with ought the support and business of their past employment choices. If you've ever wondered about what takes place behind the scenes of adult videos, more precisely those of the 70s, then this is a movie for you. I find this to be a very interesting subject as I don't think it's been done before this movie, also because one never stops to think about what the people in this kind business are like once the cameras stop rolling. This movie is a study in character development and relies heavily on the acting by all parties involved, who succeed admirably. Although this movie was not a big blockbuster hit, mostly due to the subject nature, I assume, this is a great movie none the less on a subject we don't often think about. Many have copied this movie, but few have managed to capture the feel of it.",Boogie Nights
277,dandare4479,Big Shining Star,9,13 April 2017,"Boogie Nights is an ensemble cast of characters in 1970's and 1980's Los Angeles. It is also the first great piece of work from writer director Paul Thomas Anderson, whom has gone on to become one of the best American writer/directors working today. I enjoy Boogie Nights more then say Goodfellas and Short Cuts. I feel it is more accessible and its characters are all very likable. It definitely borrows from those earlier great works mentioned, it also has a fabulous soundtrack. Great performances from Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, and helped launch very successful careers for almost all of the supporting cast. The directing here is fantastic, the opening shot being a stand out and the shot following the lady into the swimming pool. A great scene later on with fire crackers is also brilliant. I highly recommend this film, however the subject matter may put some viewers off. It is a great piece of work from Paul Thomas Anderson and one of 1990's best films.",Boogie Nights

280,shacoria14,One of my favorites,9,10 November 2016,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. One reason why I love this movie is because there are many layers to it. On the surface, it is just a movie about a guy who gets into the porn industry, but underneath that, it is really about the people involved in the story and their lives outside of porn and because of porn. The characters are what make it come alive. t's kind of like Pulp Fiction. The story itself isn't really all that fascinating, but the characters in the movie are just very interesting. That's what makes the movie so good.I was fascinated by the character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman. I was fascinated by Amber Waves and her relationship with Dirk and her relationship with her own real life son. Every character had their own personality and there was a part of me that cared about all of them (even if only a little).",Boogie Nights

But consider it's 1997, pre internet... It's hard to remember the world then and what movies were pushing forward the industry standards.Boogie Nights is notable. It will remain so for a long time. However, it's probably not worth your time 20+ years later if you haven't seen it. Chances are whatever this film offered audiences when it came out is lost to the internet age.The film is quirky, it's interesting, the work is solid. It just doesn't hold up. But that's maybe a failing of the age today and not a mark on the film or actors.With all that it's also important to note that this is a story of a 17 year old. A 17 year old porn star who asks his predatory peers ""do you think I look cool"" while snorting a line of coke.It's not an easy story to tell on film with any degree of decency.",Boogie Nights
282,FreddieLee04,Boogie Nights - 5 stars,10,18 February 2021,"If you wanted an example of perfect filmmaking to come from a new director in the 1990s, many would instantly choose Pulp Fiction. It's the most logical option, and certainly higher regarded when compared to Anderson's second feature, Boogie Nights. But what Boogie Nights has that Pulp Fiction doesn't is the deep character details and backstories. In Pulp we jump from character to character with little rhyme or reason whereas in Boogie, we start with Eddie Adams and end up with his new persona, Dirk Diggler. I've always felt a stronger connection with Boogie Nights and when it comes to a rewatch, it's more enjoyable overall.The dynamite 70s soundtrack is a prime example of how the movie creates such a great atmosphere of the era. Of course, set design is a major factor but as a lover of music from that era, it was great to see so many awesome songs crop up. Burt Reynolds' character is my favourite in the movie; it's a real shame he didn't want to ever watch the movie post-release. In my opinion, it's his best role- he got a Golden Globe win and an Oscar nom for his turn as Jack Horner, the calm and cool Movie Director that Dirk finds himself working with.Talk about an ensemble cast! Wahlberg, John C. Reily, Julianne Moore, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, Luiz Gusman, William H. Macy, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Alfred Molina. Genius casting across the board, no matter how small or insignificant the role. They each get certain scenes or moments to shine. I have to admit, my favourites were Guzman, Hoffman and Molina. All three give stunning performances that are highly underrated roles, Molina for example, only appears for one scene, but the scene is magnificent and he is magnificent in it.The rise and fall style story structure seen in other legendary movies such as Barry Lyndon or GoodFellas is also seen here, but adapted to fit a different style of filmmaking. Anderson is more similar to Tarantino than he is to Scorsese or Kubrick in the way he directs his films- a very eccentric and humourous style.And this applies to fans of all three directors above- watch Boogie Nights. It is an immense film that does absolutely everything and more.",Boogie Nights
283,Hippie69,Robbed of a Best Picture Oscar,10,2 October 1998,"Boogie Nights was without a doubt the best film of 1997. I could watch this movie over and over and over and still love it. I'm in no rush to watch that overblown romance/disaster epic Titanic again. The fact that Boogie Nights did not even receive a Best Picture nomination just goes to prove how predictable and narrow-minded the Academy is. Only Atom Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter and Robert Zemeckis's Contact came close to being as great as Boogie Nights. No other filmmaker in recent years has come even remotely close to making a film as good as Tarantino's Pulp Fiction -- until now. Paul Thomas Anderson rose to the challenge and succeeded. Just as Tarantino gave John Travolta's career a kick, P.T. Anderson has given Burt Reynolds the kick that his career needs. Boogie Nights will also undoubtedly make stars of Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, and John Reilly. Overall, a wonderful film. The best since Pulp Fiction. Maybe even better.",Boogie Nights

It might be enough to say that it tries to parody pornography, but fails -- instead it faithfully replicates that genre's banal plot development and terrible acting.

But the story does not really captivate, and the causes of the fall are not made very clear, something about there always being a new boy in town and VHS, it seems.",Boogie Nights
289,moniker_jones,A Modern Masterpiece,10,4 November 2005,"Altman and Scorsese have twisted sex together in one of the greatest American films of the past 20 years. Boogie Nights didn't make a huge initial splash, and I still don't think it's received the credit it deserves. The immediate clamor surrounding the film (""Some porn movie with Marky Mark"") was wholly without merit. What Paul Thomas Anderson has created is no less than a stunning representation of the pursuit and subsequent loss of the American Dream (if such a thing still exists).For those of you who have been living in a box (or a confessional) for the past 8 years, Boogie Nights tells the literal rise-and-fall tale of young Eddie Adams (Wahlberg). Eddie is just a dopey kid from Torrance, California who wants something more out of life. His room is soaked in muscle-bound, naive Americana. His dreams are far bigger than his potential, but not quite as large as his...special gift. His bald-headed southern gent quickly raises the attention and eyebrows of the booming, omni-present adult film industry. Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds as the film's twinkle-eyed Papa Bear) gets wind of Eddie's hidden talent and decides to put him in a movie.Before you can say ""deep-throat,"" Eddie has changed his name to Dirk Diggler and exposed his massive member to a wide-eyed public. Fame and fortune make Dirk's acquaintance, as do a bevy of local porn celebs. His friends and co-workers become his makeshift family, but it soon proves to be a Sunday picnic like no other. As the feel-good 70s give way to the coke-addled, video-friendly 80s, Dirk & Co. begin a dangerous backslide. Anderson put everything he had into this glorious, moving epic. It sizzles and never fizzles. Nary a frame of this monumental picture is wasted, and the characters and their dialogue live with us long after ELO fades from the soundtrack. See this one immediately. And then watch it again.And again.",Boogie Nights
290,Ross-45,Good film for bad content,6,27 August 1999,"Although the lifestyles of the characters in this movie are deplorable, they are well portrayed. I'm not familiar with the 70's porn industry, but I can definitely see how that kind of self-gratifying life of debauchery would lead to bigger problems like drug addiction, depression, and desperation. The characters I enjoyed most were ""Amber Waves"" and ""Buck Swope"", because to me they were the most believable. They were the only two characters (besides ""Colonel"") with any redemptive value; namely, that there are unavoidable consequences for our actions and the life we choose for ourselves.The one part that didn't fit at all for me was Rollergirl. She made no sense whatsoever. I guess she's supposed to be the Traci Lords equivalent -- a girl who drops out of high school for full-time sex. Okay, so what. Big deal, right? But what's up with the limo scene where Jack picks up a guy off the street to film having sex with Rollergirl in the backseat, and then when he doesn't do it right they get all upset, kick him out of the car and beat him senseless? ""Don't you ever disrespect me!"" Duh?! What's there to respect about her? She invited him into the car to have sex with her and then turns on him! I don't even know why they cast the part of Rollergirl at all, other than to see if Heather Graham would cave in and finally shed her clothes on film (which she did).Well, enough ranting and raving. Overall, I thought the movie achieved its goal. The bad acting portrayed was just perfect, it really helped you get an idea of how shallow these movies really are. And just for a laugh, Dirk's incredible prosthetic at the end was worth the ticket price alone (no, it wasn't real).",Boogie Nights

Burt Reynolds is a complete tool and so was Marky Mark (in real life) but they definitely bring It in this movie. The best job is done by Julianne Moore, as a coke-addicted porn star fighting a losing battle for custody of her son. If you ever rent this movie and get bored ('cause it is looooong!) hang in there because the drug deal at the end is one of the funniest moments in film history. I actually taped JUST that scene when this came on HBO a few years ago and I still have it on tape ... I can't think of any other scene in film history that's made me want to do that - wait! I taped the opening conversation between the sheriff and the store clerk in the beginning of ""From Dusk 'Til Dawn.""

293,Jackkrsk,"""It's the best film of 1997""",10,11 June 2013,"Paul Thomas Anderson wrote an impressive original screenplay for his first official Drama film ""Boogie Nights"". He of course also directed the film. The story takes place in 1977 during the time when porno films were filmed on movie cameras and were released theatrically in porno movie theaters. By 1983, when the movie ended, the porno film industry has switched from theatrical release to video tape release. This era that I referred to is called ""the golden age of porn flicks (1970s-early 1980s)"".That is mainly involved in the plot of the movie. The film was released on October 10, 1997. The film shows experience on how it's like becoming a famous porn star in the porn cinema industry and here's how it began in the movie : Mark Wahlberg portrays a 17 year old high school drop-out and dishwasher working in a Los Angeles nightclub named Eddie Adams. Eddie lives with his parents in Torrance, California. One night, Eddie is discovered by a porn film director named Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) at the nightclub, where he works.The Nightclub is owned by Maurice Rodriguez portrayed by Puerto Rican character actor Luis Guzman. Then, Jack became fascinated of Eddie so, he took him to his house to audition him by watching him having sex with roller girl (Heather Graham), who is a young female porn actress who always wears roller skates all the time. After Eddie succeed the audition, Jack hires him to star in his pornography films. There was a argument that Eddie and his mom had about his open relationship girlfriend and his sexual life. That's what made Eddie decide to run away home and move in with Jack Horner in his San Fernando Valley home. After Eddie agreed with Jack to get involved with the Porn film industry, he changes his name to his screen name Dirk Diggler. Speaking of which, here's a fun fact: Boogie Nights was an expansion of P.T. Anderson's short film The Dirk Diggler story (1988).After Dirk Diggler started in a couple of Jack Horner's films, he started to become a famous male porn star of pornographic films.The films' big cast is definitely well casted just like Anderson's third film Magnolia. Julianne Moore portrays Maggie a.k.a Amber Waves, who is female porn star of Horner's films, drug addict, former housewife & mother and she develops a relationship with Dirk. William H. Macy portrays Jack's assistant film director Little Bill, he is married to porn star who constantly bangs (sex) on men. Reed Rothchild portrayed by John C. Riley, who develops a great friendship with Dirk and stars with him in a film series of action theme porn films. He has a dream of becoming a famous rock musician and a magician. Buck Swope is portrayed by Don Cheadle, who is an hi-fi stereo salesman and second-tier actor. Maurice Rodriguez the night club owner also wants to star in Jack Horner's porn films. Rick Jay portrays Jack's cinematographer. The Colonel James portrayed by Robert Ridgely is the porn film financer. The Colonel's boss is Floyd Gondolli portrayed by Phillip Baker Hall, who on New Year's Eve, 1980, breaks the news to Jack that videotape holds the future of the porno industry.Phillip Seymour Hoffman portrays Scotty J. is a gay boom operator, who is in love with Dirk.The reason why P.T. wrote an impressive original screenplay because every line that he wrote in the script made it astonishing. It's one of those movies that has an experience type of story. It's just like the mob movie Goodfellas that features how is the experience like in the Italian-American Mafia. Boogie Nights shows you the experience of becoming a famous porn star of the 1970s.It's also just like Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam War flick Full Metal Jacket (1987), it shows experience of becoming a soldier in Vietnam war.Here's another example of the perfect film that shows experience:their is also a crime drama film called Boyz N The Hood (1991) that shows experiences of growing up in the African-American ghetto of South Los Angeles. P.T. Anderson's magnificent cinematography film style has Stanley Kubrick's same significant film style. P.T.'s same film style as Kubricks' is the film camera following the characters body movement. For example, the scene when the film camera follows the female background character gets into the pool during Jack's pool party. Stanley Kubrick was Paul Thomas Anderson's main influence and that's why he uses Kubrick's film style to make his films. Thats what makes his film style magnificent.Burt Reynolds played the perfect role as the porn film director. His role marked him that he acted out very well for his role. Warren Beatty and Sydney Pollack were originally offered the role of Jack Horner. I am not so sure why Beatty turned down but, I Pollack attended the film's premiere and expressed regret for turning the role down. Mark Wahlberg portrayed an outstanding role as Dirk Diggler for a couple of reasons. He portrayed his first out of his element dramatic lead role. The way that Mark Wahlberg portrayed his first lead Dramaitic very talentedly. His lead role of Boogie Nights made him famous as a movie star. That is the reason why Boogie Nights is Mark Wahlberg's best film. 155 minutes of the film was overall great. It's the best film of the year 1997.Here's my advice for the film: ""It's definitely worth watching "". I give it a 4 out of 4 stars ****",Boogie Nights
294,IDs_Ego,"Lousy, overlong, indulgent hack work.",1,19 October 2004,"Unlike most reviewers here, I hated this movie, simply because the writer/director's bloated ego was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic. Too many film fans equate 'EXTREME self-indulgence' to 'film GENIUS!', but I don't buy into that cult of personality. A film should be about its subject, not its director (unless it's a Woody Allen film, of course). *SPOILER* (which is just as well, save your time...) There is nothing brilliant about of showing you the foot-long porn-star's you-know-what in the last frame- that's actually called a tacky maneuver that SCREAMS film-school hackism. The poseur flick has achieved 'great film' status based on its indulgence and pandering to the audience  which, first and foremost, is the writer/director. But the rest of the audience should look down on the surly, brutal nature of the porn biz, too. The flick had an aloof angle to the porn industry, looking down on each and every player it could bash. No matter, just love your writer/director. Love those four-minute steadicam segments, which are supposed to show the energy of the moment, but somehow had all the verve of an off switch. Love the story- no matter how dull it is- about the gee-whiz rise and sordid fall of a porn star. But look down on it, too, of course. While the subject has the potential to be fascinating  innocence, money, degradation, beauty- your worshipful writer/director somehow managed to make it all look, again, DULL. Partly because of its run time. Here is something your auteur hero DIDN'T try: Giving the characters dimension. Or soul. Anything AT ALL to give a hoot about, aside from Genius That Paul Is, of course. But I'm not buying. I don't buy into indulgent hacks with astounding hype. Another overlong auteurist hack piece, with fifty times more hype than quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will see likely see this indulgent flick again. Not my problem.",Boogie Nights

Here's why. It's brilliant.I realise that isn't really a great review so I'll have to give some reasons. First of all, the characters (as in 'Magnolia') are so well-rounded you feel you could watch them sleep. The screenplay (Oscar-nommed I believe) is tender and bizarre (""Will you be my mom?"") and should have won the Oscar. The storyline documents the rise and fall of not only people, not only and industry but a whole era and I don't think any other film has done that quite as well since 'GoodFellas'. Magical, tragic, funny and inspired genius.",Boogie Nights
298,madahab,Interesting but overlong,6,15 February 2017,"Paul Thomas Anderson is somewhat of a frustration. He is a director with obvious talent but his films seem to have a very hollow center and feel more fragmentary than a complete film. Boogie Nights has a great energy and superficially present the early days of the adult entertainment industry. It is very loosely based on the career of John Holmes but does not really get into the darker aspects of his story when he was still making porn films while knowing that he was infected with the AIDS virus and probably infecting his unaware co stars. Like The Master Anderson really never goes too deep into the motivations of his characters and seems to focus on the more lurid aspects, wallowing in the excesses of the decade. There are plenty of great performances in the film and make it worth re watching periodically. The most sympathetic character is played Don Cheadle but I like the little family that forms amongst Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, and Mark Walberg is genuinely sweet at times. But the excesses the era and the industry they are in cannot be entirely kept at bay and sets up the third act downward spiral. The soundtrack is spectacular and is a great sampler of the 70's but can be a bit overbearing at times in the course of the film, jumping from one song and going right into another...and then another. It is like a juke box that someone pumped a sack full of quarters into and you just want a little quiet time. I recommend to anyone interested in the subject to read a book called The Other Hollywood which expands on a lot of the subjects that Boogie Nights covers but with much more detail and insight into the darker aspects of adult pornography industry. Boogie Nights is flawed but has ambition.",Boogie Nights

I feel this comment contains spoilers.A.K.A., ""How an Idiot Becomes Dirk Diggler"". If you have no interest in a movie about porn, this movie deserves to be seen anyway merely on the basis of the acting. Like in ""Magnolia"", P.T. Anderson gathered some great actors and said 'GO' (pretty much the same actors, too).We follow the life of Eddie Adams as he is discovered by a porn director, through his porn career, and through the aftermath as things careen out of control. Also like 'Magnolia', this movie has several subplots with some of the other porn stars, but even the subplots pretty much stay focused on Eddie/Dirk. I was real dissappointed to see yet another ""how drugs can make things bad"" theme show up in yet another movie, but at least some of the drug material is shown at a fresh angle.  I was really happy when the drug part turned into just another part of the movie instead of the main focus.
The ""drug"" lifestyle contains inherent drama, and it is almost cheating for a writer to fall back on this tired old theme just to create drama where he doesn't feel like thinking it up on his own.  (See ""Requiem for a Dream"", the best and hopefully the last ""how drugs can make things bad"" movie).
I was quite pleased to see real porn stars in the movie, and I'm not sure why (Nina Hartley, Veronica Hart, there were probably more). The 'giveaway' at the end leads you to think about the entire movie, and how this guy's entire life was merely because of one ""special"" thing. The fact that he does not realize his one special thing is very stupid is what makes him so tragic.",Boogie Nights

The film at about 2 1/2 hours is far too long and bores you to tears (1 friend fell asleep and started snoring) at the end of the film and this proves how universally hated by the cinema audience this film was when one person shouted ""thank f--- its over!"" and got universal applause.This film is amazingly bad with dreadful acting (even from heather graham, burt reynolds and mark whalberg) and the most boring script in the world ever and I know several other people have slated it too (most of them on this site).The film is that bad that even Burt Reynolds apparently has distanced himself from it which I don't blame him for. If an actor does that then that means even he thinks its s---. This is total utter trash and I cant even think of any saving graces which is unusual as even with some of the worst films i've seen I can find at least one. Ahh got 1, yes it does have a saving grace and thats that eventually after all the tedium it finishes and thank F--- for that!",Boogie Nights
303,ghostninjafire,90's in one movie,9,20 November 2013,"Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights is a masterpiece that pretty much sums up the 90's cinema: It is a never stopping comedy filled with action and sly humor in every dialogs, typical from the 90's mainly thanks to films written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, mixed with the early 90's films which felt like a warning, with a message, a critic and an unmasked reality, known from Martin Scorsese's GoodFellas and Casino. This film is a pure portray from the cinema industry in general, not only pornography, making no apologies and asking for no forgiveness: Little stars, started from the bottom, with the world at their feet, appeared, apparently, from nothing and got famous, drowned in their own money, got lost in their own minds, started with drugs, believing themselves immortal and, with no surprises, got back to the bottom. In other hand, this film keeps going for 2h30 with no stopping, filled with energy mostly thanks to Mark Wahlberg's sublime appearance that makes us feel as excited as the character, a gift typical from the 80's musicals such as Flashdance and",Boogie Nights
304,DwightLynn,PTA at his best,10,7 January 2020,"Boogie Nights is the second feature length film written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, and it just might be my favorite of his. The film follows a young man who becomes involved with the adult film industry. While a lesser filmmaker could have used this film as an excuse to be shallow and vulgar, PTA approaches this subject matter with maturity and he includes lots of depth for the amount of characters in his movie.Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Burt Reynolds all give fantastic performances, with the supporting characters being just as good and memorable. PTA is really talented at giving his actors lots to chew on; I am constantly amazed at the high-quality of acting in all his movies. Another key feature of PTA which is highly present in this film is the fantastic camera work.There are many scenes in this film that involve long, swinging shots where the camera follows character after character for a very long time. Although some may find the camera work self-indulgent, I find that the long, unbroken takes help the viewer fit into the world. It makes it easier to relate to the characters because we feel as if we are in the situation with them.Boogie Nights is a blast from start to finish. It is a very dynamic film: we experience the characters at their highest highs and lowest lows. We root for our characters and we hate them at certain points. And although it is easy to see the Martin Scorsese influence this film takes, Boogie Nights still stands on its own and offers an experience like no other film",Boogie Nights
305,jaguar-4,worst dialogue ever,2,18 December 1998,"when I say ""worst dialogue ever,"" I mean worst!!  Ed Wood's dialogue is oblique, wooden and fun, the dialogue on an average TV show like say ""Cannon"" is functional; the dialogue in ""Pulp Fiction"" is pretentious and occasionally good.  The dialogue in Boogie Nights made the dialogue of the Brady Bunch tv show look pretty good. No one in the 70's would even be capable of making those beyond banal remarks. they sound more like the brain-dead me-good-boy rantings of a 90's illiterate.",Boogie Nights
306,TheMaster01,Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Boogie Nights' perfectly captures the style of the era that it depicts!,9,3 December 2013,"Say what you will about the heavy themes and issues that 'Boogie Nights' deals with - including drugs, greed, sex and pornography - but you would have to be a fool to deny the power of Paul Thomas Anderson's incredible filmmaking. Not only the director of this late 90's gem, but also the 'Original Screenplay' writer, PTA has crafted a fantastic collection of colourful characters, and the chronicles of their lives through the American Pornography industry, during the late 70's and early 80's. The film is centred around Eddie Adams, a High-school drop out who works as a cleaner in the kitchen of a nightclub. Adams is played by Mark Wahlberg, with a cheeky sense of charm as well as a destructive sense of Greed, as shown in the later stages of the film. This was the perfect breakthrough role for Wahlberg. The Nightclub that he works at is often visited by obvious favourites Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in his incredible comeback) and Amber Waves (played by a perfectly cast Julianne Moore). Jack is a director of 'erotic films' and spies Eddie from across the room of the club. He follows him into the kitchens and tells him that within those jeans he knows that... ""there's something wonderful just waiting to pop out"".The opening of the film is a fantastic tracking shot, in which over 50% of the main characters are introduced, and the spirit of the 70's is re-created. Paul Thomas Anderson's use of effective camera work (i.e. Split Screens/Tracking shots) is often over-looked as most people believe that Scorsese's walkthrough of the Copacabana kitchens is the be-all-and-end-all of tracking shots. PTA tracks around the 70's nightclub, and also focuses on various character interactions around Jack's pool in a later scene (in which the camera even manages to follow a girl underwater). After Eddie inevitably accepts Jack's offer to work as a Pornstar, he meets a wide variety of unforgettable characters including Heather Graham's hot roller-girl (a girl who never takes her roller-skates off), John C. Reilly's Reed Rothchild (who becomes Adam's fellow sex-star buddy) and many more. Fairly soon, Eddie decides to adopt a new name... Dirk Diggler. But with adopting this new name, Adams also adopts a new attitude, a power-hungry attitude that bursts out as soon as the 80's come about. 'Boogie Nights' is not only the rise and fall of the Californian pornography industry, but the rise and fall of every key character within it. Especially Dirk.Whilst 'Boogie Nights' is about the porn industry, it is in no way a 'Porn-Movie'. The sex scenes (whist infrequent) are not overly graphic and more 'strongly-implied', and nudity is kept to a fairly standard R-Rating (until the last scene). The film thrives upon the ideas of 'Style' and the 'Culture' of the 70's and 80's era. It is an extremely effective character study and period piece, and follows similar 'Rise and Fall' attitude that are boasted by Scorsese's previously mentioned 'Goodfellas' (only Boogie Nights has a much broader spectrum of main characters). Of course, there is the occasional 'Did I need to see that?' scene, mainly surrounding Diggler's descent into drug addiction, and a need to do anything for money. Note: This is not a movie for children. Some of the content does get very heavy in the second half of the film and may seem difficult to watch at times.Wahlberg shines throughout the entire film, and a Best Actor nomination should definitely have been in order. His portrayal of the Self-Destructive porn-star is done with a strong dark sense of confidence and ease. Julianne Moore is the highlight actress of the film, and even though her character 'Amber Waves', plays Dirk's 'love-partner' in of his earlier films, she is old enough to possibly be his mother! A strong sense of love spurts from Amber towards Dirk, and although its never openly expressed, as a viewer its clear that she'd like to see herself as more than 'Mother-figure' towards him. Having said that, she does act as a sort-of 'Mother-figure' to the entire family of pornographer's depicted within this film. Moore should have won the best supporting actress Oscar. And Burt Reynolds, as Jack Horner, is calm, cool and very entertaining. This was Reynolds' comeback performance and is still one of his best.An interesting 'couple' present in the film is Buck (Don Cheadle) and Becky (Nicole Ari Parker). The couple are both actors within Jack's industry but seem to be having problems and arguments from the start of the film. The centrepiece of the film (the transition to the 80's) sees changes within each individual character, and the change between Buck and Becky is a strong one. The party at the centre of the film representing the change over to the 80's, features many unexpected-turns-of events, and shifts the film's tones to a very dark state of mind involving death, drug abuse and desolation.Phillip Seymour Hoffman is great as Gay Cameraman Scotty Jay, William H. Macy plays 'Little Bill' with an excellent state of depression, Luiz Guzman is hilarious as wannabe Pornstar 'Maurice', and the numerous other support cast members are all terrific. Alfred Molina steals the show in an amazing cameo sequence with a drug-deal gone wrong. PTA manages to cram an unbelievable amount of tension into one scene where Wahlberg, C. Reilly and Thomas Jane's insane 'Todd', attempt to pass baking soda off as drugs to make some money. Whilst Molina dances about in his robe, to the tune of a superb soundtrack - ""Sister Christian"", ""Jessie's Girl"", ""99 Luftballoons"" - Fire crackers are set off in the background and Molina's bodyguard tests out the fake drugs. The combination of music, guns and pressure rising is just incredible. Just like the soundtrack, and the movie itself. Its fantastic. <9 out of 10> A little heavy at times, but Paul Thomas Anderson's 'Boogie Nights' is a fantastic character study and amazing film.",Boogie Nights
307,flowergirlz_us,Awful!,1,10 February 2004,"Knowing this was a movie about the porn industry, I was persuaded to watch it by people who saw it and liked it. But I was appalled. This was the grossest movie I have ever seen. For all the bru-ha ha about how wonderful this movie is, I found it to be nothing more than a more glorified porn movie. Shame on Julianne Moore and Mark Wahlberg for participating in this movie. The porno scenes were graphic and disgusting. The end scene was the grossest thing I have ever seen. I know Hollywood is constantly into pushing the envelope but why does it feel it necessary to venture into a genre that already has more movies than we need. Yuck!",Boogie Nights
308,sweet_love,fearless sophomore effort from a very talented writer/director,10,29 July 2002,"One of my absolute favorite movies. Relaxed by the opening circus theme and then blasted by ""Best of My Love,"" no movie has ever grabbed my attention so fast as with Boogie Nights. The opening steady-cam shot is one of the best. The rest of the movie doesn't drop off a bit. The music, the costumes, the shots and the drama are all phenomenal. The humor is great, too, and what makes it truly funny is that most of the time the characters aren't even trying to be funny. Just when it seems like PTA won't be able to top himself, the next scene brings with it something even more brilliant. And of course the ending...What else can I say, I love this movie. Paul Thomas Anderson, you got ""the touch.""",Boogie Nights
309,montecristo42,Low User Rating? (SPOILER ALERT),9,4 January 2005,"This movie is not in the Top 250. Does anybody else have a problem with that? Especially considering that it has been hailed as one of the best films of the 90's, got the nod for Best Picture, and received countless positive critical reviews.On the other hand, I could see how some would love this movie and others would hate it. So it goes with a P.T. Anderson movie. I absolutely hated Magnolia. I found it one of the most ""annoying"" films I ever saw. The Intro annoyed me; the frogs annoyed me; John C. Reilly's character annoyed me.What's great about this film is that it is NOT about pornography. It's a character study; it's a moving story about an unconventional family. None of the porno scenes in the movie are there for the sake of nudity; each serves a specific purpose to advance the plot and reveal something about the characters.And the last shot where the camera follows Burt Reynolds through the house is one of the most memorable, if not one of the best, scenes filmed in recent memory.I can't say enough good things about this movie. But what I would like to see is a thoughtful critique of the movie. I have encountered (on this board) negative reviews that mostly sound like this--this movie was pointless, it was stupid, the characters were weird, etc.Who else thinks this deserves a higher rating?",Boogie Nights
310,ajudki20,One of the Great Films Of Our Time,9,11 January 2015,"Boogie Nights is a parable. It is a cautionary tale, a tale of misfits in a makeshift family and it is a story about an era--how a time and place felt, how wonderful that feeling was, and how it couldn't last.Innocence is a theme and a feel in this film. What could be less innocent than pornography? Boogie Nights admittedly sugar coats the industry enough to make it palatable to the audience enough to keep them focused on greater themes of human nature, family, finding a place in the world, and the idea that everyone has something special, a gift.It is often said by viewers that Dirk is pathetic and his penis is the star. The way he's portrayed though, it is clear he is the perfect storm and his 'gift' is his general sexual appeal mixed with pleasant personality, perfect for the industry at the time. Back then both male and female performers were seen as sexy people, not just meat. Very touching is watching how Walberg plays Eddie/Dirk before he enters the industry. He's beat down by a loveless family and a mean mom who does not believe in him in any way. The archetype of this mom, far from outrageous, is so relevant to reality that it makes most viewers cringe. Eddie/Dirk walks out with nothing but belief in self to find his own off beat version of self worth, and in the process he gets a de facto family.Boogie follows a whole array of characters with varying degrees of closeness. Few films allow one to feel connected to this volume of people. Perhaps, though, it is the odd father/son substitute between Dirk and Jack (Reynolds) that is at the personal center of the film. We don't see it fully until their last hug at the end, but Dirk is no throwaway talent to Jack--he likes Dirk, and thinks he's not a replaceable person or talent. Perhaps he sees himself as a father figure to Dirk.Despite the changes in Dirk throughout the movie, fueled by B-level 'underground' stardom, he remains mostly a likable guy and you can see why the others in the 'porn family' like him so. He only loses control and breaks off (for a time) when his cocaine problem gets the best of him. Even then, he is kind and loyal most of the time. Everything in these late 70's early 80's days was more innocent, even if they aren't in principal. The drug of choice is coke, which while bad, is not as bad as the Crack and Heroin that would take over as the 80's ran on. Even at his lowest low, the infamous scene where he tries to sell fake coke and everything goes wrong, Dirk maintains a level of innocence and goodness that most wouldn't and later eras might not allow for. He makes a decision there, in the famous space-out shot, to go back to Jack and set his life back on track (relatively speaking).A dimension of Boogie Nights that astounds me is the documentary aspect. This involves rigorous recreation of the look, the styles, the fashion and the feel of self indulgent, brightly colored innocence that went so far as to make the porn industry something of a fun, light time.The bare bones production of the porn films is fondly milked for smiles. Andersen doesn't let this fondness for his characters and their era allow them off the hook. He constantly skewers how dumb most of the characters are. He allows us to have a laugh at what was considered classy and fashionable at the time--crazy collars, polyester, platforms, feathered hair. Perhaps the most pathetically funny scene I've ever viewed in a movie is when Dirk and Reed try their hand at music. Dirk sings (off key) a classic piece of 80's cheese from the transformers movie 'The Touch' and a song, right out of the era, Reed and Dirk work on in front of us (actually by John C. Reily and Anderson)'Feel the Heat'. No director has ever gone this far to recreate an era. In addition, we get some scenes from the actual Dirk porn films,(a hilarious foray into Dirk and Reed creating a 'James Bond type character'). Finally, we get to see a documentary about Dirk made by his mother figure, Amber Waves.Boogie gets us to believe in an era, one that has a reputation that's less than flattering. As a bit a parable, bit of a satire and a bit of a legend, it takes a black and white view--as soon as 1980 dawns trouble begins. It works in the mythic universe of this film and what it is trying to do. The changes we see under the small lens of the porn industry in the film help us to understand where we are culturally today, oddly enough. The fact that the 80's are a darkness that comes and can't be dodged, but the characters find ways to deal with it suggests something about human nature and also what our age is all about--putting up with our ever more destructive excess.The film also gives true pathos to mostly stupid people who at times make poor decisions. We are interested in them, and cheer for them. Even when we laugh at them we don't dismiss them. As an audience we relate to them, even as they are ostracized in a untouchable line of work. The film is a legend based on the most odd subject, yet we feel it on a personal level and the human tales are transferable to anyone's life.Few films do this much, show us this many aspects of the human condition, have this much humor, warmth and satire, bring to life an era in such vivid splendor, and are this much fun. Boogie Nights is one of the great films of our time.",Boogie Nights
311,nadrojh,Very Good Drama,9,4 April 2017,"Boogie Nights is a very good drama about the porn industry. Paul Thomas Anderson did a very good job directing and writing. It is very well shot, particularly the costumes and music. It is fast moving the story never lags. It has wonderful script. It uses multiple characters with different personalities and motivations. It shows the industry from many points of view. I like that he didn't hold back on the drug and sex scenes it gave it a raw authentic look. It has excellent performances by Mark Wahlberg, Burt Reynolds, and Julianne Moore. It also has a wonderful supporting cast with wonderful performances by John C Reilly, William H Macy, Don Cheadle, Heather Graham, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and many others. Boogie Nights is not a movie for everyone do to the rough nature and content. However it is one of Paul Thomas Andersons best movies, and one of the best dramas from the 1990's. I have seen it several times over the years, and I enjoy it and get more impressed with it each time. It is very good.",Boogie Nights
312,Lou-5,A great film,10,22 January 1999,"Boogie Nights is a great and startling film which demands multiple viewings. Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson deserves most if not all the credit because of his brilliant script, densely populated with many complex and memorable characters and frequent jabs at the porn industry that are absolutely hilarious. He also has a somewhat unique and hypnotic directing style. The final scene in which Dirk Diggler is rehearsing his lines in front of the mirror is great, and the scene in which Dirk Diggler and his 2 friends try to rip off a millionaire for money is probably the most memorable and mesmerizing scene of any movie in the past 20 years. The ensemble cast is uniformally excellent. Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, and Don Cheadle are absolutely perfect. One of the best movies of the 90's. In my opinion, 2nd only to Fargo.",Boogie Nights
313,animalmother78,Forget Titanic! This is the Best Picture of '97!,10,29 October 2000,"Paul Thomas Anderson's Boogie Nights is my second favorite film of all time. It is just such a cool and great movie that I can't help but watch it all the time!I first saw it a year ago last summer. I recorded it because I knew it was gonna be cool. And sure enough, I got a great film!I hate when people say, ""Oh, Boogie Nights is that movie about porn that everyone's talking about."" Sure, Boogie Nights is about porn, but it is not a porno itself. It follows a colorful group of porn makers: the stars (Dirk Diggler, Reed Rothchild, Amber Waves, Jessie St. Vincent, e.t.c) and the filmmakers (Jack Horner, Little Bill, Kurt) through six very colorful years: '77 to '83. There we see their heyday when an unknown teen, Eddie (Mark Whalberg) is transformed into Dirk Diggler. Then we see their fall (Dirk is almost replaced by his director, Jack [Burt Reynolds]). I would tell you more, but...well, you just have to see it for yourself.This is my and my best friend, Tony's favorite film. We've both seen it a million times and know it by heart: from ""Jackie, Jack, Jack"" to ""I'm a star of a star of a star"".With colorful characters like Rollergirl (sexy Heather Graham), Dirk Diggler, Rahad Jackson, e.t.c and great performances from Graham, Reynolds (I'm shocked), Whalberg, Moore, and Macy added to writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's pure artwork, forget Titanic!

A comedy-drama about the porn business in the 60's, 70's and 80's. Well at least it's an original topic. What I really liked about the movie is the cult way it is filmed. Not too much steadycam, keep it a bit shaky. It is also interesting to see what goes on around the 'actors' in a porn movie. I especially liked the way Burt Reynolds played a porn director, who wants to make a porn movie with storyline, good acting and style(not the usual garbage). The movie has some strange twists, but that comes with the genre I guess. I think it's a must see!",Boogie Nights
315,robert_haag,The Music Makes the Movie,9,30 January 2002,Last night I rented the DVD of Boogie Nights. I have seen the movie before but this time I think I was struck by the music. If you notice the majority of the music in the movie was popular between 1977 and 1980 and most were one hit wonders.  I think the movie has a strong appeal to me because the fact that in the years 1977 to 1980 were my youth. No I was not into pornography except for a reading of Penthouse once in a while but Boogie Nights has an un canny ability to reflect the attitudes and behaviors of this time. All in all an excellent movie!,Boogie Nights
316,ColeMan88,One of the Greatest All-Around Films,10,28 July 2014,"'Boogie Nights' is centered around seventeen year old Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) who leaves home to pursue a career in the porn industry under the alias Dirk Diggler. This film follows Dirk and an all-star cast in exposing their lives within the porn industry from the 1980's to 1970's. 'Boogie Nights' is written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, best known for his work in 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia'. The cast in this film was absolutely perfect. In most cases with an all-star cast, you would expect a film to be sloppy and made just for the money, but the entire cast was flawless. When you can cast a film full of amazing actors and get them all to mesh together and work so well, you know you have a great film. Mark Wahlberg obviously steals the show as Dirk Diggler. Although it is really hard to pin point one actor in the film because they were all just so great. It was very intriguing to watch the entire cast grown throughout the film. One thing that really made this movie special was, you cared for all the characters. Through their falls and triumphs, you are there for it all and you really pull for them to succeed. One thing that really surprised me was the cinematography in this film. Every scene was shot perfectly and is so pleasing to the eye. Cinematography as well as the score in this film were done just right. Score matched perfectly for the situations and set the tone for events taking place. Editing was done right, served its purpose. Costume design was very well done to. Portrayed the 70's and 80's perfectly. It is real hard to get all these things right in a film, so a tip of the hat to all cast and crew.'Boogie Nights' received 3 Academy Award nominations. One nomination for the role of Burt Reynolds supporting role as Jack Horner. Reynolds does an outstanding job with his role and is so powerful on screen. Another nomination came to Julianne Moore in her supporting role as Amber Waves. Whenever Moore is on screen she is mesmerizing. She plays her role perfectly and it is one of the greatest in her career. The final nomination came to Paul Thomas Anderson for Best Writing/Screenplay. I can not praise Anderson enough. The writing in this movie is great, everything was just gold. Great job by Anderson on directing and writing this film. I must say I am surprised Wahlberg did not get a nomination and I am highly surprised that this film did not win a single Academy Award.'Boogie Nights' is a very surprising film that all movie watchers should see at some point in their life. The way this all-star cast works together is astonishing and a rarity. Every aspect of the film, acting, cinematography, score, you name it, was perfect. People skeptical about viewing this film thinking it is all about porn should know one thing. This is not a porno. This film follows the lives of many individuals through the 70's and 80's. Sure a bulk of the movie is about the porn industry, but there is not a mass amount of porn in the actual movie. Ultimately, 'Boogie Nights' will leave you feeling many things. Laughs, depression, happiness, shock but most of all; satisfaction.'Boogie Nights' receives a perfect 10/10 from me!",Boogie Nights

318,d858thompson,A fascinating film with the best Burt Reynolds role ever,10,21 February 2005,"This is really an outstanding movie. I saw this film before I stopped watching ""R"" rated films. This film has so many layers and so much texture and so many amazing things about it that you can watch it over and over and over again and see amazing, new things each time. The scenes are so beautifully developed that you forget you are watching a movie about pornography. What I like about this film is that it takes it's own sweet time to develop a scene. Sequences that are like a dance almost because they work so well together. Mark Wahlberg gives a great performance, one that really should have been an Oscar contender. You know who really deserved a nomination, right along with Burt Reynolds? Robert Ridgely as the Colonel. He was awesome. Does anyone else agree with that? Also, the biggest snub in Oscar history. Why didn't he win? What was up with that? I can't even think of who was nominated that year but he was awesome! Phillip Seymour Hoffman? Great as well. William H. Macy? Alfred Molina? Amazing. Another thing in this film I really like is the music. It fits the story so well - anyway - it's a great film.",Boogie Nights
319,cbddbc,"Could this movie be more stereotypical? Well, no, it couldn't...",4,29 April 2017,"PTA's Magnolia is one of my favorite movies so I naturally watched Boogie Nights after seeing Magnolia. Boogie Nights is a sex-negative morality play that teaches, like a Catholic nun, that sex is bad. PTA doesn't even include a monogamous married couple to portray the many blessings that are rained down upon a monogamous marriage between a man and a woman. But you'll quickly see that seems to be one of the takeaways from the conclusion of the film - and the more sexually active the person, the more likely that they will not be able to continue relationships with their biological families.Stereotyping porn actors is just weak. The two youngest, Dirk (Wahlberg) and Rollergirl (Graham) are high school dropouts and not very bright. No one is very bright in the movie with the exception, maybe, of Reynolds' Jack Horner character but even he's out of touch with good taste as he naively calls one of his porn flicks a 'real movie' that will preserve his memory.The first lesson we learn is that a marriage that is not monogamous can only end in murder-suicide. Little Bill (Macy - does the little moniker mean that he has a small organ unlike those in the porn films?) is shamed by his sexually active wife (played by real-life porn star Nina Hartley - a pro-porn defender and long involved with a man and another woman in an alternative relationship) so he naturally murders his wife and her lover and then commits suicide. Because, you know, that's what cuckolds do, right? Little Bill is involved in the porn industry and although Hartley is never seen as an actress in Horner's films, she's a serial adulteress and she gets her just reward.Dirk learns his lesson when he thinks that his success is a result of his smarts as much as his organ size just when his organ is failing him because of drug use. He separates from Horner, taking a couple of his buddies with him but they leave him before he falls upon hard times. Hard times, we're to assume, means being picked up by men who want to watch him handle his organ as they handle their own. We just have to assume this as the only scene that indicates some experience in these matters is a single scene in which he is pummeled by guys in trucks who are just out for a night of gay bashing. Lesson? You might be gifted with a large organ but you'll never be smart.Third and final lesson. This one is tricky - even those who are successful outside of the porn industry (by luck, theft, whatever) have been forever marked by their association and the artificial families that they have created are the only ones that they can depend upon. In the end they are all united under Jack Horner's wing to continue in the porn industry.It's been 20 years since Boogie Nights' release. Pornography on the internet has become almost respectable with the 'amateur' streaming clips being popular and men by the millions having (to me, completely twisted) cuckold fantasies. Twenty years on anyone can be a porn star and hold a PhD in sociology. The aforementioned Nina Hartley began her porn career in 1984 and graduated from nursing school in 1985. In the little research that I've done it simply doesn't seem that the nascent porn film industry was filled with stupid high school drop-outs. Revisiting some of the most successful films of the time you may find more eroticism than in the 10-20 minute videos of today. And you might alternately find that there are very well educated men and women actually enjoying non-monogamous and non-traditional sex.Boogie Nights just doesn't stand up to scrutiny or scholarship. It doesn't even present much in the way of the times when people had public hair.One final note. The cuckold fantasy is one of those 'be careful what you wish for' fantasies. A real woman has fantasies of her own and - surprise! - they may not include you. Your fantasy may be just what she needs to have relations with another guy... as 10 other guys watch. Encourage a woman's lesbian fantasies and she might leave you for another woman. Each person is sexually unique - like a fingerprint - and before becoming involved with anyone in a sexual relationship you need to know a few things up front. Even if the person is fulfilling your sex with a stranger fantasy you need to know a few things. You won't learn much about sex watching Boogie Nights. The only history that you may learn is that when porn came out of the film theaters and onto home video, there was an explosion in sales and proliferation in product. Did the transition mean less artistic products? I don't think so... not every film of the time was a 'Behind the Green Door.'",Boogie Nights

A great script presented with great acting performances. (Burt Reynolds gives the performance of his life.  Robin Williams has Burt's Oscar on his mantle.)  A tremendous character study in the vein of Robert Altman.  Great music too.",Boogie Nights
321,FilmFanatic09,Boogie Nights,8,7 December 2006,"""Boogie Nights"" is one of those films which can be classified a multitude of ways. It can easily be viewed as period piece, a character study, or a social commentary, among other things. Anyway you look at it, it proves to be an effective piece of film-making. A key to this success is the performance of Mark Wahlberg. Watching him make the transformation for clean-cut kid Eddie Adams to porn superstar Dirk Diggler is what keeps the audience invested in the story being told. In the first half of the film, when it's the most crucial, Wahlberg is able to maintain such innocence and charisma and yet seems instantly at home in the new decadent world his character finds himself in. These scenes work greatly to the film's advantage because they are played with such earnestness. Seeing Eddie Adams embark on his new career, we might as well be watching Peggy Sawyer (of ""42nd Street"") being told she's headed to Broadway. The whole thing just feels so unexpectedly clean, which in turn may be something of a setup for the much darker moments to come.Admittedly, the rise (in the late 70s) and fall (in the early 80s) of the pornography industry is an area of history we don't learn about in school. But it is a legitimate topic of interest, nonetheless. While it certainly contains humor and a plethora of colorful characters, ""Boogie Nights"" takes itself seriously. Aside from sex as a business, issues such as race relations, homophobia, and drug abuse, prove vital to the story it is telling. Another overriding theme of the film is the classic notion of fame as a double-edged sword. One heart wrenching plot line involves a porn actress, gently portrayed by the always wonderful Julianne Moore, who is engaged in a custody battle with her estranged husband over their children. The irony here is that throughout the film we have seen how naturally she mothers those around her, and yet she is ultimately deemed unfit to be a mother to her own children. I'm not saying that decision is wrong, but it isn't easy to watch as she's forced to accept it either. If in fact porn can ever be inspiring, it is something of an inspiration to see the concern the filmmakers within this film put upon themselves for producing a product they can be proud of. They strive to create movies their audiences will appreciate for reasons beyond the sex. We witness their creative process behind James Bond's porno counterpart, Brock Landers, from brainstorming through production. We see the adult industry's equivalent of the Academy Awards ceremony. It is only when we remind ourselves that these people are pornographers does any of this seem the least bit perverse. I strongly feel that this film is in no way trying to glamorize porn. (The ultimate fates of some of its characters are proof enough of that.) I do, however, feel that sometimes we are too quick to demonize based on preconceived notions. The characters we meet here are all consenting adults, engaged in a lucrative business. True, they are flirting with a myriad of dangers. But this film does them a great justice. It allows us to understand the psychology at work behind the choices they make. And it does us a justice too. It lets us choose whether or not we condemn them for it.",Boogie Nights
322,Biglebowski1,A Fitting Tribute to Film-making,10,15 May 2009,"A sprawling tribute to film-making, Boogie Nights is about far more than pornography, and the process of making it. P.T. Anderson's script manages to juggle various story lines and turn them into one cohesive film. His command of such a large film is astonishing, as it never feels as if he loses control over the plot or characters. This is achieved largely through the use of a family dynamic among the characters, giving them a connection strong enough to hold their plot lines together. An all-star cast manages to make every character compelling enough to justify their own film, and by the end you want to spend more time with these characters. The film does manage to run into some problems in the final act, when things start to feel a little rushed and Paul Anderson's boundless energy is misused. Overall, Boogie Nights marked the emergence of the most talented filmmaker working today, and remains a classic in its own regard.",Boogie Nights
323,limoosine,Great film,8,8 October 2018,Cult classic! Wahlberg does an amazing job. PTA is an awesome director. Julianne Moore is still hot! This film is just great fun to watch with some superb acting all around.,Boogie Nights

There's only one reason why this film is really good. It's honest. Totally honest. It shows people at their best and at their worst. But it shows people. Real people. Or as real as you can get in a film. It never overdoes the good or the bad sides. it's just honest and real. Just make sure you don't watch it with some small-minded fool who refuses to see that and just sees porn actors, gay people (""again those gays"" - this IS a quote) and others snort coke. Keep an open mind and enjoy this.",Boogie Nights
325,oreo77277,Simply fantastic!,10,10 September 2001,"I just watched Boogie Nights an hour ago. It came on FX and being Mark Wahlberg fan I am I thought I would give it a ty.  I was completely pleased with this movie!It starts off in the late 70' with Eddie Adams (wahlberg), a niave teen who dream of fame.  He is having trouble at home.  He just can't seem to comunicate with his parents.  Eddie works at a nightclub a long way rom his home so that he can just get away.  It does not take long for adult film maker Jack Hornes to realize that Eddie was born with an abnormaly large penis, 13 inches to be exact.  Jack introduces Eddie to fellow porn stars. That night when Eddie gets home late he has a very big argue with his mother.  Eddie leaves his family behind and goes to live with Jack at his large house.Now Jack wants Eddie to be a star in hs porn films and Eddie gladly takes a role.  But under his new adult movie name, Dirk Diggler.  Dirk get's very popular in the industry and even wins a few Adult Movie Awards!  But success comes too soon for him and soon he is being replaced.  Dirk thinks he is the number one star in the porn buisness and reassures himsef by sayig ""I'm a star I'm a big bright shining star"".  But it doesn't help and when he blows up in Jack' face for little reasons (wich was an oscar-worthy performance) hes fired and lives a life of drugs.The movie is spectacular!  Mark proves himslef to be an amazing actor as do the rest of the cast.  Rollergirl, played by Heather Grahm happens to be one of my favorite charactors.  She gave her role spunk and personality, but did not overde it.  Amber Waves, played by Julieanne Moore, was also fantastic, she was mother to al those who needed it, including Dirk.  Some scenes I thoguht they even had a romantic relationship, but I may have been wrong.This movie is most certainly worth my time.  In fact bcause I missed a few important nudity scenes, like the end (if you have seenit you'l understand)because it came on a cable channel so they bleeped it out, think I'll go rent it so I can get the full enjoyment.In all this movie was robbed out of an oscar nomination as was Mark.  I give it 10/10 and two thumbs up!  I recall Entertainment Weekly raving it the years best movie for 1997.  Not Titanic.  It gave somthing fresh and new and different form most movies I se today.  I wish they made more like it.  Go see it!  It's amazing!",Boogie Nights
326,mendaliv,"More ""feelgood"" or ""coming of age"" than porno-type film",10,1 December 2003,"The first time I saw this film, I didn't really watch it deeply. All I saw was a story of sex, drugs, and unusual people.However, I finally saw it again last year, and I fell in love with it. This film, in some sense, follows the same very basic story as Hard Eight, Magnolia, and Punch-Drunk Love:Person (or people) begins in normal life, but something unusual happens triggering either a change, or at least deviation from normal behavior. There is this buildup of good events; it looks like things could only get better and better, but there is something obviously wrong going on. Something bad happens, and then begins the descent into hell. But, suddenly, there is an event that causes things to suddenly become perfect. And the hero goes back to life, but not as it was; he still has his experiences.Dirk Diggler's speech-to-the-mirror in the end really seals this sort of plot pattern in the end. It also, in my opinion, cements in a coming-of-age theme.Look beyond the surface of pornography, sex, etc. Realize that these characters (if they were real) are people, each with their own oddities, dreams, and soforth.",Boogie Nights
327,ironlion106,A Near Perfect Film by a Near Perfect Filmmaker,10,3 March 2016,"Boogie Nights is one of those films that people say will be a ""classic"" in about twenty years or so. It is one of the most highly regarded films of the 90's as well as being, arguably, Mark Wahlberg's best film. So what, exactly, is so great about this 1997 film set in the 1970's and 1980's porn industry?Well, for one thing, it is beautifully written and directed. Paul Thomas Anderson's writing is perfect because it hits just the right note at just the right time. Every character has an equal amount of depth (although the film focuses on just one), and it is interesting to watch them interact with each other. The film is practically unequaled in how it makes the audience become invested in its characters. And Anderson's long takes and tracking shots help each actor to truly step into their roles, making for a truly personal film.Boogie Nights is an essential film for anyone who loves the art form or is interested in the art of film directing or writing, and I would recommend it to anyone. That is; as long as they don't mind a little vulgar dialogue and content. It is the porn industry, after all.",Boogie Nights
328,Tonyboy,"This film took 152 minutes of my life away, and I want them back!",5,10 August 2002,"**MINOR SPOILER**Boogie Nights was perhaps one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.I found that the story began in a promising manner, but I quickly lost interest after realizing that the entire story was simply a giant cliche: actor gets discovered, actor makes it big, and actor falls from glory. Anderson tries to conceal his formulaic fable by adding in a few gimmicks: well-known actors, nostalgic 70s music, a few entertaining scenes, his trademark long-shot, etc...Simply put, I think the story lacked depth. The open-ended nature of the story provided no global goal for any of the characters to achieve, and the last hour of the film felt unterminable.Then again, as I read over the other comments, I see that perhaps this is one of those ""love / hate"" movies. In any case, if you really must see it, I advise you to rent Boogie Nights along with another movie, and if you find yourself thinking ""Where is this going?"" early in the story, you can start watching your second movie and answer ""Back to the store"".",Boogie Nights
329,cpurvis,Boogy This,1,18 December 2004,"Some topics don't really need movies made about them--diarrhea and porno movies are two that come to mind. Porno movies are bad enough in that they capitalize on a prurient fascination with copulation. Plots are optional. Semi-porno movies purporting to be *about* porno movies are nothing more than the movie companies trying to cash in on the porno business without tarnishing their name.I like Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds, but I liked them all better prior to seeing this disgusting mess. Not that they didn't act well; it's just that this is a movie which the world would be a better place had it never been made. I will give credit to Moore, Reynolds and especially Wahlberg for taking roles that could lead to everlasting embarrassment. Maybe they were broke, I don't know. That would make more sense than the notion that they saw artistic merit in this script.Maybe the sequel will be Showgirls Boogy Knights?I rated this a 1 only because there was no zero available.",Boogie Nights
330,bettywhait06,another superb effort from PTA,8,3 October 2012,"Boogie Nights is a powerful, well constructed tale of human emotions and misery that just happens to be set in the porn industry. Just like Paul Thomas Anderson's other well known movie Magnolia, he proves once again with this film that his work has a very unique, trademark feel to it - all the more impressive when there are definite nods to the films of Scorcese for example. PTAs films are full of human life - just like Magnolia, here he creates a spectrum of characters who are all likable and real, and the strength of their creation is what sees pretty much faultless performances from the entire ensemble cast. But he is not afraid to show us the highs and lows of each character, and this is what engages the audience. Mark Wahlberg is very good as Dirk Diggler, and Julieanne Moore exceptional as the maternal figure fascinated by him. But Burt Reynolds as the unofficial father figure of the cast was both a delight and a surprise, and John C. Reilly also sizzled in every scene. There is some obvious symbolism - when Wahlberg and friends travel to Alfred Molina's apartment to rip him off in a drug deal, his padlocked gates close behind them as they enter his house - clearly a reference to the gates of hell. And the overwhelming impression of the concluding scenes, when Reynolds wanders around his vast porn-funded house checking in on all the hangers on and cast members he has assembled over the years - but with a warm sense of fatherly love - was very poignant and clever. It's impossible not to like the cast - and although there are some very shocking scenes that lack huge subtlety, this is film making at its best and deserves a lot of recognition.",Boogie Nights
331,Udo,Terrible waste of time!,1,22 September 1999,"Utter garbage! I had high hopes for this movie, and it certainly sounded like it was right up my alley. But alas it is definitely one of the worst I've seen! What a pointless, plodding exercise in self indulgence! How could this be critically acclaimed and Showgirls be lambasted as one of the worst films ever? They are frighteningly similar in a lot of ways, and I think Showgirls was a lot more entertaining. Marky Mark is no more of an actor then Elizabeth Berkely. The second half of the movie is just a long, pointless Tarantino rip-off that is even harder to watch then 2 Days In The Valley. When I think of this movie's success, all I can think about is the story about the Emperor's New Clothes. Once the ball starts rolling with critics ranting and raving about it, most people are already convinced they are going to love it. If they don't then they don't ""get it"". Rubbish! The same goes for the Blair Witch Project. I am a big horror fan, but hated that. So people tell me I am either a blood and guts addict, or I have no imagination. Huh? It simply wasn't scary, it was a bloated boring version of MTV's Real World getting lost in the woods. Boogie Nights is chock full of loathable characters doing stupid things, what a waste of time!

332,Slut,C'est Magnifique,10,13 February 1999,"""Boogie Nights"" is an exhilarating, intriguing, well written and beautifully acted piece of cinema.  It gets my vote for the best movie of '97 (right behind ""Afterglow"").  Mr. Anderson is obviously the best new director/writer to emerge in recent years, and I am very anxious to see his upcoming films. This film was robbed of Oscars for its acting, writing and directing but it just goes to show how political and narrow-minded the Oscars and its voters are.  The best performance of the film was Julianne Moore's Amber Waves (at least she was nominated).  Her performance was funny, touching and particularly heart-wrenching at moments.  I can't believe Kim Basinger got the Oscar, when her performance showed no range or versatility. But anyway, don't listen to the Academy.  Listen to the critics.  Please see this wonderful film.",Boogie Nights

I may be partial, as I remember the time period very well. Most people weren't porn actors, but a whole lot of drugs were used, and bad clothes worn by folks who would deny it today. Burt Reynolds was a surprise, forgoing all his annoying ticks. The whole casts is great- Heather Graham is maybe the only one out of her depth. See it- it isn't just a ""dirty"" movie.",Boogie Nights
334,Karen-34-2,An amazing epic of a most unlikely group of individuals...,10,31 January 1999,"P.T. Anderson has created an incredible film about the rise and fall of an extended family of porn stars, and the individuals who supported them financially, during the late 70s-early 80s. During this time period, adult film-maker Jack Horner (played by Burt Reynolds in a Golden Globe winning performance) had a vision that his films could go ""legitimate"" in the mainstream film industry-- that is, be seen as more than pornography but as actual works of art. Many critics dismissed this film as pornography masquerading as bona fide movie-making.  Those who sat through the film, however, met a fascinating, albeit naive, group of characters. In a heart-breaking (and Oscar-nominated) performance, we meet Julianne Moore's beautiful ""Amber Waves"", an actress who seemingly has everything she desires but aches for the love of the son she has lost because of her chosen career path.  Amber readily channels this displaced love on her self-made family of actors, including Mark Wahlberg's ""Dirk Diggler"" and Heather Graham's ""Rollergirl"", who go through the motions of sex on screen but have no understanding of true love or intimacy due to prior rejection of family and/or society in general.Other note-worthy performances include Philip Seymour Hoffman's ""Scotty"", who spends the film smitten with and completely devoted to Dirk in a love that is painfully unrequited.  Also interesting are Don Cheadle's ""Buck"", the actor with loftier ambitions of owning a stereo store, and William H. Macy's ""Little Bill"", who is continually cuckolded by a wife who enjoys putting on sex shows with any willing man in public. This drama is played out with a wonderful soundtrack that revisits the glory days of disco and the ""one-hit wonder"" gems that peppered the early 80s. This was certainly one of the best films of 1997.",Boogie Nights
335,Serge-18,Terrible,1,16 January 1999,This movie is total garbage. The story is horrible. It changes and changes and gets worse each time. The acting is also horrible. I guess it's hard to act with such a lousy script. This movie is a total waste of time and film.,Boogie Nights

Eddie Adams(Mark Wahlberg) has one belief he holds to heart:               ""Everyone has one special thing.""
His special thing is his stamina for copulation accredited to his thirteen inch member. When he uses these two talents correctly, he gets fame, money, power and the women. But when he mistreats his God-given gift by destroying his body doing coke, he ends up on the streets showing his member to perverts who could have a looksie for a five or an ejaculation for a ten.mark Wahlberg's character is not the only one in ""Boogie Nights"" to go through this revelation. His entourage goes through the same type of turmoils he himself goes through.

337,flembot,"Cliched, but it works!",9,29 February 2000,"Boogie Nights uses the old Hollywood stardom and fall from grace cliches to gets its point across except taking place in the porn film world. We get the first cliche' with Eddie Adams(Mark Wahlberg)a suburbian boy that dreams of one day being a star eventhough he really doesnt know what he would be good for.The Second cliche-the  discovery. Where as Lana Turner was discovered when she was drinking soda at at pharmacy counter minding her own, Eddie Adams was discovered working at a nightclub but it wasn't Jack Horner that set his eyes on Eddie, Eddie set his eyes on him.Eddie beckoned Jack to approach him to propose a price for viewing his large member. And how lucky he was that the person Eddie picked to do so was a porno film director.In the interim. Many stories abound as to where some start such as Marilyn Monroe,Lana Turner and such, had to give sexual favors to people who promised them a chance at stardom. Enter Eddie Adams. He knew what he was getting to and relished the thought that he would be having sex before and behind the camera to make his star rise.The fourth cliche-stardom rising. This is the only instance where Eddie Adams, now as Dirk Diggler, has something in common with main stream stars- time to live in luxury. Dirk moves into his own house and decorates it with the best linens on his bed and a shiny red Corvette in his garage.The fifth cliche-Swelled up head. Like mainstream stars, Dirk Diggler gets a swollen head. He tells the man that discovered him, a legend in the porn industry, that he would be nothing if it wasnt for his great ""big dick."" He alienates his friends and goes into a depression. He abuses drugs and sells showings of his big member to street perverts.The last cliche- the comeback. Most stars never get a chance to be famous again. Mamie van Doren ended up doing ""nudie"" films when her star fell. In thsi instance Dirk Diggler(Eddie Adams) went back to where he became famous-in  porno films.
Boogie Nights takes the old Hollywood ""rise and fall of its stars"" cliches except uses the porn film industry as its source. This movie does to this genre what Rocky and the Karate Kid did to all sports cliched film. There can never be another movie like Boogie Nights that deals with the rise and fall of a star-porno or main stream. Boogie Nights is cliched but it works and it should never be tried again. PT Anderson did it once and did it well.",Boogie Nights

Well this movie captured all off this and even added a few things to spice things up. Dirk Diggler's life was crazy, beginning with being a fresh face in a fresh industry. Well as the 70's ended and the 80's began, he suddenly got a big head to match his big ""tool"". He got really into drugs and even started prostituting himself. This movie is so impressive because it is so true! This is exactly what happened to porn actors of the 70's and 80's. Just take John Holmes for example. His life was like a carbon copy of Dirk Diggler's life. Start off good, do dope, start prostituting yourself, get wrapped up in murder, and have a good career again. It really is great when they switch to VHS like many porn companies did during the early 80's. I thought that was a very subtle but important part of the ever-changing porn industry.

I just gave up on it after the bashing scene--brought back memories of Matthew Shepard, who was similarly ""jacked"" by gay men pretending to be straight men pretending to be gay men.The car ride with Jack Horner and Rollergirl encapsulated all of the hopefulness, disrespect, and ultimate behind-the-scenes ugliness that much porn has engendered.

Burt Reynolds plays Jack Horner, the nice pornography man who dreams of making movie that people can enjoy as a story as well as just whack off to. Mark Wahlberg was unwatchable as Dirk Diggler, the Man with the Golden Schlong. Although it has its moments, like poor old William H.

This movie shows what the business was like in the 70s and it shows a star go through his rise to fame to his downfall in the 80s. Every one gives a great performance including a early role for Marky Mark himself. The writing is also a great thing in this movie with a little bit of comedy sprinkled in. Every character is interesting from Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, and Don Cheadle. If your a P.T. Anderson fan then I don't see why someone would dislike this, he carry's over a handful of the cast that was in Hard Eight and uses a lot from this film to Magnolia and so on. Every aspect about this movie I think is great from it really feeling like the 70s time period from the costume and set design to the really good soundtrack that sounds like one Tarantino would put together.

It was not just about the porn industry like people that have not seen the movie think. It was about the people that make these movies and about the struggles and good times they saw during this drug infested era. The film also had the best ensemble cast since Short Cuts. They all did a fabulous job of making their characters come to life. The only problem with the film is in the later half Dirk Diggler is suddenly broke and selling fake cocaine to make money. The film did not explain how a big porn star like Dirk Diggler lost all his cash in that short amount of time.  Other than that the film is almost flawless.

The story by Anderson is amazing and is held together by his great directing job, and outstanding acting by the entire cast and is topped off by a great score that takes you back to the 70s.

It didn't fit; I didn't care about most of the characters and it bored me after the first hour.

You see the exploits of a down and out teenager has he struggles his way through his life and gets a opportunity to make it big as a porn star which he accepts without hesitation.From there the diggler mania catches on and the artistic treatment of the story makes it watchable.The supporting cast is pretty good and so is the use of the 1980's style camera-work.But the soul of the movie lies with dirk and his journey to which the director gives full support and his vision.It might be termed as a off track but watch it and be prepared to be a fan of Mark Wahlberg.

350,akingy90,A very colourful film...,9,6 October 2011,"Set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Boogie Nights is centred on Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), a young man who is discovered by a porn director (Jack Horner, played by Burt Reynolds) and becomes a star in the adult film industry. The film follows the lives of Eddie (who soon adopts the screen name Dirk Diggler) and his fellow colleagues, as well as Jack's crew members.I had high expectations when I sat down to watch Boogie Nights, and I wasn't disappointed.Wahlberg delivers a stand-out performance as Dirk, whose most moving scenes see him slip into cocaine addiction, which gives him erection problems and causes him to lash out at his friends.Other memorable characters include Amber (Julianne Moore), whose involvement in the porn industry has cost her contact with her son, and Little Bill (William H. Macy), who is driven to commit murder-suicide as a result of his wife's serial (and extremely public) adultery.On a side note, the soundtrack is fantastic.",Boogie Nights
351,talkbaktalk,Hollywood as Porn,9,22 June 2018,"A first film in Paul Thomas Anderson's California Suite (all taking place in California). It shows that the director has studied Scorsese carefully: long tracking shots, period disco music, but the characters seem to come with the laid-back California lifestyle. More than that if conveys the mentality of the era.What could be more interesting than a film about the porn industry; but it's really about the film industry, with it's star behavior, drugs, bored, behind the camera people going through the motions and its share of misfits hoping for a bit of glamour. Its a comedy until toward the end it isn't, and the butchers bill comes for people who play meat on camera.The film skillfully evokes an era and a time (starting with the mid-seventies) when making porn was almost a family affair, and those who came to Hollywood seeking their fortunes find that paying the bills leads them to the productions of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds in his best role) a pornographer. It'd a transitional period in which the standard sex scene are still played, not the hard core stuff that goes nowadays.One of the best scenes shows Jack Horner's girlfriend, a porn performer, gets it on with a boy she really wants to make love to, and does it on camera right before Horner, who thinks it's a wonderful 'performance'.Boogie Nights also interweaves the lives of dozens of characters, who try to communicate things they can't articulate, so that even the most obvious double-entendre is taken seriously. They're way over their heads, playing with fire, and don't know it.Unless your older, you won't remember eight-track tape, HI-FI systems, bell bottoms, disco, Corvettes as status symbols, coke on everyone's coffee tables, or a dozen other period artifacts.I think the film is great if you've not seen it before. I tried watching it a second time and fount it a bit confining, as almost all the action takes place at Jack Horner's home or a disco named 'Boogie Nights'. The few scenes that don't seem shoehorned in, and don't work.If the acting seems bad, remember that the film wants the characters to be stupid... like the characters in a porn movie. The length of the film (you won't be bored) promises larger ideas than the film finally delivers, and that is that. No big message, and maybe that's a good thing.I recommend it highly if you haven't seen it. Just remember this is deeply ironic and humorous film - don't take anything seriously and you'll have a good time.",Boogie Nights

The opening sequence is among the best in recent years as the mood is built with simple orchestral music, which is rather misleading. The film's title flashes, and with a bang, we transported to a hip-hopping disco scene! The opening single camera shot (which introduces the audience to each of the principle characters) is brilliant! As the story develops, we see them in their every day lives, as well as some precarious or adverse situations. The film is laced with excellent wit and humor. The costumes and makeup are very accurately done. The film editing is fantastic. The soundtrack is to die for. ""Boogie Nights"" makes for a great time.Bottom line: Excellent casting and period clothing, music, and properties make this a charming film... yes, I said ""charming.""",Boogie Nights
359,homerthefreak-786-658831,6.5/10,7,28 June 2016,"This film had some really great scenes, especially towards the end, but there wasn't really much of a story. There was some character development, although it wasn't very noticeable in my opinion. Not all movies need to have a story, but I feel like this one could have benefited from a bit of a more permanent arc. It's kind of hard for me to explain without spoiling it so I'm going to stop avoiding spoilers from here on out with this review.All I was trying to get across is that after Dirk hits it big and has a falling out with his producer, that's where the real conflict of the story starts. Every good story has a conflict, that's Writing 101. The problem for me is when at the end of the film, all that Dirk needs to do is say sorry and everyone lives ""happily ever after"". Also, the scene where Don Cheadle's character witnesses the robbery at the bakery and comes across all that cash; that's a really great scene. The problem is that it was pretty much just dumb luck and all it did for the story was give the character a free pass towards a happy ending with everyone else.

360,lilyplusplus,OK; not as good as I expected,5,30 March 2015,"Ever since I heard what this movie was about, I thought the topic interesting. I have never before watched a movie based on exploring the more human side of the porn industry (except ""The House Bunny,"" but that is beside the point), so I decided to check it out. Overall, I think the movie was OK – worth a check out but not something I will want to come back to. The acting was quite good, with some current big-name actors that were just starting out at the time. For me, the biggest problem was the length of the film; I thought it was far too long and I even had to split it into two parts, in order to finish it. To be completely honest, I do not know exactly why I did not enjoy it – it was a good movie but I don't have any desire to see it again. In fact, I found it rather boring. If you're on the fence, I would say that you should try it out but not set your expectations too high.Final word: Eh. Date watched: Sometime during Spring Break. Rating: 5 | 10",Boogie Nights
361,Dirk-15,An episode of the sex industry in the 70's,8,25 November 2000,"Theme: The success and failure of porn star Dirk Diggler in the 70's and 80's.Why you should see it: If you wonder how your life could be if you used your talent for sex instead of developing others, this is the movie you should watch. (What's your talent? Good at math?) It is exciting to see how ,somewhere, there is a whole world of happiness and misery surrounding the making of porn movies. The 70's atmosphere is simply great! The parties, the music, the drugs, the clothes and the people, they're all there. A lot of scenes have outstanding acting performances(see below)and some are very sexy. Also you will find many interesting little characters surrounding the main players.Why not: The movie is pretty long and not all scenes are acted that well. The 70's theme you've probably already seen a lot of times. The characters in the movie are (on purpose) mostly pretty simple minded, so don't expect many interesting thoughts.
Actors/actresses: In most scenes Mark Wahlberg does an excellent job playing Dirk Diggler that pursues a career as porn star trying to find some affection that he didn't even get from his own mom. He desperately wants to be popular. When the story gets more dramatic he's at his best. Heather Graham has the easy part of just being a sexy Rollergirl, which isn't hard to screw up. It probably worked out well for her career, as a lot of sexy roles do for actresses. Burt Reynolds is wonderful in his character of the director of the movies and being the patron of the ""porn-family"". He looks like Sean Connery and secretly you would like to be in his little porn world for a couple of days too. Julianne Moore completes this world. She brilliant in the short scene about the custody of her child. And ,of course,very sexy as the woman de la famille and performing porn star. Notice Philipp Seymour Hoffman's role as the crew member who's secretly in love with Dirk Diggler.Other observations: The story of Boogie Nights is like that of Casino or Goodfellas, but then for the sex industry.Conclusion: As I said, the 70's setting and the many small scenes that characterize this period are simply great! With often wonderful acting. (8)",Boogie Nights
362,Jar Jar-2,Incredible storytelling,10,16 September 1999,"Paul Thomas Anderson has truly created a masterpiece. Boogie Nights is, oddly enough, just as poignant as it is funny. And that's the movie's chief strength -- the story, which is essentially about family, showcases a wide range of themes that covers everything from success and frustration to failure and redemption.      The film benefits from a great cast with winning performances from all involved. Mark Wahlberg gives an especially charismatic and commanding turn as the movie's central character, Dirk Diggler, proving himself adept at realizing Anderson's brand of comedy. Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore, as Wahlberg's surrogate parents in the porn industry, both bring an ironic likability to their parts, making them genuine and human. The rest of the supporting cast is not to be forgotten, but the standout is John C. Reilly as Dirk's friend and fellow actor Reed Rothchild. Reilly is hysterical, simple as that. Make sure to stay tuned for the deleted scenes at the end of the special edition to get a better idea of Reilly's comic genius. Perhaps most amazing is the maturity that writer and director Anderson exhibits at such a young age. He was no more than 26 or 27 when he made this movie, yet the structure of the screenplay and his wildly entertaining style is solid and interestingly complex. He seems perfectly capable of maintaining more than a few storylines and subplots, keeping them all intriguing and spinning them out to satisfying endings. With a perfect track record and a promising film called Magnolia on the way, Anderson is emerging as one of the country's most skilled filmmakers.

Rarely do we get even one 3rd Dimensional character in most movies, let alone an entire cast full of them.

I saw elements of other directors' influences, such as Robert Altman, but the film holds its own in originality and plot development.Character development is the movie's finest feature.  I really identified with all of the characters and felt their pain and their success with them. All of the performances were brilliant. (It was especially good to see a small part performed by real-life porn veteran, Nina Hartley).Basically this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result being one of the best films of 1997, which was snubbed at the Oscars (probably due to the ""racy"" - as they would say - subject matter, and the general conservatism of the Academy.",Boogie Nights

If you are the one remembering Commodore64, He-man, songs with newly invented electronic sounds, you are an 80's guy too. It's the era when the increasing trend of the entertainment industry was just about to peak, and everything were shiny than ever. As I see it, Boogie Nights is the best adaptation that flashbacks the audience to that decade, even better than ""Munich"" which zooms to another perspective but on the same age.Paul Thomas Anderson is truly a brilliant director/writer considering his other movies, ""There will be blood"" and ""Magnolia"". On Boogie Nights he tries to reveal the insights of adult movie industry with messed up characters having bitter life stories, with a tremendous approach than ever. The actors are so well chosen that I can not imagine this movie without any single one of them, casting made a ""bull's eye"" selection on this one. Mark Wahlberg was great for the role of Dirk Diggler, a confused kid, trying to be somebody in big town, appreciated by others with his gift (?). Especially I loved him at the scene where he just stares on empty space for 50 seconds in Rahad's mansion, giving the summary of the movie and letting audience to feel free to guess what he may be thinking. He is simply great as well as Julianne Moore, a drug-addict porn-star/mother desperately trying to get the custody of her son, Don Cheadle, another star trying to find out ways to get by besides playing in movies, William H. Macy, a recessive husband with a morally disturbed wife, Philip Seymour Hoffman, a poor sound recorder who can not control or express his homosexual urges, John C. Reilly, the long-life partner of Eddie ""Dirk Diggler"", and Heather Graham, the sweet Rollergirl.As for Burt Reynolds, I can not find the exact words to express my thoughts for his acting. He is truly amazing for the ""Jack Horner"" character who is trying to be an art-man in this difficult sector. Jack Horner is the director of adult films in the movie, trying to prove that the industry may grow with the help of directors, as himself, having artistic approaches. He believes and cares for his actors so well that instead of his directing job, he tries to help the characters in their daily messed up lives. While Reynolds gives his full effort on this one, I can not pass the great acting of Alfred Molina, as freaky Rahad Jackson, who was just on the screen for approximately 10 minutes of the whole 156 minutes movie, but he performs a tremendous job as good as Judi Dench in ""Shakespeare in Love"" and deserves at least a nomination for an Academy Award.The songs are so well placed in the movie that besides the art direction; the music you hear will blow your mind and simply take you to those years. I want to congratulate the music supervisors for shaping up the movie just for our taste.It's a real travesty that this picture was only nominated for 3 Oscars in the lousy Oscar year when the 2.5 hours of hollow steel, Titanic, swept most of the awards. Just like ""Shawshank Redemption"", this movie was so unlucky to be released on a year when a major shiny blockbuster manipulated the members of the Academy.I truly recommend it to drama lovers and but also warn parents to keep their youngsters away from this movie, because of too many explicit scenes.My Rate: **** out of ****",Boogie Nights

After that it became clear that while this movie seems to be about the porn industry in the 70's and thru the 80's what its really about is lies. Lies we tell ourselves. Almost every character in the movie is under some self delusion and can't see themselves as they really are. Jack Horner tells himself he's a ""film maker"" and protests when he has to switch to using video tape, but quickly compromises failing to see that all he really is is a pornographer. Look at the line ""Ever hear of that movie Star Wars? People tell me I look just like Han Solo"" uttered by the highly under rated John C. Reilly (who looks nothing like Harrison Ford obviously). This hidden theme runs throughout the movie in all the characters. There are several great moments if you look for them. Buck, an African-American redneck/cowboy, the most redeeming character, lies to himself throughout the movie, hoping to be accepted for who he is without being judged for going against stereotype and being in porn (he's constantly stating ""I'm an actor"") is forced to compromise in the end to open up his stereo store with the hip-hop style commercial. What is great (and sad) about this movie is that no one really evolves. There is no character arc. Dirk comes back when he hits bottom but not out of any self realization. In the end, they are still self deluded. Hence the reason, in the final scene where Dirk is rehearsing his lines and stands up and unzips showing his rubber phallus repeating his mantra ""I am a star, a star, a bright bright shining star"" the camera doesn't pan up showing Dirks face and we hear the lines while looking at this 13"" fake phallus.

The fact that this movie is about the porn industry and one of its most famous stars leads many people to reject it, or not look deeper into what the film is really about. It starts off with sheer energy, the music, the dancing, the fabulous opening sequence filmed without any cuts by a very under rated director. the movie rolls on, introducing the viewers to many characters and their own personal problems. This is where the many interesting subplots occur. William H.

Other characters such as Buck played bashfully by Don Chedale is trying to start his own business, you have Jack Horner, a man wanting to make a ""film"" a man who rejects moving to videotape, and many more. The most fascinating sub plot, is not really a subplot, and some might argue with me, but it keeps your interest one way or another. i am talking about how everybody in the movie is so fascinated with Dirk Diggler's special friend. all throughout the movie you have people seeing it and the look on their face is always priceless. for this very reason, the viewers want to see it as well. it seems to be always just out of the frame, i found this to be a very odd way of keeping the viewers alert. it is not revealed until the end.The acting is superb, this one of the best casts since the godfather, everyone in the picture plays his or her roles perfectly.

372,gw143,astonishingly overrated,2,18 February 2002,"""Boogie Nights"" is a lot of talking, a lot of dialogue that goes nowhere. Not much happens, and if something does happen, it is of little or no consequence for the rest of the movie. A woman overdoses on cocaine at a party - she gets carted away to a hospital and is never seen or heard of again. One character shoots two people and then himself, and that's that. There are two other shootings later, but the survivors just walk away. No police ever show up. One character does land in prison, but for something else that isn't even part of the movie.While the movie focuses on the Mark Wahlberg character, it does not exclusively follow his rise and fall as a porn actor. It occasionally follows other characters' lives (such as ""Buck""'s) for no good reason, and it could have easily been an hour shorter if it hadn't digressed so many times. There are also scenes at the beginning which I suppose are meant to motivate the main character's actions - like his mother yelling at him. But he seemed to have already made up his mind anyway, so the glimpse into his home life doesn't really add much information, and since his parents are never seen again, it is yet another loose thread in a movie that has a lot of them.There is a lot of drug use and some of the main characters spend quite a lot of time acting drugged out. But except in the case of that one overdose, which is treated as no big deal and not followed up on, the drug use seems to be of little consequence.At best, this movie feels like a somewhat boring and rather tedious pseudo-documentary of the porn industry in the late 70's and early 80's. It even contains the making of a (pseudo-)documentary of the main character's career!

I didn't laugh, nor cry, and I didn't care about any of the characters.This film has so many plot threads, none of which are particularly interesting because the characters are shallow, dumb, one dimensional, or all three. While there are a few very good scenes, most are like this (ridiculous):one guy shoots himself dead at a party because his wife repeatedly cuckolds him,
a porn starlet stomps on her lovers face with her roller skates for no good reason moments after he was inside her,
a well-endowed stud rises in the porn world, then falls due to excessive drug use, then re-rises after a murderous botched robbery attempt,
same porn star records an awful rock record and gets really upset when he doesn't have access to the source recordings,
same porn star gets beat up by some good-old boys after he is unable to get an erection in a pick-up truck in a vacant parking lot,
a different porn star gets rejected for a bank loan he needed to start his own HI-FI stereo business because he had worked in porn only to bear witness to a botched robbery attempt in a doughnut shop. Covered in blood and other human remains from the shoot-out in the doughnut shop, he makes off with the doughnuts, the stolen loot, and finally gets to start his Hi-Fi business,
a porn producer transitions from film to video after refusing to do so in a ""tense"" business meeting,
a hot waif sniffs too much coke at a pool party and has to be whisked off to the hospital,
a senior-aged porn-backer gets accused of being involved with an underage teen and gets beat up in jail,
a gay film-hand harbors a crush on the well-endowed porn star, but when he finally gets the alcohol-fueled courage to act on it, is rebuffed,
a female drug addicted porn star lost partial custody of her son and cries when she cannot re-gain it.
Sadly, while watchable, these scenes do not add up to a great film.
But if this sounds like your cup of tea, happy watching!",Boogie Nights
377,spartancus,Simple greatness,10,5 August 2001,"This film, much in the same way as ""Jackie Brown"" gets better with each viewing. Hands down my favorite film because of its impeccable sense of humor and ability to shape characters in a short amount of time. P.T. Anderson grabs pop culture and jams it down the throat of reality, all the while using the porn industry as a backdrop for a very dysfunctional ""family"" of different people. It's hard not to feel sorry for Little Bill when his wife sleeps with other men, or for poor Scotty, whose confusion and lustfulness has been felt by every human being at some point in time. But the real star performances come from Burt Reynolds and Don Cheadle. I'm not a Reynolds fan, but he is stellar in a very complex role. He's a porno visionary who loves the people he works with but also is driven by his desire to make great movies. Cheadle is the oft-rejected Buck Swope, whose shady past limits his ultimate dream to open a record store. It's pointless to name all the funny little exchanges, but there are enough to keep the film on an off-kilter journey towards oblivion (a.k.a. the 1980s). Some of the best lines come from the secondary characters such as Luis Guzman, Philip Baker Hall (""I like simple things...) and Todd (Thomas Jane) who turns in a great performance as a frustrated, cocaine-driven small-time criminal. Forget Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch for five minutes, and you'll also realize Mark Wahlberg as a strong actor. Same goes for John C. Reilly, who is underrated and brilliant as a less-attractive porno star and Dirk Diggler sidekick. The film is simply great on every level, and the originality cannot be disputed.",Boogie Nights
378,paigejeancody,excellent push out of my comfort zone!,9,23 August 2021,"This film honestly made me reevaluate what kind of media was within my comfort zone.I would say that by nature I am someone who tends to be discerning in choosing what I watch. I tend to stay with media within my comfort zone, on topics which I am comfortable with. However, this movie really has been making me question that view.It took me a moment to get drawn in by the plot but once I was I got drawn in and wasn't let go. By the mid-point of the film I was so emotionally tied up in the characters that I wasn't ready for things to change for them ( to the point where I left the room to relax ), but when I came back and finished the movie I was rewarded.The movie is just so, raw and real that I have to give it credit for how much it moved me.",Boogie Nights

First of all the peformances are just the best I have seen in a long time. The ensemble cast is great. Julianne Moore gives the peformance of a lifetime and definately deserved to win the best supporting actress Oscar. Burt Reynolds, Heather Graham and Mark Wahlberg all gave excellent peformances too.

I've watched it so many times since that the ribbon broke!!!I bought the DVD about 2 months ago, and had to have probably watched it in excess of 40 times since. This movie is superb, it is perfect in almost every way.In addition to amazing performances, Boogie Nights has everything- comedy, drama, suspense, erotica, irony, innuendo, empathy, warmth, crass.... I could go on and on, not to mention the awesome soundtrack.Speaking of the soundtrack, I thought it was clever that the song Boogie Nights was not in the movie. PT Anderson certainly knows when not to squeeze the cheese!!!If you like Boogie Nights, you'll probably also like -Looking For Mr. Goodbar, (one of my favorites). The theme is more dramatic than Boogie Nights and not about the porn industry, however much like 'Dirk' the main character Theresa, is basically a wholesome person trying to find her identity and love- as a result too many wild nights eventually catch up with her.",Boogie Nights

Paul Thomas Anderson did a fine job showing the rise and the fall of an adult movie star and the people around him working in that industry. The overall presentation was fantastic and it had a nice 70s and 80s feel to it . The character growth of the adult movie star Dirk Diggler was on to the point, Mark Wahlberg did a fine job playing the character .. In one of the sequences he got in his deep thinking about how far he has fallen which was one of the most memorable scenes of the movie. Burt Reynolds as Jack & Julian Moore were the acting stars who held the movie together and had great character development.Overall I would recommend it, for a good unconventional story and some good performances . Despite a lengthy screen time It doesn't bores you and you don't wish for it to just finish.",Boogie Nights
383,dbararev,I cannot believe how people respond to this movie!!,10,16 April 2008,"What has to change in today's attitude towards films like Boogie Nights is the approach. The approach is awful! Comparing it to Pulp Fiction, seeing only the pornography, and all its aspects.. come on people, there is more than that in this beautiful motion picture. And to all the sceptics, hasn't Paul Thomas Anderson proved himself worthy time and time again? Magnolia is one of the main reasons I watch American films at all and still have faith in this ""Industry"" that film-making is today.. And what about There Will Be Blood? That is a film that will stay in film history whether u like it or not! Yeah, you! The so-called consumer.. you know something: F#*k you! you don't deserve this, you don't deserve anything. So many artists today struggle to get recognition and it has become increasingly difficult to make serious films, even mainstream, because people just wanna see celebrities doing stupid stuff.. like that sell-out Britney spears.Anyway, this was very painful for me to say because I don't want to see this, i don't wanna believe that today all it matters is the adding up of numbers.. sales revenue and sales return.. I want to see magic, the magic that Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa brought and created through the language of cinema.. Because thats what PTA is doing.. he is creating magic!!",Boogie Nights

385,Robin-10,Porn at its best,8,30 July 1998,"An excellent movie, its portrayal of the sex industry and of 70's and 80's life is interesting - you have to admire the fashions and general kitch of the era, which are captured extremely well. The sex is fairly explicit, so this may be hard film to watch in  mixed company but the overall effect is not cheesy and most of the sex scenes are erotic, funny or otherwise enjoyable. The film-in-film with Brock Landers is unmissable as are the recording studio scenes. I love the use of tracks from the transformers movie in this scene as well. Overall a great watch, emotionally engaging if a little overlong  - this isn't a problem if you get involved with the characters however.",Boogie Nights

387,Ari-8,Get Past The Theme And Watch It,8,17 January 1999,"Being Saturday evening (comedy night in our house),my wife and I sat down to watch a supposedly funny movie called ""Boogie Nights"". The only thing I had heard about it was that my sister-in-law told us not to see it because it was bawdy and she walked out, so right away I knew it was worth watching. This movie was nothing like we thought it was going to be like--it was a fantastic and quite involving drama, which deserved a few Oscars. The time frames from the early 70's to the mid 80's were flawless, and the ""glamor"" of the porn industry was effectively dispelled by the portrayal of the stars. One of the most memorable scenes of all times, in my opinion was the drug deal gone bad, the firecrackers, the guy in the bathrobe and the utter uneasiness of the deposed porn stars as we listened to ""Jessie's Girl"" and ""Sister Christian"". Burt Reynolds was great as Jack Horner, the director who made money with young energy and the coming trends, but realized he had to be ""father"" to all those aging stars who had nowhere else to go once the bright lights began to flicker and the money was getting thin.",Boogie Nights
388,aLeX-79,Waste of time!,2,13 September 1998,"Don't waste your time! How did this film fall in the hands of the greedy marketing business people who hyped it out of all proportion.

Go rent Saturday Night Feaver instead!",Boogie Nights
389,focuz,Hans down for Anderson,1,23 January 1999,"Posited on the not uninteresting notion that cinematic entertainment is to be found in the lives of a bunch of people who spend most of their time in a state of undress, Paul Thomas Anderson's `Boogie Nights' is less a reminder of its intended era  the 1970s  as of some 100 years earlier, when `The Emperor's New Clothes' was all the rage.Satire purveyed as fairytale, this attacked the self-serving pomposity of a European cultural elite as represented by a sycophantic Court so in thrall to its Emperor that whatever he said, and whatever he did, was unfailingly marvellous. Even when he appeared stark naked and invited admiration of his new clothes, response was fulsome and unquestioning.Fast forward from Andersen's fairy tale to Anderson's film and it's clear from the reviews of so many US critics that the court is still in full swing: the references to Boogie's richness of tapestry and brilliance of detailing could just as well have been culled from the parroting so deservedly ridiculed in `Emperor'.Like Andersen's fairy tale, Anderson's film is about people with no clothes: porno actors doing their thing in 1977's California. Directorially, Anderson is at one with his subject because he hasn't any clothes, either, hence two and quarter hour's worth of the ransacking of other directors' wardrobes.Unfortunately, cinematic dress sense is lacking: where others went for style with purpose, Anderson goes for style per se. The opening sequence is Nicholls-out-of-Altman-out-of-Welles, a three-minute tracking shot concluding with a character on roller skates who promptly absents herself to go for a pee. Dramatic, or what? (One assumes that, out of shot, she then handed over the skates to the camera operator, so that thereafter the lens may hurtle around one static set-up after another in hope of signifying vitality). Anderson, however, has more in his armory than tracking shots and roller skates: Nicholas Ray is in a sub-sub-Deanish confrontation between the film's hero and his deranged mamma; Tarantino arrives as soon as people start shooting each other; Scorsese gets comprehensively ripped off in the unintentionally hilarious climactic scene. As for the bit when Anderson follows a character into the swimming pool and under the surface, a round of applause seems appropriate for Jacques Cousteau.The problem with all this laborious artifice is not that it's there, but that it's there for no reason: you swoop your way into a night club and find absolutely nothing happening, plunge into a pool and, er, find absolutely nothing happening. In fact, so often do you find absolutely nothing at all happening that it's no wonder Anderson finally gets bored himself and moves from sex to its stereotypical concomitant, violence.As a comedy about the porn industry, about the fatuity of its mainstream aspirations and the self-deception of its principal exponents, `Boogie Nights' could have been a refreshing entertainment, audacious yet affectionate, searching yet sympathetic. Unfortunately though, Anderson's script never gets over the novelty of its own pitch -- a movie about 1970s porno people: gosh, wow, how radical!  and, thus mesmerised, plots its characters' rise and fall in more pedestrian fashion than any porno chronicle of tumescence and aftermath.In the role of the hero, Mark Wahlberg is defeated from the outset: Anderson's script makes him a sleazoid from scene 1, thereby denying any opportunity for examination of innocence traduced. Wahlberg's little sleazoid is disowned by his bonkers mother and becomes a big sleazoid courtesy of his ability to handle a very large part in a succession of porno movies. At this point, Anderson could have found the iconoclasm these dismal proceedings so urgently need and had Dirk Diggle' living in a mansion and endowing a new hospital. But no: middle-America knows porn is bad, so ergo, the people in it must all come to a bad end. And so Anderson obliges the Moral Majority, trying, but failing, to obscure the predictability of the redemptive route by constructing setpiece events more bizarre than anything encountered by Bunyan's Pilgrim. Discarded by the porno people because of the so-sad truth that there's always a, how can one put it, a new up-and-comer, Dirk sets off to be a singing star, a surprising career move given that he hasn't so much whistled in any preceding scene. More surprising, however, is the fact that Dirk has somehow lost house, car, and bank account in remarkably short time, a disaster that might have elicited some sympathy had Anderson's script bothered to mention it. Instead, all the audience discovers is that the world's most famous and richest porno actor is cruelly thwarted his dream of being a recording star. . . because he can't afford the cost of a demo. Hmm. Sad.Inexplicably bankrupt and demonstrably unmusical, you'd have thought Dirk's mortification was complete. But no: he's now landed in a Tarantino setpiece filmed through one of Fellini's old view-finders, and thus winds up with two ex-porno friends in the baronial living room of a rich loony to whom they'd dearly love to sell baking soda masquerading as coke if only the loony's Asian houseboy would stop running around letting off Chinese fire crackers. Breathtaking cinema? Had an introduction been here effected of a nun on a pogo stick playing a bugle, it's likely US critics would have signed a petition to ensure Anderson's Oscar.As to the fate of others, two are worthy of mention: porno film director Jack Horner, played by Burt Reynolds, and porno actor Buck Swope, played by Don Cheadle. Reynolds, inexplicably nominated for an acting award, decides early on that Jack Horner sat in a corner and thus spends most of the movie doing just that. His expression is glazed and his directorial input, zilch: it's as if the material over which he presides has a life of its own, and somnambulism is all that's required. (The same thought probably occurred to Anderson). Cheadle, whose career  unlike Reynolds's -- at least looks like surviving this tripe, has a more lively time of it: his character wants to move from low-life to hi-fi, to have his own store in order to sell the eight track cartridge players depicted by Anderson as quintessential 1977 regardless of the fact that by then they were all museum pieces anyway.Although the bank refuses to provide the substantial financing a hi-fi store clearly needs, Cheadle strikes it lucky by first walking into a small bakery to buy doughnuts and then, Bruce Willis-like, by finding himself the Last Man Standing when a homicidal maniac rushes in (as they do, as they do) and everyone else winds up dead. Drenched in gore or possibly, raspberry jam, Cheadle stares at the money the maniac would've taken. There must be all of twenty dollars there. Can he resist the temptation? Apparently not, because in his next scene there he is, proudly opening a new landmark on the block, his very own hi-fi store.That you could buy and equip a hi-fi store with just 20 dollars will come as a surprise to all those who remember the 1970s. Anderson, at 26, doesn't, so it's little wonder that the film overall is about as historically accurate as ""Ben Hur"".Still. `Boogie Nights' is a triumph of sorts, in much the same way that Cheadle's hi-fi store was. With minimal investment in wit, originality or imagination, this unlikely construct has nevertheless been hailed as a landmark on the cinematic block, its distinctly rightwing triteness blithely misrepresented as exactly the opposite. There's no doubt Anderson does have talent, and once he gets over the preoccupation with being young, radical, and free to nick everybody else's directorial styles, he could well assert an identity of his own, beginning, perhaps, with a script that surprises and characters that engage with more than each other.For the US critics though, no redemption is in sight: they're probably still in court now, praising the clothes of the naked director, still listening to their eight tracks and claiming it's real fidelity. . .

So, here are five simple reasons why it's one of the greatest films of, if not simply the 90's, the last 40-50 years of cinema:1. Potentially the greatest ensemble cast put before a camera (Hoffman, Hall, Guzman, Moore, Macy, Reilly, Reynolds, Wahlberg, Cheadle, etc.)2. Absolutely the most danceable soundtrack that can double as a time capsule of the greatest dance hits of the 70's.3. Any film that can generate enough quotes to be used extensively in an ESPN.com article as allegories for the NBA and NOT be a film about basketball is a sign of a golden script. (By the way, the article I speak of, ""Boogie Hoops,"" is hilarious.) Say any line from this movie at a party loud enough, and you'll have another shouted back. Go on. Do it.4. It shows, in raw, realistic fashion, the classic hero arc--and set against the contrasting values of the 70's and 80's, no less.5. It makes you care about the characters without telling you that you have to.(Bonus Reasons: 6.

Aside from his performance, great work was turned in by Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, and Heather Graham. John C.

397,sprickety,When sex was safe and business was pleasure,9,28 October 2014,"Boogie Nights opens with a shot that lasts for 2 minutes and 55 seconds. The words Boogie Nights appear on the screen, but within the universe of the film; the name of a nightclub, which the camera spins away from and onto the entrance of another nightclub. The camera snakes inside, following several primary characters interacting with each other, while patrons dance and drink, all soundtracked by a rocking 70's soul tune. What a way to start a film. Paul Thomas Anderson was only 26 when he made this.In fact, looking at the context of the writer-director's age, it's a ridiculously ambitious movie. We are thrown, for 148 relentless minutes, into the world of the 70's porn industry, a challenging topic to make into an accessible film; but Anderson succeeds with ease. We sympathise with these strange characters and their strangely innocent world, and with Mark Wahlberg's well-meaning and well-endowed Dirk Diggler. ""Dirk"", real name Eddie, is a lowly dishwasher at that nightclub in the first scene with a reputation for his gigantic member. Taken under the wing of Burt Reynolds' director, he grows to become a porn superstar. And then, just as Diggler's career hits its peak, it goes downhill as the 70's literally turns into the 80's. The fall side of this rise-and-fall plot is catalysed by, at a New Year 1980 party, one of the most shocking and brilliantly handled screen deaths I've ever seen. The film's second half is chaotic and messy, but feels intentionally so; the tight structure of the opening hour unravelling as the character's lives fall apart. I mentioned before the strange innocence of the porn industry. It's seen in the hilarious in-porn dialogue, in the Margherita-soaked parties, in Reynold's dream to be a real, artistically valid director making real art. As film gives way to video and that visual aesthetic is lost, we start to see the effects of drug abuse, of ego, of exploiting women, and of an industry that is dangerously linked to real crime. There is a violent scene in a donut shop that seems indulgent and pointless, and a subplot with Julianne Moore that doesn't really go anywhere. Some may feel that the running time is excessive, and they'd have a point; but I wasn't bored for a second. It's funny, shocking, sexy, ugly, and frightening at all the right moments. There's an obvious debt to Goodfellas in style, plot, and yes, the long shots; but it's never a pastiche or ripoff. That's partly because of Anderson's assured and confident direction, partly because California and porn offers such a nice contrast to New York and gangsters. John C Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman offer excellent supporting work, and the soundtrack is fantastic. Boogie Nights is vibrant, effortlessly entertaining and intelligently made cinema.",Boogie Nights
398,HellBellsLiveWired,"A funny and engaging saga of dreams, debauchery, and the search for belongingness.",8,9 February 2014,"The very beginning of Boogie Nights sets the tone for the entire picture. A melancholy piece of sentimental music plays over a black screen before being quickly drowned out by an explosion of upbeat disco. It's almost as though PT Anderson wanted the audience to feel like they just snorted a line of cocaine. The brilliant tracking shot that follows does a fantastic job of introducing all the characters, but it is that first screen that sets the tone; Boogie Nights is not about the glitz and glamor of its time period, but rather the sadness and desperation that lies beneath the gilded surface.The film follows a well-endowed and starry-eyed teenager named Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg), who escapes the turmoil of his home life by immersing himself in the sex and drug-fueled world of disco-dancing and hardcore pornography. Porn mogul Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds)and the sexy yet maternal Amber Waves (Julianne Moore)take Eddie under their wing, adopting him into their own twisted 'family', which Eddie is eager to join. As Eddie changes his persona to Dirk Diggler, the line between his real self and his on screen persona begins to blur, and the humbleness of his Eddie Adams is replaced by the ego-crazed arrogance of Dirk Diggler.After watching Boogie Nights time and time again, I have come to realize how truly unique it is in that the tonal shifts of the plot seem natural rather than jarring. There is a lot of humor in this movie, and at the same time a lot of sadness. Like all great filmmakers, PT Anderson is a master at playing with the audience's emotions. Boogie Nights, as well as his next film Magnolia, are emotional roller coaster rides. The key to mastering this is good characterization and seamless tonal shifts, both of which Boogie Nights succeeds in getting right.Tone is hard to define, but it can make or break a film. If a comedy is too serious, then it doesn't work. If a drama isn't taking itself seriously enough, then it doesn't work. Boogie Nights somehow manages to find that balance throughout its many tonal shifts, and for that it is a unique film watching experience.Perhaps the biggest strength in PT Anderson's films is his attention to detail in regards to his characters. In this ensemble cast, almost all of the characters undergo an emotional journeys of some sort. The fact that even the most ancillary characters have a storyline makes the film seem more realistic, and this makes it easier for the audience to sympathize with their struggles.The acting in the film is mostly superb, although truthfully I found a few scenes a bit too melodramatic. Mark Wahlberg did a good job, but in some scenes I feel he has a tendency to overact. However this is a minor gripe, and in the overall scheme he does a fantastic job revealing the emotional nuances of his character. John C. Reilly plays my favorite character in the film, Reed Rothschild, Dirk Diggler's best friend and eternal man-child.Julianne Moore gives a highly emotional and affecting performance, and Burt Reynolds is, for once, not completely annoying.On the contrary, he gives another fantastic performance. Heather Graham is great eye candy for the film, but her character has a lot more depth than her 'rollergirl' persona might suggest. In some ways I find her storyline more interesting than Dirk's.As someone who is a big fan of the music, films, and culture of the late 70's and early 80's, the setting of Boogie Nights appeals to me a great deal. The soundtrack is phenomenal, and the film uses it in some very unique ways. For example, who could forget Dirk's rendition of 'The Touch'? If you haven't seen the film yet, its worth watching for that scene alone! The film seems to have an appreciation for the time period, but also uses the changes of the period to represent changes in the characters, such as when the primary medium of porn changed from film to tape. This is masterfully done and a unique way to tell the story.Boogie Nights is a finely crafted and emotionally engaging film that engrosses you not only in its story, but in its characters and setting as well. Its one of those films you can watch time and time again and never get tired because there is simply so much to appreciate. The only things holding it back from masterpiece status are some stilted performances, but for the most part it is a great achievement.",Boogie Nights

In the commentary, the director said that he was influenced by Martin Scorsese movies, but I think that the long take is a good match for Good Fellows and others.
There are quite a lot of characters, but each one has a perfect view, all of which plays a role to complement the main actor and the story, and it is calculated.I like the last in the same way as Raging Bull, but unlike that I'm in the last with salvation, which I like this.Directing, acting, screenwriting, music, arts I think that it is very first class, one representing the 1990s.RIP Philip Seymour Hoffman and Burt Reynolds",Boogie Nights
401,Alboredo,"The 70's, the 80's",8,17 November 2005,"P.T Anderson, is one of America's best directors. This is no Magnolia yet, but still a compelling film that gives a great inside of the adult film industry. In 1977, when the story starts, porno movies are shot on film and play in theaters, and a director can dream of making one so good that the audience members would want to stay in the theater even after they had achieved what they came for. By 1983, when the story closes, pornos have shifted to video and most of the movies are basically just loops. I think many people pass up ""Boogie Nights"" cause they are anti-porn, or just flat out hate the adult industry and can't overlook that aspect of this film. But underneath that is a great story about characters losing everything and battle to regain themselves. This is a beautiful film... and it's too bad that enough people can't see that.",Boogie Nights

Mainstream Hollywood movies could not show a man and a woman in bed together and if they did , both actors had to have one foot on the floor during the scene. The words such as ""Pregnant"" and words referring to a woman's breasts or a man's penis were never allowed so this film means Hollywood has moved farther OR sunken deeper in trying to find what the public wants to see and spend it's money on. Burt Reynolds was the first man to appear in a nude centerfold picture in the woman's PLAYGIRL magazine and played a woman chasing Senator in the movie STRIPTEASE, so he is right to play the Porno film director in this movie that tries to show the way pornographic films were made during the 1970's to 1980's. Mark Wahlberg(later in the Planet of the Apes remake?)plays the young stud that Burt finds to star next in his porno flicks.

These are as follows Firstly useless characters like the guy shooting himself n his wife, the gay one, n the black guy .. their roles dint matter in the movie ... was in fact leading somewhere else. The Movie becomes boring when the director fires(not exactly) the main character .. This was just something to increase the movie timings nothing else .. but its better to work on quality rather than quantityN one more thing ... i don't think the movie name goes with the movie , if it had been the adventures of Dirk Diggler something like that, it would have been great .. Now coming to the GOOD POINTS .. it was good combination of Exotic n Erotic Scenes .. a couple scenes were very good n its always good to watch celebrity sex ... kind of gets u turn ON .. Most importantly it tells the history of Porn industry , how the golden era of porn changed through 1980's .. n the introduction of sex videotapewell at the end i should tell u that i have gone too deep to provide my reviews n u may consider these flaws have been explained in to detail, so overall i consider it a good movie and a must watch moviei'll give it a 7.5/10 ..",Boogie Nights

If anyone shares my feelings, maybe they have enough sense not to watch. I wondered why this topic would qualify for a satire, and because of its critical acclaim and awards/nominations, I decided to watch to find out. For me it was a waste of time. I'm not especially offended by porn, but I'm not excited by it either. It's not a substitute for the real thing, and if you've seen one porn film, you'e seen them all.

405,pretentiousanderson,A cartoonish ripoff of Goodfellas meant to appeal to adolescents who like the topic of porn,4,27 September 2017,"Having grown up on watching movies and having no reason for making them other than to ape his idols, Anderson lifts the template from Scorsese's Goodfellas in this adolescent ripoff. Tell me - Which film am I describing here? Narrative structure: Set primarily over the course of the mid-1970s through the 80s, a young high-schooler has troubles at home and has to live with abusive family members. He feels trapped in this environment, and to help him escape, he grows attached to a surrogate family whose activities revolve around moral and societal vice. He finds that he excels in this environment and rises quickly in this new family hierarchy, earning both respect and riches from it. He eventually becomes fully initiated into this new family when he passes a test that demonstrates his commitment and talent to the vices that they support, and he is then rewarded by this new family with a celebration. At near mid-point, a ""retro reel"" involving 8mm or 16mm home movies and photos are used in a montage to express the passage of time and the deepening relationship between our protagonist and the other members of his new family. Things are going swimmingly until, at what is supposed to be a fun social occasion among friends, violence unexpectedly breaks out, resulting in murder and death. This scene mid-way through the plot tells the viewer that not all is well within this ""fun"" social structure, and that its very mores helped to contribute to the mindset that would lead someone to murder. But our protagonist tries to brush aside this violent event as a mere aberration, not wanting to question social world he has embraced. After eventually reaching a pinnacle of success, cultural shifts along with an infusion of drug abuse drag our protagonist down to the point where the same elements stemming from the vice and the surrogate family he joined now work against him until he hits rock bottom. When he hits rock bottom, he has a falling out with his surrogate ""father figure"" who turns against him for his betrayals and now uncontrollable drug use. All of this nearly kills him - but he still manages to survive rock bottom (unlike some of his friends around him). He is eventually able to pull himself up from rock bottom and settle into a less-than-ideal but by no means awful life, wistfully thinking back on the good times and how they are likely gone forever. Stylistic elements: Wall-to-wall music to help set tone, establish the time setting and occasionally provide an additional commentary on the action itself. Swish-pans, rapid editing sequences to convey frenetic energy, punctuated by extensive dolly and tracking shots to convey more leisurely times of our characters and cover the spaces of the lively nightclubs that they frequent. Title cards placed late in the film in order to subtly tell the viewer that the upcoming scene, times or sequences will be especially significant to the lives of the characters, followed by a shift in editing style to highlight the stresses that the protagonist has gotten himself into - which systematically builds the dramatic tension in the sequence until it results in a conclusive tipping point in his life. Which movie am I describing here? Boogie Nights? Or Goodfellas? Which one came first again? The final scene where our protagonist talks to himself in the mirror and looks back on his experiences is obviously ripped off from Raging Bull rather than Goodfellas, but that is still another Scorsese work.Anderson has nothing to say other than he wants to be thought of as a great director, but he needs to ape the true pioneers that came before him to make that happen. He just needed to make sure he adapted Scorsese's work into the porn world in order to appeal to his adolescent male fan base that eats up anything that helps mainstream their sexual fantasies. Don't fall for the hype. This is an extremely derivative, mediocre work.",Boogie Nights

We watch Eddie transform from a simple good-hearted busboy to the biggest star of the adult cinema industry, with all the money, women and drugs that come with that fame. The movie ends with the predictable moral that taking yourself too seriously leads to failure, as we watch all of the actor-characters sink into their own personal hells, as they mistake their fame and money for personal talent and success, only to realize too late that they're being consumed by the business that feeds their instant gratification. Burt Reynolds is excellent as the father figure director who is the center of the group of porn actors he recruits. Bill Macy turns in his usual great performance in a small role as the cinematographer whose wife (played by Nina Hartley, as an inside joke to all the porn fans in the audience!) can't stop having very public sex with other men, every chance she gets.",Boogie Nights

The film reminds me a lot of Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas in terms of characterization and dialogue.

Please choose from this list of words in describing what is, quite probably, my favorite film ever made.  Paul Thomas Anderson showed flashes of genius in his debut, Hard Eight, in 1996; and in 1997, he all but solidified his place in the Director's Hall of Fame.  Everything about ""Boogie Nights"" is pristine, from the 5 minute one-shot introductory scene, to Anderson's fluid camerawork, to the pinpointed details of a turbulent social era.  Mark Wahlberg is perfectly cast as Eddie Adams AKA Dirk Diggler, the boy wonder who makes a HUGE name for himself in the adult film world.  Julianne Moore and Burt Reynolds were properly praised for their career-making and reviving roles, respectively.  And the strong supporting cast of John C. Reilly, Heather Graham, Don Cheadle and William H Macy provide enough comic relief to make it through the 2 and a half hour epic.  The most impressive aspect of this late 90's classic (besides the terrific music) is that these pornographers/drug users/general lowlife actually warrant sympathy and even sometimes, love.  Anderson's amazing script makes you FEEL for these people like no other script could.(with this subject matter anyway)  WARNING: This movie's biggest knock is that it's far too long, but my tip is this....become a slave to Anderson's masterpiece, and you won't find a better two and a half hours you could spend.  Paul Thomas Anderson is the man to watch for the 21st Century, and with his new movie, Magnolia, slated for a late 1999 release; with all due respect Mr. Lucas, there is only ONE movie I will wait in line to see this year.",Boogie Nights

I am no prude, far from it, I have watched the films that this film portrays on many occasions. But to make a whole film about the making of them was scraping the barrel. All the characters were shallow, despicable, two faced and that was their good points and the plot went nowhere fast. At the end I said to myself ""Did I miss something here?""

But if you either A: like to be entertained, B: enjoy the 'magic of movies', C: are interested in film, or D: all of the above, then there is no reason what-so-ever not to see Boogie Nights.To put it quickly, the movie takes place during the transition from the 70s to the 80s and focuses on life of Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler/Brock Landers (superbly played by Mark Wahlberg).The viewer is graced with stunning performances by the entire cast (Burt Reynolds, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, et al...), and for two and three quarter hours is taken on one whirl-wind of an emotional roller coaster (sorry for my adjective filled sentences, but I LOVE this movie!).  Each character is well developed, and is given ample time to make you love them and possibly hate them simultaneously.  The emotions they emit are true, and I can completely empathize with them at times.In the end, Boogie Nights is funny, poignant, smart, sexxy, and - though parts might enrage you (due to the phenomenal performances) - should leave you with an over-all good feeling.",Boogie Nights

Along with David Fincher and Danny Boyle, he's most certainly the best director to immerge from that hard decade for film. Pardon the cliché but `this is a must see for film lovers', the script is amazing, the performances are stunning, a plot to die for, excellent soundtrack, editing and the cinematography is mind blowing. Throughout the film Anderson puts a whole new meaning to the word steady cam, he uses it to great effect and again and again, meanwhile we sit there and go ""wow"". And the main thing is that he's not trying to over stylise the film just for the hell of it, like Guy Richie or even David Fincher with Fight Club. Each shot is meticulously planned with the audience in mind as well as the films narrative, enabling us to dig deeper into the characters in the film that struggle to find dignity in their lives. One particular shot in the film that I favour is when the camera holds close up on Mark Wahlberg's character for about a minute, intensifying the situation and enabling us to relate with his character. Ultimately this is a film about humans, people being people, something that we can all relate to, watch and enjoy. Of course there is the language, violence and sex scenes, so it wouldn't be suitable for younger viewers but I don't see any other reason why anyone should miss out on a marvellous piece of cinema. And if you enjoy this then check out his other films Hard Eight and the three hours masterpiece Magnolia, which he should have, without a doubt, won best director for.

Brillantly cast and wonderful character development, the performances somehow combine the best of stage acting with improvisation within a cinema verite style.The plot proved richer than I expected and the underlying themes are teased out quite profoundly as each ""B grade"" human being is brought, through crisis, into perspective.A sociologist's dream case study, the film resonates the raw truth of what we all know about self-esteem, parental love and lack of it, attention/love deficit and its manifestation in adulthood, the desperate need to belong. Something for everyone here.. almost camouflaged as issues of untouchables and their separate milieu but of course they are universal.The film works on a number of levels.

424,drejr1977,I guess even Burt Reynolds has to work...,3,1 August 2001,"Without question, this has to be one of the most overrated movies in recent memory.  I'm a not that familiar with Anderson's other films, but I sincerely hope if he has tackled any other ""based on a true story"" themes, he has indeed been more ACCURATE! For starters, the film claims to have been based ""loosely"" on the famous (or infamous) porn star, John C. Holmes, and his turbulent life.  They may have gotten the ""meteoric rise and fall"" part right, but in no way did this film reflect anywhere close to what John Holmes' life was like, especially in the pornography industry.  I guess Anderson must have felt, for the public to truly accept it, he must sugarcoat (if that's possible) the story a little. It wasn't nearly as tragic or brutal as Holmes' life, so apparently that would never sell. More so, everybody has raved about the cinematography of this film, and to be honest, it's just average.  That goes to show that in the post-modern world we live in,  people's standards have slipped, have less knowledge about art and art in film, and are obviously more easily impressed by not their own opinions, but the media's... Burt Reynolds at least got to salvage his career by not taking a totally cheesy role again, and that's about all the credit I can give Anderson on this film.  Mark Wahlberg is clearly a terrible actor, and anybody who believes he IS good, must be in the 14-21 year old demographic somewhere.

Which includes drug use and even attempting to cut a record.Burt Reynolds is Jack Horner, an adult film director who discovers Diggler. Moore is Amber Waves, a mother who loses her child because of her occupation of an adult film star.  John C. Reily is Reed Rothchild, Dirk's best friend and sidekick in most his films.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is Scotty, who works on most of the films.  Heather Graham plays Rollergirl, who is just a very interesting character.PT Anderson really proved that he is the one of the best filmmakers in Hollywood with this film.

If you want a great movie to rent. Rent this. If you want a better one to rent. Get Magnolia.You might just even get both. I am 13 and I think that P.T. Anderson is a genious. Some don't like his work, they think it is vulgar and disgusting. But when you think about it. All of these things happen or happened. And Paul just decided to tell them on screen, which I think personally is a great way to explain something with a weird tale. And boy does he layout his stories perfectly.Go Paul! Waiting for yet another one of your directorial masterpieces.",Boogie Nights
431,freshgagh,"""Boogie Nights"" - PT Anderson gives Porn the Goodfellas treatment",9,2 February 2008,"""Boogie Nights"" is a classic Hollywood film of dreams and dreamers  the twist is its set in the porn business of the late seventies and early eighties. Writer director PT Anderson was just 25 when he made this homage - or should that be expose - and the movie shows him experimenting with techniques clearly borrowed from Scorsese and Altman amongst others. What's amazing is that it all comes off confirming his reputation as one of the most exciting young directors to emerge from the nineties.The film follows the life of the creatively named Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg) as he leaves home determined to make it by using the only asset he has  and it is quite a substantial asset. Along the way we meet the varied characters that inhabit the porn scene, most of whom are introduced in a stunning long take through a nightclub that opens the movie which is reminiscent of both Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" and Altman's ""The Player"".At 156 minutes this film is very much an epic but Anderson wisely keeps the explicitness to a minimum, making this very much a piece of drama rather than erotica. What we are shown is a world where sex, drugs and money act as substitutes for artistic dreams and emotional need.The large cast produce uniformly excellent performances from Burt Reynolds porn director through cuckolded William H Macy to Jullianne Moore's drug addicted pornstar facing a child custody battle. Anderson handles his large cast with the assuredness of a seasoned veteran none of the characters get short changed by having their story lines abruptly abandoned.Both funny and disturbing in equal measures this is an excellent film, with bravura directing from Anderson and a style that perfectly evokes its setting. If there is a criticism to be made, and it's a harsh one, it's that Anderson occasionally seems too fond of his characters. Don't let the subject matter put you off, this is an excellent film that heralds the rise of a potential new auteur.9/10 - Excellent",Boogie Nights
432,jkjones,"It was OK - Lots of sex & nudity, but not much realism",5,21 September 2005,"It was alright, but not the great piece of work everyone raves about. Also, it was obvious that the director had absolutely zero knowledge of firearms. Like a shotgun blowing out a rear windshield from 50 yards away. Also a crack-head who had been shot through the heart by someone he hadn't seen turning and making a perfect shot from 30 feet on the guy who just shot him then turning and making nailing a head shot on someone else all while he was falling and dying. Trying too hard to make an anti-gun statement. Not very believable. Also with all of the shootings that happened inside peoples homes and the police don't show up even once? Pretty 2 dimensional. But if you want to see Heather Graham & Julianne Moore naked, this is the movie. Just don't go looking for a believable story.",Boogie Nights
433,simpleton2632,Fantastic Filmmaking,10,7 April 2003,"Though it is 2003 I feel that the comments on this film are rather weak and I would like to update them.The opening sequence is one of the best in the films. The first few shots introduce all the main characters that are important to the story without it even feeling like that was the intention. We are shown the dance club, roller girl, Maurice, Jack and Amber/Maggie, Eddie/Dirk, and Little Bill (William H. Macy). Amazing that Anderson could be so blunt with that and not even feel like you're being smothered with characters. Brilliant directing.Boogie Nights is one of my favorite films. It deals with the rise and fall of numerous characters during the peak of pornography in the 70's and early 80's. Mark Wahlberg gives probably his best performance we might ever see. Burt Reynolds plays Jack Horner, a filmmaker trying to tell stories through pornography. Hard task but he's a man of vision and the character in my mind is a genius. This too was a great performance by not my favorite Burt Reynolds.This film should be studied by cinematographers and writers alike. My best and easily acceptable example is the donut shop scene. Cinematographers note that in this scene there are so many opprotunities for reflection but not once do you see the camera. Not once. This, in my opinion is one of the best scenes. The beauty of that scene shows how simple the human mind really is. Don Cheadle had numerous options after what happens and you could see it in his face that he was thinking about what to do. He chooses selfishness, takes the bag and runs, which I believe most of us would choose.Writers take note that Boogie Nights goes into great character development and has a number of characters to build. Paul Thomas Anderson is I think one of the best writers of our era. His understanding of human suffering and confusion brings his characters to life. Especially Eddie Adams and Jack Horner. Anderson shows even more depth and emotion in his film Magnolia. But that's another story.If you don't like Boogie Nights that's perfectly alright. The beauty of Boogie Nights is that the film is about the 70's porn era, but there is barely any nudity when plenty could have been put in. The film doesn't glorify pornography, it shows how great and terrible it can be. Or at least how quickly something good can be swept out from under you. Boogie Nights is about people and their belonging in this world, whether it be the porn industry or anything else. It's not about porn, or sex, or making drugs seem great. It shows how easily people can be corrupted and ruined by the things around them. I love this film and recommend it to anyone who is going to study film.Why Anderson hasn't recieved an oscar for writing and directing I don't know. His films keep getting better and deeper. The thought provoking movies he has made keep me coming back for more. I'm sure he has plenty of ideas for the next decade or so to entertain the masses.",Boogie Nights
434,piper-says-punk,Afternoon Movie Lemonade,8,30 October 2011,"Yes, this movie is about the pornographic industry. If you are not a fan of such an industry, the movie might not ""grab you"" as much as it should. But, think about it: it is interesting to know how this kind of ""world"" works around. This movie didn't get a 10 from me because it reminds me of lemonade. Let me make this clearer: the plot is interesting, but the story line is too light. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes, movies turn out better when they are more ""light weight"". Due to the volatile natures of the characters, this lightness fitted in quite well. It's almost perfect. A certain heaviness of the story is embedded into this lightness with a very ""merry"" soundtrack following it around throughout the entire movie. However, it was not embedded enough. I mentioned the soundtrack. Before I comment on that, I must say that I think that soundtracks are VERY IMPORTANT in a movie. If the soundtrack does not fit into the movie, it is very possible that I will dislike the entire thing, even though the movie itself without the music might be good enough. The OST of this movie is: TERRIFIC. The music goes along with the characters and especially the story, but in some instances: the music was too happy, when it should have been more solemn.It would be a shame not to watch this movie. It's a good movie. Perhaps not perfect, but it still can be charted in ""a movie you must see before you die"". I hope you enjoy it.",Boogie Nights
435,billyacewilliams,A modern masterpiece.,10,23 May 2004,"Paul Thomas Anderson's stylish and compelling take on the 70s porn industry follows Eddie Adams, aka Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), through six years of sex, drugs and disco. His chance meeting with pornography director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) starts his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time. Dirk's character is based on real-life porn actor John Holmes, who, like Dirk, was renowned for being extremely ""well-endowed"". This is where Dirk finds initial success.The main themes in Boogie Nights are the obvious ones relating to a film of this genre; pornography, drugs, sex, betrayal, violence and music. Boogie Nights deals with the pornography theme with some control. It is not overplayed and the sex scenes are surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when they take place on screen.Throughout the film cocaine is abused enormously, and the film's setting, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of the drug at that time, which the film captures perfectly. However, Boogie Nights does not promote cocaine, as there are some scenes involving addiction and overdoses. For example at Jack's party, they find a girl who has recently, and graphically, overdosed; blood pours from her nose and she begins an unconscious fit. The film, before this scenes, has been fairly upbeat and comic, but from this point it foreshadows the darkness that it will occur.The music scenes are executed brilliantly, from superbly-staged disco scenes to a down-and-out Dirk singing terribly in his new music career. The soundtrack too is excellent, featuring tunes from The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and the unforgettable Sound Experience. The standout scene in the whole film comes down to the music; Dirk, Redd Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) visit drug dealer Rahad Jackson's (Alfred Molina) house in order to make some quick cash from selling phoney drugs, but Night Ranger's Sister Christian, which is playing in the background, increases the intensity of the scene incredibly, proving that music can bring so much more depth to a scene. Boogie Nights is filled with those kind of scenes, which makes the film even more fantastic.The standout performance in Boogie Nights is Burt Reynolds as the enigmatic, yet moody, film director. In the scene where he attacks a young guy for slating his movies, it is a complete shock for the audience, because before this point he has been pretty mellow and content. Other notable performances are Julianne Moore, Heather Graham as the beautiful Rollergirl, John C. Reilly, and Mark Wahlberg, who delivers the performance of his career.Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original film, using common themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way. Anderson's approach has been fully captures these characters in a time when nothing seemed to be going wrong, or at least until the 80s arrive. From then on, things turn very dark indeed, and all signs of the recognisable characters and situations from the first part of the film have gone. This does not, however, reduce the high level of engaging entertainment that this film offers.Boogie Nights was not a box-office success, earning only £2 million at cinemas in the UK. But this is not the film's, or the director's concern. Anderson recognises quality, not popularity, which is evident in his three other films, Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple parable filled with excellent and variable situations, because at the end of this film you will realize that Boogie Nights is a simple morality tale, but one which will stay in the mind days after you watch it. Boogie Nights is at once shocking, hilarious, devastating and both visually and audibly outstanding.",Boogie Nights

I don't recall ever being bored through any of the one hundred fifty minutes either. Now I know many people are turned off by the idea of a movie about the porn industry, but it's done in a tasteful way, but still maintains it's entertainment. At the base of the film, it all comes back to family and how everyone searches through their soul to find themselves for what they really are. In particular, John C. Reilly, Mark Wahlberg (best role of his career), and Philip Seymour Hoffman light up the screen. In my opinion, the best film of 1997, and one of the best films of all time.

This story is about success, it's about failure. It's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you. The story deals with self realization and determination on a scale so large, no camera angle could cover it. Within the grasp of each scene is resides an element marked for depiction within your imagination. Keep this in mind as you watch the movie; it's more than eye candy. The sexually suggestive, rarely explicit scenes serve only to distract and entertain you during the tedious process of character development.",Boogie Nights

Mr Anderson is a brilliant filmmaker. The time he spends setting up the characters and situations this film portrays so well is brilliant. The cast is flawless and the music the party tape of a generation. I cannot recommend this film highly enough. And don't get me started on how good Mark Walberg looks! Even Burt Reynolds (who looks a little strange after some obvious face work) gives a performance that makes us realize how much more this guy has to offer than Smokey and the Bandit. Finally, if you're still not convinced, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is in it, need I say more?",Boogie Nights
440,nourenme84,Overrated and over the top.,2,18 November 2004,"I had so many problems with this movie. I understood that it was cinematic genius and ended up with cinematic excrement. I came into the movie uninfluenced by the good reviews it naturally gets, but it was still to no avail. Here's my beef:First, Boogie Nights tried to hard to have that deep message about how a life of moral decadence leads to regret and a general waste of innocence. We all know this, we all think about how empty the dirty stripper is on the inside. Second, I have no beef with Anderson, it's just that his cinematography was so over the top. I fully understand that he has the capability to make long shots on tracks, cranes, dollies or with a steady cam, but not every single shot has to be a long shot. I don't want a porno version of Raging Bull. Third, Burt Reynolds really didn't deserve an Oscar nomination for his role. It was a good character, but not nomination worthy. The only thing he deserves is the Awesome Mustache Trophy Fourth, this movie gets so much damn praise from people. I can't figure out why. I think it's the classic ideology that something risqué has to be good. This movie is over inflated because of the type of content (in this case, the pornographic type) in Boogie Nights instead of the quality of the content (which was weak). Fifth, this movie was filled with too many 70's stereotypes. It was overdone. Sixth, Mark Wahlberg's acting wasn't that great. It was subpar at best. I'll give it him on that he was good in the scene recording his album because it was pretty funny. Regardless, he was too dramatic and and over worked the nonchalant attitude of his character. Seventh, too many useless characters. I love William H. Macy, but his character was useless. I'm indifferent on Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but he too was useless. Eighth, this movie had that feel where if you keep waiting patiently, it will get better. It never did. I hate when movies do that. Ninth, I personally think the writing for this movie was unimaginative and boring. Such a cliché story, boy goes on his own, boy makes porn and becomes rich and famous, boy finds drugs and hits the gutter, boy finds his way back to glory. Seen it before, let's write something new. Tenth, too many useless side stories. If Anderson would have completely cut out the black guy making it in the stereo business with stolen money, Phillip Seymour Hoffman's homosexual journey, Luis Guzman's club adventures and William H. Macy's marital frustrations and this movie might have been somewhat less aimless.Overall 2.3 out of 10.",Boogie Nights

What a novel idea to make a movie about the porn industry in the 1970's. And that's exactly what is fun about it too...all the music and style of that decade are brought back in living colour. What a blast! Every time I watch this, I notice an actor that is now famous that wasn't famous the previous time I watched it...but I think I've now covered off all the main characters in the movie as they all seem to have gone on to bigger and better things; most notably, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, Bill Macey, Tom Jane, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and of course Mark Whalberg and C. Thomas Reilley. A notable mention also to Don Cheedle who was just nominated for a Best Actor award at the 2005 Oscars. This guy is awesome and sooo cute in this movie!

It was on IFC, and it stole 3 hours of my life. There just doesn't seem to be a plot. Nothing in the film seems to get resolved. The acting is OK, but the directing is awful. There are several instances where you're just looking at someone staring off into space for perhaps a whole minute or longer. You don't get to see what they're looking at, or what they're thinking about, you just see the blank look on their face and that's it. At the end of the movie, I'm sure that's how I looked.

But soon enough the story turns formulaic as too much coke is vacuumed up and everyone pays for the character's excesses, especially the audience.

All the actors were very good but this film really belongs to Burt Reynolds who gave a tour-de-force performance as Jack Horner. For this being Burt's greatest performance, he got royally screwed by the academy.  Like Robin Williams was THAT good in ""Good Will Hunting"". P.T. Anderson who did the equally good ""Hard Eight"", has great poise and energy in his writing. How could you every forget a name like Dirk Diggler?  ""Boogie Nights"" in my book was the best film in 1997 and is near a masterpiece to me.  Others will find it boring, disturbing, gross, whatever, the point is, that this is a film that people are going to remember for years.

But when I saw it (about one year ago) i knew at once that I had missed out on probably the greatest film of the 90`s!! I sat for two and a half hours and I was simply stunned! I cried, I laughed and when the end came I was sad. I really didn`t want it to end. First of all, I was deeply moved and touched by this film and I can`t say it enough, Mark Wahlberg is simply magnificent in this film and portrays Dirk Diggler with passion and skill. It`s really a kind of sad story and you begin to feel sorry for Dirk, but you know that he has himself to thank.The best thing about this pic maybe, is the acting. Academy Award nominee Burt Reynolds in the role of his life! Great and if nothing less, SUPERB!! Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman, Julianne Moore, Melora Walters, John C.Reilly, P.S.Hoffman, William H.Macy, Phillip Baker Hall and Heather Graham!! Every each and one of them delivers blistering performances and makes this movie unforgettable.The director/writer Paul Thomas Anderson is one of my personal favourits and i do believe he will continue to make great films in the future. His excellent style in camerawork and his intense and brilliant scripts are all known qualities. I think and I mean that he really deserved that Oscar for Best Original Screenplay!! I would already categorize P.T.Anderson as one of greatest and most promising director/writers of all time.The best movie of the 90`s and why stop there?! This movie is the best movie I have ever seen and I think it`s one of the all-time top-ten!! I give it 10/10!!

458,paul_monks,"Boogie Nights OR ""How I learned to ignore the consequences, and love the freedom of the 1970's.""",9,8 August 2001,"Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any would-be filmmaker should take a long hard look at.  Sure, you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from Hitchcock to Scorsese; but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half-heartedly.Where to begin, I suppose one could look at the film as simply a story, perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970's porn industry-and what an industry it was!  The other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and *ahem* rubber.  But honestly, Boogie Nights brings back the pure, no-bul!shi$, in your face kind of cinema I haven't experienced since the film greats of the 1970's...ironic...or stroke of genius.  The story is full of richly detailed characters, all of which you either can relate too, love, or hate; but the impact is clear-you are feeling something for them.  Among the characters the two performances which stand out are: Burt Reynolds as Director Jack Horner, and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brillant, as is Heather Graham...but if I focus on any one actor it would have to be John C. Reilly.  John's performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion...I'm a sucker for the line ""Ever see the movie Star Wars?...People say I look like Han Solo.""  Anyway, the look of the film is incredible, the Director of Photography and Director/Writer/Producer, have come up with a vibrant colour, and flashy style that compares to Martin Scorsese, and Stanley Kubrick(in terms of his perfection of his craft); but with creating his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the longest single shot I'ver ever seen...that being the New Year's party sequence.The music, like in any great film, is a character of its own.  At times, it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief...but mainly its all about fun, dancing, and having a good time; the spirit of the 1970's. OK, back to the performances.Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of ""film"" means to his genre.  The awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape. The lose of his art, as it were...and the changes in mentality to the people he works with.  Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character.  For all those individuals who have seen Burton's Planet of the Apes, pay no attention to the performance of Wahlberg in that film...rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make!Julianne Moore plays the would-be mother to all, and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels, as life imitates art; and she loses all those close to her.  Heather Graham is the eye-candy, but later holds her own, and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds himself.  Each character is multidimensional, rich with life, and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part.The film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting, and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fast-pace 1970's. It makes no excuses, and tells no lies; and offers the audience a trip back. But even more importantly, the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made; and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film.",Boogie Nights

It has just enough entertainment, just enough great acting, just enough of everything. As a younger person, in the 1990's it was shocking, now it is mild in subject matter, but the subject matter is why I took off one star -- there were too many nude scenes. The other star is taken off, because, for all of its grit, the movie was a happy one, with a happy ending. That's not how it usually goes in life. The most wonderful aspect of the movie was the performance by Don Cheadle. His character was just sweet. I loved the scene where he changed his look, and met his new love. I wish that he had more starring roles with comedic value. He is a human heart!",Boogie Nights
460,SavageJack,Beautiful film of a somewhat touchy subject matter...,10,9 January 2004,"What can I say but that this is a simply beautiful and amazing film.Right now, let me say that it's NOT a movie my grandma would approve of but hey...I know that the whole subject of the 70's porn industry isn't exactly something that people would admittedly want to outright say that they admire, and I myself am somewhat reserved in recommending this movie to others because everyone will look at it differently.  But still, it's just such a great story!  Eddie's rise to stardom and the life of luxury and then his eminent downward spiral.Another aspect that most people might not notice or admire (although all movie buffs would of course) was Anderson's use of extended shots to capture many different conversations and actions going on in the same scene.  The transitions are really cool.  Sometimes I wonder how many takes it might have taken them to get just what they wanted out of a single shot.Finally the part of the film that really makes it stand out for me is the amazing use and choices of music throughout the movie.  The music really gets you into the groove of that swingin' party life of the 70's.  If nothing else, go get the soundtrack.Overall for me, I would say that this movie is an 8.5/10, but the music just bumps it up to 9.5 or 10/10.  It's just that good.",Boogie Nights
461,oopsigotshot,More than what it seems,10,14 November 2002,"** Thematic Spoilers **Since the debut of Boogie Nights, critics have observed P.T. Anderson's movies become more abstract and metaphorical.  Some would say that Boogie Nights is his only fully intact movie, in that it's main purpose isn't to reveal some other hidden meaning.In contrast, many casual viewers thought Boogie Nights was simply the story of a porn star. None of these people paid attention to the plot of the movie, and to whom the director is at the same time.  P.T. Anderson certainly didn't attain his joy for hidden meanings all of a sudden.  As anyone who has followed his career knows, it's in everything he makes. It's the kind of filmmaker he is.In short, just as several great movies before it, Boogie Nights is the story of America in the 70's through the 80's.  The climate in the movie follows that of the nation to a T.  The soft, fun and enjoyable 70's make way to the drugged, over-indulgent 80's with the striking image of, well, how's a double murder by and suicide of a jealous husband?Another P.T. Anderson trait, being coincidence of events, is overwhelmingly present in the movie.  A prime example being the night of 2 beatings and a very strange robbery, as well as the colonel's house being a magnet for Corvette's.Off the topic of the script itself, the acting is superb.  Rarely do you see so much acting talent in a movie.  The atmosphere of the movie fit the time it is set in perfectly.  The music fits well, and isn't over used (a trend that many 70's-80's movies were unable to resist).  It's very hard to find significant faults in the movie.I give it 4 stars (out of 4). The movie is extremely enjoyable. It's clever without being overbearing, it has all of the major cinematic elements, it succeeds in dissecting a delicate subject matter (pornography) without being overly vulgar, and the quality is exceptional.  To top it off, this is of a relatively amateur writer & director.See it.",Boogie Nights
462,laurakerr100,A view of the 70's,8,14 January 2009,"What did the 70's look like? Grime and brown looking at documentaries etc. But there was a sleazy glamour about the time which the 1980's clean look didn't have. Boogie Nights captures the feel for the era remarkably well its this which makes the film so good. Set in the 1970s porn industry at a time when employment rights in porn were are distant as any sense of rights in the decade of Watergate.Burt Reynolds as Director Jack Horner shows all the sleaziness and exploitation. Excellent casting as Reynolds fame as a hunk with a sense of danger in all the 70's macho action movies which had little sense of moral direction.The story of the film of a 1970's period piece has been revived by the like of Quentin Tarrantino in the form of homages and have failed because of their insistence on referencing the 1970's instead of the atmosphere. Boogie Nights instead uses full characterisation of the roles: Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Grahame all that is essential to make a film good instead of just successful.A great film on a tacky subject from a gloriously tacky era.",Boogie Nights
463,velvetburglar,Unashamedly cinematic and humanistic classic,10,18 August 2009,"Boogie Nights was not Paul Thomas Anderon's first film--that was 1996's Hard Eight-- but it was the first one he had full artistic control over and the result is a real tour de force. Except for Citizen Kane I have probably never seen a movie so enthusiastically cinematic. He is not afraid to use split screens and other unfashionable film techniques, and because he is not afraid to use them they work. This is one of the most confident films I've ever seen. Anderson's camera moves through the scenes like a kid in a candy store, floating about gayly eying everything around it but never coming to a full stop because there is so much other stuff to see. And there is certainly a lot to see. Boogie Nights is a huge ensemble, but Anderson never really gets lost in the scope (there is admittedly one storyline that doesn't really go anywhere, but it serves to advance the other threads so it's fine). Take the opening scene of the movie. Faced with the problem of introducing such a huge cast, Anderson decides to ""dive right in"" and brings us to a nightclub where the entire cast is partying. We don't exactly meet anybody during this scene, as the camera just floats from booths to the dancefloor to the kitchen and back around, and we overhear out-of-context blurts from the characters as we pass them much as we would were we walking through the club ourselves. However, the blurts are revealing--Luis Guzman wants Burt Reynolds to put him in a film someday. Don Cheadle's fashion sense is questionable. Julianne Moore is like a mother to Heather Graham. William Macy is more concerned with business details than the carefree Reynolds. By the end of the scene we feel like we have a pretty reasonable grasp on the scene these people run in.This speaks to Anderson's other great strength as a filmmaker--his writing. People often talk about his camera and how it relates him to his idols like Scorsese and Ophüls, but rarely mentioned is his ability to create wonderful characters. Boogie Nights, like another great ensemble, Robert Altman's Nashville, is a movie that really feels lived-in. We do not for a second doubt that these are real people, and they occupy our imagination long after the runtime is up. The movie is bursting at the seams with life. Anderson is anything but a lazy filmmaker. He loads the characters with traits that might not seem ""essential"" to a lesser writer, but end up giving the characters the necessary human qualities to make the story really touching. Would Boogie Nights be as moving if Mark Wahlberg wasn't obsessed with karate, and didn't pump himself up by doing punching exercises in front of the mirror before porn shoots? Or if John C Reilly and Don Cheadle didn't have ambitions of becoming a magician and a stereo equipment salesman, respectively? I think not. Boogie Nights is a classic film in the same sense as The Godfather--the filmmaker takes us into a world unknown to most of us, one many of us might think unsavory, and creates a truly moving piece of human drama. And like Nashville, it being so full of life makes it truly life-affirming. Boogie Nights is one of the few movies that not only makes me feel like I've learned more about human beings, but also makes me truly happy to be one.",Boogie Nights

Anderson is one of the most talented new directors in Hollywood and has an amazing cast that play off each other very well.  Every actor was cast perfectly for each role and all deliver great performances.  This movie's setting is the 70's pornography industry, so many people expect the movie to be close to soft porn.  Nothing could be further from the truth; there is very little nudity considering the setting. The movie is not about the pron industry, but instead on the lives of a few main characters, who happen to work in this business. This is one of my favorite movies ever and anyone who enjoys movies set in the 70's and 80's should see it.  I hope Anderson can keep delivering films like this and Magnolia.",Boogie Nights

The story starts when Jack introduces himself to 17 year old high school drop-out Eddie Adams in San Fernando Valley nightclub after hearing rumors that Eddie is 14"" long in the ""Mr. Torpedo"" area.At the same time we are introduced Rollergirl (Heather Graham), a high schooler already making a career as a porn star & Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), a 30 something cocaine addict who lost visitation rights to her young son because of her chosen career. Over the course of the next few days Eddie moves out of home after a fight with his mother and into Jack's house. Where we are introduced via a party to the rest of the characters including Reed Rothchild (John C.

The people around Eddie are falling too but they always stick by one another.

We also meet Reed Rothchild played by John C. Reilly and Buck Swope played by Don Cheadle.These characters are all brilliant, Julianne Moore becomes the mother hen as we learn that her child was taken away from her due to the porn business she is in and the main character Eddie Adams (who re-names himself Dirk Diggler as his porn name) slowly slips into drug problems and greed.My favourite scene in the whole film is when Dirk, Rothchild and Todd played by Thomas Jane, go to see Rahad Jackson played by Alfred Molina for drugs which then escalates into violence as when he gets his pump-action shotgun out.overall Boogie nights is a must see, an exuberant film and if you like Boogie Nights I also recommend the directors other films 'There will be blood and Magnolia.",Boogie Nights
468,jjgavillet1,"a movie about a porn star, that isn't about a porn star.",10,17 May 2012,"Starting against a black screen with fade in credits, Michael Penn scores broken circus music that whistles triumph and failure of the grandest scale. The warped tones and drowned out laughter provides a foreshadowing of the gradual downfall of a man we all see ourselves in. This score leads into the epic one-shot opening of Boogie Nights, set to Best of My Love, which shoots us into the glamorous world of the social circle we will eventually join.Paul Thomas Anderson makes his mark by direction in every front. Sporting Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, John C. Reilly, Phillip Seymour Hoffman as an incredible ensemble as is, PTA directs these actors to preform their roles as simple-minded humans who are just trying to find self-assurance of their own worth in a complex world. All characters seem to have a heart of gold, but lead themselves into disaster by no fault but their own human mistakes. PTA refuses to let us find their job as machines in the porn industry as an excuse to pass them as lesser human, as he sets them in scenes with one another that establish their puppy-dog-like loyalty to one another in hope to feel and be loved, to feel a sense of belonging, to find a home which can celebrate them for their own achievements and be proud in one another alongside themselves.Beyond the raw emotive scenes of ones darkened past and fuzzy future, we are drawn in by all stylistic choices that make this epic feel incredibly intimate. PTA directs cinematographer Robert Elswit to capture the story a very distinct way. Seeing influences such as Marty Scorsese in his quick zooms, stylistic incoming vignettes, heavy steady cam and dolly shots between drawn out nearly theatrical drawn out scenes with complex blocking, challenge traditional film making standards of quality, in that it draws sever attention to the audience of the film being in fact, a film, and fictional. However, his direction to his cast and writing which previously mentioned, is impeccably human, seems to cancel this heavily orchestrated style to challenge the viewer to choose what is in fact real or unreal, to suspend disbelief and yet honor the film as a film in a rather superficial and frankly dumbed-down manner that puts us in the same position as the characters.In addition to all external direction PTA approached for this movie, we see heavily influence and reflection from PTA himself. Besides being set in the 70s in San Fernando Valley around the protagonist as a 17 year old, we have several other moments and key features that we see PTA projecting from himself. Early on we have a glimpse into the life of Eddie Edams (Wahlberg) in his dysfunctional relationship wit his mother through a heated, raw exchange that ends in his estrangement. In commentary of this film, PTA shares this is merely a glimpse into a real-life exchange between his mother and himself. He has admitted on other occasions to being estranged from his mother. As we as an audience question the reasoning to the anger, accusatory sense, and aggression the mother has for her son, PTA is there with us, questioning the motives of his own mother, of questions he himself could not answer.The real word that emerges to describe this movie is ""momentum"". From literal camera styles of quick pace pull ins, to a blossoming storyline that illuminates us with the wonders and woes of ambiguous characters who we don't think to question their origin but accept their presence in the most intimate nature, this movie has an unexpected ""edge-of-your-seat"" nature that keeps your heart in an emotional roller-coaster. In the end, we are left to feel a sense of home as we learn, with the characters, that it shall be wherever you strive to make it.",Boogie Nights

This is one of the best movies I hav seen in the recent past where the story of it revolves between the pornographers,it is set in late 1970's and early 1980's, like, wat were the conditions of this pornography at that time and how well would they fare and how these porn films hav slowly transformed into videotapes(less story with hardcore sex), more importantly the emotions of the pornographers(actors,technicians,etc.) and how hard is life for these pornographers out there in the contemporary world.The concoction of all these elements is 'Boogie Nights' and the director of this movie,Paul Thomas Anderson did complete justice to the script.And each and every actor of the movie (Mark Wahlberg,Julianne Moore,Burt Reynolds)gav their 100% to the movie, it's really a team effort. It's the director of the movie who should be credited for his work which will make our asses stuck to the seats from start to the end.Trust me frns u'll enjoy watchin it.

Anyway, they all support one another and hang out at parties together during the holidays (instead of Christmas parties, it's New Year's Eve parties).

There are three living directors today (or directing teams) who write their own screenplays that can really tell the best stories on film. Quentin Tarantino, Joel and Ethan Coen, and last, but most definitely not least, Paul Thomas Anderson.

After Dirk leaves the porn industry in pursuit of a music career the film takes an amazing change in an almost Quentin Tarantinoish sort of way. People are being shot left and right, cocaine becomes a prominent crutch in the lives of the people involved in the film as they try to clean up and move on.

All a coke head has to do is open the bag and smell it. Baby powder will fool no dope fiend. Finally, this film is loosely based on scumbag John Holmes, who pimped out his 15-year-old girlfriend for coke, and beat her when she arrived with the cash.

Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" is a worthy example.""Boogie Nights"" is a historical account of certain eminent trends, social structures and patterns that existed at the time. Set between 1977 and 1983, the film portrays the pornographic film industry in California at its peak, and its imminent downfall, invoked by the introduction of the video tape - something that reduced the creative ambition of the porn filmmakers to a simple push-button recording and introduced competition from anonymous amateurs to the business.It appears that the people involved in the industry (actors, producers, directors, technicians) all lived in a sort of a ghetto (flashy and glossy nonetheless); had they ever dared to part from it, they would have had inevitably gotten burned - either by the stigma that had been cast on them, or in the face of the fact that their abilities in the real world were never held at a high price, which is what lured them into the industry in the first place. It is obvious, then, that inside this little world, these people have found a haven where they could appear important, a universe which was built upon and sustained through all sorts of hedonistic temptations and dubious financial sources. It was a cocaine-fed lie, and they knew it.""Boogie Nights"" describes the paradigm shift of the sex cinema industry in a similar manner in which ""Gone with the Wind"" approached the abolition of slavery as an eclipse of the civilization of the South. One of the film's features is that it loosely depicts real-life characters and situations, like the film's Dirk Diggler (Wahlberg's character) posing for John Holmes in real life. This is what makes characters of the film all the more believable; they are ignorant, shallow, terrified and self-indulgent. The soundtrack of the film is impressively appropriate.Certain scenes definitely make cinema history, like the one in Alfred Molina's character's apartment, where an unexplained Chinese character, probably in an opium-induced frenzy, explodes fire-crackers every half a minute or so. The story-telling in scenes such as this one hits the mark in expressing the state of the characters' minds. The film is simply brilliant.",Boogie Nights

486,clarejar,A tongue in cheek look at the heroes of porn,7,10 September 2018,"Last night I watched ""Boogie Nights"" maybe as a sort of a tribute to Burn Reynolds, none of whose movies I've seen up till now. I""ll be talking to a limited number of people who haven't seen it yet, but here goes!If you're expecting lots of cheesy 70s fashion and disco music the movie delivers a tiny bit of this, but it is primarily a drama, not a period piece. The movie's focus is the rise and fall (pardon the pun!) of its main character, Dirk Diggler, who is based on the real life American porn star John Holmes. The movie begins with the young Dirk being spotted as a seventeen year old in a club by porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds). Not particularly intelligent, he determines that he can use his one particular talent (being good in bed) to make something of himself. After having a vicious argument with an emotionally abusive mother he accepts Jack's offer to pursue a career as a porn actor and moves in with him. As the protege of Jack and Maggie (Jack's porn star partner) he makes friends and becomes successful. The movie shows Diggler winning awards and beginning a series of movies that combine porn with light entertainment, however it all begins to go wrong when he is introduced to drugs by coke addict Maggie. In the following months his mood swings, egocentric outbursts and inability to perform result in him being fired. In order to get by he resorts to prostitution, a failed attempt at a singing career and finally a drug deal that goes spectacularly and cataclysmically wrong in what is perhaps the film's most memorable scene.There are notable character performances in Boogie Nights from Don Cheadle, Heather Graham and Phillip Seymour-Hoffman but it's Mark Wahlberg who really commands attention in every frame. He portrays Diggler with only slight comedic overtones as an earnest character who really wants to believe in the artistic integrity of what he does. This is played opposite Burn Reynolds' Jack who acts as a father figure in this world in which sex is mundane and openly performed without embarrassment or moral significance attached. This is the source of the movie's comedy, but I suspect for the average viewer it also makes the characters hard to relate to. In short, it's a movie packed full of gutsy performances and memorable scenes. However personally it failed to resonate with me immediately and might require one or two repeat watches. The strange nature of the characters makes it difficult to understand the world that Diggler is moving through, and this is the flaw that detracts from an otherwise excellent movie.",Boogie Nights
487,john-a-hannigan,One of the best films of the 90s,8,9 May 2006,"Boogie Nights is possibly one of the most completely watchable films i've seen, it has everything going for it, a great ensemble cast, a cool soundtrack, fantastic dialogue and amazing camera-work. I used to seriously doubt Mark Wahlberg's ability as an actor, but after seeing this film i saw that a good script and good direction can really bring out the best in him. To be honest there's not a bad performance from any of the actors in his movie,. Those i found most noteworthy besides Wahlberg were John.C.Reilly and Don Cheadle who really excelled in their roles. Also the cameo from Alfred Molina as the Russian roullette playing drug dealer is simply class. This movie depicts the pitfalls of showbusiness in the 70's and 80's wonderfully and although its quite long it never lags and in my opinion is an instant classic.",Boogie Nights
