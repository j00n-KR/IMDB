0,MartinHafer,"Not really a comedy...and, surprisingly, a bit grim.",4,20 July 2020,"IMDB lists this film as a comedy romance. Well, I can see the romance part but a comedy? No. In fact, the film, despite starring Andy Samberg, is certainly NOT a comedy nor is it funny....and I really don't think it was intended to be.The film is a reworking of the basic concept in ""Groundhog Day""...a guy (Samberg) keeps repeating the same day again and again and again. The big differences are that others CAN get stuck in this same time loop as him and it's just not funny nor sweet like ""Groundhog Day"". In fact, although most reviews are very, very favorable and it has an overall score of 7.5, I didn't enjoy it very much. Part of it was that I never liked the characters and part of it was that the film, at times, was dark and bleak...and unnecessarily crude. Overall, a film many like...but I felt underwhelmed.",Palm Springs
1,Prismark10,Palm Springs,7,14 April 2021,Palm Springs is a fun time loop comedy. Mainly because it assumes that the audience is familiar with the Groundhog Day concept so it hits the ground running.Nyles (Andy Samberg ) has been reliving the same day for ages. He goes to the wedding each day of a friend of his live in girlfriend Misty (Meredith Hagner) who is also cheating on him.At the wedding Nyles hooks up with the bride's sister Sarah (Cristin Milioti) who has got sloshed at the wedding.Later Nyles is attacked by a stranger with a crossbow and runs for safety.He then relives the day again. Only this time Sarah is in the time loop with him. She followed him into a cave that contained some kind of a time vortex.Sarah has to get used to her new life like Nyles. However she plans to escape from the time loop. She also gets Nyles to confront the stranger who keeps attacking him.This is an enjoyable romantic comedy. The two leads have a good chemistry. It is a good reworking of Groundhog Day as well as Russian Doll as the characters reveal a little more about themselves on each new day.,Palm Springs
2,nogodnomasters,"You can't break up with me, I am breaking up with you.",7,17 February 2021,"Nyles (Andy Samberg ) is stuck in a time loop on a friend's wedding day. He keeps going because he likes the food. He meets Sarah (Cristin Milioti ) who parties too much. He picks her up and they go out into the desert for some fun and when things go bad, she ends up in wedding ""Ground's Day"" with Nyles. Nyles likes the fact of living forever while Sarah wants out.The film was cute in spite of the time loop thing being over done. I thought the roles were designed with Jesse Eisenberg and Aubrey Plaza in mind and they didn't have the budget.Guide: F-word. Sex. No nudity.",Palm Springs
3,kosmasp,Paradise for a day,9,25 September 2020,"Or is it? Sometimes you can't tell. Also while this is reminiscent of a Bill Murray classic, it does not contain the moral lesson. At least it is not meant to be taken that way. Doesn't mean there is not good things happening and characters developing. It just not as attached to the story or rather resolution as the Murray movie was.Having said that, this also is more in the R-rated territory. So while it has some nice moments, it also isn't afraid of pulling punches. This is really funny and the two leads give it their all. Even JK Simmons who's barely in it, is as grounded (no pun intended) as he always is. But it is about the chemistry of the two lead actors and it really translates more than well. Brooklyn 99 fans and/or Lonely Island fans don't need me to tell them this anyway. Yes he also did SNL, which seems ages away ... comedy is his thing, no doubt about it.",Palm Springs
4,Tweekums,Groundhog Wedding,8,12 April 2021,"Nyles is attending a wedding in Palm Springs with his girlfriend; his behaviour seems somewhat unusual, he turns up dressed for the beach rather than in formal wear, but later on, he rescues the bride's sister, Sarah, as her toast is a bit of a disaster. Through the evening they get closer and head into the desert together. Just as they are about to get intimate a strange man attacks Nyles with a bow and arrow. Injured, he heads into a mysterious cave, warning Sarah not to follow. She does and they both wake up and it is once again the morning of the wedding. For Nyles this day has been repeating for almost as long as he can remember but for Sarah it is the first time of many. As the wedding day repeats Sarah tries to make sense of it, figure out how to get out and gradually grows closer to Nyles. Of course there will be problems for them both.The idea of a day repeating is hardly new, 'Groundhog Day' did it in '93 and 'Happy Death Day' gave it a horror twist more recently... that doesn't mean this is unoriginal though. Having one character already caught in the time loop when the story starts adds something new as it means Sarah has a guide, of sorts, when she too is caught up. The story is fairly obviously a rom-com but it escapes many of that genres clichés, often by mixing in the fun clichés of the smaller time loop genre... most notably varied deaths suffered by those in the loop. There are lots of laughs to be had throughout the film. The cast is solid; most obviously Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti as Nyles and Sarah. While only in a relatively small roll, as the man hunting Nyles, J. K. Simmons steals every scene he is in. There is quite a lot of swearing, which might put some viewers off but if it doesn't bother you this film is well worth watching if you want a good laugh and some romance.",Palm Springs
5,paul_haakonsen,When stuck in a time-loop...,6,31 March 2021,"Well, if you enjoy time-loop movies, in the likes of ""Groundhog Day"", ""Boss Level"" or ""Edge of Tomorrow"", then you should also enjoy the 2020 movie ""Palm Springs"" from writers Andy Siara and Max Barbakow.Sure, the main concept of ""Palm Springs"" is something that has been done and seen numerous times already in other movies where the characters in the movie are bound to relive the same day over and over again. But it should be said that ""Palm Springs"" with director Max Barbakow at the helm actually manages to bring something truly enjoyable and entertaining to the table.The storyline, whilst being fairly straight forward in terms of the same day repeating itself, was actually offering more than just your average repetitive comedy. And was definitely with the performances from Andy Samberg (playing Nyles) and Cristin Milioti (playing Sarah) that helped bring the movie's story to life on the screen in a very interesting and enjoyable manner.Writers Andy Siara and Max Barbakow actually manages to keep the storyline interesting and constantly evolving, despite of it being one of those repeating-the-same-day-over-and-over movies. So that was quite the accomplishment.Aside from Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti then ""Palm Springs"" also have the likes of J. K. Simmons and Peter Gallagher on the cast list in some good supportive roles.I found ""Palm Springs"" to be a nicely made and told movie, and it was one that definitely was a wholehearted and a feel-good movie. It is a movie that I certainly will recommend you take the time to sit down and watch.My rating of the 2020 movie ""Palm Springs"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Palm Springs
6,BandSAboutMovies,Shockingly enjoyable,8,19 February 2021,"All of the time loop films of the last year or two - Happy Death Day 2U, Boss Level, The Map of Tiny Perfect Things, Koko-di Koko-da, Game Over, The Obituary of Tunde Johnson, Russian Doll, See You Yesterday - all follow that Groundhog Day-style approach of the same day happening over and over again. Of course, we can also point to 1990s 12:01 PM, which part of the Showtime 30-Minute Movie entries.The idea is pretty rich and particularly so this year, where it really does feel like every day is exactly the same as we're trapped in our homes. Of course, like all movie trends, this one has seemingly been done to death, but can Palm Springs - a movie that escapes my radar when it played Sundance in 2020 and then went to Hulu in July - do it better?This movie succeeds because of the likability of its two leads, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, who have discovered a cave that allows them to repeat the same day endlessly. I kind of loved how this film didn't seem like it was about that at all until JK Simmons murders Samberg to end the day. The trailer spoils this, I spoiled this and now, we must all realize what we've done.Actually, the spoiler is just fine. The real beauty of this movie is how the characters actually grow instead of just experiencing day after day. It also benefits from a rich cast, which includes a great cameo from physicist Clifford V. Johnson, Dale Dickey, Jena Friedman, June Squibb (who was also great in another wedding movie, Table 19), Peter Gallagher, Camila Mendes, Tyler Hoechlin (who played the kid in Road to Perdition) and Meredith Hagner.This is a film that matter of factly gets across very open sexuality - what would you do if you could sleep with the same people over and over?* - and explores what a time loop centered around a wedding really would be like. I really loved how Simmons' character comes in and out of the story, along with the very real emotional damage these characters suffer as their bodies are often destroyed multiple times.Director Max Barbakow hasn't done many full-length films and neither has writer Andy Siara. I'm truly excited to see what they do next, as this movie could have been completely saccharine and instead became something wonderful. It's surprising at nearly every turn and quite emotional.Now, back to living the same day I've been living since last March.*According to IMDB, Samberg's character was trapped in the loop for somewhere between forty and forty million years.",Palm Springs
7,evanston_dad,Quirky and Charming,8,21 July 2020,"For a film that rips its premise off the ultimate time loop movie, ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Palm Springs"" is surprisingly unpredictable and exceedingly charming. It's got an anarchic anything goes vibe and a pair of vibrant actors, Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, who also happen to have a ton of chemistry together. It's a movie for our very troubled times and seems tailor made for a quarantined audience, where day bleeds into day and the repetition of the weekly grind is sending many of us to the loony bin. The sweet message at the center of this otherwise naughty film is that it's not the what we do that keeps us happy but rather the who we do it with. It's all about appreciating the little things that make life worth living moment to moment rather than focusing all of our energies on the big things that we chase at the risk of letting peace and contentment pass us right on by.This message is most effectively encapsulated in the character played by J.K. Simmons, who spends the first half of the movie trying to kill Andy Samberg and then has a great scene toward the end that makes the most mundane situation imaginable seem like a little piece of heaven. How I can relate to that right now.....Grade: A-",Palm Springs
8,deloudelouvain,"A modern Groundhog Day, even funnier to me.",8,6 September 2020,"You could compare Palm Springs with Groundhog Day (1993), this version is just a modern take of that classic movie but it's certainly as funny if not funnier. I liked both of the movies but I prefer Andy Samberg to Bill Murray. Bill Murray was more of a grumpy unsastified character whilst Andy Samberg has a more laidback-not-giving-a-toss character. It's not completely the same story though. Palm Springs has a lot of good humorous scenes, and Andy Sambergs usual funny face and expressions are contributing to that. Since Brooklyn Nine-Nine I'm a fan of Andy Samberg, he has everything to become the new star comedian. And even if his previous movie Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping didn't leave me with a great impression this one is certainly a step forward. Palm Springs is for the fans of silly comedies, with a touch of romance, but it's not the typical romcom as for that the plot is also interesting to watch. There are elements that make it intriguing, things you have to think about. A comedy that I will for sure watch again in the future.",Palm Springs
9,siderite,Infinite time loop romance,8,27 February 2021,"This is Groundhog Day ver 2.0, with updated references, upgraded sexy actors and kind of the same plot. To me this kind of story always makes me insanely angry: how dare they underuse an infinite time loop? Do they realize they could learn everything there is on the Internet?! But enough about me.The acting was good, the characters compelling, but the story is not bringing a lot to the table. I mean, yeah, Cristin is someone one could look at for an eternity and not have a problem with it, but there was nothing captivating in the film other than the chemistry between the two leads. Also, considering the ending, I would say she would have soon gotten bored with the guy. And also beside the two characters, nothing else was fleshed out in any way. All of the other people at the wedding were cardboard.",Palm Springs
10,blanbrn,"Fun funny go back or stay in time film that connects with themes of courage, and escape!",8,18 July 2020,"""Palm Springs"" is one film as you watch you will enjoy it's hard not to like as it blends connection and romance with some fun laughs. It involves Nyles(Andy Samberg) a lonely down on his luck guy who after attending a wedding meets and becomes attracted to the brides sister Sarah(the wonderful Cristin Milioti) and all of a sudden it's like magic as both of their lives have changed forever. It's like the same day each day they live over.Maybe your thinking ""Back to the Future"" still each day the characters have new adventures and grow each time though thru each repeat they learn to take chances and the courage is unmatched to explore people and places. Love and laughs is filled along the way. Really call it a journey adventure or an escape from the norm ""Palm Springs"" is a thumbs up winner that travels quick and pleases. As much love, sex appeal, and learning is felt by watching the film.",Palm Springs
11,cherold,funny and surprisingly romantic take on the endless day genre,8,26 July 2020,"This very funny movie involves two people eternally reliving someone's wedding day.From the trailer I expected a level of wackiness commensurate with that of co-star Andy Samberg's Brooklyn-99 series, but while this is often very silly and very thoughtful, it's also existential, thoughtful, and increasingly romantic. Cristin Milioti is great as the one who can't adjust to her strange reality, and she and Samberg have great chemistry as they flirt and fight under extraordinary circumstances.This is just really fun and you should definitely watch it.",Palm Springs

13,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Fun in the sun.,7,25 April 2021,"I suppose that the basic premise of 'Palm Springs (2020)' is technically somewhat of a spoiler, especially since it was hidden prior to the film's release. However, it's almost impossible to discuss the feature without discussing its concept. Therefore, if you don't want this element of the movie spoiled, stop reading this right now (and, if you fancy a well-paced and satisfying alternative rom-com, go watch the thing; it's good). So, it turns out that the film is a part of the time-loop genre pioneered by 'Groundhog Day (1993)'. Like that cinematic classic, the thing focuses on a man who finds himself living the same day over and over again with seemingly no way of escaping his new reality. The difference here comes in the form of the ability to bring others into the loop, something which allows our lead to experience his lonely, repetitive existence in an entirely new way: sharing it with someone else. This forms the core of the narrative, which is basically a romantic comedy about two people who have to confront their deepest fears in order to actually connect. The picture moves at an absolute clip, barely slowing down for a second. Because it's very aware that most members of the audience will be familiar with at least one other film in its increasingly popular sub-genre, it sort of skips over much of the initial set-up that's usually required for such high-concept fare. Having said that, this context isn't so much missing as it is incredibly efficient. The film feels finely tuned in almost every aspect, as concentrated as it can possibly be. Of course, this leads to an engaging and energetic experience. There's never a dull moment, so you're never even close to being bored. Its comedy is generally successful, even if there are only a handful of laugh-out-loud moments, and its characters are surprisingly well-rounded. Plus, it also touches on some rather deep themes and deals with them in an interesting, if ultimately predictable, way. It's just really enjoyable. One of its plot-lines is a little underdeveloped in some ways, but it comes together satisfyingly nevertheless. In the end, this is a well-cast and generally charming rom-com. It sets itself apart from its peers in a couple of intriguing ways and, generally speaking, it's just really competent. Even though it's typically unsurprising (at least in its wider arcs), it's an entertaining, pacy and actually somewhat uplifting experience. 7/10.",Palm Springs
14,dromasca,smart entertainment,8,15 December 2020,"'Palm Springs' directed by Max Barbakow (incredibly at his first feature film) is for me the good surprise of the end of this strange cinematic year 2020. It is also a film that proves once again, if necessary, to skeptics and cynics that there are entertainment films and romantic comedies that do not insult the intelligence of viewers, and that 'feel good' movies can contain a dose of fantastic (and even references to quantum mechanics). The premiere of 'Palm Springs' took place at the Sundance Film Festival, after which the movie was supposed to be screened in theaters, but then the world froze and same as many other productions Barbakow's film had to find a streaming platform as its main broadcast channel. I'm so sorry for their missed opportunity, because this funny movie would have had good chances to be the big surprise and maybe even one of the blockbusters of the summer of 2020. Unfortunately, COVID-19 had other plans.The film begins with the awakening of Nyles (Andy Samberg), on a sunny morning in a resort in the middle of the desert, where he accompanies his (not very committed) girlfriend to the wedding where she is the bridesmaid. Nyles, a rather non-conformist guy, almost ruins the party with an impromptu speech influenced by intense drinking at the bar, and later in the nighr he he meets Sarah (Cristin Milioti), the bride's sister and the family's 'black sheep'. The two seem to have a 'click' that will take them to the desert at night where the beginning of a sexual encounter is interrupted by an event ... and here I stop telling more about the story so as to avoid falling into the sin of spoiling.What happens next is a combination of crazy and romantic, fantasy and clever comedy. Many comments on the film mention that the inspiration comes from 'Groundhog Day', a film I have not seen. What I can say is that I did not find any logical flaw in the script written by Andy Siara, who manages to give credibility to the pretext and substance of the characters, makes us viewers care about them, and even adds a touch of science with which the heroes will come out from a complicated situation. I didn't know the two lead actors or I don't remember them from other movies, but they both manage to win our empathy. J.K. Simmons, an actor we know from countless television series, is distributed here in a very different and original role. 'Palm Springs' is one of the best entertainments of the year, a kind and smart movie that I warmly recommend. It's fun.",Palm Springs
15,ThomasDrufke,One of the Best Rom-Com's of the Last 5 Years,9,27 July 2020,"As I've said in previous reviews and for many years, the modern day rom-com is nearly dead. There are outliers a few times a year typically but the formula was incredibly overdone back in the 1990's-2000's, that I think we began to grow numb of what a great rom-com can actually be. Palm Springs is a GREAT rom-com and it's also one of the best films of 2020, if not the best. Not to mention how perfect it is for the summer season and current quarantine most of the world is stuck in. What better than a rom-com about two characters stuck in a time-loop of never ending death at the end of their day? Even more impressively, Andy Samberg & Cristin Milioti have wonderful chemistry, enough to melt even the most cynical of movie-going audience's hearts. Palm Springs is nothing short of excellent.9.5/10",Palm Springs
16,Cineanalyst,Groundhog Day and Friends,8,10 July 2020,"It's like I said, I love ""Groundhog Day"" (1993). I've seen it over a hundred times.... But, I enjoy time-travel movies in general, including the time-loop variety in the vein of that Bill Murray-Harold Ramis classic, such as ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (2014) and Netflix's ""Russian Doll"" series. Time travel is an inherently cinematic notion, of an art form that literally consists of moments in time--still images, shots and scenes--along a continuum--what used to be the film strip--that may be edited, rearranged and begun again, reviewed by the spectator ad infinitum. The main difference of ""Palm Springs,"" although it's partially a continuation of a thread from ""Russian Doll,"" is that it places multiple characters in the time loop instead of just the usual lone (and usually male) protagonist--to wake up in the same place on the same day every day, always at a wedding in Palm Springs. Thus, there are shifts in perspective running concurrent with the temporal repetition of events and place. Besides offering a greater gender balance to the rom-com formula, this opens up an array of possibilities in montage and storytelling.In this case, the bifurcated narrative is largely exploited for efficiency. I'd be fine lingering in such a scenario, a sense Murray gives us in ""Groundhog Day,"" with his various schemes and explorations of his situation. It's a fantasy that's well suited to the episodic format of ""Russian Doll."" Unlike these prior efforts, however, ""Palm Springs"" rushes through and is able to do so because Andy Samberg's Nyles has been living this repeated plot for long before we caught up with him in the movie, and so he is able to quickly get Cristin Milioti's Sarah up to speed when she joins him in the repetition. Interestingly, the idea of beginning the picture with the male character having already re-lived the same day untold times was a feature of Danny Rubin's original screenplay for ""Groundhog Day,"" but Ramis altered this rather arthouse notion to an easier and more commercially-friendly beginning where we enter the time loop at the same moment with Murray. ""Palm Springs"" is able to have it both ways.Neither does ""Palm Spring"" afford much space to philosophical or religious musings. Indeed, Nyles declares on the first night we meet him that there's no god. Even the supposed quantum physics within the picture doesn't rise above the sophistication of an installment from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ultimately, ""Palm Springs"" is merely a place we're meant to inhabit fleetingly, for some laughs and the cliché love story conquering all. Some critics are surely tempted to analogize this version with the unraveling of habit and structure making days seemingly run into each other--losing track of time--for many in the real world of 2020 by isolating themselves or otherwise limiting their activities due to the pandemic, but the timing here is as accidental as that for the characters within the movie. No, ""Palm Springs"" is a lovely fantasy, where death is a reset button and where one feels more freedom than ever without the threat of tomorrow, as well as to experience it safely with others. There's no meaning underlying this romp beyond the hackneyed wholesomeness of family life provided by J.K. Simmons's Roy and romantic coupling that's the foundation of the entire premise. That's fine; fun need not always be wrapped in layers of existential profundity--a ""shaggy dog"" story will do. Some days are well enough by just enjoying the slight variations to the same format. I'll see ""Palm Springs"" again.",Palm Springs
17,cricketbat,Keeping things fresh in a time loop,8,3 February 2021,"Due to the repetitive nature of time loop movies, they have to be done right in order to keep the audience engaged the whole time. Palm Springs does it right. This film does a great job of keeping things fresh. Andy Samberg shows that he's more than just a goofball, and Cristin Milioti proves, once again, why she should have had a more prominent role on How I Met Your Mother. I wish this film were a little less vulgar, so it would be accessible to a broader audience, because I think more people should take a trip with Palm Springs.",Palm Springs

21,The-Sarkologist,Another Pretty Cool Timeloop Movie,8,9 December 2020,"There's something about time loop movies that are pretty cool, though I guess it probably has to do with Groundhog Day simply being one of those classic films that spur people on to adapt it to different situations. This one is certainly no different, and it does have some uniqueness about it that I particularly enjoyed. The difference with this one is that multiple people are actually trapped in the time loop, and they are able to interact with each other, which I thought was quite cool. The other thing is that while we know who is trapped in the loop, we don't know how long they have been in the loop, namely because they have been caught in it for so long.So, basically have this guy Nyles, who as you can guess, has been living this day over and over again. Like, it's a wedding where his girlfriend is a bridesmaid, and it is located out in the desert, Palms Springs to be precise. Obviously, he has used the opportunity to, well, pretty much try everything, and he also discovers and awful lot of secrets as well, such as his girlfriend being unfaithful to him. However, the catch comes when one night he is out in the desert with the maid of honour, and is attacked, and he flees into the cave, the one that originally started the time loop, and she follows him in.It's pretty cool actually, and while I'd suggest that it is slightly different to Groundhog Day, it still has a lot of the elements. It's pretty funny as well, especially with a lot of the shennanigans that he gets up to. In fact, it seems as if he has been in this loop for so long that he no longer cares, and it has just become part of his life. Not so with Sarah, who is looking for a way out, and decides that the only way to do it is through quantum physics. Actually, it's quite interesting how these days quantum physics is thrown around with the idea of time loops, but that is probably because despite having been around for about a hundred years, there is still a lot we really don't know about it. In fact, it is just another one of those 'new frontier' type of things film makers and such that is probably why it appears so often.Anyway, this is a pretty cool film, and quite funny as well. While it doesn't really break new ground, it's stull quite fun to watch.",Palm Springs

The plot follows Nyles (Adam Samberg) who is stuck in a time loop, reliving the same wedding day over and over. Stuck with an unfaitful girlfriend. Sarah (Cristin Millioti) who is living with regret and follows Nyles and gets stuck in a time loop with him. They both try to make a time of there lives.Fun plot. The movie does turn a lot of fun when Nyles and Sarah try to make most of it with there repetitive time. Like having fun and doing things differently. Having like a 1980s retro dance in a bar. Interrupting there girlfriends hook up. Ect. The film does leave you smiling and has a few laughs. Which does get a little few in between throughout.Adam Samberg is great with the role. Cristin Millioti is also perfect with the role. The music score was decent. Trying to be like a 1980s score. Yes, its a romantic comedy that does have a predictable ending.

26,eddie_baggins,"One of 2020's nicest surprises, Milioti will be a star",7,19 November 2020,"Once you've seen one time loop movie, in many ways you have seen them all but this years Sundance Film Festival hit Palm Springs, where the film was bought by streaming service Hulu for a mind-blowing 17,500 000 (a Sundance record), is an extremely enjoyable ride that makes a star out of its co-star Cristin Milioti in the process.Directed by debut feature film director Max Barbakow, Springs is a sun-soaked romantic comedy with a sci-fi/time loop twist as Andy Samberg's long-suffering and carefree Nyles finds himself living out a particular day in Palm Springs over and over, an experience that leads him to find solace in drink, the threat of being hunted by J.K Simmons jaded fellow loop sufferer Roy and most importantly the friendship he strikes up with Milioti's newly looped Sarah.There's lots of instances where Springs feels familiar and lots of beats it plays out that are to be expected from such an affair but Barbakow (working off a great script by Andy Siara) and his two lead performers inject a hearty dosage of soul and charm into much of the films elements ensuring that we as an audience are constantly given laughs and even in many ways emotionally resonate feelings as Nyles and Sarah's relationships grows.In what's by far his best lead turn in anything outside of the likes of the great but low-brow Lonely Island backed Hot Rod and Popstar and his work in TV hit Brooklyn 99, Samberg shows there is more to the man than objects in boxes and pants mishaps as he brings Nyles to life.The real joy however is his interplay with Milioti who shines as the flawed but affable Sarah.A long serving performer in TV and movie parts, Milioti is a revelation as Sarah. She shares great comedic timing with Samberg and as the two begin to explore their repetitive new lives and decide to live it up, the film really hits a strong groove that while culminating in a little bit of a so-so final stretch, is extremely entertaining while it lasts in the films particularly memorable middle section.There's no doubt that we will be seeing a lot of Milioti from now on in, with Hollywood sure to be knocking down her door.Final Say -It doesn't reinvent the time loop wheel and has moments where it coasts along but Palm Springs is a mightily enjoyable ride when everything clicks and will work wonders for the futures of its two on fire lead performers.3 1/2 dinosaurs out of 5",Palm Springs

The characters find themselves into a time loop and they just follow every classic rom com trop until the final ending. We don't get to know them, we don't get to understand them, or to understand the whole time loop concept really.

30,southdavid,Groundhog Date,7,6 July 2021,"""Palm Springs"" landed on Amazon Prime in the UK with a decent amount of advertising on the site that convinced me (a lazy person) to give it a try. I found a slight if reasonably entertaining indie style comedy, with engaging leads.At her sister's wedding Sarah (Cristin Milioti) meets Nyles (Andy Samburg), another guest whose easy-going confidence and seeming precognition about the events of the evening make him an appealing companion. But fair from natural, Nyles' confidence stems from the fact he's already lived this day, several times in fact, as he's stuck in a time loop that means regardless of how the day ends, he wakes up back in the hotel bed each morning. His life is complicated though, when Sarah follows him through a cave in the nearby scrubland and gets trapped in the recurring day also.To describe it as the indie comedy version of ""Groundhog Day"" is reductive but not wholly inaccurate Samburg is already at the advanced stage, where he's been stuck in the loop for a long time and has worked out exactly how far away he can get and done nearly everything conceivable. Sarah is the one we go through the initial phase with her trying to get her head around it all and Nyles acting like a guide. We also learn that she is not the only other person to have gone through the cave, with Roy, played by JK Simmon's occasionally appearing to take his frustrations out on Nyles.It's as I say, generally pretty lightweight stuff, but the leads are appealing enough to cover a multitude of issues with originality and that the film starts to get a bit less amusing the deeper and deeper into it's premise the film goes. That said, it definitely does have some funny moments and decent lines and I'd recommend anyone to give it an try.",Palm Springs
31,Vartiainen,Modern day Groundhog Day,8,6 September 2021,"Palm Springs follows Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) as they both get stuck in a time loop while attending a wedding in the desert. Very reminiscent of Groundhog Day, but with the added twist that it's possible to have more than one person looping over and over again. Which changes the dynamic considerably. So very much so that it's worth to ask, would you even want to break out of the loop?Samberg and Milioti have great chemistry together and even better comedic chops. And as with most projects Samberg (who also co-produced) seems to be involved nowadays, the film is uproariously funny, but never meanspirited or even that lowbrow. Which is a huge plus in my books.I also like the slow unraveling of secrets and circumstances both around the wedding and the time loop itself. Clean, clever writing all around.Then again, if there's something I'd have to criticize about the film, I'd be forced to say that in my mind the ending could have been better. Now it feels ever so slightly like a deus ex machina. Not enough to ruin the film by any means, but enough to warrant mentioning.Nevertheless, easily one of the best movies of 2020 and one of the best comedies I've seen in recent years. Easily recommended.",Palm Springs

33,jtindahouse,"Funny, charming and even thought-provoking",9,3 August 2020,"The 'Groundhog Day' scenario is starting to be used in films more and more I've noticed. 'Happy Death Day' took a crack at - and it went extremely well. 'Before I Fall' also used it - with slightly less successful results. And now 'Palm Springs' has used it. Ironically the only one of those films I haven't seen is 'Groundhog Day'. I absolutely loved 'Palm Springs'. The concept worked perfectly here, and they worked the concept perfectly. It was funny, touching, thought-provoking and inventive. It never felt like it was stepping on anyone's toes either. It just worked.The cast are a big part of what made this so great. Andy Samberg for starters nailed the lead role. He was endlessly likeable, relatable and hilarious (without turning it into a full-blown comedy). It's hard to imagine many actors playing this role as well as he did. Also Cristin Milioti deserves almost an equal amount of credit. She had to make us fall in love with her (despite being quite a flawed character in a lot of ways) so that we would buy Samberg's character falling for her. And she pulled it off and then some. Finally, J.K. Simmons was a great addition to the film. He actually isn't given a whole lot to do, but what he is given to work with he utilises extremely well.I love that the film made you question yourself over whether the scenario would be good to have happen to you or not. Personally, I would absolutely love every minute of it. I could live the same day over and over for 1000 years quite happily. But I understand why a lot of people wouldn't like that too. 'Palm Springs' was an incredibly enjoyable film to watch and one I would highly recommend you check out if you haven't already.",Palm Springs

The humor is very lame and childish. The time travel aspect itself is also pretty poor and underdeveloped, they played it out way too safely with its concept.But there is one thing which this film does incredibly well, it's the romance between the two leads.

Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti lead the cast for this wonderful film, and both provide quite excellent performances in their roles, and honestly perfect casting for them. The film doesn't seem short, but seems to use its time to the best of its advantage, and it truly feels like you are in the journey along with these characters, even with the film only clocking in at about 1hr30min. The film is written quite well surprisingly, and never feels tedious, or boring, or in anyway repetitive. It makes the best out of its familiar formula, and provides quite an interesting story and interesting characters to follow. Never would I have expected so much from a Hulu Original film, and I'm hoping that Hulu continues its streak of brilliant dramedy like films for its service.

42,questl-18592,Groundhog Springs,8,14 July 2020,"I'll be honest, I've been getting a little burned out on the resurgence of the ""Groundhog Day"" style movies. It's not that they're all bad, I've actually enjoyed a few of them but there's been such an influx of them lately I'm just... Not super into it. That said, really enjoy Samberg and the Lonely Island guys and Brooklyn 99, so I was a bit conflicted on this one.Absolutely surprised me with how good it was. It plays with hilarious comedy and moving somber notes so well throughout. It embraces and challenges the ""Groundhog Day"" theme wonderfully. Samberg even plays a more toned down character and it's still exceptional. Oh, and J.K. Simmons? Even more wonderful than usual.For me, the only down note is Cristin Milioti. I didn't feel like she struck the right balance with her character. With Samberg playing more reserved, I would have loved for her to be the crazy one or maybe even the super nice one, something to work with Samberg's performance and instead I feel like she lands right in the middle and... She's not bad but doesn't quite shine either. There's a possibility that she's just not for me though, because I didn't love her in How I Met Your Mother either.They were also clearly on a weird budget because some of the locations look pretty fancy, but the few special effects looked dreadful to me. I don't expect blockbuster effects from a movie like this but we've been doing CGI fire for a while now and I feel like it should be possible to make that look half-decent on a budget. Still, that's a small thing.This is an absolute recommend for me. This was a lot of fun and even my negatives aren't a huge detractor here. Throw in the fact that it's streaming right now on Hulu and this is a readily available movie that everyone should check out.",Palm Springs
43,valleyjohn,Fun but it's no Groundhog Day,7,13 May 2021,"It's impossible to talk about Palm Springs and not compare it to Groundhog Day.It's basically the same premise but with a more modern twist and I have to say that the 1993 film is still the superior film.Stuck in a time loop, two wedding guests develop a budding romance while living the same day over and over again.I'm not a romantic comedy fan but when it's full of adult humour and has two leading stars that are as quirky as Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti then I'm interested.The funniest parts of the film are when they know what's about to happen in their repeating day and use it to their advantage.One scene when Nyles makes his way across a dance floor , knowing the movements of the wedding guests , is very clever and funny .The longer the film goes on and the more it turns into a love story ( although it never really gets that serious ) the less I enjoyed it .I got the impression that the J. K. Simmons character was shoe horned into the story to get a big name on the cast , and it worked while it lasted but for some reason they dropped that thread pretty quickly which I thought was a shame .All in all , I enjoyed it but maybe not as much as other people I know who've seen it.",Palm Springs

45,jadepietro,The Dittio Effect,8,6 August 2020,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A comedy about time loops and romance with much to say and it says it well.JIM'S REVIEW: Palm Springs is a far from original idea that is original in its execution. It take that well-used sci-fi trope of time loops and becomes a clever send-up of a rom/com. This date movie would have been a huge box-office hit had it premiered in movie theaters. Instead, it becomes another victim of the Coronavirus outbreak and is demoted to the small screen streamed to subscribers who can view it repeatedly in their homes at their own enjoyment and pace. It is a delightful modern-day romp in any format.Having more than a passing acquittance to Howard Ramis' 1993 comedy classic, Groundhog Day, we first meet Nyles (Andy Samburg, channeling his best Bill Murray's cynicism). He has been caught in this time warp after being drawn into a cave's mysterious vortex that carries him into another time dimension in which he is doomed to repeat daily events. This quantum anomaly brings Nyles into a never-ending wedding setting that also introduces us to Sarah (a delightful Cristin Milioti), the maid-of-honor. Sarah is the always the unhappy bridesmaid type. She get entangled in the time fold as these two misfit strangers slowly become a couple. Trapped together, they unite to try to escape the drudgery of their frequent recurrences.Solidly directed by Max Barbakow, in an impressive debut, the film adeptly sets in motion a series of incidents that replay with some slight variations. The screenplay by Andy Siara gets a bit too existential in its philosophic debate about the meaningless of life and its little things that make up our days. Still the script is smart and more intelligent than your average rom/com as it plays with the high level concepts of quantum physics, time loops, and screwball comedy. One wishes the script had given the supporting characters more depth and interaction rather than only serving them up as plot devices to advance the central love story.Adding to the pleasure of this sweet story of two aimless people who suddenly discover a purpose in life are the film's two lead actors. They are totally charming and completely convincing in their funny roles. Mr. Samberg has played this man-child character before, but he has never been this endearing. He plays Nyles as an insufferable and sarcastic chump, a beer-guzzling and self-defeating dupe unaware of life's subtle lessons. Early on in the movie, there is a lovely well-stage dance number that clearly shows the endless repeats of his daily existence as he makes his way across the dance floor with a series of rote moves that quickly establishes his dilemma. His callous attitude counteracts with Sarah's bumbling disregard of her own self-worth. She is the black sheep of the family, more interested in surviving the hours than truly living them. Ms Milioti's is a delightful foil, generating charisma and star wattage in her role as the hapless loser.Mr. Barbakow has assembled a deft cast to tell his tale which includes such fine veteran performers as Peter Gallagher, Dale Dickey, and June Scribb, all who need more screen time with their under-developed characters. J. K. Simmons does become an interesting third-wheel as Roy, a resentful old codger who is also trapped in the loop, but again, his character remains too disposable and sketchy.Palm Springs celebrates the perfect and the imperfect things of life with gentle authority and a great deal of humor. How many films can serve up this much fun during these COVID days when we ourselves are destined to repeat our own daily actions as well?",Palm Springs
46,Kamurai25,"""Time and Time Again...and Again and Again and Again""",8,22 July 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend, especially for fans of ""time shifting"" tropes.Time shifting is where your mind goes back in time, but not your body. Essentially everything resets like a save point, except your have all this knowledge.""Time shifting"" was made popular by ""Groundhog's Day"" and there have been several movies that mainly consist of dying / sleeping and repeating like a video game, and this isn't THAT different with a few exceptions that make all the difference in the experience.Andy Samberg (Brooklyn Nine-Nine) finally steps up and shows everyone that he can do a somewhat serious role, and not just a straight man. Cristin Milioti (How I Met Your Mother) does an excellent job in her lead role, with a great supporting cast, to include J.K. Simmons (Cave Johnson) leading a wonderful supporting cast, except for Tyler Hoechlin (CW Superman: ""Supergirl"", ""Flash"", etc.), who I might just not like because he was Superman, but it's supposed to be an disliked character...so....good job?The medium of the transfer being shown is an interesting option as we saw in the ""Happy Death Day"" movies, but it does allow for a reasoning of how it works, can it be broken / manipulated as opposed to divine will. Most importantly, it allows for more than just one subject being affected, which is really where it gets set apart.The trope bleeds a little when you have multiple people trapped in the loop: you have multiple people trapped in a thing: you have multiple people trapped in a prison. When multiple people are trapped in a environment together, they tend to get a little strange, and we get that sort of thing a plenty. Because we have multiple story threads to follow, we're almost seeing 3 stories all overlapping, and the movie does a great job of showing those, whether or not their in chronological order, or happening at the same time.Whether you see it as a prison break movie, or a time loop movie, this movie has a lot of fun in it, along with deep metaphysical philosophy, so there is something for everyone.",Palm Springs

49,arungeorge13,"A solid, innovative entry in the time-loop subgenre! [+73%]",7,13 July 2020,"Wow! This film was such a breath of fresh air. It's exactly the kind of film you need more of, during difficult times like these. The basic thread is borrowed from films such as Groundhog Day and Happy Death Day. However, thanks to the clever treatment of its core concept, the infectious chemistry between the leads Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, a solid supporting act from the ever-dependable J.K Simmons, and a brisk runtime of 90 minutes, Palm Springs is a winner all the way.Palm Springs will now be looked upon as one of the ingenious entries among films that deal with infinite time loops. More than being just a romantic comedy (which it is damn good at!), it also succeeds in putting forward relevant questions about life, relationships, routines, happy moments, and realizations. And most of them get answered too, within the film's context.Nyles (Samberg) and Sarah (Milioti) forge an unlikely connection on the latter's sister's wedding day. As Nyles and Sarah hook up, Roy (Simmons) shows up trying to murder Nyles and all 3 of them are drawn to a vortex that makes them relive the same day over and over. Palm Springs doesn't try to dig deep into the tedious scientific details of a time loop; writer Andy Siara and director Max Barbakow clearly know what they want to extract out of this idea.As a result, you get a rom-com that works well as a character study (Milioti is awesome; why don't we get to see her in more films?). Nyles has been in the loop longer and has grown to accept this repetition of events. Sarah, on the other hand, clearly was going through a lot (in terms of how she's perceived by her own family) and wants out of the loop. Roy is seen to be out occasionally seeking revenge against Nyles for bringing him into the loop. Do these characters attain closure the way they want? The film has some interesting tricks and laughs up its sleeve.Some of the humor stems from situations when the lead duo is trying to live it up while in time captivity but is not restricted to just that. Sarah is a well-written character as is Nyles, and the film benefits a lot from its quirky writing and energetic performances. Palm Springs is definitely a film that I'll watch again and I know I'll like it a lot more each time.",Palm Springs
50,martimusross,Very Entertaining RomCom,8,5 June 2021,"Palm SpringsFundamentally, despite is apparent allusions to a metaphysical understanding of the universe, this was no more than a quirky romcom.The two leads played by Cristin Milioti and Andy Samberg, seasoned professionals of the small screen, delivered in spades, there was some real chemistry, this was excellent as the whole movie rested on this reality.The wise-cracking, sometime clunky script was delivered with aplomb, and it was just made to work.With regard to the metaphysics I would make two points:the granny, it was hinted was also repeating the day, however as she was complete in that day with no ambitious alternative future, she was happy to remain.The dinosaurs in the movie in the present could be roughly interpreted as meaning that our current behaviour is a culmination of our past knowledge and experiences and unless we accept the past and forgive ourselves we cannot move on.And so it was with Nyles and Sarah.Overall this was brilliant fun entertainment worthy of a solid 8 out of 10.",Palm Springs
51,leftbanker-1,I Wanted to Like this But It's a Complete Rip Off (AKA Plagiarism) of Groundhog Day...,1,11 July 2020,"...except without a hint of charm or humor. There wasn't a single joke in this, unless you call a man constantly drinking a can of beer a joke. I defy anyone to tell me one line from this movie that was noteworthy in the least. I think the writers thought that the protagonist wearing yellow surf trunks and a Hawaiian shirt during the entire film would be funny. It wasn't. Not even a little.Andy Samburg looks like he needed a vacation and just sleep-walked through this movie that appeared to be ad-libbed.I'm surprised that Andy Samburg made such a lackluster movie as he seems to be on top of the world in the entertainment business. Hire some decent writers. The writers couldn't even write a decent wedding speech, or a funny wedding speech. Cringe-worthy wedding speeches they can do. Once again, it just seemed that it was written by dudes who do nothing but watch TV. Find people who have read a book or two or who have travel. Someone with a bit of life experience.Where Groundhog Day had the clock hit 06:00 and the Sonny and Cher tune on the radio, this one just has a voice whispering ""Wake up."" It is impossible not to compare this with Groundhog Day as this movie completely plagiarized that now-classic film from 1993.There is nothing they could explain about a character to excuse the fact that she slept with her sister's husband-to-be the night before the marriage. I can't think of many things worse and more psychopathic. Maybe the Green River killer. Hannibal Lector would shudder at the thought of such a horrible crime.P.S. On a side note, weddings are all horrible, at least in my culture, and by my culture I mean America, and Europe.

It's good enough that you almost wish it was longer, but I guess the 90-minute run time does help keep the movie fast and entertaining and never boring.I'm not sure it would exist without Groundhog Day, but it does a decent enough job at combining the premise with the genre of romantic comedy, leading to something that feels fresh enough.And it's just hugely entertaining to boot. If you sometimes have problems paying 100% attention to a movie you're watching at home (hate to admit it but that's me sometimes), then give this one a shot because it is super engaging.

The two leads are perfect.I am a big fan of Brooklyn Nine-nine so was pleased to see Andy Samberg; Cristin Milioti has that hot, grungy girl going on.Both of them put in great performances - which is important as there is some meat here.The film takes some time to look at how awesome having the same day replay without consequences. The two have an absolute blast and makes you wish you could get stuck in this loop.The movie also has a subtle creep of actually how awful it would be too.This is a great fun movie that has some extra levels if you want to ponder them.If you don't though that is fine, this is great fun.I loved the chemistry between the leads and there are some curve balls that keep the plot interesting.An absolutely great film!",Palm Springs
59,rockman182,Palm Springs (2020),7,11 July 2020,"The Groundhog Day formula for film is something that has become extremely popular. The day repeats over and over for a character until they do something profound and change their life or an event to break the loop. When I started watching Palm Springs I didn't initially sense that it was that type of film but when it was I was hoping for something that would use the aforementioned formula will. With its twists and sharp writing, Palm Springs absolutely works and remains fresh the entire 90 minutes of its running length.
The film is about a wedding and two guests of the wedding that find themselves in a magical cave, once they go near the light in the cave they are doomed to repeat the day over and over. Anyone who interacts with this cave find themselves knowing about their predicament. The pair find out secrets about themselves and have fun with their situation but ultimately need to find a way out of their repetitive situation. The film stars Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti.
The film takes the Groundhog Day formula of the never ending day and twists it. Now instead of following one person who has to deal with being the only one who knows about what happens on the repetitive day, we have multiple characters. This brings a lot of fun and the script can have fun with this unique test on a tried formula. That's what makes it fun. There's enough light twists and turns that make it worthwhile and the chemistry of the leading pair really does help with the quality of the film.
Palm Springs does a good job of taking something we know and changing it just enough to keep you guessing and having fun with itself and its characters. I like Andy Samberg as a lead in films, he has a humorous charm that can make a bad film worth watching. Palm Springs is a strong Hulu original film and the best one I've seen so far on this streaming platform.

Nyles & Sarah are guests at a wedding, stuck in a time loop. As they experience the same day over & over again, they develop feelings for each other.Palm Springs is a mind-blowing film. Director Max Barbakow has given us a movie, that makes you guffaw uncontrollably & also has quite a few emotional moments to tug at your heartstrings. Andy Samberg is spectacular as Nyles. Cristin Milioti is outstanding as Sarah. Samberg & Milioti share this electrifying chemistry & it's the highlight of the film. J. K. Simmons is phenomenal as Roy. Peter Gallagher, Meredith Hagner, Camila Mendes & Tyler Hoechlin are amazing as Howard, Misty, Tala & Abe, respectively. The supporting cast is great. Palm Springs is a must watch for everyone.

61,abisio,A very funny and smart take of Groundhog day,10,13 July 2020,"If you are not familiar; with the concept; basically a person keeps living the same day again and again until finding a way to get out of the loop.
Basically is that happens to Sarah (an outstanding and lovable Cristin Milioti) when by accident gets trapped in the same time loop with Nyles (Adam Samberg ) and Roy (J.K. Simmons).
The movie portraits three depressed, frustrated and immature in funny and sweet way making really care for the lot.
Giving too much will be to spoil the surprise; but let's just say that the movie is able to be sweet, entertaining but with a very deep message about what we make of our lives and understand for happiness.
In brief; it is really worth seeing it.",Palm Springs
62,bob-the-movie-man,Did Anyone Order Groundhog for two?,8,14 April 2021,"Positives:
So, it's obviously a retread of ""Groundhog Day"" (so 1/5 for originality), but it has some fresh fun with the concept..It starts off at the ""town dance"" stage of G/D, where Bill Murray's character has lived enough lives to perfect everything. This is a smart move, and allows those of the audience 'in the know' (which I would guess is 80%+) the joy of getting to the fun bits early.It also luxuriates in having two (actually, more than two) people experiencing the 'phenomenon'. This leads to some truly hilarious scenes of Nyles and Sarah living life to the max.Because this dynamic duo can talk to each other, we get deeper existential discussion about the downsides of eternity and what life is all about.The best comedies also have some element of pathos as well, to mix the highs with some lows, and this movie does that nicely. The despair felt by Nyles at one point in the movie is heartfelt and moving.The element of female empowerment in here (no spoilers) is very 2020's and entertaining.The mushroom-induced hallucinations (again, no spoilers) made me laugh.I wasn't familiar with either Samberg (who is a regular in TVs ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"") or Milioti. Samberg was fine, but came across a bit ""Saturday Night Live cookie-cutter"". Milioti though is a real comedic find, nicely filling the sort of young-kooky-woman space that the younger Sarah Silverman used to do in movies. One to watch.Negatives:
The movie starts off at such a pace that the minority of the audience not familiar with the ""Groundhog Day"" concepts will have a ""WTF"" attitude and possibly turn them off during the first 20 minutes. (There is explanation, but it takes this long).The movie is rude. Very rude. This doesn't bother me, but it does shift the viewing options away from the ""Groundhog Day"" set and more towards the ""Hangover"" set. This will limit the audience, so I'm not sure it was a wise move by the writers.Of all the films showing this week, this one seems to have the most hype through social media: ""SEE THIS, YOU'LL LOVE IT"" screamed the posts. And - don't get me wrong - it's pretty good and has more than the requisite half-dozen laugh-out-loud moments to merit being called a comedy. But - perhaps my expectations were too high - it's no where near, in my book anyway the 5* classic that ""Groundhog Day"" was. Any any movie that borrows so much from the plot of that film has to be prepared to be directly compared and rated against it.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or on Facebook.

65,kjproulx,It's Very Hard to Dislike a Movie like Palm Springs,9,11 July 2020,"Films that revolve around characters repeating the same day over and over again has grown very tired in my mind. Groundhog Day perfected it and it really wasn't until more recently with Edge of Tomorrow that I really found a film that seemed to stand out among the rest. Well, I'm glad that I can now add Palm Springs to the list of films to put a clever spin on this concept. This film was originally supposed to play at more film festivals around the world and eventually receive a theatrical release, but things being the way they are, Hulu has now released it. Although this may be a film that's hard to find for some right now, here's why Palm Springs is one of the very best movies to come out of this bare year of 2020 so far.Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) find themselves sort of bonding over the fact that they both really don't want to be at the wedding they're at. He's the date of someone who cheats on him and she is the sister of the bride, who clearly has many issues. Stumbling across a strange cave after the wedding, they both find themselves caught in a time loop that has them reliving the same day over and over again. Certain things are revealed about each of these characters that add a lot more depth to the story and I found myself incredibly engaged from beginning to end.Where this film shines the most is in the fact that it completely commits to the whole time loop concept, even giving a few winks at the audience. It never once makes any huge mistakes logically, which felt refreshing, especially in the ways it would subvert expectations and most importantly in the way that they choose to conclude the story. The way Palm Springs wraps up was a very entertaining and emotionally earned finale. Now, I feel like I say this about a lot of movies that focus so much of their time on very few characters, but I truly mean that if Samberg and Milioti didn't have any fun chemistry together, this film would've been a disaster. This is probably the most laid back and comfortable I've ever seen Andy Samberg be in a film and it made the entire experience that much better.Only having written and directed a few short films and a documentary before tackling Palm Springs, director Max Barbakow has honestly blown me away here. With a small budget, a small number of characters, and a small scope, this film felt much bigger than it was. I can honestly see a big future for him in the coming years. I will gladly seek out his next project. On top of his stellar work on this film, writer Andy Siara (who also doesn't have a huge filmography as of yet) added a very funny and clever tone to the whole concept. It was clear that the performers were very comfortable with the dialogue because their acting lept off the screen and that just seemed to be a nice mixture of everything coming together nicely behind the scenes.In the end, Palm Springs is a film that I was very much looking forward to, but was wary of due to the concept itself. Thankfully, this is one of the best movies that I've seen accomplish this concept in years. I'm not calling it a masterpiece by any means, but for a fun time loop movie, I really couldn't find many issues. At a mere 90 minutes, this movie flies by and has just enough clever surprises for those who may not have been completely engaged. While the idea itself has grown tired for me, this movie is undeniably hard to dislike. Everything about this movie put a huge smile on my face and if that isn't what the world needs right now, I don't know what is.",Palm Springs
66,msbreviews,A rom-com as one of 2020's best movies?! The refreshingly unique Palm Springs is here!,9,3 July 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)If you've been following me for a while, you know I'm not the biggest fan of rom-coms. It's not that I don't like the genre (I appreciate and enjoy every single one), but I find its movies tremendously difficult to *really* love. The massive majority follow the genre's formulas and cliches to such an extent that I rarely end up truly loving one of these films. Some are way too cheesy. Others are way too unrealistic and dream-like. But the aspect that throws me off the most is the lack of originality. I can't remember the last rom-com I watched that didn't borrow from countless other installments. I didn't know a thing about Palm Springs: no trailers, no knowledge of critics/audience's opinion, nothing... And I'm extremely happy about that!I usually watch the main trailer for every film I review *after* I've seen the actual movie. I ignore all other trailers, clips, images, and so on. I do this so I can have some sort of knowledge regarding how far I can take my spoiler-free reviews. This way, I'm sure that I don't write about something I shouldn't. The official trailer for this film doesn't ruin the experience in any way, but it does tell its viewers the most relevant aspect of its screenplay. So, I could address it in this review, but I won't... because I enjoyed this movie a lot more, not knowing a thing about it than if I knew how it developed its story.Therefore, I'll keep it really vague, and just write that Andy Siara's first feature-film screenplay can easily snatch a couple of nominations when the awards season comes around. This is a rom-com like no other due to its refreshingly unique concept. It's true that it's not an entirely new method of storytelling. Many other movies also employ this idea, but Siara holds so many surprises within his narrative and so few of the genre's common traits that the whole film is elevated by his outstanding writing.It's one of the most entertaining movies of the year. With a short runtime and a fast pace, Palm Springs is constantly being genuinely fun, engaging, and even mysteriously intriguing. Its original plot makes the viewer think and remember previous lines that take a whole different meaning a few minutes later. There are no predictably dumb narrative decisions, and its characters escape the cheesy and forced relationships that these films usually insert them in. The dialogues are hilariously captivating. Almost every single plot point packs an emotional punch, a jaw-dropping revelation that never crossed the viewer's mind.Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti share such great chemistry. Their characters are exceptionally developed, and their relationship feels incredibly real. I'm rarely that viewer who requires the main characters to be together, kiss, fall in love, and all that, but Nyles and Sarah are two wonderful protagonists I can definitely root for. Both carry an interesting ""baggage"", which is also explored at a deep level. They deal very differently with the ""situation"" that the story puts them in, and it's so much fun to watch them go through it and evolve as characters. Oh, and J.K. Simmons (Roy)... this man doesn't know how not to be utterly remarkable!Max Barbakow (directorial debut) demonstrates his talents as well, by allowing Siara's screenplay to shine under impeccable direction. Tonally, it never loses its balance. It keeps its comedy pretty grounded, considering the craziness of its premise. It never relies on the genre's formulas, cliches, and cheesy outcomes. It really separates itself from the majority of modern rom-coms. I don't really have any flaws to point out... The ending does have a ""just accept it"" narrative component, and there are a couple of unnecessary scenes, but I'm nitpicking here.I can't believe I'm going to write this, but Palm Springs is not only one of the best rom-coms I've ever seen, but it's also one of the best (if not *the* best) movies of 2020, so far. With the help of their first-time director (Max Barbakow), Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti spread their extraordinary chemistry all over the innovative, original narrative, written by the also debutant, Andy Siara. The latter is undoubtedly the main responsible for such an entertaining film. Siara takes an imaginative concept and develops it in the most captivating, fun, hilarious, and even intriguing way possible. A surprising screenplay packed with emotionally impactful plot points, revelations, and twists that keep the enjoyment levels extremely high. The two protagonists are exceptionally developed, as well as their compelling relationship. With a fast pace and a perfect balance of its tone, Palm Springs sets itself apart from the other movies of the genre, staying away from all of the cliches, formulas, and stereotypes associated with it. J.K. Simmons also lends his awesomeness because why not? Whether you're a fan of rom-coms or not, I definitely suggest giving this one a look. You won't be disappointed!Rating: A",Palm Springs
67,0w0,"7.5 Well worth watching, just once",7,11 July 2020,"This film could have been much better, like possibly an 8.5 or 9 film if it was just longer and funnier. Throughout the entire film I laughed twice, so it's certainly not a 'laugh-a-minute' type film.

The film is a little short though... I would have loved it if the film was about 20-30minutes longer, so that some time could be spent on showing the various 'loops' that the main characters have previously experienced. With a plot/story like this, you could have SO MUCH fun, with the various crazy and wacky things that the characters could be shown doing (like robbing a bank, jumping into a volcano, wrestling a bear, etc.) but alas this film's short runtime leaves very little time for such antics, and thus results in only a 7.5 film.",Palm Springs

71,ronakkotian,"For a rom-com, this was a surprising treat",8,11 April 2021,"To be honest, I thought this film was going to be a regular throwaway romantic comedy but I was pleasantly surprised by how it good it was.Palm Springs follows Nyles and Sarah, two wedding guests who develop a budding romance between as they're stuck in a time loop.The premise of a time loop has been done before, like in Groundhog Day, but turning it into a romantic comedy isn't something I've seen and I'm happy to say Palm Springs manages to succeed in that venture. There's a typical formula rom-coms tend to follow, and this film does follow that formula in the third act, but Palm Springs is refreshing in the way it tells its story. It manages to stay unpredictable for the first two acts and leaves interesting surprises throughout that build on the two main characters. The script from Andy Siara works on many levels. He develops the two protagonists enough to the point where we care about them and uses the time loop premise in fun and creative ways. There are neat little details in the dialogue that foreshadow events and some of the reveals actually surprised me. There is some great comedy involved that had me laughing a few times. I wouldn't say it's a full on laugh riot but there were enough jokes that worked. For his feature debut, Max Barbakow did a great job directing. The camerawork is great and captures a few beautiful scenic shots.The two lead performances make this film even better. The chemistry between Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti is fantastic and believable. It builds very nicely and both actors deliver solid performances. J. K. Simmons is also very good and has some hilarious moments. The rest of the supporting cast also do a great job in their roles.Palm Springs was a genuine surprise.

72,garethcrook,Surprisingly good.,7,22 September 2020,"I'm not sure what brought me here, I think it was a random mention on a podcast or something. Nyles (Andy Samberg) is dragged to a wedding by his annoyingly perky girlfriend Misty (Meredith Hagner). He's not suited to either her or weddings, Nyles is a glass half full guy, a nihilist, a grump. Nyles though is also an awesome drunk, an activity he indulges in marvellously and one that helps him meet Sarah (Cristin Milioti). They hit it off, nearly hook up, then he gets shot by a dude in army fatigues with a crossbow! This is not your average romcom. The guy with the bow is Roy (JK Simmons), a guy from Nyles' past who is not too pleased with him cursing him to a repetitive world reminiscent of Groundhog Day. See, not average. Y'see Nyles is trapped in a loop, living the same day over and over. He's done all the things Bill Murray did, but we're not witness to that and this film isn't really about redemption. This is about Nyles dragging Sarah into the loop. Now it's not super original, but it is fun and both Samberg and Milioti are great to watch. He's the old pro, she's the novice. It's largely stupid, switch your brain off stuff as the two find humourous and frivolous ways to pass the endless day(s), but there's an obvious event coming in their future. Falling for one another. Something that throws them both off what had become a comfortable path. It's still a bit derivative, but it's well constructed and despite a dodgy montage where Sarah learns quantum mechanics it's really quite engaging. Considering what it's trying to do, it's very simple, but that's okay. As is all the silliness and the finale that made my eyes roll. I enjoyed a romcom fantasy, who'd have thunk it.",Palm Springs

It's not spoiling much to say that it's a Groundhog Day movie, which isn't a premise I find particularly interesting, but it recognizes our familiarity with the notion and thankfully speeds through the learning curve. Both leads are good, but it is Milioti who steals the show. Their comedic chemistry is excellent, and the script has some excellent moments playing off of their knowledge of the day and everyone else living it once. There are still some interesting existential questions in the purpose of life, repetition, and the depth of relationships. Some of the ups and downs, particularly in the third act, felt a little less fresh and more tropey than I like, but if you don't mind a generic easy resolution, you'll definitely enjoy Palm Springs.

78,PyroSikTh,A Charmingly Endearing Time Loop RomCom,8,10 April 2021,"Palm Springs is yet another time loop story. If you've been following along you'll know I'm not typically a fan of time loop movies, but honestly I'm starting to feel like I should reconsider that standpoint. It's been a long time since I last saw a time loop story I didn't like, be it a feature-length movie or a single episode of a sci-fi TV show. I feel the reason for this is that Groundhog Day came along, was a huge success, and everyone wanted to capitalise on it without really revolutionising the concept. But filmmakers have grown as tired of it all as I have and have started infusing new ideas and twists that freshen it up and keep it interesting and new every time. Edge of Tomorrow threw in an alien invasion, Happy Death Day threw in a classic slasher, Source Code threw in a train disaster and some extra twists and turns, and hey, the 12 Monkeys TV show played with time travel so much that it just made sense to have a time loop episode.So what does Palm Springs throw into the mix to keep it fresh and interesting? More victims! This is the time loop tale of Nyles and Sarah who find themselves stuck together, and find love each other when both feel unlovable and unsuited to relationships. To add further spice to the mix, Nyles has already been in the loop an unimaginable amount of time when we're first introduced to him, so we skip all the tired and repetitive elements of a time loop story; where the protagonist takes several loops before they truly realise what's going on and start to show same agency. Although by the time we meet Nyles, he's gone through and come out the other end of that agency and has just grown to accept that this is his life now. It creates an interesting juxtaposition between the two characters, as we watch Sarah's realisation and vain attempts to break free at odds with Nyles' chilled-out approach. Nyles has been stuck here so long that it's changed his entire philosophy on life, just taking each day as it comes, not caring about anyone or anything.This also creates a fantastic dynamic when it comes to gender equality, as Sarah never once falls into the role of damsel in distress. She's strong and independent, and doesn't rely on Nyles to get her out. She's the one who decides to spend her time studying quantum physics in order to find a way out. But the movie doesn't use this to make a point about girl power either. Both Sarah and Nyles are just people irrespective of their genders, and you could swap the genders, or even just swap the gender of one of them, and nothing in the movie would change (other than you know, turning it into a gay romance instead of a straight romance, but that's about it). Nyles never comes across as pathetic or whiny in contrast to Sarah's capability, and she doesn't come across as ""difficult"" or ""aggressive"" by being a woman with agency either. Just the way both characters have been written is beautiful.It helps that Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti share such an infectious chemistry with each other. If I had a criticism about this movie, it's that I grew so attached to both characters and their relationship that I wanted to see more of them together once they escaped the loop. I'd watch a sequel that ditched the time loop aspect entirely, just to see these tow characters together again. Both are fantastic at the full range of emotions the story demands of them both. Sarah is constantly haunted by her past actions, waking up every morning after her most recent and arguably most terrible. Nyles just drifts into a mild depression, feeling helpless until Sarah adds her own spark to his new life. And yet with such serious and sombre character traits, both Samberg and Milioti find ways to make the comedy natural and endearingly hilarious.There's also some much deeper stuff going on here as well, that I certainly don't feel qualified enough to talk about at length, but the whole team is acutely aware of how to improve on the time loop concept; make it matter and feel like more than just a plot device. There's references to eastern philosophies peppered around all over the place, and there's hints and foreshadowing dotted around the early scenes that signpost the twists and turns. This is a movie that demands rewatching just to catch all the tiny little details. And then there's the dinosaurs...Palm Springs was a pure joy to watch. It's hilarious, charming, dramatic, and engaging from start to finish. It's full of surprises and the plot takes new routes all the time, but the film's best aspect is the core relationship between Sarah and Nyles. As I said above, I just want to see more of them, being together, their lives outside of the loop. We learn so much and yet we're still only just scratching the surface. Is their love destined to last, or is it truly as impossible as dinosaurs in the desert? The soundtrack is also great, with a summery and oddly romantic synthwave score interspersed amongst some interesting musical choices from the likes of Leonard Cohen, Cyndi Lauper, Kate Bush, and John Cale. I give Palm Springs an unsurprisingly solid 8/10. It was worth the wait.",Palm Springs

It triumphs in every aspect, from its comedy, its romance, its drama, and is all tied together with a brilliant central premise.There are lots of things that make this film great, one of which is the great partnership between Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti. The two had such a brilliant chemistry and both characters had so much to love and connect to. Andy Samberg was fantastic in his role as the nihilistic Nyles, and played the part to perfection, with the right amount of charm and comedic despondency. Milioti was just as great in her role as the newly indoctrinated member of the time loop. The two were so watchable together.The plot is also so great. It's light and breezy with all of the comedic scenarios you could want from a time loop situation, but it also had some really solid dramatic and emotional moments. This is because the characters were so well crafted and felt very real and grounded.The pacing of Palm Springs was also spot on. It comes in at a crisp 90 minutes and always has something going on.

81,akcenat,"Pleasantly predictable movie based on ""Groundhog Day"" formula",7,14 July 2020,"As many of us have been stuck in quarantine over the past three months, reliving the same boring day over and over, ""Palm Springs"" couldn't come at a better time. What makes film work is that it's a blend of the familiar and the new. Basically, movie is just another ""Groundhog Day"", but tonally, the comedy here is much more in line with a more Millennial, crass brand of humor than the Boomer-produced ""Groundhog Day"". At the end, ""Palm Springs"" is entertaining enough no mater there are some slower moments. For me, it wasn't the best time loop movie ever made, but my wife and I did enjoy it on a lazy afternoon during 2020 pandemic.Rating: 7",Palm Springs
82,gsygsy,Could do worse,3,31 August 2020,"When you feel the editing is the best thing about a movie, something's gone wrong. The main problem here is the script, which fires out volleys of would-be wisecracks, one-liners and diversions, only to succumb to icky sentimentality. On the plus side, the obvious derivativeness of the piece is shamelessly displayed for all to see, so let's give it full marks for honesty, at least.The actors do what they can to keep us entertained. For my taste, Christin Milioti succeeds, Andy Samberg doesn't. The supporting cast includes a nice turn from Meredith Hagner, some welcome warmth from J.K. Simmonds, Peter Gallagher and, in a sweet cameo, June Squibb.Rom-coms are not my thing, I admit. This merry-mawkish offering goes a long way to explaining why. But it's by no means the most offensive of its kind. You literally could do worse.",Palm Springs

86,SnobReviews,An incredibly fun and original film.,7,15 July 2020,"""Palm Springs"" is incredibly original, thoroughly inventive and the feel-good movie we need right now.
.
In this comedy, two strangers who meet at a Palm Springs wedding, get stuck in a time loop.
.
The script is fun and sharp and the performances from Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti are really great. The duo has a quirky chemistry that is almost impossible to resist. The film itself is seriously irresistible; if you don't have a good time watching ""Palm Springs"" maybe get yourself checked. The use of the premise and the time loop are done with precision that even if certain scenes are contradictive, it still feels refreshing to see these characters go through what they're going through. I really enjoyed this film.

87,David-240,Enjoyable movie but so many problems with the concept!,7,7 February 2021,"Although I enjoyed the film, there were so many things that bothered me with the 'time travel' concept that I got distracted. Firstly, when Nyles is panicking because he can't find Sarah, he finds out pretty quickly that she spent the night with the groom - so all he has to do is go straight to the groom's room in the morning and there she will be. Secondly, unlike in Groundhog Day when Bill Murray was 'snowed in' to the town, Nyles and Sarah can travel anywhere they want before they fall asleep, which opens up huge parts of the world to them. They could go to New York and see every play on Broadway or work their way through the menus of the best restaurants in the Americas or go to every theme park in California etc etc The possibilities are endless but they spend most of their time at the resort or the bar down the road. They certainly should never get bored. Thirdly, and this is more conceptual, either everyone is also in the time loop but only Nyles, Sarah and Roy know about it, or there are millions of alternative realities going on simultaneously - because every day the three characters change the world in some way - do these worlds continue or does everything loop back? For example when Sarah throws herself in front of the truck does she just vanish and everyone forget she ever existed or do the truck driver and the attending police officer have to deal with her remains and the resulting psychological trauma? Roy says he was taken to hospital after this event, so it appears that time continued and did not loop back. So does time only loop back when all three looping people fall asleep or does time just continue in multiple realities? In another scene Nyles gives a little boy money but tells him he better spend it today, suggesting that the money will vanish when he does - this means that the boy is also stuck in time. And when Sarah is watching Nyles sleep, shouldn't he have already vanished and returned to the morning? Time travel always does your head in but try to enjoy the movie anyway.",Palm Springs
88,nicorip22,Unconventional romantic movie,7,9 November 2020,"This movie is very good, it is not the common stereotype of a romantic movie, which in my opinion is very good. It has its comic scenes too, as you couldn't expect anything else from jake peralta :P . I recommend it!",Palm Springs
89,fciocca,"Fun comedy with Andy Samberg, which is a guarantee",6,16 October 2020,"I watched many stuff by Andy Samberg, and I personally think that through the years he was always able to bring on screen fresh and funny stuff on screen, Palm Springs is no exception, but in this case his role feel more complex and complete, compared to other characters that he played. Sure, there are funny moments and Andy will make you laugh with his typical comedy, but at the same time he will have some ""dramatic"" scenes, where he will be more serious. I really appreciated this and I liked how the movie developed the story. Palm Springs feel really balanced, there is always the right amount of comedy, and the right amount of drama. Special effects are well made and not too invasive. The result is a really enjoyable movie, it has the right length and it manages to be entertaining and engaging for the whole one hour and a half.Unfortunately, I cannot give more than six stars, because the plot is not original at all, and it is a movie that I will soon forget. It is a really nice flick if you just want to relax by watching a light-hearted comedy, but that's it. There is nothing peculiar that make this movie stand out from the genre. Even if the relationship between the two main characters is very solid, is not enough to create a memorable movie.",Palm Springs

Director: Max Barbakow
Starring: Andy Samberg, Cristin Milioti, J. K Simmons, Peter Gallagher, Meredith Hagner, Camila Mendes, Tyler Hoechlin etcOverall rating 96/100Palm springs is about two wedding guests Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) who meet after Nyles saves her from embarrassing herself at the toast, but when there romantic hook up turns into getting stuck in a time loop living the same day over and over again, they must embrace that nothing really matters, and they begin to wreck spirited havoc on the wedding guests. What an absolutely amazing film Palm springs was it was one of my favourite comedies I have seen in a long time, so let's get started.My first few positives would be the clever idea, the blending of the two genres, the humour. As well as the comedic and romantic chemistry between the two leads. I thought the idea for Palm springs was excellent, it went with the comedic genre trope of something going wrong at a wedding and completely turning it on its head and the concept of repeating the same day and developing the characters and different ideas on that was a refreshing twist for the comedy. I also thought the two genres of comedy and sci fi blended very well. I think they incorporated the repeated time loop created a lot of comedy in a fun way and they meshed well together and never felt tonally conflicted. Next, I thought the performances from the whole cast was fantastic, the supporting cast was great, but Andy Samberg and Crisitin Milioti were fantastic, they had so much charm and charisma and they worked absolutely excellent together. There comedic timing and chemistry with each other was great and they bounced off each other really well, but they also both had great romantic chemistry, making the development of their relationship so much better and making me connect to both characters more.My next few positives would be the fun set up, cinematography, development to the plot. As well as the character depth, development, and conflict. I thought the set up was incredibly well set up here. I liked how the movie established the different characters and Nylan before going straight into the time loop. I liked the subtle hints at Nylan knowing more then he did, this was done effectively and the set up of the time loop was fun and crazy and really got me excited to watch the rest of the movie. I also thought the cinematography was excellent here, considering the very small budget there was some very creative shots and some realistic elements with where the time loop was situated, having the beautiful set locations also was great and helped out the movie a lot. I also loved the development to the plot, I really loved how the plot progressed as it explored every different aspect to the time loop, how to escape playing with people and the characters just learning not to care was a really fun development. I really liked the character depth and development as well, as you learned different things about both Nyle and Sarah you really began to sympathise and understand both characters, Sarah having relationship issues and making mistakes at the wedding really showed you the positives and negatives about Sarah which I loved, and also how distanced Nylan became with reality and relationships after being so used to repeating the same day by himself was really interesting. I also really liked the development to both characters and the conflict this caused. It wasn't a simple love story which I loved. I really liked the conflict created as Nylan wanted to stay in the loop in order to live his life With Sarah without having to worry about anyone else, but also Sarah wanting to escape her past mistakes and live her life differently every day. This caused plausible and authentic conflict between both characters and was very well written as we learned more about why Nylan wants to stay in the loop.My only slight negative would be the slightly underdeveloped character arcs. It would have been nice if they had tied Sarah's character arc in connecting with her family more I think this would of just made her arc that bit more satisfying and proved she was improving as a person as the mistakes she made were slightly too big to be brushed under the carpet in places.My final few positives would be the development and differences with the two main characters, the great themes portrayed, the great character background and finally, the satisfying ending. I really liked the sharp contrast that they had with the two different characters. Nyle had very much settled into living the same day and had tried multiple different ways to escape, and it was nice to have that balance with Sarah discovering and trying different ways to escape and them going on that journey together. I also appreciated the character background given to Nyle, I found it really cool that they incorporated more of when Nyle first started to be stuck in the loop and his connection with J,K Simmons character was really fascinating. I also loved the deeper themes the movie was able to portray with living the same day over and over. It showed the positive side of not having a care in the world and being able to do what you want, but balanced that with your actions still having consequences due to you being able to remember every day still, and also with J K Simmons character they bought up an interesting theme and topic of not being able to see his children grow up but being happy every day with the people you love and that connection to Sarah for Nyle and I am sure a lot of other people was touching in places. Finally, I thought the ending was very satisfying for both Sarah and Nyle. There character arcs were resolved nicely, and their relationship developed and showed growth which is rare for a comedy to write so cleverly, but they ended it in a heart-warming and fun way that really tied the movie into a nice little bow.Overall, Palm springs is a refreshing, hilarious, clever, and well written film. That blends and combines its two different genres and ideas almost to perfection. Giving Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioni there time to shine, its one of my favourite comedies that I have seen in a long time and I already want to watch it again.",Palm Springs
91,jakethesnake-42007,Smart funny and weird,6,2 March 2021,This is a prime example of a story that has been done before but this time it's done right that it feels we haven't seen this story before. It's smart abs funny and weird but all in a good way. It has its faults at times and I don't think it's the best comedy of the year but it's a fun one.,Palm Springs
92,Rendanlovell,Not my thing,6,19 July 2020,"Time to come clean, I've never been an Andy Sanberg fan. Almost every time he's involved in something he's been unlikable in one way or another. Here though, he may be my favorite part. He gives a surprisingly restrained performance, only doing his normal loud guy schtick a few times. I like his character on the whole. The film is basically another ground hogs day where he is trapped in a time loop before another girl gets stuck with him. So he's incredibly jaded and nihilistic having spent an eternity in this time loop. Almost everything else though, is kinda blah. His love interest is, of course, the girl he gets stuck with, Sarah. Which is a stupid obvious plot point even if it's mostly well done. The worst part about this romance is, unfortunately, Sarah. Her character almost exclusively is a childish baby that can't deal with her problems. She's attractive but that's sorta it for her. However, there's another person stuck in this time loop, JK Simmons. Who wants to take revenge on Sandberg for trapping him in this loop. He isn't exactly a compelling character and only exists to have a nice little moment of clarity with Sandberg to explain the themes to him. Which encapsulates the story as whole honestly. It isn't breaking new ground or really trying anything new at all. The majority is just the romance plot until the inevitable, 3rd act low point that is meant to throw these characters apart. It really isn't that well developed and the ""twist"" that leads to it is painfully obvious. Then there's a whole plot that comes up directly at the end where the characters attempt to leave the time loop using ""science"". It's just another thing that feels tacked onto this story. The humor too is something I can't say I liked. I got a few laughs from this, that's about it. The rest feels a bit low brow. I can't say I disliked this on the whole, but I enjoyed the character driven story. Especially the Sandberg character. Other then that I found it rather bland. It's not particularly well made or shot, in fact some parts are kinda ugly. I was constantly wishing for more out of the story and every plot point feels forced or obvious in one way or another. I didn't hate it, but ima forget it pretty soon. Better then that awful Marlon Waynes Naked movie everyone has already forgotten about.",Palm Springs
93,mike-c-b,One of the best films of the last 5 years,8,24 July 2020,"There are some scenes which could have been done better (important reaction scenes involving emotion) where Andy flat lines it, but there are also some scenes where he does better than most current actors... Andy Samberg, Cristin Milioti, and JK Simmons all carry the film with charm. Directed and cut together energetically.",Palm Springs
94,deepfrieddodo,New Time-Loop Twist,7,14 April 2021,"Whilst based on a well-known foundation - someone repeating the same day forever - Palm Springs does offer a different take, mostly by having several people involved. It's certainly a slow start, Samberg's trademark wacky humour isn't used to begin with and it rarely comes up throughout, it's certai ly a different kind of comedy from Lonely Planet's usual. That does mean that from the off it does seem like the film will be a bit of a miss, even though it drops into the plot very quickly. It's never laugh-out-loud funny, there are a few chuckles throughout, but really Palm Springs revolves around relationship and character development. The story unfolds and each character has a satisfying arc. It definitely grows on you as it progresses, and it's refreshing by the end. Not Samberg's best, but worth the watch.",Palm Springs

Could have used the supporting cast better than that and integrated way more jokes into this. An explanation about the cave might have been nice.

100,austin0731,Andy Samberg strikes again with Palm Springs,7,10 August 2020,"Palm Springs is the latest from Andy Samberg and I just can't get exactly what it is the makes him and his roles so charming and relatable. I've been a fan of his work since the Lonely Island music videos and continue to love his work in Brooklyn nine-nine, Samberg has an aura about him that's so 'ordinarily friendly', making you care about his character no matter his role. In Palm Springs we get to see him in a film that is a joke overdone, the 'Groundhog day' trope isn't the first of its kind and won't be the last, we've seen this again and again in cinemas and on TV, yet somehow they've pulled it out of the bag with this one. All the pieces just fall into place with this one, rendering the premise much less important because of just how well it executes on the jokes and heartfelt moments alike. While the film doesn't do anything unexpected it simply brings a smile to your face as you reminisce in the charm and lightheartedness of the film.",Palm Springs

103,carlos37andre,I can't believe they actually made a romantic comedy that's (completely) different from any other ever made!,10,18 July 2020,"That's it. I don't think there is a better complement to give here, is insane. They've managed to re shaped, and tell such a refreshing story, in a genre that can be so repetitive most of times. Don't get me wrong, some of my favorite movies of all time are rom-coms, but this is different from everything I have ever seen. A movie doesn't need to be completely different from everything that came before in order to be great, but when they are, it feels... fulfilling (if that makes sense).If you've seen the trailer for the movie, you know what the movie is about. Basically, two people, getting to know each other, in ridiculously stupid situations while stuck in a time loop (actually, it would be at least interesting the experience of seen this movie without any previous knowledge, just thinking is a regular romantic comedy).And well, they delivered, Andy Samberg is my man, I love the guy, I love Brooklyn 9-9, and I've been closely watching almost everything he does for the past few years, and he rocks, always funny, a great comedian and actor. Cristin Milioti is also great here, some of my biggest laughs in the film were on her scenes (like the first scene in the desert, when Nyles gets shot and she goes ""wtf?! wtf!?"", is so genuine! J.K. Simmons, is also here, he isn't in the movie that much, but when he is, he's great, as always.Anyway, to sum up, the movie is great, is refreshing, is so damn funny, the story is great, the dialogue is great, the direction, everything about it is great. Sure, you could point out that their ""way out"" isn't that believable, but c'mon, they've earned cause of how innovative, and smart the whole storyline of the movie is. So, that's it, Palm Springs is an amazingly funny rom-com that takes place in a time loop, and that's a phrase I never thought I would say, but I'm glad I'm saying now.Before I forget: One other good thing I thought about it, is that I thought cause I already knew about the time loop thing, that the first third of the movie or something would be useless, and boring, but it wasn't! They go almost instantaneously straight to the point, and the story moves fast (after all, the movie has just 90 minutes).",Palm Springs
104,quaseprovisorio,"i didn't love it but it's still a very good film, with relateable characters.",7,20 July 2020,"Now this is a pretty fine film, that came in a time where movie audiences want to watch something good - mostly because there isn't as many offer as it's usual in a regular year. i haven't seen more than 3 or 4 movies from this year, this one is the best so far, from my very little sample.Samberg and Milioti have a very good chemistry that definitely carries this and it makes a very watchable piece. samberg isn't far from his usual, even though he's more contrived here. the characters go through a journey of self acceptance and caring, through a time-loop. there's a lot of dialogue concerning nihilism and how far they have to go until they start to actually care.now i'm a fan of time loop movies. everytime i see there's one i want to check it. groundhog day is probably still the best, but here they do a creative approach to this.with the editing for example that i think it was smart. or on the different stages they positioned the characters at the beggining. there are a few variations from the theme that actually work here.the script makes two likeable leads and creates a good pace too. i'm not a big fan of two things: first i think this could have been funnier. it has some nice jokes, but i think it could have been a bit more tailored. the style...well i like the music and the editing, but i don't find the cinematography or the colours very attractive. there are some parts where this definitely wants to make an ""indie vibe"" and i didn't feel it.it is still a fun watch and an emotional journey. the pace is also cool, never gets boring. i understand also why some people loved this. i don't think it's a great film, but it's a very nice one, that is engaging, interesting and has heroes we actually care for.",Palm Springs
105,aheaven2005,Pleasantly surprised,7,3 March 2021,Going into this one without any expectations I was pleasantly surprised. The movie formula is simple but efficient but the acting from Samberg is enough to make it a good experience.,Palm Springs
106,Christopher_Reid,"Groundhog Day: Part II - funny, creative, but nothing special",7,9 May 2021,"The concept is essentially the same as Groundhog Day. You keep waking up on the exact same day with apparently no explanation of why. The comparisons are inevitable since the concept is so uncommon and Groundhog Day did it so well. Unfortunately, Palm Springs doesn't really match the earlier film. But it does have some funny ideas and a little bit of philosophy and romance.Like Groundhog Day, the main character starts to know everything, get bored and start doing all kinds of ridiculous things, including commit suicide in a variety of ways. Their life begins to lose meaning and days blur into months, years and... decades? Who knows?Like Groundhog Day, the central focus becomes is a romance between a girl's boyfriend and the sister of the bride at the wedding which happens every day. Maybe the movie should have been called Wedding Day. While they seem likeable enough and get along, neither of them actually seems to be that nice a person. She cheated with the groom last night! Meanwhile, he doesn't seem as bad but is willing to cheat on his girlfriend since he catches her cheating on him. However, he has apparently also slept with the main girl who only enters the time loop later in the movie. For all we know, he's slept with everyone, used them - gained information about them and abused that knowledge.Whereas Groundhog Day lets us gradually realise what's going on and how weird and psychologically draining it is, Palm Springs kind of glosses over that. It focuses more on the characters randomly doing things, taking risks and having fun because there are no consequences. But they don't seem to make the most of it. At least Bill Murray learns the piano and other random skills.The earlier movie also has more charm and creativity overall. Murray's sarcasm barely conceals his depression and confusion at the bizarre torture he's being put through - living Groundhog Day over and over again. We get a perverse joy out of seeing him live through such a dull day over and over again. And there's at least a sense of mystery in terms of what he's meant to do to escape the cycle - what's the message he's meant to receive?Palm Springs picks a much less significant day - a wedding between characters not very strongly connected to the story. The romance also seems a bit forced, like it's more out of convenience than some deep connection. The story becomes sillier when the girl tries to learn quantum mechanics to find a way out of whatever time vortex thing they're stuck in. It's a convenient way to end the movie and make the characters profess their love, but it's hardly uplifting since they might be about to commit suicide. And they don't seem to have greatly grown or changed through the process - maybe they're a little bit more mature.Still, it's an entertaining movie overall which manages to at least mostly take a different path from Groundhog Day. The main highlight would be J. K. Simmons who somehow also ends up in the time loop and takes sadistic joy in killing or otherwise harassing Andy Samberg at random points throughout the movie. Samberg also has a natural flair for comedy and awkwardness. But I think Hot Rod better displays his brand of stupid and over-the-top humour.",Palm Springs

The Brooklyn Nine-Nine star alongside Cristin Milioti (The Mother from HIMYM) dazzle as a pair of cynical wedding guests stuck in a time loop.Riding on the legendary coattails of Groundhog Day (1993), Director Max Barbakow still manages to surprise you with some amazing twists and dollops of laugh-out-loud moments, springing up at the places you least expect them to.Oscar-winner JK Simmons is brilliant as usual in a role that has very little screen time but makes a powerful impact.A perfect romantic comedy during these tough times. Highly recommended.",Palm Springs
108,sirwillisiv,A delightfully bizarre cosmic romp with something to say...,8,4 March 2021,"Romantic comedies are usually not my cup of tea, but Palm Springs is smart, unique and irreverent enough for me to make an exception. This is a film that takes a concept - a done-to-death one at that - and reinvents it with sheer wit and the bravery to ask deep and meaningful questions about existence, isolation and personal reinvention. It follows a man and a woman who meet at a wedding venue and are trapped reliving the same day. The man rejects the possibility of escaping and prefers to relax, descend into nihilism and crash the wedding, while the woman - who is the maid of honor - wants to stop experiencing the results of her own selfish and irresponsible behavior.Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti's characters are brilliantly well-rounded, funny and share a believable chemistry, which that alone is what many romcoms sorely lack. There's a motivation to their relationship, their experiences together actually transform them. J. K. Simmons - who I believe makes anything he touches amazing - stars in a secondary role that adds a dramatic and fun-loving weight in his own right, dabbling in ideas about anger and forgiveness among feeling secluded. I can't think of any other actor that could've nailed it. He's an excellent supporting actor. I just wish there was a little more of him, though. Sometimes his character comes off as a comedic afterthought.Unlike most romcoms which are fueled purely of sappiness, Palm Springs is a delightfully bizarre cosmic romp that actually has something to say. Intelligent, provocative and emotionally-investing.",Palm Springs

Cristin Milioti is absolutely fantastic though. Every little nuance and every huge delivery is spot on perfect. Hand her the phone book and you would have a hit just watching her read it.

111,grygotis,Fun,7,1 March 2021,"A fun little movie that is a variation on the Groundhog Day theme. It's not as funny as that one was, but it has its moments and some different twists than that one. Not sure how great an actor he actually is, but Samberg is just a very likeable guy totally at ease in front of a camera and hasn't any problem with embarrassing himself. He's a funny dude. He was funny on SNL and Brooklyn 99 though I didn't watch it much. I'm just not a sitcom kind of guy anymore. Like Groundhog Day, there is a romantic angle and I could understand why Murray would want the day to be over as he kept repeating the same day alone over and over again, but in this Samberg has a mate and they can do anything they want each day and they would live forever. Maybe it's just me, but I didn't quite get their joy about the prospect of having to get jobs, paying bills, aging, illnesses and dying.",Palm Springs

It was entertaining throughout, I cared about the main characters, I dug it.I actually watched it two times, I haven't said that about a film in ages, let alone a Hulu film.It has minor, forgivable flaws.

121,ScoobySnacks66,Derivative but also unique,8,19 December 2020,Watching Andy Samberg dance over to Cristin Miloti sets up a Groundhog Day inspired film where you know there's going to be plenty of chemistry between the 2 stars. This particular flavour of quantum mechanics stuck on repeat brings plenty of its own ideas that makes for a fun love story that is well written and highly entertaining.,Palm Springs
122,theredsky,Palm Springs Review,8,6 September 2020,"A very refreshing take on the romantic comedy. The leads here are excellent. Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti do an excellent job portraying these characters with imperfections who learn to love each other through a weird situation. They both have excellent chemistry as well which really contributes to romances in general. The other performances are all right except J.K. Simmons who I also felt was excellent here. The film has some issues in pacing and some of the effects but it's so investing and entertaining. Most time loop movies take themselves seriously sometimes with the exception of this and Groundhogs Day. Palm Springs understands how dumb these movies can be and goes out of its way to be funny and most of the time, the humor works. For a first feature, Max Barbakow knocks it out of the park with his direction. It's well written and well shot with plenty of interesting ideas about how we live our life and love. Check this out on Hulu when you get the chance.",Palm Springs
123,jordyntsmith,Quirky and Unique,6,25 September 2021,"Another 'time loop' movie where the characters are living the same day over and over again. However, for a very over-done theme, this movie uses it quite well. It's not quite Groundhog Day, and it's a totally different genre than Edge of Tomorrow, but it works in its own quirky way.We went into the movie looking for a romantic comedy. It has some of that, but with a mix of sci-fi, drama, and all-around quirkiness. However, I did find it fairly enjoyable.The movie is worth watching if you want something different and unexpected. However, I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to view it again.",Palm Springs
124,mbrcf,Needs more time loop and less rom-com,6,5 September 2020,"As many others have already pinpointed, this is literally the third millenium Groundhog Day. We have Nyles (Andy Samberg) who is trapped in a time loop for 40 years (not mentioned in the film) and is forced to live the same day over and over again. He is soon to be joined by the cute Sarah (Cristin Milioti) by some accident and the duo will share this time loop business together.For the first half of the film, the two leads make some great, original fun on the curtain. They banter, do stupid stuff and bring us a lot of chuckes and laughs. What is inevitable though, is that they fall in love and suddenly we are drawn into the same old same old rom-com which we've seen a billion times before for the rest of the movie. I personally don't know how different I would write/make this film or which direction I would lead my story, but I found myself to be wanting more and more time loop, chit-chat and ridiculious nonsense and less and less rom-com, those old, cliched formulas too familiar and too tiresome to care about.Nevertheless, I've had a good time watching this, especially in the first half.

131,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Refreshing,8,22 July 2021,"A very enjoyable time loop movie with a quirky and modern twist. The movie had great direction and flowed at an energetic pace, never slowing down or leaving room for plot holes. The 2 main actors were brilliant, especially the leading lady who could bring a mix of both comedy and emotion. The plot was refreshing and surprisingly clever, using some plot twists that added a different dimension to the movie. The beginning of the movie was originally executed, only really making sense later on when we're introduced to the female lead, and so it almost felt like a sequel to a movie we haven't watched yet. The cinematography was beautiful ; The summery, desert design was a consistent theme throughout and posed as an iconic feature of the movie. Lastly, the movie was self aware and didn't take itself too seriously. It remained a light hearted comedy without overplaying it's main message. There was a very good balance of lightheartedness and seriousness, and neither became overbearing. Overall I highly recommend!",Palm Springs

Cristin aka Sarah, on the other hand is new and starts out grumpy but becomes the adventurous one.J.K. Simmons is also beautiful in his character, although a short storyline. They took Groundhog Day and added some ""stoner existencial crisis"" type feels and added a beautiful romantic angle with an appropriate cinematography.

139,madanmarwah,"Weird, bizarre, unfunny wannabe rom-com",5,10 June 2021,"After reading the tagline of the film which said that the boyfriend believes in nihilism, I thought the film would be interesting but the film left me confused and exhausted. The film talks of a time loop after one goes into a cave, but that makes it perplexing. The day keeps repeating with different events each more outlandish than the other. Reality and dreams mix in a blur. If there was some kind of symbolism in this, I didn't get it. There are some dumb scenes which are neither interesting nor relevant to the plot. The so called comedy is quite unfunny and the dialogue lacks punch. Characters in bed are asked to "" Wake up"" at least a dozen times. The scenes of the wedding reception are lacklustre. The couple are supposed to be reliving the same day many times over but either due to lack of directorial finesse or due to sloppy editing the effect falls flat. The film is directionless in many places.( Pun intended)

It is a time loop film, similar to ""Groundhog Day"", if he had someone to spend eternity with. The wonderful aspect of this plot is that they expand more on the rules of the time loop and its capabilities.
While full of comedy and laugh-out-loud moments, I found the romance and drama realistic and relatable. Some parts hit hard and made me feel extreme happiness or sadness.
Lastly, Samberg and Milioti are tremendous leads, but JK Simmons blew me away with his surprisingly zany comedic role.

148,Criticalstaff,A breath of fresh air,7,24 July 2020,"Palm Springs is the typical romantic comedy meets Groundhog Day. The trailer is very indicative of the tone and style of the movie. Yet it is not overtly explicit and leaves out some nice surprises.It is hard not to love this movie. Not only because it is funny but also because it is sweet. The movie operates on a Groundhog Day(GD), time-loop, premise. Andy Samberg relives the same day over and over. Then, things become complicated when Cristin Milioti is dragged with him to live on the same day forever.It is interesting that GD has become the canon of time-loop movies. Not that it is a bad movie, but it feels very quaint. It works more as a modern day fairytale than anything. And it revolves entirely on Bill Murray and on his own desires and impulses. Bill Murray breaks the spell when he grows out of being a jerk. Obviously it is a movie from another decade, but you can see the same mechanics in Edge of Tomorrow.Palm Springs starts almost where GD ends. Andy Samberg has already mastered the world and himself too, to a certain extent. He starts with the nihilistic hedonistic worldview. This leads me to consider actually Milioti as the protagonist. This movie is GD from a woman's perspective. But not in a hacky Oceans Eight way.
It takes the absurdity seriously, and builds on it to deliver a powerful story. I loved that the first thing she does is trying to get out of the situation. And later on her whole character arc is not dependent on the actions of someone else, but it her willpower to fix the situation herself. Her arc is that she actually does get out of the time-loop. It is refreshing to see that dynamic in these types of movies.Of course, for all the movie's psychological and meta-physical themes it does stay firmly in the rom-com genre, with a light emphasis on comedy. The topics of the purpose of life are secondary to the tropes: they meet, they fight, they go back together after having learned something. Yet, I don't necessarily hate that . It makes for a charming movie. My only complaint is that there is not enough JK Simmons. He ends up having a smaller role than the trailer suggested. But it is not all that bad, in return the movie focuses on the romance between the two leads.And I think that is the charm of the movie. It is smart, but it is not heavy. The story is character driven but it also allows for gags and funny setups. It is similar to Love Wedding Repeat, premise-wise. However, it left me with an even better feeling, which might be result of a more focused story, more out-loud comedic tone and some of the greatest comedy actors. Not that they had bad actors, but hey were mostly unknown and British. Here Samberg and Milioti carry the movie to the highest levels.",Palm Springs
149,ThomDerd,2/3rds of the film are great.,6,18 July 2020,"This is a six (point...twenty-five...). The start of the film is actually pretty good and you 'd think that this will get funnier and funnier but halfway through it gets closer to romance than comedy and loses it's pace.

150,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,A fun and charming romantic comedy time loop,8,28 December 2020,"Groundhog Day was a film that blew my mind back in the nineties. It was a funny comedy with a great philosophical premise that was executed pitch perfectly. The whole time I was thinking, ""How did the filmmakers achieve this?"" I am in full admiration of the story and how the script was constructed. Since then, its structure has become a formula that screeenwriters can study. In the case of Palm Springs, Andy Sanberg's new comedy, it seems someone has.What I loved and admired most about Palm Springs is how it uses the audience's pre-established knowledge of time loop movies to its disposal, of which Groundhog Day sits at the top of that pantheon. The filmmakers know the audience is familiar with how time loop movies work. They do not waste any time and keep things moving and that train, once started, does not stop.The whirlwind speed of how we move through the story is brilliant in that it keeps the story ahead of its audience and provides a firm baseline for all the comedy. These gags come fast out of nowhere and land cold and hard and in your face. Then it cuts straight to the next gag from scene to scene.I laughed a lot at the irreverent humor. Do not forget that this film is a Lonely Island production and they're not afraid of getting graphic, disgusting or shocking. There is a real sense of chaos and anarchy in how Andy Sandberg and Cristin Milioti's characters have fun with the time loop and the audience gets to experience that through them.The philosophical musings, while it's familiar territory, are explored in a comedic way unique to this film. Existential themes like ""What's the meaning of life?"" don't get old. Everybody thinks it about all the time.Andy Sandberg and Cristin Milioti are great as the leads and play off each other well comedically. J.K. Simmons is in a scene-stealing supporting role that is exactly what film fans want him to be doing. The cast add a lot of the charm and we are okay going on this weird-yet-familiar journey with them.In the end, Palm Springs is no Groundhog Day. This movie wouldn't have existed without its predecessor. However, it spins its genre conventions enough to stand on its own merits as a very good charming romantic comedy. It's great fun.",Palm Springs

How on Earth is this a 84/100 on Metacritic is beyond me, even by their laughable standards. This is absolute pedestrian drivel. Out of the many recurring day themes in movies and TV (Groundhog Day, 50 First dates, Supernatural), this is definitely the worst. This made an 85 minute runtime seem unwatchable and never ending. Probably because Samberg is such a third rate version of Sandler, with none of likeability of the latter.

155,MovieWarfare,Unique take on time loop genre,7,2 August 2020,"I have always been a sucker for ""infinite time loop"" movies such as ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Edge of Tomorrow"". So I was already thrilled to see this movie and it was getting a lot of praise from all the critics. There was just one problem I've had when thinking of watching this movie. I am not a big fan of romcoms...Let's start with some of the praises I have with this movie. Firstly, one of the important aspects of a romcom is the chemistry between the two leads. In this case, Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah Wilder (Cristin Millioti) have great chemistry that is charming and effective. There are so many great moments between the two and seeing both of them perform silly antics such as a well-choreographed dance number is funny yet heartwarming. There are also strong performances from the supporting cast who play annoying over the top people to the point you can sort of see where the main leads point come from. Roy (JK Simmons) is the most relevant supporting cast as he is the third time looper and it is great to see him give a more wacky performance but I do feel he is sort of underutilised. Although, the main focus is on the main leads and in that case the lack of focus on supporting characters works in the movie's favour.Another praise is that they found a unique way to tackle the time loop genre that differentiates itself from the other time loop comedy ""Groundhog Day"". Right from the get-go, it is obvious to us the audience that Nyles (Andy Samberg) has been in a long time loop and we are not learning about the loop with him but from him. Additionally, having multiple individuals in the time loop together allows for it to go in a unique direction. The director and writers utilising the time loop to show the relationship between the main leads developing and growing as individuals is fun to watch and sincere. They also use the time loop to as a plot device for surprise twist and revelations and the film certainly has a lot of great twists.Now onto flaws of the movie and the first comes straight away in the first 10 minutes and it is how raunchy it is. The trailer for the movie made it seem like a sincere and heartwarming time loop romcom, which it is to be fair it is, but this movie is extremely R Rated with it's over the top sex scenes that made me question if I was even watching the movie that was advertised. It gives a wrong first impression of the movie and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if someone stopped watching after the first 5 minutes because of how stupid and unnecessary these scenes are. I finished the movie and I still didn't get what these added to the movie. The answer is that it didn't and I question why they thought it was a great idea.The second flaw I have got to say is that this movie is defined as a ""romantic comedy"" and there are a lot of great romantic moments but honestly no moments that made me laugh out loud. They do a fair amount of ""The Lonely Island"" raunchy sex jokes but even then I still didn't find it funny. I got a couple of chuckles in some moments but none stuck out as memorable in the comedy department.Overall, it is a surprisingly very good movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it but not to the extent of how everyone in the media felt about the movie. The most important aspect in a romance movie is to get the audience to root for the main couple and this movie succeeds in this case. The movie is a great time if you ignore the first 10 minutes and you will no doubt come out enjoying it.",Palm Springs

160,PerryAtTheMovies,"Fun, light-hearted, and easy going...",9,11 January 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
I thought this movie was great and fun. I went in assuming that it would be ""another time loop movie to waste my time"", but I was rather surprised. Andy Samberg brings about his usual wit and is complimented by Cristin Milioti's equally stellar performance. Their chemistry flows and in such a way that nothing feels awkward. This movie is light and witty with a little bit of ""got you thinking"". Definitely watch it if you have the means and time.While the movie never truly delves into any deep emotions, it does offer a little grain of salt to make you think, but not in the way to ruin the fun and comedy. If one were to nitpick then the story is decent enough to flow all the way through, and not feel like a time waster. Personally, I enjoyed this movie on my quiet Sunday night.What sets this time loop movie apart from the rest? I truthfully believe that it's the comedy that it brings to the table. Unlike other time loop movies set in the action/adventure genre or the horror genre, this comedy is plain, simple, and fun. You don't have to overthink the issues, the story, or what's happening. You can just sit back and relax with a fulfilled outcome.Overall:
I think this is a fun comedy that most will enjoy. While not raunchy, it definitely has a few jokes and sequences that not everyone will find necessarily tasteful, but overall this is a great movie. I enjoyed it for what it is.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'yes'.Enjoy the show!",Palm Springs

I remember the first movie that I watched with this kind of story was Groundhog Day 1993. I like these movies since they show us how valuable is each day of our life. We grow up we have kids. Our kids grow up. You see time is passing and so many good things come with it. I liked the innovative story of this movie. The movie is filmed in different locations like a wedding venue, a desert, and a bar. Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti played well in this movie. I liked the special effects. I enjoyed the music during watching this movie. In summary, I recommend watching this movie to comedy fans especially fans of multi-verse and time loops.",Palm Springs

167,severindringel,A delightful Rom Com we didn't know we need,8,24 February 2021,"When you see films with an eternal time loop, you automatically think of the legendary Bill Murray comedy Groundhog Day. The theme of the constantly repeating day was taken up by numerous films after that, but none came close to the well-aged classic. Max Barbakow may now have succeeded with his directorial debut film Palm Springs. The film tells the story of Nyles and Sarah, who share the same fate after an incident and grow closer in their literally repetitive lives.The two protagonists are embodied by Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti. Samberg plays the carefree and cynical Nyles with quite a lot of wit and has surprisingly profound monologues despite his character's initial apathy. These come out especially once he meets Milioti's character Sarah, with whom Nyles shares some similarities in lifestyle. From the point where they become unwilling companions, their chemistry is unstoppable and has nothing of a superficial Rom Com relationship. They are cheeky, reckless and hilariously play the trump card that their actions will have no consequences. Their chemistry doesn't just come through the comedic factor, though, because from Sarah in particular we get glimpses into the mind of a person who realises her mistakes as the film progresses and tries to mend her ways. Together they also have romantic scenes that are not over-staged and played up, but just happen naturally. The presence of the two is so powerful and stirring that the supporting characters only get a chance to shine at points. J.K. Simmons is always out for revenge as the frustrated Roy, who shares the same suffering as Nyles and Sarah, until even this one-dimensional character shows other facets towards the end. Simmons once again shows that he is most comfortable in supporting roles and uses his subtle humour at the right time. The rest of the cast around Camila Mendes, Meredith Hagner and Peter Gallagher round out the importance of the plot well without making big appearances individually.Palm Springs is a romantic comedy that does not emulate the cliché of its genre. Barbakow has brought in an idea that we have seen many times like this before, but has a special implementation. The film communicates important messages when it comes to adapting, admitting mistakes or leaving your comfort zone. However, it manages to never fall into the over-the-top drama vortex because the funny and unrealistic scenes always prevail. Paradoxically, another strength of the film is its variety. The fast pacing and treacherous editing never give us the feeling that it is actually the same day throughout the entire ninety minutes of running time. Another feel-good element of the film is its entertaining soundtrack, which makes you want to dance along constantly. Even though Palm Springs has its cliché moments, it is the ultimate cinematic summer experience that gives you a lot of pleasure in times like these.",Palm Springs

Also some things in the movie make absolutely no sense whatsoever & are never explained as to why they would be in the movie at all.So to sum up watching this movie is only worth it if you yourself was in a time-loop & had simply run out of all the other good things to do & this was there.",Palm Springs

177,cristinalinderman,A lively time loop film.,7,17 July 2020,"* There is 1 mid-end credit scene *Max Barbakow in his feature directional debut and crew brought a lively time loop film. The story is about two strangers who meet at a wedding and they are stuck on a time loop. There are many genres with that concept, some of them are good and some of them aren't and this one was an interesting comedy-romantic version. It wasn't hilarious like I thought it would be but I still enjoyed it. The narrative was fun, odd and it all clicked fantastically. I loved the scene where the lead male character did a calculated dance at the wedding to impress her, sadly there weren't enough scenes like that. The ending felt cliché and it could have been better. They should have left it open to interpret and have the mid-end credit scene its only ending making an exciting interpretation.The composer Matthew Compton brought great music but I preferred he stuck with a pattern. His main music was basic in this kind of genre and it did fit with the film. He also had a few of them that were like in a synthwave tone and those were magnificent. How I wish the whole movie would have that same pattern instead of having a mixed one.The cast was fantastic, Andy Samberg's vibe was so electric and exhilarating. Cristin Milioti was more centered and loved her solo mission scene. Both of them had undeniable chemistry and never a dull moment.",Palm Springs

184,theshanecarr,A Delicious Stew,8,13 May 2021,"Start with a wonderful premise, add a little bit of romance, a sprinkling of quantum physics, a heap of good performances, a soupçon of chemistry, a dash of good actors in the supporting roles, garnish with some beautiful locations et voila! You have delivered a fine stew that sounds like something you maybe ate before but as it's going down, you're like ""Oh damn, I don't know what this is, but it is good!""I'd seen a few 5 star reviews for this film which maybe raised my expectations for this film. At the end of the day, it's very much a rom-com, but the timey-wimey spin, and the existential comedy/horror it allows the film to explore (Imagine being stuck with one person forever!) turns this into a gem.I know Samberg from SNL only but he turned in a beautifully judged performance here. Milioti has more of the heavy lifting to do, and pulls it off wonderfully - moving convincingly from anger to mania to sweetness to self-hatred in a short amount of screen time. JK Simmons is ALWAYS good value. Throw in actors like Peter Gallagher and June Squibb in the supporting roles. It's even got Camilla Mendes from Riverdale showing up as the bride. What more could you want??!!!If the measure of a film is how much, once it's over, you feel like you want to watch it again, this scored an ""again! Again!""",Palm Springs

I enjoyed the colour scheme of the filming, very bright and fun.Andy and Cristin have really good chemistry. They are such a joy to watch (and Andy Samberg looks so cute in it!).However, some character's transition is so sudden and unexplained. For example when Sarah suddenly gets angry at Nyles and becomes a physics expert. Or when Roy suddenly becomes this wise forgiving man (He's so good in it!). Also would love to see more of their life after the loop. I guess I just wish the movie was longer to give the story justice (or I just wanna see more of them).",Palm Springs
186,ZuhayrRoha,Not a new concept but executed very well,7,28 July 2020,"Has classic template for Rom-com which I am not a huge fan of but the other stuff glows in this film.The chemistry between the 2 is so great, that night scene with dinosaurs felt very real and emotional, I actually cared about their relationship. But the ending of classic Boy-Girl separates and boy confesses for happy ending was a let down, too cliché for me.I like they went straight into the time-loop, didn't show us the beginning of time-loop madness but gave some flashbacks of more crazy things happening, 'tell not show', audience imagination is more horror.The movie doesn't explains a lot stuffs that I liked, where did the dinosaurs come from?? no one knows, the cast also never questioned and everyone went along with it. Even there are theories of that Nani also being in the timeloop.I liked that they told the story from multiple perspective of similar situation. The idea of Time-loop life with no consequences was executed greatly with montages of them just living the best versions of themselves.As a science nerd I was disappointed that there was longer expositions scene of the actress explaining how they get out, I know some of the scientists in the laptop scene. The actress was sad it was cut down, she tried her best to understand quantum mechanics.
Thinking about it more, the goat disappeared from bomb blast but Nyles stayed for JK Simmons scene at end. Time travel movies always have these inconsistencies.JK Simmons was a great addition, the other cast were also great.The story kept somethings hidden from audience which was later revealed and I was really shocked, rewatching would be great as I did feel there was a lot of foreshadowing at the beginning.Comedy was fine, didn't laughed out loud majority of times, kept a smile on my face throughout the small runtime.",Palm Springs

That one sentenced was the only thing that was going through my head after I finished watching this movie tonight at my local drive in theater with a couple of friends. My excitement for this movie I would say was very high because of how original and fresh the concept looked, yes the time loop concept has been beat to death but I don't think I have ever seen a time loop love story before which was very unique. But the story isn't the only positive thing this movie has to offer. The whole cast is extremely good and funny, yes samberg is good as usual but the main standout here is cristian Milioti who steals every scene she is in. The movie is also extremely fun and had me laughing out loud many times and honestly had me close to tears. The music is also very good. The twist and turns this movie also takes are also very unpredictable and had me Quite shocked a couple times. I honestly have no cons with this movie at all. Overall, I loved Palm Springs and it's a movie I can see me watching again and again, if this movie looked at all interesting to you I would say for sure give it a try because it's for sure worth your time.",Palm Springs
188,MackMonMay87,2020's Update to Groundhog's Day is Worth a Watch,7,29 April 2021,"As someone who's seen Groundhog's Day, a movie about living life over and over again, multiple times, over and over again, a time loop movie has to be done right for me to want to see it, and after enough convincing from friends, I finally tried Palm Springs, and it's more than just a GD retread, thankfully.Andy Samberg might be at his best ever here, and new-to-me actress Cristin Milioti was a hilarious discovery. She looks like she could be Krysten Ritter's younger sister and is just as witty, snarky, and heartfelt. I really look forward to other projects with her.I'm generally not a fan of romantic comedies, so they have to meet a relatively high bar for me to be able to bear them, and Palm Springs succeeds. Importantly, Samberg and Milioti have not just romantic but also comedic chemistry together. A particular scene after she gets adjusted to the time loop where her and Samberg do a dance routine in a local bar had me hurting with laughter.Groundhog's Day is a solid Bill Murray movie, but he gets the majority of the movie's comedy. Not only that, but viewed today, there's some interactions he has with Andie McDowell's character that haven't aged well in terms of consent and modern dating culture (not that he egregiously assaults her or anything, but it's a little uncomfortable to watch now in parts). Palm Springs might use the same premise in general but updates it enough to make it fresh while bringing some of the ideas and interactions, and concepts up-to-date without feeling forced.Some other reviews have mentioned that yes, this is a little more vulgar or adult than Groundhog's Day, but none of that is gratuitous and fits into the plot well. The fact that it's more adult in tone doesn't make it a lesser movie, just meant for a different audience.I don't think we need a whole lot more time loop movies, we should be good for another few decades now at this point, but if you enjoyed Groundhog's Day or want a romantic comedy that isn't overly sweet and won't make you puke, you should spend a bit of time, but not eternity, in Palm Springs.",Palm Springs

I love Brooklyn Nine-Nine, I love Lonely Island, I loved his run on SNL. Still, I walked in with some skepticism. Groundhog Day is hardly the road less traveled, so I had modest hopes. I wasn't prepared.I'll start with this: chemistry. The one thing that will keep me interested when all else fails is the cast's chemistry. If I'm engrossed in two characters sitting and talking with naught else happening, there's something there.Also, the movie managed to get something fresh into the mix: multiple loopers. I'm not going to say it's never happened, but I haven't seen it yet. I liked it.I would throw some shade at the ""protagonists fight before the climax"" cliche, but... if I knocked points off for that, there'd only be three movies in the world.9.8/10",Palm Springs

Like most people of his generation he is without talent, well connected in the industry, and vile. And shame on you J.K. Simmons for allowing yourself to be in this I lost a lot of respect for you.

203,mertafor,Almost great,7,13 July 2020,"At the beginning of the movie, I had a feeling I'll enjoy this one a lot. Really had a promising start. Actors are fine, color is fine, setup is good. Then the next morning came. I've recently finished the superb third season of Dark and after I noticed Groundhog day style trick, honestly I felt it's going to be a bad rip off. Yet surprisingly it turned out pretty good. At least until up to a moment that the girl realized about that bad morning she wakes.It's totally understandable she wakes up on a terrible mistake and can't take it anymore. But taking it out on the guy just didn't make sense. At first, movie tried to lean on the idea of we're here because we've done a mistake in our lives and we should fix it. Once this higher purpose idea didn't work out, she comes up with the ridiculous idea ever to get out : exploding yourself with a c4 in that special place (I won't even ask how did she found c4 since this is a romcom). The worst part was she didn't even care about the guy, she just wanted to end it. Basically her own personal mistake or dilemma has become his problem. All that chemistry (if ever there was) was gone afterwards. I don't know if making a huge explosion would break a time loop but messing up the chemistry between main characters definitely breaks the consistency.Once that connection is lost, the rest wasn't funny, romantic or whatever you call it. If they would handle the second half more delicately, this could have been 8 even 8.5 easily. And it could have stand on its own instead of calling it a Groundhog day style movie and it means you can re-watch it countless times.In the end this is a nice flick. But I don't imagine I would like to see this again.",Palm Springs

it is a groundhog day in a different perspective, you could and would watch groundhog day anytime again but not this movie !
good enough to enjoy but not good enough to watch again !",Palm Springs
211,helghast-1337,Interesting Groundhog Day rip off with a few twists,7,10 July 2020,"First, if you don't think this movie took an idea from Groundhog Day (the movie) then it's obvious you never watched that movie. As bad as it is to rip an idea of an already popular film, the twists added to this one make it worthy to watch, albeit once and never again.I like Andy and he's decent in this role but the whole movie is more melancholy than funny and while other actors can pull it off he doesn't. He should stick to being funny and not serious but I get he would want to show some range in acting. The rest of the cast is okay. Nothing special (except Simmons of course) and nothing memorable from the acting perspective.It's a perfect length at about 90 minutes. Unless it's a masterpiece, spending more than 90 minutes on a movie is hard to justify. It's about 1 hour 24 minutes or there abouts after the intro and end credits so it's not a lot of time invested.I would recommend watching it once just to say you watched and think of all the things they could have done in the movie. When I see a movie like this or Groundhog Day (with this one being rated R ) I imagine they could do far worse things with all the time they spend in the universe. They may say they have done things but doesn't bode well for the imagination. I hope if there's another movie like this in the future they will make it more of a sadistic type thriller instead of a rom com.",Palm Springs

213,johnpmoseley,This film is such a winner...,9,11 April 2021,"...that it's weird to find its average rating is only 7.4. The cosmic ideas are really fun, the characters are likeable and relatably world-weary, their dialogue is, by turns, funny and touching, and the setting is lovely. It's so good!Maybe the low-raters just thought they could be reborn and rewrite their reviews tomorrow.",Palm Springs

Nice soundtrack too.Original script, metaphorical about relationships and how to adapt to changes.This is one of the best movies made in the last 20 years.",Palm Springs
217,theworstcritic,Surprisingly enjoyable,9,24 September 2021,"I really like this movie. I thought it was going to be a generic comedy to waste some time, but it's does a really good job in creating a funny story. The main points are due to the chemistry between Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, they carry the movie as they are really the only characters. I always thought the time-loop genre was just all boring rip offs of Groundhog Day, but Palm Springs proved me wrong.",Palm Springs
218,Gorillaboi,As fun as everyone said it was,8,11 July 2020,"I'm a sucker for time-loop / time-travel type movies, and so was always going to enjoy this. But this movie gets extra marks for making an effort to add some originality.CHARACTERS: They're great in this. Very likeable. The chemistry between the two leads is very good.ROMANCE: It's got the right level of cheese to it. Not over the top or cliched. It's very believable / relatable.COMEDY: Gets full marks in this department. Not over-the-top or annoying. Jokes are well paced (spread out) - and strike a fine balance between seriousness and laughter.STORY/PLOT: It's a time-loop film. Not much else to it. But the events in it are entertaining. And it's content with being a very simple plot (doesn't try to overcomplicate anything)There are a few drawbacks (like the rushed ending). But all in all, a very good, heart-warming movie that keeps your interest over a respectable duration. Definitely worth the watch.",Palm Springs
219,armanwhannell,FUNNY,7,19 December 2020,"We have already seen all this before in another movies such as, Happy Death Day and Groundhog day. As well as Netflix's original TV Series titled Russian Doll. However, watching Palm Springs was an enjoyable and an entertaining experience. Despite the fact that the plot of the movie is similar to the ones mentioned above, it is unique in the way of presenting a very unusual love story that I really loved.",Palm Springs

221,jordanlamborn,I can't believe I watched that whole thing.,5,16 July 2020,"Boring as can be. I felt like I got stuck in two time loops watching this. Nothing exciting or original happened. Cristin milioti is cute though. I didnt plan on watching the whole thing but I wanted to see how they got out. Pretty underwhelming.
I hate that I hate everything.
The main character's name is Nyles which I think is short for Nyles-ism. Heheh get it? That's a better joke than most of them in the movie.",Palm Springs
222,nIGHTmAYOR,Deus Ex Quantum 2,2,2 August 2020,"This movie steals on a large scale from another movie called Happy Death Day 2U . It even without guilt relate the reason behind this time loop to the Quantum theory (Where Hollywood decided blaming every thing lately on it despite being irrelevant just because it's some vague theory and few people understand it) which is exactly what Happy Death Day 2U established to justify time loops .I could have marked dozens of other similarity but yet I like sticking to my format of reviews of minimal to no spoilers .As for the movie itself , the pace is not boring , it did not play on being repetitive as all time loops movies like to , but still , you do not get quite engaged enough nor care what happens next as a result of all characters being developed so you hate them .So bottom line if you haven't watched Happy Death Day 2U this one might seem okey , but if you did , then the value of entertainment this one gives becomes minimal .P.S Deus Ex Quantum is a claimed propitiatory by me , do not abuse it or else .",Palm Springs
223,tjsuf,One of the better movies of 2020,8,8 August 2020,"This movie was just fun. Andy Samberg always has really funny, crazy entertaining movies. Palm Springs had some depth to it.

224,danielmullin,Literally straight faced this entire movie,4,16 December 2020,"There must be some mistake..... they forgot to make it funny! Have I accidentally watched some special directors cut of the film where they remove all the funny jokes or something? I didn't laugh once in this awful movie. Andy Samberg a pre cringe guy on the low. But most importantly Cristin Milioti literally the least likeable character in a movie ever, I hated her and hoped she would die for real. No seriously it's actually physically impossible to laugh at this movie I DECLARE THAT THIS MOVIE IS UNLAUGHABLE !!! And OMG the cringe was unbearable I felt it running down my spine it was actually painful !",Palm Springs

227,Drawmort,The fun time loop that successfully pretends to be wise and deep.,8,29 June 2021,"At the beginning of the story, the obvious first thought is to be seeing another variant of ""Groundhog Day"" again. But Samberg has that charisma that combined with a very clever, audience-focused script, gets you hooked without hesitation.The ambitious writers take care to keep viewers identified with Nyles and Sarah at all times in their different reactions to events, having plenty of time for a few.The protagonists end up being wise, although they have traveled different paths before achieving it.Despite having a predictable ending, as in its storyline predecessors, the overall tone of the film leaves you satisfied after a quick move on to an up-close, empathetic (for convenience), and entertaining rom-com.It is a light, funny movie with a good dose of existential philosophy and some present science as an excuse. It has a great script, a very good editing and decent performances.Fully recommended.",Palm Springs
228,ravenosa,Yet Another Groundhog's Day...,5,11 September 2021,"Yet without the humor and FILLED with exposition regarding a very convoluted mess of a ""time loop"" plot.I didn't find there to be any laughs or characters to care about. I'm really not sure what the writers, director and producers were seeing in this story. By the end, I didn't see what the point of any of it was other than to reuse and overcomplicated a tired storytelling premise.",Palm Springs
229,Joeyan0706,Keep everything small for a bigger thing,6,30 December 2020,"Obviously Palm Spring is a small budget movie, the story evolve between several character, who keep relive the same day over and over again. As they try to keep everything simple and focus, we the audience can literally develop a very good bonding with the character, the dialogue is comfortable to deal with, no cliche no empty rhetoric. It is a heartening rom-com with perfect sci-fic genre. Please give it a try.",Palm Springs
230,aigoalies,B-List Groundhog's day,6,20 July 2020,"Warning: spoilers for this movie and groundhogs day belowThis movie is basically a remake of groundhog day with a few twists here and there. The good parts of the movie for me was the comedy which I thought was very good and I had some pretty good laughs. The part where the movie falters for me was that it was too similair to groundhogs day. The movie goes through everything groundhog's day does: romance, suicide, helping others, having sex, doing fun stuff. The only two things it really does different is using ""science"" to escape the loop and having two people get stuck. For me this movie would have been much better if it started with the groundhog's day loop but took a different twist on it with different results instead of ending up in the same ending of them falling in love and continuing their lives. I still believe there is much room for uniqueness with the groundhogs day concept as shown in the edge of tomorrow (for example you could have the couple stay in the loop) but this film didn't make it unique enough to make it super interesting.",Palm Springs
231,INTXb,Enjoyable but no Groundhog Day,7,19 July 2020,A good movie to watch if you want to kill a couple hours. The two leads are pleasant and I liked their chemistry but the movie was just not as well crafted as Groundhog Day which includes the attention to detail. Admittedly GD is one of my all time favorites so it's a high bar. The lead often doesn't act like a guy stuck in a loop for a long time. Also they didn't tell Roy what they discovered near the end which is a big loose end. They could have don't without the cheesy effects used to demonstrate traveling through dimensions or whatever.,Palm Springs
232,sevenhorseshoes,Phenomenal,9,14 July 2020,"It's like an updated version of Groundhog Day. But it didn't feel like a half assed rehash.Adam and Cristin are fantastic. This is a great rom-com too. Music brought me in but didn't seem forced. Felt at times like Donnie Darko too, which I liked. Beautifully shot and paced too.My only gripes are too much swearing and ocassionally unoriginal swearing or contrived swearing, and the ""animals"" at the end. The only way they could've been there is if they went through and they are WAY too big. But the ""animals"" were so awesome an affectation I didn't care that much.Watch this twice in a row and get twice the movie.",Palm Springs
233,herichey-67169,"Eh, it's ok..a movie to pass the time",6,29 July 2020,"Don't think it was really worth the watch but I didn't dislike it. Andy feels out of place in the character he plays. Just didn't work. Other actors were great. The plot line was predictable and pretty basic with typical tropes. It was a cool concept in general I wish was explored more than it was, felt like a knock off version of Groundhog Day.",Palm Springs
234,mchristi-156-169140,Fun but too R-rated,8,12 July 2020,I enjoyed the show a lot. But I have to take a few points off for vulgarity and heavy swearing. Those aren't entertaining to me.,Palm Springs

This is not an awful film and we are samburg fans, but it was just meh. Not funny enough to be a top comedy and not deep enough to be a top rom com. As I said not an awful but don't expect a 7.4 as they say it is a 5.2 at best.",Palm Springs
238,the-antichrist-is-near,"Less pretentious than groundhog day, but not perfect",7,27 July 2021,"First part of the movie is great, gets a little predictable halfway with the romance.

243,juanandonly-80815,Easy to like,7,26 November 2020,"""Palm Springs"" is a kind of film that you don't need to be very technical in order to appreciate it. ""Palm Springs"" simply relied on a plain plot that everybody won't expect to be engaging and extraordinary but the film managed to add flavors to the ""time loop"" conflict so the viewers can have a mesmerizing experience for 1 hour and 30 minutes. The application of romantic-comedy element was nicely done and a very little touch of sci-fi made the turning point more interesting. ""Palm Springs"" is one of the few good things happened in 2020 cinema and everybody may find hard to not like the film.",Palm Springs

245,tommymoses-82110,I actually liked it,2,18 July 2020,"But how in the world can anyone justify them not taking Roy (J. K. Simmons) with them when they leave? He had a light monologue about how he is stuck never having the opportunity to watch his children grow up, so they dont take him with them?

246,QuadeC2010,I Must've Watched a Different Movie than Everyone Else,3,15 July 2020,"I turned on Palm Springs last night since everyone is talking about it, and it has gotten rave reviews from both audiences and critics, which is kind of a rarity these days, and it also has Andy Samberg in it. It really sounds like it can't go wrong... but, it does.Throughout its run-time, I don't think I laughed even one time. Its trailer advertises it as a comedy, and everyone on here calls it hilarious, but seriously I didn't even laugh once. It starts off as almost like a sci-fi horror movie ala You're Next meets Happy Death Day, but after those first 15 minutes, it becomes to drab and mundane.I really don't think I've seen more people cry in a supposed comedy. Every 5 minutes someone is either crying or teary-eyed. And there is no comedy at all to be found. It's not darkly funny, it's not silly funny, it's just overall not funny. At all. But it's also not sad either.It's not a total waste because it is beautifully shot and well acted, but those are about the only two good things I can say about this. I just don't get it. Not sure what all the hype and ranting and raving is about.",Palm Springs
247,mnogogaloshi,Sursprisingly fresh spin on a tired idea,7,10 September 2020,"Palm Springs doesnt do a lot of things he havent seen before, but at least it doesnt take itself too seriously. The chemistry between the leads is great and the oscar winning J.K. Simmons is a great addition too.The theme of time traveling will probably never get old and its also the engine of Christopher Nolans blockbuster that everyone hope is going to save the cinematic 2020. Here we see a cardboard version of the scale and action in Tenet.

Palm Springs offers from beginning to end, a unique experience, light and deep in the same time... With two mesmerizing actors whose delightful chemistry expresses itself through the multi-flavored layers of this so catchy story... A fun but meaningful journey that is, to experience this intense & emotional ride alongside these two great characters !Andy Samberg & Cristin Milioti both offer a tremendous performance, striking and very much memorable ! And the supporting cast does a superb job ; which makes the whole piece even more enjoyable.This is the type of movie in which you just feel good to go through each of the events that happen ; and as same as for an excellent book or comic book, you quite simply wanna turn the page and get the chance to see what's next !... And eventually going back to it later on, because it was so good ...A mention to the color treatment & light, the settings & overall atmosphere, along with the music : it all contributes wonderfully to create this pretty magical piece of a movie :)",Palm Springs

265,ryanmoynihan,"Another Groundhog's Day, But Still a Lot of Fun",7,22 September 2020,"I was worried this would be another ""oh no! This groundhog day syndrome is making me feel crazy"" movie. I'm happy to say that it's not. It still falls into a few of the same beats, however. The characters predict events and words before they happen and eventually want to find a way out of the loop. But the bulk of the movie feels fresh.It takes a spin on the concept by letting the characters mess with all other people at the wedding, which is hilarious. And by the end it seems to be even more thoughtful than most other movies with the same premise. It touches on hedonism and love as a life motivator in a way that may be fairly shallow, but is still sweet and appreciated.Andy Sandberg and Cristin Milioti are funny as hell and work well together as a comedy duo. They really pull the whole thing together. Without them this whole movie probably wouldn't have been as good. The way the film is shot is a little dull apart from a few interesting aerial shots and the cave scenes. What really kept me interested was the chemistry between the leads and the fun script.",Palm Springs

269,StrifeLeeSimpson,Andy Samberg was almost one bad movie away from becoming thought of as another Adam Sandler,9,9 September 2020,I was hoping this was going to be good but was worried that Andy Samberg may have been one bad movie away from becoming thought of as another Adam Sandler. Luckily he's had the opportunity to consistently show his range on Brooklyn Nine-Nine since 2013 and completely delivered in this film. With a really effective opening showcasing the type of humor and emotional journey he would find himself on and a female lead who did a perfect job showcasing the character's multidimensional and realistic personality. I was taken on an emotional journey with a familiar rom-com formula but fresh and enough character development to keep it interesting. I was also a fan of the shifting perspectives as it was not overdone and happened at the perfect times to give the characters time to breath and let us empathize and understand both. It took a sub-genre and familiar premise and was able to stand on its own as an outrageous comedy and emotionally driven sci-fi flick.,Palm Springs
270,A-90,"Sweet, hilarious, original",9,25 April 2021,"Had a great time watching this. Seeing people say the Groundhog Day concept has all been done before is, well, like Groundhog Day. Of course you have to go into it knowing it's based on a well-known premise, but the story is fresh and entirely original.

But that being said the movie isn't flawless, some minor plot holes, some problem with logic and science of time, but in my opinion, the worst aspect of the movie is JK Simmons's character that just feels out of place and doesn't work out the way it should.
Overall Palm Spring is a fine, fine film that was missing in American comedies.",Palm Springs
275,edfie_f,Very enjoyable and thinkable sci-fi,8,10 July 2020,"The first thing come to my mind when I watched this movie is that ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) time lopping where Bill Murray's character got stuck in. But in here there's a way of going further with the idea of being inmortal. Discovering the meaning of life through days gone by is a get off well technical goosebump, followed by a bunch of unnecessary time-travel resolutions we don't need to. Same as ""Back In the Future"" (1985) when Doc tries to explain what is going on a blackboard. Of course this is a reference. The last thing I have to say is the exploitation of Simons' character as a man who is tired of living his life but at least has to raised? two little childs cause of one Mai Thai left condom. The relationship between Nyles and Roy could be the same Alan Parrish and Van Pelt in ""Jumanji"" (1995). Just because we don't know what happened between the last two. It came randomly to my mind but I think it's another cinematic reference so filling more scenes with them. And you? How many did you find?The positive ""vibe"" is somehow on the dialogue comes from Sarah when she asks Nyles: ""Well, then what's the point of living?"". Or Roy's best meta quote: ""At least you have each other. Nothing worse than going through this s**t alone"" referring to life itself. It's a comedy but it take it seriously to the frame",Palm Springs

I was expecting another Groundhog Day ripoff but this was totally original and the chemistry between the two lead roles were totally heartfelt and heartwarming.

278,BrBaFett,A Beautiful Masterpiece,9,23 November 2020,"It's one of those heartfelt indie movies that you can appreciate. I also like how they give Andy Samberg a serious side in this movie with a comedic role while introducing other low-key brilliant actors and actresses in this film, even giving Cristin Milioti a movie to show how excellent and underrated of an actress she is also why she deserves more big roles going forward into the future; JK Simmons is also a fabulous actor that knows how to portray antagonizing characters very well -- but today I say he was born to play J. Jonah Jamieson as I believe it's his best role before his in Whiplash. If you as me today, deserves an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay.It has the same premise as Groundhog Day with Bill Murray, but what I love about it is that there are hidden clues within the movie that gives more for you to think about. But what I think I would've liked to have seen get added within is more of a story as to why Andy Samberg's character of Nyles went into the cave in the first place, I have a strong and wise idea as to what lead him there.",Palm Springs
279,fscouto_,A profound and sentimental repetition,9,13 April 2021,"When I started watching Palm Springs, I immediately assumed it was going to be another romantic comedy following the archaic formulae of two people, without hope in love, that end up winding up together. When that unfortunate closure seemed to be becoming true, pretty early on, our expectations are suddenly subverted, and we end up in one of the funniest and most profound feel-good movies I have seen lately. The general idea has been used before (not as much as the hopeless lovers' one), but Palm Springs makes it work. Because even though it is fiction, the truth is we are all afraid of being stuck, without something or someone that brings some meaning to our lives. And these misfits, with no hope for the future, will meet in this infernal loop, turning their lives around, making them a little less hellish. With delightful, profound and a few daft moments, Palm Springs is tasteful, embraces the inherent silliness of its story, and it is met by a beautiful cinematography and a suitable soundtrack. In a year where cinema was practically lost to the pandemic, the streaming services allow these indie gems to surface now and then. For much of our enjoyment.",Palm Springs

281,robrhlphotographylee,could even be better then the classic GHD,9,10 April 2021,"If someone says timeloop movie, everyone thinks of groundhog day. Quite rightly so. It seems there was GHD then there where imitations. Naked probably being the worst of this type of film. Seriously dont ever watch that.Then along came palm springs. One of the things that makes this film different is that its not just one person stuck in the loop. This adds another depth to this tried and tested type of story.So apart from the obvious live like there's no tomorrow together. Enjoying the fun of nothing matters and no punishment for their actions, the film then takes the darker turn of what happens when they dont want to be around each other. Hating and missing the person who is going through the same torture of reliving the same day over and over. This is what makes the film different to other time loop movies.It also shows the different perspective of length of time in the loop. Nyles has been in the loop so long he's actually forgotten what he does for a living. While Sarah is new to it and wants out.This review only loses a star for the ending. Which is always hard for this style of film. I almost feel it should of ended with the explosion leaving the audience to make their own story from there. The ending falls flat in comparison to the rest of the film. Its like they had to give it and ending but didnt know what to go for.",Palm Springs
282,grim2005,Pretty Good Rom-Com Time Loop Film,6,14 July 2020,"I'm a huge fan of time loop movies and this one might be in the top 5 of those I've seen.The first half is fun and enjoyable. Samberg and Milioti are great and work well together, and the use of multiple people experiencing the time loop - something that's surprisingly rare for time loop movies - works well. Samberg's usual over-the-top schtick is turned down to 25% here, which made the movie more enjoyable for me, as it meant the humour meshed well with the somewhat more serious vibe of the movie.Where the movie faltered for me was around half way through the movie where it switches from fun to drama. As with a lot of stories, this is when the world falls apart for our protagonist(s) and they need to fix things to get back on top and come out stronger than before. But here the resolution is not greatly satisfying, so it's not really worth the switch from fun. The ending itself is not the worst they could have gone with, but even that feels somewhat underwhelming. In fact, despite the movie having a somewhat unique premise, the last act of the movie feels like the generic final act that a lot of rom-coms movies use. I also didn't find Samberg's acting to be fantastic when he needed to act more serious, although that issue only stood out to me a few times in the film.Overall, though, the movie was good. It did something a little different with the time loop concept, the good parts of the movie were really enjoyable, and even if the second half wasn't fantastic it didn't ruin the entire film. So I'd recommend this to anyone who likes the sound of a semi-serious rom-com time loop flick. (And now that those 90 minutes have come and gone for me, I wish they'd actually made it an 8-10 episode miniseries instead.)",Palm Springs

299,RyanMatheson13,A MUST WATCH TIMELOOP ROMANTIC COMEDY - Technical Rating: 7.5/10 My Rating: 8.5/10,9,5 August 2020,"Palm Springs
Released July 10th, 2020
Hulu OriginalStarring: Andy Samberg, Christin Milioti, J.K. Simmons
Directed: Max BarbakowThis may well be one of the most enjoyable movie watching experiences I have all year. Palm Springs is just simple and fun with its fresh approach to a time loop romantic comedy. This Hulu Original film produced by the one and only Lonely Island and helmed by first time director Max Barbakow definitely took a risk of falling into the standard formula or template films like these tend to fall into. Although it does become fairly predictable as we enter into the third act of the film (which honestly didn't bother me at all), I did appreciate how Barbakow told this story from many different perspectives. Editing in a smart way, and made sure to reveal shocking aspects of each characters arch perfectly as to make sure not to turn the screenplay in a repetitive and dull mess. You'll understand what I mean as each time the day repeats, we are shown that much more of each of our main characters that will have you being more and more invested.By far the best part of this film is the instant and palpitating chemistry between Nyles & Sarah. Films like this sink and fall flat if the audience does not truly believe the genuine performances of the actors - this was absolutely not the case in Palm Springs. It was honestly such a treat to watch when they were both on screen together as they completely stole every scene - one in particular in the second act in a bar (you'll know!).Now, is this the funniest film I've ever seen (most definitely in 2020)...no. It's doesn't change the game with hilarious out loud laughter but it does have its moments. And we've established how amazing the film is having Andy and Christin occupy most its key scenes, BUT the supporting cast - most notably the presence of J.K. Simmons - is just icing on the cake. As I mentioned in one of my previous posts, J.K. Simmons is one of my favourite actors working today and if you don't agree, simply watch 2014's Oscar nominated Whiplash - it will change your opinion.One thing I should mention in case some of you may be thinking of watching this film with your younger children or even your parents - Palm Springs is a HARD R rating! And by no means is this a bad thing - look at some of Judd Apatow films - just wanted to give you all a heads up. Drug and alcohol abuse, and some heavy sexual content are present throughout - you'll see in the opening scene of the film. I believe this is done intentionally to let the audience know then tone of the film and nature of some of the humour and that it doesn't hold back any punches!As of right now, Palm Springs has easily cracked my top ten favourite films of 2020 and it is most definitely a must watch in my opinion. If you're not particularly fond of romantic comedies, you may miss why I love this film so much. But if you're like me, and can appreciate a light-hearted 90 minute time-loop journey to happy-town - you are going to enjoy this film as much as I did.Sorry, there are no cameos or performance from Loney Island - disappointing I know and a huge SPOILER ALERT!",Palm Springs

But this was a charmingly-delightful experience into a clever time-loop snafu, so I got over the cartoon sex and cartoon violence.Andy Samberg captures some of Bill Murray's frustration in Groundhog Day but then makes it charmingly his own. Andy is exhausted but then added into the mix is the captivating Cristin Milioti. And then things just take off in a bizarre way.The bar dance was mesmerizing and hilarious. Bonus points for the great J.K Simmons who stole every scene he was in. Bonus points for the amazing chemistry of Samberg and Milioti.I'll let the rest of the reviewers discuss direction, set design, editing, and cinematography - but all were perfect.In a normal year, this film would've garnered many academy award nominations.

I found the screenplay very good (still one bugging detail at the marriage but hey...).

Cristin Milioti is great, I've loved her performances in Black Mirror, Made for Love (ie Diet Black Mirror, Directors Cut). I mean, all she does is show up and stare in shock at things in all three but she's really good at that one specific look.Palm Springs has some really funny bits, some good darkly humor, some plain darkly bits and some heartfelt moments. Really loved the use of The Partisan- so good. I have nothing really to compare it to except maybe like a mix of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Lonely Island- and that doesn't even come close tbh. Palm Springs is just a good movie. I would call it a dark romantic comedy with a sci-fi backdrop.If you like Save Yourselves!, Mitchells vs. The Machines, Sorry to Bother You, etc- you'll find Palm Springs towards the top half of that list.",Palm Springs
313,Anudeepsambaraju,Palm Springs (2020) Short Review: 6.5/10 Surprisingly good...,7,6 August 2020,"I was a bit skeptical after watching the trailer, but surprisingly Palm Springs (2020) is satisfying, entertaining and has no dull moments, its absurdly funny throughout the movie. My rating 6.5/10.Director: Max Barbakow
Cast: Andy Samberg, Cristin Milioti, J.K. Simmons
Genre: Comedy, Mystery, RomancePremise: A wedding at palm springs, a city in California. Two strangers Nyles (Andy Samberg) and Sarah (Cristin Milioti) stuck in a time loop, repeating the wedding day over and over...Palm Springs is about this two strangers how they fall in love in this bizarre scenario and finding ways to escape the time loop. Will they succeed or they will be stuck for eternity?Review: Premise of palm springs is nothing new its "" one of those infinite time loop situations you might have heard of"" and maybe you saw a couple of movies similar to it. Whats interesting in this movie is the two witty characters Nyles and Sarah, their absurd comedy, weird moments, and how they find joy rather than suffering on the wedding day that they both hate to live in, because of (Spoiler) past. And eventually they falls in love.Nyles is a carefree guy, he gave up escaping after many many time loops and then masters the several ways to entertain himself, enjoys his life like there is no tomorrow (literally for him there is no tomorrow, so he had no choice). On the other hand sarah, she is the sister of the bride and has some issues... somehow, when she dragged into the mess of this time loop, where the fun begins in the movie. She tries to escape this time loop numerous times, failing every time. Such as driving back to her hometown and still waking up in palm springs the same wedding day. Slowly she sees logic in nyles philosophy of enjoying life. And as seen in the trailer they party, dance, drinks tries all sorts of fun happy stuff.
The bond and chemistry between Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti is really good, definitely carries this movie and makes a very watchable. Even with the little screen time J.K. Simmons stole scenes he in it, he was hilarious. progression of the story and the characterization through the same day makes us curious and interesting in every loop.Cons: The main problem i had is that it skips the pivotal moments like the character transformation and the resolution for change is not that believable. Palm springs plays in the safe side, it never takes risks, it never gets serious it sticks to the cheesy comedy (which is great in first 40 minutes, after that, it didn't work for me). the ending could have been better. And off course the horrible CGI.Verdict: With a low budget 5 million US dollars and with just 90 minutes of fast-paced comedy in the genre of the time loop that we all love about, i think its hard to hate Palm Springs its quite entertaining. I had a good time watching this movie. Don't expect too much just lay back and enjoy the movie. My Rating 6.5/10Other movie recommendations: If you liked this movie then definitely check Groundhog day (1993) movie, a classic which started this whole time loop genre.
If you're into sci-fi action want to see some bullets , then Check Edge of Tomorrow (2014).
or try experiment with your taste by Source Code (2011).

It's all been done before. The plot mixes ""Groundhog Day"" with bits and pieces from trite romcom tropes, veers into ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" or ""Good Will Hunting"", depending on the level of suspension of belief that you decide to allocate to this sad comedy. The lack of internal logic of the plot is what grated most on my nerves. I was obviously not expecting much in the way of plausibility, but the plot holes are so huge that the whole wedding party might have fallen through it. I had very low expectations: I do not particularly appreciate the acting chops of the two leads, they have no chemistry in the scene used for the trailer. The writing is effervescent in comparison to the directing. The Photography is so basic that I would not be surprised if it turned out that the D. P. was working from home. The music really deserves a better movie and it was butchered in such a pathetic way, that the unfunny scenes become almost painful to watch. I stuck to the end of it, because I wanted to see if there was any redemption in the final act, anything surprising at all. Alas, no. The only saving grace is J. K. Simmons. The other actors have almost no lines, with the exception of Meredith Hagner who, in a thankless part, still manages to be more likeable than the two leads.",Palm Springs

While this movie was great I did find certain scenes didn't flow as well, and there were a couple plot points that were easy to figure out early on, but I think those things are able to be overlooked with this type of movie.Overall, if you have Hulu (or even a drive in nearby that might be showing it) I highly recommend it. It has laughs, a likeable cast, and is a well done movie that should be watched during a year when movies have almost ceased to exist.",Palm Springs
324,lilbuch22,The Most Fun Film I Have Seen In a Long Time,10,13 November 2020,Palm Springs is one of those films that has so much to it. If you are looking for a really fun and fast paced romantic comedy this is for you. If you are looking for a deep and philosophical film that makes you think this is for you. If you want to be sitting on the edge of your seat this film is for you. If you like a fun science fiction adventure this film is for you. Palm Springs is one of those hidden gems that blends so many genres in one film while flowing perfectly. The story is so relatable with the days in the quarantine but also what is most relatable is our two main characters aren't perfect people. They have to learn to become better people from how they have lived their lives in the past. There are so many ways to look at this film but I will leave that up to you. The acting from Sandberg and Milioti is top-notch. The direction is fresh with a blend of beautiful cinematography. What really got me the most though is the music. The blend of old alternative music with a beautiful and almost euphoric score. This film is just an overall wave of emotions while being a roller coaster ride of fun! When the Oscar season is upon us they need to remember this flick!,Palm Springs

326,LConyers,Ending movies like this is problematic...,9,14 July 2020,"I kept waiting for this movie to shyte the bed, and it just refused. I REALLY enjoyed this ride.As I neared the end, I was almost anxious wondering how they were going to wrap it all up.
I realized immediately that ending a movie like this was always going to be problematic, but they did a good job, and it did not take away from an otherwise great experience.I watch movies with the intention of laughing, crying, and laugh-crying, and this movie delivered on all counts.A final quick note, I absolutely love Groundhog Day-ish movies, but so rarely are they done well. This one delivered.",Palm Springs
327,rossjackson2,Fantastic!,9,30 April 2021,I really enjoyed this. So it uses the same concept as Groundhog Day but puts a fresh spin on it. Funny and entertaining with both leads putting in great performances with an obvious chemistry between them. And J. K. Simmons is superb as well. My new favourite time loop film!,Palm Springs

329,eaveschristopher,The Cinamatic Manifestation of 2020,9,16 July 2020,"Palm Springs Micro Review -When Palm Springs premiered in January at the Sundance Film Festival it never could have predicted it would be the cinematic manifestation of the year 2020. While the film is built upon traditional romcom scaffolding its characters and their balancing of hilarious moments with honest and authentic underlying feelings of loneliness elevates the genre. Palm Springs is near perfect at accomplishing what it set out to be.Andy Samberg (Nyles) has been stuck in a repeating wedding day time loop for an eternity, when by chance, Cristin Milioti (Sarah) becomes unknowingly trapped with him. Samberg uses his comedic background as a well executed shield for Nyle's nihilism for the situation he has found himself in. Miloti faces her own challenges and plays off of Samberg's quirkiness acceptance of this bizarre situation fantastically. But Samberg and Milioti's back and forth is more than well executed hilarious moments, they punch upwards towards exploring our interconnections.While I did not care for ""how"" the time loop was addressed, Palm Springs is not a film about escaping a never ending repeating day. Palm Springs authentically addresses the feelings of loneliness in a world we sometimes feel we have no control over with leviety. One of the best films 0f 2020.",Palm Springs
330,anishchari,Second hand embarrassment,2,7 September 2020,"There's a reason people don't copy Groundhog Day despite the premise being something so tempting to repeat; like time travel or body swapping. Groundhog Day is it's almost a perfect movie, to invite comparison is to risk being inferior. Edge of Tomorrow was the last quasi successful movie to try.Palm Springs is NOT a success. The setup is familiar. Niles is stuck in a single day loop and has already accepted his fate in a kind of nihilistic defeatism. That is until someone else is sucked into the loop with him. Now, this would be like being stranded on a deserted island and finding on day that someone else has washed ashore. It would literally be the most world changing event in your otherwise purgatorial existence. You would think finding a kindred spirit would give his life purpose, but the even is treat so blasse as if it's just another rerun for Niles.So if we're not supposed to take this seriously then it's just a big dumb romantic comedy without any of the existentialism or deeper meaning we get in Groundhog Day. Ok fine, Edge of Tomorrow pulled that off. But that mean it has to be funny. This is not. There's lots of yelling, swearing, ridiculous drug usage, constant drinking, and pithy one liners and quips. Turning the craziness up to 11 isn't going to work. It has none of the comedic timing of Bill Murray and certainly not the more natural character arc. The jokes all so obvious and so disappointing coming from Andy Sandberg's often brilliant Lonely Island.JK Simmons feels like a throwaway. His plot relevance could have been any other character spouting the same wisdom, but I guess that wasn't zany enough for the director. There's a brief moment in the middle where they try to get to something deeper but it doesn't amount to enough. That the movie starts and ends on bad wedding speeches may be the most fitting thing about the movie. It's derivative, tries to be funny and fails, is longer than it feels, and you really just want the whole thing to be over.",Palm Springs

336,tangled-up-in-plaid,Best Romcom Ever Made,10,21 December 2020,"This movie is the most inventive Romcom that's ever been made and I want more like it from The Lonely Island. They avoid tropes altogether, the conflict makes sense and it's a twist when you find out what the female leads issue is, the reason behind the loop makes sense from sci Fi standpoint and the ending is sooooo satisfying.
The characters are well written and well acted and their reaction to the situation they are in makes sense.
You should watch this movie, my fiancee and I are watching it for the second time in 24 hours.",Palm Springs
337,BlooartStooart,Fantastic update of the 'Groundhog day' format,9,14 April 2021,"I was genuinely surprised how good this was. It was nice that the main character stuck in the daily-loop was joined by someone else, and it added to the narrative that sharing things is better than doing them alone.I was engrossed for the entire duration. Great characters, lots of comedy moments and superb lead performances from Samberg and Milioti.I love Groundhog day with Bill Murray, but it is now 'dated' so this is a great refresh of the concept and I think I actually slightly prefer this! Controversial!!!",Palm Springs

339,ivington,"Good first half, poor 2nd half",6,9 September 2020,"Yes we've seen the premise before, but the 2 main characters had a pretty decent chemistry during the lunacy of the first half and the rom-com genre of the movie was following a logical path.
Then all of a sudden the female has a split personality attack and becomes a real party pooper with any connection between her and the guy completely lost from that point. She just behaves like she couldn't give a rat's about him.
Then right near the end, split personality flips back and she says she loves him too, but it just doesn't work in the storyline because of her ambivalence towards him in the previous half hour. It just sounds odd.
Surely they could have written a better script. Did the writers just run out of ideas?",Palm Springs

Another one of these?"" but I kept watching it because I love Andy Samberg, and I was pleasantly surprised! Funny, sweet, honest, existential, this movie had my eyes glued to the screen. Each scene adds another layer of excitement and the writing of this film definitely keeps audience satisfaction in mind! If you're a Samberg fan, you won't be disappointed!

And I've never been particularly enamored of Andy Samberg or Lonely Planet (okay fine, Dick in a Box THE great comedic video touchstone) But this film is in every way: direction, script, performances, cinematography and score, perfect.Just watch it.

364,roel-willemsen,So much better than I'd expected,8,11 December 2020,"I didn't really know anything about this movie before I watched it. I hadn't seen any trailers or read any summaries. All I knew was that Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti were in it, so I decided to give it a watch. I expected some sort of raunchy, maybe bland, comedy with these two as romantic leads. While that was partially correct, this movie proved to be so much more.First of all, the time loop shtick. I didn't know that was what was gonna happen, and I was slightly apprehensive at first, but it was great. After movies like Groundhog Day, Edge of Tomorrow and Happy Death Day, you'd think this trope was played out, but far from it.This movie works extremely well, and I just have to repeat how much better it was than I expected. Samberg and Milioti work well off each other, and their comedic scenes are but one of the highlights in the movie. What impressed me the most, were the philosophical questions the movie threw in without expectation. In between the comedic scenes, acted out by two characters who literally live without consequences, there are deep questions about living, death, love and the very difficult matter of having to live in the same day on a loop...All in all, this movie is just so much more than what it appeared to be on its surface. It's a blast from start to finish, easy to love, and very mature in its handling of its highly original subject matter.",Palm Springs

And the result is absolutely great!The story follows Nyles (a funny yet melancholic Samberg) as he prepares to attend a wedding as the boyfriend of one the bride's maids. During the ceremony he starts behaving weirdly and connects physically and emotionally with Sarah (Milioti), the bride's sister. From then the story unravels showing its funniest, weirdest and supernatural side. I won't share any detail about the ""plot twist"", which by the way happens at the very beginning of the movie and gets spoiled by the trailer anyway if I remember correctly, so you'll just have to trust me on this one. Watch this movie and enjoy it till the end! You'll laugh a lot and you'll also feel for the characters, whose great writing is outstandingly portrayed by Samberg and Milioti as they struggle to connect one to another in a world they don't actually belong to.Oh, almost forgot! J.K. Simmons is in the movie too, if you ever needed any other reason to watch it, and his character is crazy and hilarious. So come on, stream it now!",Palm Springs

375,stefankljajic,What would you do if you lived the same day over and over again?,10,15 July 2020,"Answer is: Most people already do. You wake up in the morning, go to a job, get back home, hang out with your family, maybe do something in between and go to sleep.
Living one day over and over is one movie concept that gets used every once in a while, and usually those movies are very enjoyable to watch. Why? It's a mix of ""how are they going to get out of this"", character development and finding new ways to enjoy life. Palm Springs is similar to Groundhog Day because of the repeating days concept, but they don't have much else in common. If you like movies like About Time, Groundhog Day or even Edge Of Tomorrow, this is a movie for you. It is really a great combination of romance, comedy and sci-fi and if you like a good laugh and a good romantic story, I would definitely recommend it. Really well done by Hulu, everything from acting to directing was done professionally and superbly. Netflix/Hulu movies have not been famous so far for their cinematic/entertainment quality so I was really surprised by Palm Springs.",Palm Springs

However, within the the first 20 minutes or so, it really grabbed me. I'm not even one for comedy (or timeloop) movies, but this one didn't miss with any jokes. And if it did, the jokes that missed were so understated that it was never cringe-worthy.An underrated element of Palm Springs is the atmosphere. There's a very fun summery vibe throughout the whole movie, except the emotional scenes. The emotional scenes were also very good, with a surprisingly good performance from Andam Sandlerberg. The other actors did perfectly fine too, but I just assumed that they're already established dramatic actors.You should definitely watch this movie.

Great chemistry/performances from both Andy Sandberg and Cristin Millotti, plus its always good seeing J.K. Simmons whenever he shows up in a movie. Funny dialog and does keep things engaging throughout. It is not an average RomCom and rewards those who are giving their full attention.

Overcomes the Groundhog Day trope easily. The minute it finished I immediately wanted to re-watch it.",Palm Springs
389,jerk-leg,Instant classic,9,17 August 2020,"Occasionally I watch a movie where I literally want to watch it again when it's over. A very funny, existential, and human movie. Andy Samberg absolutely nails both the drama and comedy of this absurd premise. He's having so much fun in the time loop you're not sure you want to leave it either.",Palm Springs
390,aquarianavenger,Perfect movie for 2020,10,3 December 2020,"It's December 2020, and I finally got around to watching Palm Springs. It was released earlier this year and has been on my radar, but because of the pandemic; time has lost all meaning...it's the ""perfect"" movie for this year. (Hard period)If you've reached the end of all shows you've ever wanted to watch and still haven't seen this one, you won't regret giving it a try.",Palm Springs
391,troybadoo,Extremely Entertaining,9,13 February 2021,"I would actually advise anyone to not read too much about this film and just go in. A little bit of everything on show, rom-com, science fiction, drama the works. If you want a movie that doesn't tax the mind too much, very likeable characters, original script and just great fun, then this is it. Highly recommended.",Palm Springs
392,eroch2001,Amazing Rom Com Chemistry,7,5 April 2021,I was expecting this movie to be a straight comedy but I was wrong. This movie is a romantic comedy with some drama scenes mixed in. The chemistry between the 2 leads is really what saves the movie and the acting performances specifically by Cristin Milioti. JK Simmons always finds a way to make a movie more entertaining and this is an example of that. Everyone should check this movie out and it's probably the best Hulu original to be honest which isn't really saying much.,Palm Springs
393,kcrew98,Groundhog Day meets Andy Samberg,7,25 July 2020,"In the genre of rom-coms, Palm Springs stimulates an atypical arousal, satisfying even the most strongest skeptics. Andy Samberg, a national treasure, delightfully and whimsically whisks you away into a journey worth repeating.Most rom-coms have a familar recipe: boy and girl meet through a circumstance. Followed by a chase of sorts filled with infatuation, frustration, sadness, acceptance, and ultimately relief. Viewers pray and hope for a happy ending. There is nothing wrong with this recipe except for the torture of cheesy dialogue, lack of chemistry, and unfulfilling plotlines. Nyles (the boy) and Sarah (the girl) achieve remarkable chemistry; hilariously wrestling with the past, present, and future.For any couple struggling to find a Thursday night rom-com, we recommend Palm Springs, paired with a favorite offering of aged boxed wine and sliced American cheese. Cheers!",Palm Springs
394,jessupj-08184,I was having a great time until the very outdated gender trope (very minor spoilers),6,17 July 2020,"It was a very enjoyable movie until the tired, worn out trope, that is used in almost every romance movie, reared it's ugly head. I'm sure you know the one I'm talking about? It's the narrative in which the break down (the conflict) of the relationship solely stems from the male protagonists ""bad actions"", even though he hasn't actually done anything wrong, and he grovels, apologises and prostrates himself to mend the relationship while she is annoyed and inconvenienced by his display of beta submission.Meanwhile what the female protagonist did was actually far worse, (she was effectively going to abandon him forever) yet the movie doesn't acknowledge her utterly selfish and hateful behaviour, let alone make her accountable for her actions.Still it was a well made narrative with good performances and good pacing, it's just a pity the sexist trope put a very sour taste in my mouth near the end.",Palm Springs
395,AmazingCinema,Not to be missed,9,27 September 2020,"Modern comedy that lives between fantasy and mystery. During the movie the viewer remains intrigued and amused at the same time. It is strong the awareness in the plot that we live in a world dominated by lies both by those who govern us and by the members of our communities to which we belong. The plot mocks the lives of its participants, and in order to be saved, they have to be themselves totally. The main actors are excellent like the other members of cast. Photography and images are perfects, the lights are wonderful and the music hypnotizes. This product represents one of the best messages of love in recent years. Not to be missed.",Palm Springs

397,alvsborg,Another prepubertal Hollywood movie,1,3 September 2021,"A true stand up comedian can deliver jokes and get laughs without going under the belt. It's my definition of a good stand-up comedian.It is the same with comedy movies. Is the fantasy and humour so bad in Hollywood these days, that they can't do nothing but putting a humiliated masturbating man in the first scene to laugh at?And how can this movie be rated at 7,4? Are you guys rating it 12 years old?",Palm Springs
398,palomichaturvedi,It's freaking deep too dude.,9,24 July 2020,"During the movie you constantly think why aren't these people doing bad things? Crazy bad things? But at the end of the day Miles is a good dude , his nihilistic demeanor is a defence mechanism and he genuinely doesn't want to hurt anyway to be happy. I think throughout the movie you're gonna get jealous of how lighthearted and genuinely nice niles is , because I did and I know I'll never bebas happy or as genuine as he is but watching him felt good.
I'm not one for happy endings but man , this won my heart. The soundtrack is great and the cast is too. HIMYM really deprived us od more Cristina milloti. Cami mendes was one of the reasons I saw it too and she was great. Roy was amazing. Watch this for a genuinely good rom com , your hearts gonna feel full finally.",Palm Springs
399,ordinaryguy86,Well Done,9,29 August 2021,"Palm Springs, is a fantastically fun film with an original storyline and two charismatic performances from, Andy Samberg and Cristn Milioti. It gets some great laughs and has some surprisingly gorgeous cinematography. The film isn't the deepest, it's fairly predictable and follows your usual rom-com formula, but the concept feels new and original enough that those issues aren't too noticeable.",Palm Springs
400,phillipsadl,This is American Crap,4,4 December 2020,Well so are so many things these days including ex-President Trump but this film truly insulted me. The fifteen minutes I spent hating this film would have been better spent stabbing my scrotum with a fork but I didn't have one at hand. I think a monkey on Rohypnol could have written a better script but again I didn't have one around.,Palm Springs
401,PhillChase23,Discovering the problem was a blast; fixing it seemed too easy,8,24 January 2021,"I don't normally finish watching a movie and exclaim, ""wow"". But I did with this one. Both of the leads glide effortlessly through this one; in the best way possible. Talk about actors fully being the characters. The directing was super interesting, too. Sometimes I feel like indie movies feel the need to go weird with how they shoot things, just for the sake of being weird and quirky; but this felt like a director using style to help complement the story.
The only negatives about this film are how quickly they solve the whole (trying to keep this spoiler free) ""issue"" in the end. Couldn't tell if they were using cliche as a troupe or if the writer just used it as a place holder and forgot to find something interesting to end the film; but either way; the journey was very much worth watching this film.",Palm Springs

The story is very different and the decision to ground it (Slightly) in some science was cool.All in all... it was a fun flick that I'd recommend.,Palm Springs
404,DimmySz,Cliché well done and well produced.,8,21 January 2021,"I didn't have very high expectations, I decided to watch the film just because I was a fan of Cristin Milioti, I hadn't read a synopsis or anything. So I was surprised with the movie, but when I watched the first half hour I thought it was just another cliché with big names in the cast but no, it is well built, well directed, good characters and with a great soundtrack. But even though it is not just any romantic film, it remains cliché and with a predictable ending unfortunately.",Palm Springs

414,hottentot7,Déjà vu all over again,5,14 August 2020,"This movie uses the by now well-worn formula of the classic Groundhog Day. (Used in Edge of Tomorrow, Russian Doll etc.) This theme by its nature raises a number of interesting philosophical and existential questions. Palm Springs presupposes the viewer is already familiar with the formula and the main character is already well on his way into his groundhog journey. How many days exactly isn't quite clear at the start and the movie treats it as a bit of a joke and plot twist. But this sabotages viewer identification with Samberg's character, as it would make quite a difference in his attitude and degree of resignation, if it's his 1000th or 1000000th dayBy having the character already well on his way into his journey the movie skims over the by now familiar parts but it also robs the audience of a chance to grow together with the character's experiences.There is some innovation to the formula by adding more people to the loop, most significantly Cristin Milioti who almost saves the movie with her performance.At one point she uses her infinite time to learn quantum mechanics to attempt to break out of time loop. (Of course!) But the movie completely glosses over the complications that would arise by only having only a few hours each day to learn until it resets again.Another difference is that there's a way for other people to also get stuck in a loop. But wouldnt the ability of adding people to the loop, given infinite loops, eventually lead to everyone within 1 day traveling radius of the cave getting added to the loop. Thus negating one of the fundamentals of the loop? But this isn't really explored in any detail.Maybe I'm being too harsh since the opening half hour setting up the wedding day is pretty funny actually. You see Andy Samberg already operating at Bill Murray post-caring god-mode, unknown to the viewer at that time, owning at a wedding with a weird but charming impromptu speech.But the movie can't really make up it's mind between playing with groundhog days viewers expectations, or making a more sincere movie in the vein of it's precursor. And these two goals are fundamentally opposed.Moments of sincerity are undercut by the Lonely Island trademark irreverent tone and Samberg's light-weight comedic performance.",Palm Springs

421,eoreill,Little substance underneath funny time loop bits,5,4 August 2020,"Palm Springs seemed promising to start off, but ultimately wound up kind of a let down. Part of that effect may have been caused by the rave reviews it received (at present, the film holds a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes), but I can't quite figure out what all the fuss was about.Things start off well enough. There are plenty of funny bits, including a brilliant sight gag in which Samberg's Nyles (boyfriend to a bridesmaid) threads his way across the dance floor to first approach Milioti's Sarah (the maid of honor), but where Palm Springs falls short is in the substance category.The two protagonists aren't particularly fleshed out - we never really learn if Nyles became disaffected before winding up in ""one of those infinite time loop situations you might have heard of"" or because of it - nevermind the rest of the characters, almost none of which I can remember with the clarity I can picture, say, Ned Ryerson from Groundhog Day. Samberg succeeds at making Nyles's go-with-the-flow nihilism charming; Milioti makes you feel Sarah's emotional baggage but also spends a lot of time just looking incredulous or overacting.The film falls short in the humanity department, which makes its saccharine ending feel particularly vacuous. Since nothing is taken seriously, the narrative just ends up feeling like an obligatory frame for the admittedly funny time loop gags.",Palm Springs

Andy Samburg does a great job of fleshing out his character with genuine emotion, some really heartfelt scenes with only odd hints of Jane Peralta slipping out! The rest of the cast do a Stirling job of selling this ""slightly twisted"" Groundhog Day rehash. Sadly the pace seems to drop off completely about half way through and meanders a bit really struggling to make any headway with the story telling but finds its feet again for the lead up to the climax to provide a very satisfying ending to a middle of the road fairly harmless sci-fi-ish film.",Palm Springs

434,outlandishflamingo,Great comedy followed by mediocre drama,7,21 August 2020,"The first half of this movie is great lighthearted fun. It was the funniest / most fun first half of a movie I've seen in a while. However, it unfortunately falls into the trope of adding drama for the sake of conflict. This movie would've easily been a 9/10 had it kept up the fun of the first half and had the two main characters trying to figure out how to get out all while dealing with Roy. I also found that the dramatic portions were not as well written and had some questionable character development.
I don't think the ending even made sense. So Nyles and Sarah make it out of the time loop and are chilling in the pool after having gone through so much together. Ok, that's nice. But then we get a scene where Roy shows up and Nyles doesn't recognize him? Why does he remember Sarah and not Roy?",Palm Springs

Had enough of a new twist on the time loop concept to keep it fresh. While at the same time using those twists (physics!) to force you to catch up, as in the Harry subplot, and Nyles' and Sara encounters. In that respect, I still don't get why Sara goes away for awhile after their arrest, then comes back.
One minor complaint: when they do mushrooms. and Nyles sees... something. I could barely make it out. They should have made that clearer, increasing the effectiveness.
Loved Samberg already. Miloti is a big-eyed beauty, makes the jump to lead. JK Simmons nails it again. Totally entertaining and fun.
Big questions: Was this intended for theaters? (I think it would have done OK as a date nite movie.)
And of course they can make a sequel out of anything, but will there be one? (I would like to explore the origins of that cave / time warp. Just please, anything but Palm Springs Too.)",Palm Springs
442,Qaxentius,Evolutionized romantic comedy with astonishing delivery,8,17 August 2020,"I'm not a huge fan of romantic comedy genre, but Palm Springs is something extraordinary in this genre, especially because of implementation of ''soft'' sci-fi elements. I didn't expect that I will be so much impressed by this film. I thought it will be typical romantic comedy, with classic drama made by main characters, but I was positively surprised it wasn't something like that.Story is interesting right away from the start, and it keeps you interested until the end, which is quite rare for me to find in this genre. It doesn't use any cliché, and makes new, positive and funny elements into the story. All of actors deliver amazing performance and casting is very fitting to the roles. Setting and scenery is also good, I doubt it would have similiar impact if they changed it to some other location. Direction and pacing are well done, I never felt that movie looks weird or it is very fast or very slow.In conclusion, Palm Springs is a romantic comedy movie that you definitely should watch, it has everything that you need to enjoy: good story with refreshing elements added to it, beautiful setting, amazing actors, it keeps you interested and delivers fitting end, all of that with enjoyable pacing.",Palm Springs

I love comedies and Andy Samberg, but the writing is so awful. I don't see how a writer could be happy showing this to anyone, and the producers must of been so eager for a script that they couldn't recognize how terrible it is. The editing and sound mixing look like they've been done by amateurs.

While I enjoyed the film, it just felt like I was watching a rehashed version of Groundhog Day.The chemistry between the two leads was good and it certainly had its funny moments along with great side characters especially in Roy (J.K. Simmons).I just couldn't help but compare it to Groundhog Day. I wouldn't buy it on DVD/BRay but if it was TV I'd probably watch it again.",Palm Springs
456,justinwademitchell,A Fun Light-hearted Comedy worth a watch,9,21 July 2020,"I found this romantic comedy, a great watch. The cast is awesome, the story line stays in focus throughout, the comedy is free flowing and abundant while not becoming over bearing. Both Samberg and Miloti show their assertive wit and then give us just enough charm to wrap this piece into a nice present worthy of your opening. J.K. Simmons is the bow on top, completing the ensemble.",Palm Springs

459,david_jinkins,Updated Groundhog Day with a twist,7,28 November 2020,"It is hard to write about Palm Springs, without comparing it to the classic 1993 Harald Ramis film Groundhog Day. I don't think the comparison is unfair - I have no doubt that the Palm Springs script writers watched Groundhog Day and realized there was still a lot of unexplored potential in the main plot device. The characters are stuck in a time loop. Whatever they do, when they sleep or die they just wake up at the beginning of the same day.The main innovation in Palm Springs is that when Sarah (Cristin Milioti) gets trapped in the time loop, she has Nyles (Andy Samburg) to act as her guide. Nyles has been trapped in the loop for a long time, and he is able to show Sarah how to pleasurably frit away her unlimited time. Having two people in the loop allows for both new hijinx, hilarious banter, and more characters to development. In the time loop genre, only the characters who repeat days can really grow.Palm Springs succeeds as a fun, unassuming comedy film, but it doesn't have the lasting impact of Groundhog Day. What made Groundhog Day memorable was the growth of Bill Murray's character from a self-obsessed misanthrope into a generous community man. Groundhog Day is a funny movie, but the movie isn't really about the laughs.Palm Springs is the opposite. There is some character growth, some minor plot twists, and a Deus-ex-machina ending to tie things up. But the story is secondary to the comic set pieces. There are some great gags in Palm Springs. I laughed out loud several times. Both Samburg and Milioti shine during the zaniest moments. Both are natural comic actors, and both their acting and the script provide lots of entertainment.The humor is also much raunchier than in Groundhog Day. Sex and drugs are major elements, and the language is definitely adult. It was the perfect film for a date night with my wife. It was light and funny, and made for a fun end to our evening. Then we went home, and fell asleep, and in a year I'm sure we won't remember a thing about it.",Palm Springs
460,kimbarlow,Fun & Enjoyable Movie,10,28 April 2021,"This was an enjoyable, fun and amusing movie. Yes it's like Groundhog Day, but had its own originality. The main leads had a definite chemistry. The supporting actors and actresses were great as well. In these COVID times it's always good to have something that makes you smile and laugh, and this movie definitely did. This has become a movie I will watch time and again! Andy Samberg is great in this, but Cristin Milioti is fantastic! I hope she's in more movies over time!",Palm Springs

The acting my samberg is incredible and really sets the tone throughout the movie.

465,daxwax_97,Groundhog Day with a touch,9,17 October 2020,"Actually never wrote a review for a movie. So, basically, the concept is kinda like Groundhog Day, BUT, with a twist! It's very entertaining in a ADULT way, without the stereotypical American style (like supermuch sex and cringe lines). It's actually sofisticated, somehow, and makes you realize the importance of your own relationship (maybe) and also concider the fact that you're no longer 16 years old and that the world is different now.",Palm Springs

471,RJHoward-927-373914,There are 3 reasons to remake a movie...,6,25 May 2021,"One is that the original was flawed and the remake can improve the idea.The remake of The Children's Hour is a good example.The next is that the remake can take the idea in a different and interesting direction.The 1982 version of The Thing is a good example of this.The last and worst reason to remake a movie is to target an audience which won't watch the original.Unfortunately, this last is what the producer did with Palm Springs.Groundhog Day was a compelling fable with a good setting and cast.Palm Springs is a youngster's romp with a good setting and cast.The cinematography is excellent and the acting is good, but the story's been hollowed out and filled with foam so it can float on shallow minds.Think Groundhog Day laced with Bachelor Party and you'll get the flavor of this movie.Aside from turning a spiritual fable into an inexplicable science fantasy, this movie adds the now obligatory 'strong woman pushes weak man aside to save the day' trope.It's amazing to see Leftist political correctness using the same obnoxious methods to enforce ideology which the Right did 2 or 3 generations ago.There's one point where Cristin Milioti's character asks Andy Samberg's character the questions anyone - including the audience - would like to know about the time loop they are trapped in, such as how did it start or what was his life before.In a clumsy bit of dialogue which I can't help feeling recapitulates a story conference about the movie itself, Samberg fumbles about for an explanation, then says he can't remember and it doesn't matter anyway.I wish he had added, ""Who cares? This is a romantic comedy. It doesn't need to make sense!"".The movie has undeniable charm.The choice of a wedding for the day which is the time loop is a good one (though a funeral would have worked well too).The acting is good.If you're under 40 and like the shallows, this might be for you.",Palm Springs

There are some funny gags but the overwhelming sense was that I had already seen this movie. You get all of the standard rom-com beats plus a retread of every joke in Groundhog Day. It is a nice movie overall and there is nothing expressly bad or offensive about it (besides one groan inducing ""science"" montage), it just isn't very new or innovative.",Palm Springs

488,padraigmurphy-81123,Who knew time travel was boring...,4,14 February 2021,"This movie is an update of Groundhog Day. Whereas Bill Murray character had to improve himself and fall in love to break out, in this movie the 2 main characters wallow in self obsession and sneer at the people around them as if they are the enlightened ones. Whereas Groundhog Day was filled with humanity and the opportunity to do better, this flick resorts to crude scenes, crude language and cynicism. Perhaps this suited the main characters acting background. The only interesting part were the brief scenes exploring physics to extract themselves, though this side could have been used earlier to add something original rather than just an escape hatch...3 of us watched this at home, various ages and it was passable at best.",Palm Springs
489,danielle-08144,Probably the best romcom I've seen,7,27 January 2021,"Sweet, honest, funny. I love the relationship and connection between the main characters. They're both strong characters with different backgrounds from different worlds but they still manage to find each other. Also nice with a female lead that is more than an object and she doesn't need Nyles but life might be a bit more bearable with him.",Palm Springs
490,SomeCannadenMac,A New Classic Comedy,10,30 January 2021,"Have you seen Groundhogs Day? Yes. Ok... so this is Groundhogs Day on crack. Oh you want me to explain, well lets get into it.
So you want a none spoiler moment. Ok, during the as I put it, random Day montage, there is this one scene.
Nyles and Sarah decide to do a... act I guess is how I'd put it. During one of the weddings, they put a bomb in the wedding cake. Nyles enters center stage well holding a CROSSBOW. Tells the room that there is a bomb in the cake. Pulls it out puts it on the crossbow arrow, and shoots it into the sky, were it exopods mid air. Sarah then comes in with a eyepatch and pirate hook on. Nyles then says that Sarah the brides crazy evil sister planted the bomb in the cake. Sarah then says that he foiled her plain, and they fight.
If that doesn't make you want to watch this movie ok. The main character is cooked in a pool filled with gasoline in a flashback. Yeah.
Ok so if don't care for jokes. Well you sound boring, but Palm Springs has got you. every moment that pushed the plot forward was amazing. It's hard to explain this movie without explaining the whole movie, but I'm trying. When the two main characters start failing for each other, it is done perfectly. The loops are done so well, and it's a really cool way to do it. Plus they do the good time loop thing of changing what happens every day more then a little.
I love this movie. A great time, filled with laughs, and tears if you can get them out. I will watch this again in the years to come.

It has the same premise, but in actuality it is a totally different movie.

509,Waltdisneyfan9,Romantic Groundhog Day,8,24 December 2020,At first I was worried that it would be just like previous films that have the concept of repeating days. I felt like this was a fresh take on the concept with two people going through it together and finding love. It's a new fresh romantic comedy which is really nice to watch. The dialogue is super face paced and the characters are super endearing. It takes on a ride and doesn't ever question itself about what's going on or how things are. The style is really fun and chemistry between Andy Samberg and Cristin Millotti is great. My complaint is would've liked more setup of Andy Samberg's lifestyle before she comes into his loop. Also more development of the relationship between the two that doesn't involve just a montage and why he falls in love with her. All and all a great film. One of the best of the year.,Palm Springs

526,Esco-123,PALM SPRINGS REVIEW: POTENTIALLY THE BEST FILM OF THE YEAR (SO FAR!),7,12 July 2020,"Palm Springs was directed by Max Barbakow and stars Andy Samberg, Cristin Milioti, J. K. Simmons, Camila Mendes, Tyler Hoechlin, Meredith Hagner and Dale DickeyPalm Springs tells the story of Niels (Andy Samburg) who bumbs into and falls for Sarah (Cristin Milioti) at his girlfriends sisters wedding. But things get a lot more complicated, when Sarah wakes up in the same exact day again.Going into this picture I had high expectations, because people who saw it when it originally premiered at sundance back in January all loved it.Firstly I taught the chemistry between the two leads was great. I like how at first Nyles was a mentor to Sarah but they slowly start to grow a relationship with each other. I know that sounds really cliche, but the relationship is so well paced that it makes it work to a tee.I also liked how this film took inspresation from groundhog day but didn't overdo it and because of which, makes this film feel fresh.Also the preformances are great here. For the time he's in the movie Jk Simons is of cource as always is brilliant here and the exact same can be said for... and... honesty everyone is superb here.As far as complaints go I felt that Niels's wife was just there to cheat on him and also to be used as awful overused comic relief.Finally I didn't like the ending because it felt like if they cut it by fife minutes it just would have left the ending up for interpretation, which would have hit home the message better.Overall despite a few annoyances I taught Palm Springs was a great movie. With fantastic performances and a great debut by Max Barbakowand. For me it is one of 2020's best movies (so far) so I would certainly say see this movie at all costs.",Palm Springs

528,estefaniam-29276,A breath of fresh air,10,19 February 2021,"I usually wouldn't give a romantic comedy 10 stars, but this one earned it entirely. I haven't seen a movie this good in so long. It was completely unexpected as my boyfriend and I are used to starting movies and then changing them after 10 minutes. This one hooked us in fast.It is extremely well made. Everything from the silly plot, dialogue, comedic cues, cinematography, music, and most importantly; the screenplay itself was done to a t. Andy is absolutely incredible. So was was his counterpart. And everyone else for that matter. They did a great job with casting.
It was lighthearted and fun, yet also deep and existential at the same. A perfect balance.Usually movies these days have all types of flaws (I assume they're just trying to get the movie made as quick as possible), but the writers and film team really took time and care into every scene. There is so much heart in this. It is so noticeable. And I am so grateful. My bf and I are still talking about it days later. And my sister agrees, this has been one of the most enjoyable films she's seen (if not the most) in a very long time.Thank you for making a movie THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE.

I was about to turn it off but something stopped me . It was when Adam Samberg seem to know every move of everyone else's actions before it happened. I thought to myself, wait a second, "" is this a time loop movie? "" So I stuck around. And it was definitely worth it. I laughed, I danced, I even shed a tear hear and there. I wish they would of spent a bit more time developing the characters as they did in Ground Hog Day. Or dug deeper into a back story of how this loop started in the first place. At least The Edge Of Tommorow had Alien ""spooge"" that creates a mysterious time continuum. I think Adam Samberg should've ""Sharpened his axe"" just like Bill Murray Learn to play the piano, learned how to dance, and improved his ""game."" At least make a reference to G.H.D like for instance....""We're not In Punxsutawney."" All in all, it's a pretty good movie and I recommend it.

However we were wrong , the first half an hour of the film was okay , we then rolled a joint and smoked , and when we started to get high , the movie was becoming more and more confusing , and we honestly started to get paranoid and terrified. I think it put us both in such a weird head space , where we both felt like we were hallucinating.

558,Dzheph,"Don't read the reviews, just watch. The ride is more fun that way.",10,13 October 2020,"Okay, if you clicked for spoilers, I'm going to assume that you've seen the movie already, that's who this is meant for.You really can't talk about Palm Springs without at least mentioning Groundhog's Day. The premise is undeniably borrowed, but by the time you find that out it is already clear that Palm Springs is on its own trip through the scenic loop.The actors are pitch perfect, but the story is where the real magic is. The not-unique premise gives rise to some very intriguing philosophical exploration. If there is not, and can never be any ultimate consequence for anything one does, what does one choose to do?You party like there's no tomorrow ('cause, well, there isn't). You enjoy the time you spend, even in the face of knowing that your time is not limited, but it is still precious. You don't bring about harm. ""Pain is real.""Also, there is nothing worse than dying slowly in the ICU. I feel that message is not intended only for time-loopers.This film is so much fun on its face that it's easy to look no deeper, but if deeper you look, deeper you go.On second viewing, I became almost certain that there was a CRUCIAL plot-point that was never exposed. Ready? Sarah didn't just get caught in the loop. Nyles did that, very deliberately, although it's not entirely clear that he knows it.Watch the wedding toast, and tell me Nyles isn't saying every word for Sarah alone, to welcome her into his world where she (and Roy, I guess) will be the only other ""real"" person for Nyles. At a level so deep that the actual wedding is utterly trivial in comparison, Nyles and Sarah are entering a partnership that is more exclusive and more enduring than any marriage.And here's the kicker. When Nyles says to Sarah, ""Don't you kiss me!"" it's cute and playful, and he knows better than anyone that she's for sure going to kiss him as a result. But then five minutes later he's shouting to Sarah, ""Don't come in the cave!"" Again, she defiantly does the opposite. Is Nyles *actually* surprised by this? Is Nyles surprised by *anything*?There's room to read it either way, but that's some very convincing evidence.",Palm Springs
559,shubhikothari-15873,Who says rom-com are chic flicks?! Palm Springs is definitely not!,9,25 October 2020,"In the times when there's a renewed wish to read Orwell's dystopian novel 1984, or watch that movie or other movies like clockwork orange that depict complete pandemonium (Infact whats also a part of sentiments these days are sci-fi movies on contagion), I chose to watch Palm Springs.
Nothing to do with the international film festival, the movie turned out to be an insanely clever romantic comedy!It made me fall in love wild the idea / concept / theory / scheme / feeling of ""Love"" again. I wanted it to be longer so that I could just watch more of it and more of Andy Samberg & Cristin Milioti. Their conversations are engaging & the sparks between the 2 of them were galvanic.'The life of Brooklyn 99', Jake Perolta has
turned out to be sucha fine actor! And I did
not watch HIMYM till the end to see the
ancillary character - Cristin Milioti's (The Mother's) introduction unfold and that's why
I underrated her as an actor all uptill now. Both of them deliver super sassy performances!Borrowing the idea of time loop from other artworks, yet Palm Springs contains shades of originality & weaves a fresh spin on the subject.With the journey, starting with a wedding reception in Palm Springs, that goes through multiple wake up shots in bed everyday to live in a world of no consequences, the protagonists hitting the beers while lounging on the pool floats, they spotting the mystical dinosaurs together on a starry night, thumping on the EDM in a bar while performing a crazy badass duet, the iconic kissing scene in the cave, going for long drives only to take a different turn each time; the movie was infinite miles far away from humdrum. It wasn't dull even for a split second. A very well written story is metamorphed into a feel good movie with flamboyant colors and it exceeded its own elements of expression as it kept me glued for the entire time.Palm Springs is an incredibly fun & a whacky chase movie!It's a must watch for anyone who's in love or hopes to be in love.",Palm Springs

Andy Samberg is funny, and usually movies that involve people meeting at weddings, have a decent amount of comedy potential. Boy was I wrong though! First of all, its an unapologetic rip-off of Bill Murray's Groundhog Day, with none of the comedic talent of a Bill Murray. Secondly, its pure sophomoric humor with no effort at at least making it funny. This is such a boring film, that after investing 50 minutes and not one laugh, I had to pull the plug on it.

But on the contrary. It is actually one of the time loop films we know. However, this film is so incredibly original. This is due to the fantastic script.Because Palm Springs offers a refreshing twist on the all-too-familiar plot of the time-loop films. It's just amazing. Maybe even the best I've seen this year. It just blew me away. It's wonderfully black, full of biting dialogues and a smart twist, with numerous unforeseen twists and turns, so that the film never gets boring, even though the entertaining running time of only 90 minutes also contributes. And despite the fact that Palm Springs has a dry sense of humor, it finally makes the viewer laugh to tears again after a long time. And Palm Springs is surprisingly touching and astute and doesn't ignore big emotions, while the film wildly mixes romcom, fantasy, comedy and romance, but again in an amazingly clever way. And it is unbelievable that one script has so many good things in common. Because the film knows what it wants to tell. It's just perfect.I was just flashed by this adorable movie. The perfect feel-good comedy and, moreover, a simply perfect film. Not only the turning is ingenious ... I'm far from finished.The cast is perfect. The actors fit their roles like a fist in the eye. And how grandiose they are embodied. Outstanding work! And these move in one location with a single steal. The movie just looks wonderful! Whether the beautiful filters that were put on the film that I just love or the costumes or the sets or ... just everything! With such a grandiose director, with an eye for loving details that are just a pleasure, everything from Max Barbakow fits together! I am just delighted! Yes, even the camera and the editing, the lighting ... Oh, I could forever praise this smart film, which is fun and makes you laugh to tears.And since it is Max Barbakow's cinema debut, one should have even more respect and expect great things for the future.With so much praise, it's hard for me to come to a conclusion: Palm Springs is a thoroughly intelligent time warp comedy with terrific actors, one of the best scripts of the year, an unmistakable Stiehl that you just can't love, that of the great camera, the smart one Editing, thanks to the great lighting, and of course an excellent director who combines all of these achievements into a perfect film. I had a wonderful evening and I recommend the film to everyone ... even to those who don't like time loop films, even if I think you won't find someone there anytime soon.

573,makarova-21895,Charming and good weird Rom-Com,7,29 September 2021,"Palm Springs (2020) is quite a charming rom-com with some fresh ideas of the genre, it's suitable for relaxing and watching in the background.The end of the film is very predictable due to the typical plot of romantic comedy genre and time loop storyline. We, as viewers, expect the happy end of the story of the two lovers and the film is so successful partly because it meets these expectations. Nevertheless, the plenty of interesting and in some cases weird episodes that viewers can't anticipate, makes the film not so dull and different from the other time loop plots.I found the film dynamic enough, but I personally think that there were some moments that could be shown in a more interesting way, in more details, e.g. Different stages of accepting the situation. Despite this, Palm Springs is good because it can be watched in one breath, it lets us move to a sunny place and chill out after the working day. The picture's bright and there are even deep thoughts in some episodes.Typically, the impression of the romantic stories strongly depends on the main characters. I really enjoyed the captivating actors' game of Nyles's and Sarah's characters. The supporting cast was good enough, but not bright and remarkable.One more advantage of Palm Springs for me is that there weren't too many vulgar episodes that I used to see in American comedies. As for the humor in this comedy, I didn't find all the jokes really hilarious, but some of them made me laugh.Altogether, I don't regret the time I spent watching this film but, frankly speaking, there's no wish to see it again. For me it's just an offbeat rom-com for one time. But I would recommend Palm Springs for the fans of rom-com genre for entertainment.",Palm Springs

All actors handled the roles perfectly because, in my opinion, it is difficult to make the audience to believe them.Also, the film is packed with hilarious jokes, some of them are connected to black humor and can be a bit over-the-top but they are relevant.

579,bolter-799-416135,Relaxing to watch but lacking too many crucial elements,6,5 May 2021,"You cannot avoid making parallels with Groundhog Day (1993). It must be really hard to follow a movie which has set the bar this high. And Palm Springs tries to honour the 1993 movie without imitating it which is admirable.Unfortunately, the characters of Nyles and Sarah feel underdeveloped halfway through the movie while in the already classic movie, you get formed characters and suggested plot development literally on the third minute.Palm Springs has too many plot lines which seem incomplete or unconnected to the movie (or both) like, say, Roy's character. On the other hand, some things are maybe better left to the imagination - the movie underestimates its viewers with some unneccesary pseudoscience and shimmering lights.Visually, the movie is a pleasure to watch and the cast performs masterfully. Cristin Milioti and Andy Samberg have great chemistry on screen and this helps the movie feel relaxed and fun despite the somewhat underwhelming plot.A reasonably nice and fresh piece, Palm Springs lacks the multi-layered ideas and messages that those of us who love Groundhog Day expect. Except maybe forgiveness and openness, which are implied in a romantic comedy anyway.

I love Andy Samberg so i was excited to watch. The pacing is weird and becomes super slow. No where near as good as Groundhog Day. I do not recommend. Honestly all the reviews here that are 8, 9, or 10 stars have to be fake because this movie was so terrible and BORING.",Palm Springs

The character that blew me away was Cristin Milioti's Sarah. I had never paid attention to her before. She was amazing. Sarah and Nyles chemistry was much more believable than Rita and Phil in Ground Hog Day. Roy was an added bonus to give the movie some additional excitement. I will put the movie on an endless time loop (emphatic period).",Palm Springs

So I was surfing Netflix the other day and this movie came up. I like Andy Samberg's comedy, so I started watching without any expectation whatsoever. I was it would be some goofy romantic comedy movie, but I was hooked as soon as I had realized it was about time loop. It was overall an enjoyable movie and certainly rewatchable. Now that I see it has quite a good IMDb rating, I would watch it again.",Palm Springs

599,mille0712,"Quite deep, in a way",9,27 May 2021,"Well my expectations were rather low to be frank; my friend introduced this movie to me as a »silly comedy starring Andy Samberg«, it was just that indeed, however I got much more out of it than I had expected. The concept is simple, not groundbreaking in anyway, mind you I haven't seen »Groundhog day«, but I did see »Happy death day«, and while it was a fun watch, it did not strike me what a genius thought experiment this essentially is. While facing some logic problems such as: do the other people in this timeloop continue their life in a different timeline? Are the main characters missing from these timelines? Etc. That aside, it gets to the core of the meaning of life, the meaning of love and takes the sentiment »live like there's no tomorrrow« to a whole different level. I will break up my thoughts on these three things here.The meaning of life: While this is a comedy movie, the setting is quite a horrific one. I could hardly imagine a greater curse, than being imprisoned in time, never moving forward, having nothing you do matter, and no one understand you. Normally these would be things we strive for: building something up, climbing some ladder, acumulating wealth, finding love. It is in life's big picture, in the longer arc of our story that we find meaning and purpose. But in this here case, all of this is thrown out the window. Money doesn't matter, achievements will be forgotten, your personal development (if any) will go unnoticed. What you're left with is no choice but to »live in the moment«, and just enjoy life I suppose. This is of course a valuable lesson, and something most of us could do more of, instead of always worrying about the past and the future - but in this movie there simply is no past and future! And in the end, purely living in the moment, will, in a way, reduce your existence to that of an animal. Just surviving, sensing, without the sweet release of death, and without a companion... Truly that is agony for a human. But here Sarah enters the loop.The meaning of love: Nyles loneliness is quite striking to me. It's one thing to just be alone, but to be surrounded by people and have a completely different perception of reality, must be absolutely alienating. And I quickly realized that this goes way beyond the thought experiment in the movie. Connections between people are formed through communication which reveals a shared experience of the world. In Nyles case, connections like these are completely impossible. There is close to no likeness between what goes on in his mind, and what goes on in the wedding guests minds. They might as well be robots, for all he knows. It might be a simulation, he might be dreaming, he might be insane. But then, Sarah comes along, and suddenly he is able to share his experience with her. In this case it's not so important whether or not they are compatible, although they are, the important thing is that she sees him, and sees the same as him, reacts with him, reacts to him, and thereby confirms that he is real, that he is sane (in other scenarios a couple most likely won't share the experience of a timeloop, but just share the experience of life in general). Now this feeling, of being heard, being seen and not being alone is the most valuable thing we have, and what I would define as love.»Live like there's no tomorrow«: So that's all good then right? They can just fool around forever, together, with no consequenses. All you need is love. Well, I disagree, and so does Sarah. Although they are in love and happy, they are still trapped in what I consider to be either limbo or hell. She brings science into it, which, well - if I were the screenwriter I wouldn't know what to have done either, but jeez, there's absolutely no science in this whatsoever. Nevertheless she figures out a way to escape the timeloop, and enter the real world wherein she would be able to move forward. However Nyles want to stay with her in the timeloop - because, love, I suppose. And so this initially struck me as the typical career vs love dilemma, with the simple twist that it wasn't REALLY a dilemma. Nyles just had to grow some balls and they could have both - love AND a meaningful life. Because you NEED both, and of course you can have both because they're very different and seperate things. You want the journey of life, and someone to share it with.This presents the four possible scenarios, in which these two things are either present or absent:Love absent - meaning absent: Nyles stuck in the timeloop alone.Love absent - meaning present: Sarah stuck in a linear (regular) timeline alone. Well, meaning might be the wrong word here, but she's moving forward in some way although quite alone.Love present - meaning absent: Nyles and Sarah stuck in the timeloop togehter.Love present - meaning present: Nyles and Sarah stuck in a linear timeline together.So what's the morale? Well I don't know if you could boil it down to one sentence, but it definitely inspired a lot of thoughts.",Palm Springs

It is one of the best comedy's with heart I've seen in years. Even better than King of Staten Island, which was expected to be similar. But it's not. Thia movie is worth your time. Period. Watch it now.",Palm Springs
603,mosrady,good story telling but poor comedy and romance,7,21 July 2020,I love the story telling and how the story shifts between the characters. the comedy can be so much better the characters and actors have the potential to do a lot of jokes like more ways of Roy killing Nyles or more wedding crashing. the worst thing is how Nyles fall in love with Sarah this didn't make any sense and it surely needed a lot of scenes to clear why he will fall in love her.,Palm Springs
604,frassonomar,Surprising,8,9 September 2020,"I'd suggest watching this movie without any clue about its plot (avoid the trailer). It feels like the classic movie to watch on a summer night as it is a rom-com. It's been a fun vision with a lot of interesting things like directing style, hilarious scenes, soundtrack (!!!) and main plot. Also, chemistry between main actors is very good and you can tell that by watching the inverviews they had in various festivals. Overall I think this can be a solid candidate as the best comedy movie of the year.
Watch it and have some fun :)",Palm Springs

Palm Springs and Groundhog Day share very little except for the core concept, and each are classics in their own way. Samberg and Milioti stuck in the loop together gives us laughs, great energy, and thought-provoking scenes, and while it's not the perfect movie, it's destined to be a repeat watch for fans of the genre. And it's also unintentionally a visual anthem for the time in which we're living, so you might as well watch it over and over and over.",Palm Springs

614,bjoanz,What about the goat?,6,1 August 2020,"I'm only giving this as many stars as 6, because of the bizarre revisionist plot premise is just far enough left of Groundhog Day to give it a boost. Otherwise, all the millennial-fueled angst wears real thin (think a next generation ""Singles"") and despite the cute likability of leads Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti, they're still not anybody I particularly grew to care about. Okay, I did laugh out loud at Nyles' initial approach toward Sarah on the dance floor (the wedding held all the best interest), but everything else just kept unfolding as a ""whaaa...?"" In GHD, Bill Murray's character found humility, mended fences, and even learned how to tickle the ivories in his pursuit of Andie McDowell's approval. Our Nyles balks likes a shallow child right up to the last act, yet in the same timeframe, Sarah manages to learn quantum physics in her pursuit of paranormal freedom (?!) ...and still doesn't care what Nyles does! In a whirlwind of loose-end resolution, they just end up blissfully floating in a swimming pool of sudden happiness? Even that was just too big a leap into the abyss for any and all the plot devices to save themselves! I still wanna know what happened to the goat!",Palm Springs

616,kimstellav,I didn't expect this is such a good movie. Interesting but unique?,9,8 July 2021,"I'm not a fan of romance stories (because sometimes the plots are cliché). This movie is different because they put some fantasy with time loops things. Although they can add more jokes because it just funs for 40 minutes in the beginning? And suddenly, they change into more drama/intense/sad, typical romance stories. But so far, I'm curious about the ending and how they will do with the time loops. I'm satisfied with how they end this movie, especially their post-credit scene. Unexpectedly I got emotional with several scenes, and I love every message from this movie.I recommended it if you need some light romance comedy but unique and fresh.
