0,TheLittleSongbird,2001: A Mesmerising Odyssey,10,19 October 2010,"To me, this is not only Kubrick's best film but also a milestone of the genre. It is quite long at around two and a quarter hours, and it is slow, that I agree with. But it is never boring, well not to me it isn't. Besides, and this is up to interpretation, but I think the slow pacing is deliberate, it adds to the haunting and eerie quality 2001 has and also to assimilate every shot which speak volumes, and also 2001's greatest strength is actually in the details.The story is somewhat abstract in its structure but is also quite complex, innovative and interesting yet has a simple message, and the screenplay and direction by Kubrick are superb. The acting is not the film's best asset, but it is good enough, with Douglas Rain the standout as the voice of HAL 9000 as he is really quite brilliant. Two things especially make 2001 so good. One are the visuals- even after all those years they are simply outstanding. The cinematography is indeed splendid, as are the colours and settings, but there are so many memorable images. The images of the giant Starchild floating through space and the tribe of apes painfully putting two and two together still resonate considerably even now. The other is the music. Coming from a big classical music enthusiast, I was delighted by the use of Also Sprach Zarathustra and On the Beautiful Blue Danube and how they combined with the visuals were exceedingly clever.Overall, this is a truly wonderful film that is worth seeing for the visuals and music alone and still continues to intrigue and perplex with the ending. As much as I like Oliver and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, two of my childhood favourites, and the brilliant Lion in Winter to me this is it... the best film of 1968. 10/10 Bethany Cox",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1,bkoganbing,The Biggest Fast Forward,8,6 February 2009,"What the meaning of the black monolith is in 2001: A Space Odyssey has been puzzling moviegoers for generations. I confess I haven't any better idea than any of the others who have written on this board. I guess Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Clarke wanted everyone to make their own evaluation. A little more evidence could have helped.The awesome visual affects of 2001 for which the film won its only Oscar in 1968 have blinded a lot of viewers to the ultimate incomprehensibility of the plot. That big black rock means something a whole lot different to the prehistoric caveman than to the futuristic astronauts. To one it means power, the other understanding. It's like some all powerful creator has left this touchstone for mankind to take another leap forward.The film begins with the cave people who are struggling to survive against animal creatures who are better equipped than they are for dominance. But contact with the rock, so glaringly out of place from the surroundings awakens the latent intelligence in the cave folk and they stage a comeback against their foes. It's the beginning of man's dominance.In the biggest fast forward in screen history, we are now in the future and another of these things has been discovered on a moon of Jupiter, the first sign of intelligent life away from earth. Scientists Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood and three other scientists in cryogenic suspension are sent to investigate. Remember we haven't discovered warp drive yet. Civilization may have taken too far a leap forward because these guys are in the hands of an all powerful computer named HAL who controls the ship and their very lives by definition. What's supposed to be a tool for man now is his dominator.When man does come in contact with that monolith on a Jupiter moon, my own interpretation is that the contact represents an all powerful creator telling man to reflect on what he has achieved and to warn him to not go too fast forward in the future. The monoliths represent signposts, like checkpoints in a race to God only knows what end.I'm always leery of rating a film like 2001 too high when the plot is so vague and speculative. But the special effects and Kubrick's use of classical music to create that space ballet just so dwarf the human beings involved, in effect the film itself is a warning. And all that music was in the public domain so MGM didn't have to lay out big bucks for a composer. I always favor story over spectacle which is why I can never give 2001: A Space Odyssey the highest rating. But when the spectacle is as awesome as what Stanley Kubrick gives us, you just sit there amazed.Of course 2001 came and went and instead of reaching for the rest of the solar system and beyond, mankind regressed into barbarism with the most notable event being a planned massed murder. Mankind needs to touch the monolith and make another leap forward. Maybe Kubrick should have looked farther ahead and called his film, 2101: A Space Odyssey.I hope we touch the monolith before that.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
2,Leofwine_draca,Kubrick's outer space masterpiece,8,24 February 2015,"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is without a doubt the 'ultimate' space movie. Films like STAR WARS or ALIEN wouldn't exist without this, the first film to realistically portray what space travel is actually like. Yes, the film is incredibly slow, long, and extreme arty, but it's also a masterpiece and quite possibly Stanley Kubrick's greatest directorial effort.After a lengthy introduction that quite wonderfully shows off man's pre-history (and includes THAT famous jump cut), we're transported to the interior of a spaceship, where protagonist Dave (Keir Dullea) must contend with the machinations of his computer, HAL 9000. Everything that happens takes place very s-l-o-w-l-y, but this was intentional and I don't think there's any better way of getting across just how elongated being in space really is.HAL 9000 dominates the film and is my favourite computer creation in cinema; the most tragic too, I think. Dullea underacts to the best of his ability and is all the better for it, and of course Kubrick's direction is masterful, with incredible attention to detail. Yes, things get extremely psychedelic and trippy for the last half-hour's light show, but then it was the 1960s and you wouldn't expect otherwise. Great stuff indeed!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
3,SnoopyStyle,Not a popcorn movie,9,20 September 2014,"The monolith has been there on Earth throughout human history. It goes all the way back to the ape-man. In the near future, they have found a monolith on the moon which is kept secret with a cover story. Then 18 months later, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are on a long deep space voyage to Jupiter on Discovery 1. HAL 9000 is the computer on board that is almost human. HAL seems to be malfunctioning. It kills Poole and the rest of the hibernating crew. Bowman pulls out HAL's memory and only then does he discover the true mission. Bowman encounters a monolith in the darkness of space near Jupiter.It's hard to talk about this movie without pointing out that this is more than the normal fun space sci-fi movie. This is definitely not Star Wars but it has qualities that transcends popcorn movies. It's confounding at times. It takes its time which bored some people. Director Stanley Kubrick obviously is saying something but it's not so simplistic that one could easily explain it. One either loves the vast nature of the movie or one hates the meandering story. Nevertheless, there is no denying the profound influence of this movie and its enduring fascination.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
4,Hitchcoc,A Few Random Comments,10,18 May 1999,"So many  have commented, some quite scholarly.  There are few films that have been held up to such scrutiny as this one.  My reactions are emotional, although I think I could wade in the same waters as some of my predecessors. My approach to movies is to take them as they come.  I am so tired of all the talk about special effects that begin almost every review.  If you have a high profile film, the special effects are treated as if they are some a form unto themselves, as if they were actually removed from the film. Didn't like the special effects.  Didn't like the movie.  Sit down for a moment and look at this film.  It's wonderful that Kubrick was able to do what he did with those effects, but the way this movie unfolds is so  much more than that.  This movie is there to portray a sense of the awe of the universe and the future of humankind based on the increments that have led us there.  It is about a future that may occur.Everyone is talking about movie being a disappointment after reading the book.  Folks, the movie came out before the book.  The movie was originally based on a short story called ""The Sentinel"" by Arthur C. Clarke.  The movie borrows some of its thoughtfulness from ""Childhood's End,"" another Clarke book which deals with similar issues about the ends of humankind and the transmigration of our being.  If you are going to enjoy 2001, you have to put away that fixation on the conventional science fiction of the day, with foam rubber aliens and armies of extra-terrestrial implements of destruction.  Take a look at Star Wars sometime (by the way, I think it's a wonderful film).  It is really a space western, a World War II airplane movie, with a rite of passage thrown in, and the obligatory soap opera stuff with Luke and Darth Vader.  No-one can hit anything with laser weapons. Those storm troopers are the most worthless fighting force I have ever seen. It's a fun movie, but when you look at true speculative science fiction, there isn't much to think about, no metaphysics, nothing much to occupy your mind after its over.  2001 sets out to be different and shouldn't be compared to Star Wars; they are apples and oranges.  This movie has some of the most breath taking images that stand there in silent space, just getting a reaction.  If Independence Day is your thing and everything you see needs to copy it, don't bother to see this movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
5,Horst_In_Translation,More than one odyssey,6,9 October 2020,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is an Ammerican/British co-production mostly in the English language. This is from 1968, so it had its 50th anniversary actually not too long ago. The director is Stanley Kubrick and he is also one of the two writers in charge here. Many say this is the best and defining film from Kubrick's body of work and regardless if you agree or disagree, this is quite a statement of course looking at the powerful filmography he came up with. I would say it is one of his best, but maybe not the number one, but I will get to that later saying what I liked the most and what was not too appealing. There are several versions out there with different running times, but you can say that you will never find a version under two hours or over three hours. I think the most common is right in the middle at 150 minutes. This film was nominated for four Oscars, including writing and direction for Kubrick, but no Best Picture nod. It took home the win for its visual effects, which is worth noting because that win went to Kubrick indeed as well and it was meant to stay the only time he would ever win an Oscar. Kinda ironic with all the stuff he wrote and directed that it was visual effects that became his only triumph with the Academy. He was not there to accept. I have not too much to say about the cast here. This is never really an actors movie at all. Still they do what is required and asked from them to make sure it becomes a good film overall and here and there we also get a scene that is nicely acted. The one that comes immediately to mind is the one where they try to get some information (in a friendly manner) from the astronaut, but he won't say a word. The only other male there asking him was from the East no? So this could be a slight implication of Cold War effects. It is also by today's standards a bit ironic that they pretend there was some dangerous disease going on, a pandemic if you want to call it that, and that is the reason why they won't let people on the planet. But it's all an invention and the truth lies elsewhere. This film can easily be structured into three or four segments. The first would be the scenes a long, long time ago when there were no humans yet on the planet. The second is the one with the daughter's father and his trip to the moon. The third is then the one 18 months later and the trip to Jupiter. And finally, what happens after the protagonist of the third segment manages to take out HAL is the fourth and final segment although you could make a point there too for this epilogue still being part of the third segment.Let me say a few words about each of those segments: What stood out most for me about the first and about the first hour in general was the music. Some really amazing tunes we get there. Best to be heard loud. And it sure was. What was also interesting about the beginning was the mesmerizing (supernatural?) light in the cheetah's eyes. And of course what happens when the apes discover the monolith. They were prey before that in danger of being attacked by the cheetah, but it seems the monolith brough to light some wild instincts and now they were all keen on eating flesh too. The second segment then jumps far, far ahead in time. I am actually not sure if we are in 2001 there or if the third segment is set in 2001, but it is definitely interesting what Kubrick thought 2001 would be like. Or actually he did not think so I guess, but it is interesting how he depicts it in here that there are colonies on the moon for example. And it is probably gonna take another hundred years till we actually get to the level shown in here. Or hopefully not because honestly who cares. It seems that space exploration is pretty much put on halt now anyway. The third segment is the one starring two astronauts and HAL. I liked the attention to detail in this one, for example the scene when they are eating this specific food I was not sure if I found it gross or if I wanted a spoon as well. But what needs to be talked about here the most is HAL himself of course. The voice was so haunting. So well done by Douglas Rain, may he rest in peace. He lived until very recently. It comes pretty quickly that you could think there is something wrong with HAL. When he gets something wrong for the first time, I thought it was actually because he did it on purpose for whatever reason, but no he really seems flawed. When he totally escalates, I felt there were some memorable scenes. Like when one of the two drifts into space. Or when he kills the three in hibernation. Or when he will not let the last one on board again. But is all that really the reasonable approach? He just says he does what needed to be done in order to accomplish the mission. But it does not feel like that at all. Can he succeed on his own without human contact? The three in hibernation had no clue what was going on by the way, why kill them. And maybe he should have let the guy on board again because he must have known about the infrastructure and that the man can make it on his own again anyway. The scene when he gets switched off basically is also memorable, not really because of his his voice changes, but how he keeps talking about his memory loss. I constantly thought about the question from earlier if this computer or robot or machine or whatever you wanna call it or machines in general can have feelings and express emotions. Did Hal? Was he disappointed when he managed to read the lips of the two wanting to switch him off? I mentioned his actions before already. It is really hard to justify all that as the accurate decision to secure the mission. So what was Hal then really? Up to you to decide. One thing he definitely was is truly memorable.The fourth and final part is then linked to the monolith from earlier again and we find out about extraterrestrial life and how the one remaining astronaut was part of a mission that was something entirely different than he expected. This transmission sequence is maybe one reason why this won the Visual Effects Oscar. There is no denying that technically this film was far ahead of its time and probably also somewhat paved the way for many of the then following science fiction films that were on the radar and soon about to happen, especially those set in space. I must still say this final sequence that felt a bit like an epilogue to me is not on the same level as everything before that, probably also because I had no clue what was going on in terms of the symbolism of the baby and how it is basically inside a bubble, inside a planet(?) that was moving at fast speed towards the Earth. Before that final sequence I was undecided if I would call this ""only"" a good or even great film, but I was tempted to pick the latter and give it four stars out of five. As you see from my rating here, I eventually went with three and this was because of the ending. I wish the film could have ended with these bright colorful effects there shooting towards the man. Then I would have said this is indeed one of the best films of the year. Well, it probably still is. I have not seen too much. But I cannot be as enthusiastic about it as I would like to be, especially because I think these last 15-20 minutes also will not get more interesting or memorable or easier to understand on rewatch. But even with these occasional flaws I am glad I got to watch this film today and it has been on my watchlist really for a long, long time because I was waiting to see it on the big screen. The wait was worth it I suppose. Overall, it turned out slightly better than I thought it would because of some brilliant moments and scenes. I would still say that a comfortable place in the imdb top250 is a bit too much, let alone the top100 where it still sits right now. However, I think that it must have been really special to see this film back in the 1960s and it must have been a haunting watch without knowing about all the technical progress we are aware of today. So yeah, visually (also those small moments, just the reflecting lights in the helmet on several occasions or HAL being constantly depicted as this red circle when talking) and audibly a film that definitely deserves more than six stars out of ten. So many haunting moments, not just the beautiful music, but also for example you could feel the explorers' pain in the second segment as they approach the monolith and are confronted with a really unpleasant sound there. By the way, what was up with the beginning? Already there a lengthy sound sequence, but no moving pictures yet before the MGM logo kicks in. Okay, I think there is a lot more to say about this film and everybody will see something different in it (this description really applies here more than everywhere else), so I shall leave it at that and say that, if you haven't already, it is high time to go check this film out. For me it is a thumbs-up and there was never really any moment right from the start where I would say I was unsure if I should give out a positive recommendation. I definitely do give this one a thumbs-up. Maybe I would not say it really flew by, but it still felt much shorter than it actually was. As this film is widely considered a classic nowadays and probably will still be 100 years from now, I say wait till you get to see this one in a movie theater and then go for it. Most likely you will not regret it. Even I as somebody who rarely sees a lot quality in science fiction had a pretty fun time here. This is a film that has aged quite well for sure.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
6,Prismark10,Music and Space: A Odyssey,7,21 February 2015,"Martin Scorsese once said that certain great films need to be revisited at certain points in your life. A film you may have watched when you were 20 years old would give you a different feeling when you are 45 years of age.Well I did watch 2001 when I was about 20 years old. I admired the film's technical achievement but the film outside its opening minutes featuring the ape like creatures left me cold. The latter part of the film being even dull, the psychedelia enjoyed only by people who had popped pills.So after several decades I decided to heed Scorsese's advice and watched it on a high definition big widescreen TV for a more immersive experience. Again the technical achievements is outstanding and still dazzle, it leaves films like Gravity standing because nowadays these types of special effects is common with the technology available to filmmakers. Heck even my mobile phone probably has more computing power than that was available to NASA back in 1968.This leaves the story itself with the monolith appearing in different stages of history pushing human evolution. When a monolith is discovered on the moon it leads to a manned mission to Jupiter to find another monolith. But HAL the advanced computer sabotages the mission wants to get to the monolith instead of the humans so computers can enter the next stage of evolution.With the special effects on screen we have imaginative use of classical music to give us mood. It ranges from soothing to eerie such as when the monolith appears. Again as I get older I appreciate the music more.The film still has problems though. Obviously back in 1968 with all the effort they put into creating the visuals you cannot blame Kubrick for those lengthy shots of the space station or space ship. It does lead to pacing issues and make you feel bored. Even Star Trek - The Motion Picture did the same thing when it was released a dozen years later with all the lengthy shots of the refurbished Enterprise. However the story still gets lost as the film gets lost with its dazzling effects as HAL has to be challenged and then the astronaut enters the monolith. You then see the astronaut as an old man and then is reborn as a baby.I have no idea what it all means and maybe I am not supposed to know as its supposed to be all symbolism.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
7,kosmasp,Genius,8,9 July 2007,"I won't go so much into the plot or try to answer questions that you might have about the movie or what it's about. This is something you have to figure out yourself (and it will be difficult) or search for some explanation on the internet. Although I don't think there is a definitive one! It's a lot of guessing, but not so much knowing what Kubrick was saying.But what I want to talk about, is how the movie was made. Everything is genius, from the fact, that there is no noise in space (and there isn't despite almost every other movie telling you there is, e.g. see Star Wars), to the making of some shots. A shot where it seems the camera is spinning around, it's actually the set that is build like a ""spinning wheel"", the camera is set in one position. But my favorite piece is the sound design! I can't compliment the movie enough on this matter! When the astronaut is breathing in one scene, I suddenly realized, that my breathing was controlled by him. My breathing was identical to the rhythmic sound of the movie. And I don't believe this was an accident, this was Kubricks genius. Of course if you watch it for the first time, you might not realize that, but if you focus on it, you will see that you breathe in the same way as the man on screen! Enough said!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
8,classicsoncall,"""We are all by any practical definition of the words..., foolproof and incapable of error"".",8,29 March 2011,"Notwithstanding Kubrick's status as a legendary director and the film's reputation as a visionary achievement of the genre, I find myself pretty much right in the middle on this picture. For 1968, there is no doubt that '2001' set some high bars for sci-fi in film, but watching today with the passage of four decades, there is a lot that works against it's being the monumental must see that it was when first released. I'm thinking about the extended opening with the ape tribes, and the long psychedelic sequence near the finale that certainly wowed audiences back in the day. Sure, I get it, the picture was portraying one man's interpretation of the evolutionary stages of man, but there's a lot to sit through to get to the point.The best part of the picture for me was the confrontation between HAL and Dr. Bowman (Keir Dullea), but even there, I find myself with some conflicting ideas about what happened in the story, on two points. For one, I find it difficult to believe that enlightened computer programmers of the future would have given HAL the ability to violate an essential code of human conduct, to commit murder in the interest of self preservation. A machine does not have priority over humanity. Secondly, HAL should have recognized this flaw in his programming, and acted to either repair it or terminate his own existence. William Shatner actually talked a few of his computer adversaries into committing suicide in a handful of Star Trek episodes when it appeared they were going out of control. Those stories also came out in the late 1960's and played out to a much more logical conclusion than having HAL stand his ground only to be terminated by Dave's back door sabotage.Even with my misgivings though, I can say that my appreciation for the picture has grown with repeated viewings, and I will wind up watching it again as time goes by. However I don't expect something to click in a way that makes me see it as the kind of masterpiece many give it credit for. That rocket has left the launchpad.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
9,gavin6942,"Visually Stunning, But Perhaps Overrated",6,1 December 2014,"Humanity finds a mysterious, obviously artificial, object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the intelligent computer H.A.L. 9000, sets off on a quest.Saying that ""2001"" is overrated is the sort of statement that can bring down hatred and vitriol from science fiction fans, Kubrick fans and more. Of course, it is possible to be a Kubrick fan and still generally dislike this film.Nobody can deny that this film is visually stunning, and a landmark in imagery. It also has the advantage of being the last film about space travel to be released before the moon landing, making it somewhat prescient in a way.But yet, does it need to be so long, so grand, with the music and long shots? Perhaps not quite ""pretentious"", but the film presents itself as being more important than it really is. Critics at the time (1968) denounced the film, and perhaps they were right. At the very least, two cuts could be made: a longer one for die-hard fans, and a shorter one for casual viewers.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
10,lee_eisenberg,Are machines more human than humans?,10,4 August 2005,"Most people probably know the story. One group of apes forces another away from a water hole. The other group then comes across the monolith, which seems to imbue them with a new ability. One of the apes realizes that he can use a bone as a weapon, and forces the other group away from the water hole. Millions of years later, a bunch of people on the moon discover the monolith, which has indeterminate effects on their equipment. Eighteen months later, supercomputer HAL tells astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) that there will be a failure. When the failure never happens, Dave and his co-astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) realize that HAL may be malfunctioning and get into a pod so that they can talk about disabling him. But HAL can read their lips, and begins plotting against them. He kills Poole, and so Dave quickly disables him. After coming across the monolith, Dave then goes through a time-space continuum, which ends with him seeing an elderly version of himself. The elderly version then sees an even older version. The older version sees the monolith, which then portrays a fetus, which seems to introduce a new stage of humanity.It goes without saying that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a thinking person's movie, but what is it saying? Knowing that insanity is a frequent theme in Stanley Kubrick's movies, let's address it here. We would jump to say that HAL is insane, but is he? He was programmed to complete the mission, and he would probably see fit to eliminate any perceived impediments. In Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory"", the soldiers disobeyed orders because they knew that it would be insane to obey; HAL cannot disobey orders because he is just a series of chips, wires and electronic impulses. So in a way, the people who designed him were the insane ones.What about the humans-vs-machines issue? Dave is human and HAL is a machine, right? Well think about it. When Dave tries to retrieve Poole after HAL kills him, the claws almost look like they're cradling Poole, while Dave doesn't seem to express any emotion.As for relations to other Kubrick movies, technology is going out of control, like in ""Dr. Strangelove"", and they are completely trapped, like in ""The Shining"".",2001 - A Space Odyssey
11,jboothmillard,2001: A Space Odyssey,9,24 March 2005,"For its time, the visual and audio magnificence of this film has never differed, even if there is not much story, it is still an inspirational film from Oscar nominated director Stanley Kubrick (A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket).

This then moves to ""The Dawn of Man"" where a tribe of prehistoric apes/primates engaging in regular activities, before finding the black rectangular monolith and learning to use bones as weapons. The tossed bone image matches the next hour and a half in outer space, starting with all space crafts (including the cart wheel one) orbiting to the score of Johann Strauss's ""Blue Danube Waltz"".

12,ccthemovieman-1,A Unique Film Which Has Reached 'Classic' Status,9,17 February 2008,"This has really become a classic film, not just a sci-fi classic. ""2001""was a ground-breaking event, visually-speaking, that had people talking big-time when it was released. In my college-age crowd at the time, all anyone could talk about was the famous ""light show scene"" late in the film on the trip to Jupiter.Admittedly, there are a few things that make this film less than appealing to some, and I've always found that understandable: mainly, the slowness of many scenes and the secular agenda. I've never let either one bother me. First-time viewers are warned: don't expect a fast-moving film. And don't worry about figuring out the ending. I don't know if anyone has an answer to that.The visuals - the ""light show,"" modern furniture, immense space craft, the ending bedroom scene, the apes learning to use weapons to fight each other, etc - are all fascinating aspects of this movie, but there is more. The soundtrack, the more one hears it, is extremely impressive especially as technology improves and he we hear it on a good DVD and surround system. (The Blu-Ray is fantastic.)Now that's the way to hear classical music! Strauss' ""Blue Danube"" never sounded better! Played during many of the slower parts of the film, the dramatic music enhances the feel of the immensity of space itself. Then, audibly, we hear these eerie chants whenever the mysterious monolith appears, whether its on earth, out in space, or in Jupiter. In other words, this film offers a fantastic assortment of visual and audio ""trips"" for the senses.Story-wise, it's all about HAL, the computer, and two astronauts who are under his leadership. The spacemen - played by Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood - are good, but HAL steals the show. His ""voice"" is mesmerizing, a haunting monotone. In fact, Douglas Rain is the unsung ""hero"" of this movie, with his voice-work of ""Hal."" The more one sees this movie, the more cold and evil HAL becomes.All in all, this is a movie - like the controversial ""A Clockwork Orange"" - that is so unique that I would think it would have be part of any movie fan's collection of the memorable films of the 20th century.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
13,rmax304823,"I think, therefore I am. (I think.)",9,21 June 2005,"Nobody could have done it better than Kubrick. The question is, ""What does 'it' mean?"" I'll skip the story, what there is of it. Anyone who wants a reasonably decent explanation in coherent terms ought to consult the Film Guide series from Indiana University Press.It is an unforgettable movie that would not have had quite the same impact if it had been made more than one or two years, one way or the other, of 1968.Just take one instance. The computer, Hal, the most interesting character in the film, goes berserk. He signals to the two astronauts that there is a failure that must be fixed from the outside. The astronauts leave the space ship in tiny round pods. While they are gone, Hal kills all the other astronauts who are in hibernation for the long trip to Jupiter. Hal also causes a pod to kill one of the external astronauts and then refuses entry to the remaining live one, Dave (Keir Dullea).Dullea orders repeatedly, ""Open the pod bay doors, Hal."" His expression is one of vexation, as if he's having a duel of wits with a recalcitrant garage door. Finally he blasts his way into the space ship, barely surviving, then sets about destroying Hal. As he climbs a ladder to enter Hal's brain, Hal remarks soothingly, ""Dave -- I can see your really upset about this."" It's EXACTLY what Carl Rogers would have said. Hal begins to sound like a junior executive being fired. ""I know I've made some bad decisions recently. But I can assure you that I am back to normal now. Really, I am devoted to the success of this mission"" If that's supposed to be a joke, it must have worked in 1968, when we were all in the business of seeing (or being) humanistic shrinks. I'm not sure that everybody would find the humor in such a line now, in 2005, a year in which most of the USA seems to find itself adrift on Jupiter. In the end, Dullea, if that in fact is what we're looking at, finds himself alone and unborn in the shrill silence of outer space.That ""star gate"" episode -- wow! The coeval audience had a heck of a good time seeing it while stoned. Vavoom -- through an unknown universe! Into the Maelstrom. It must have been great if you'd been smoking grass. If you were tripping it might have become one of Edgar Allan Poe's worst hangovers. Just seeing it tonight took me back thirty years or so to when I was a research assistant at the New Jersey Neuropsychiatric Institute, engaged in a study of psychedelic drug use. It was perfectly legitimate, run by the psychiatrist who coined the term ""psychedelic"" and visited Aldous Huxley on his death bed, and endorsed by a former Attorney General of the United States. (By the way, has the statute of limitations run out?) We were not supposed to use drugs but one night circumstances demanded it and the next thing I knew I was wandering around a part of Manhattan I was completely unfamiliar with, the East 70s, never having gotten north of 14th Street in my youth. And -- wow -- everything was just terrible. People were walking dogs along the sidewalks and I fancied the dogs were staring at me because they knew I was a complete wreck. Well, let's skip it, except to say that what you need in a paranoid state is not the trip that Kubrick gives you, but a handle on reality. Well, I'm not sure, really. Sometimes I feel spaced out here in New Mexico where the Ice Cream trucks play ""La Cucaracha."" In the New Jersey neighborhood where I grew up they at least had the prescience to play the ""Dies Irae.""Anyway, one of the most impressive features of the film is the special effects -- all done in the 1960s before computers. They are all mechanical or photographic. No computerized graphic images like the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park"" or the musclebound monsters that leap around on today's screen. If you see a space ship in ""2001"", it was hand built. The FX are the pinnacle of pre-computerized FX. They're like the clipper ships of the 1850s, marvels of marine engineering, about as good as it gets, before they were replaced by steamships.I realize this is not much of a review of the movie itself, but without having looked, I imagine there must be a hundred or more so, really, why bother? Kubrick was an interesting guy. According to Kirk Douglas's revealing (and not very flattering) autobiography, ""Rag Man's Son,"" Kubrick shot ""Spartacus"" which had been written by someone on the McCarthy-style blacklist and forbidden to work in the USA. A heated discussion arose about who exactly should get the writing credit, since the actual writer's name couldn't be used. How could justice best be served. Kubrick piped up and said if you want a writer's name, use mine. I'll take the credit. As Douglas put it, ""Kubrick was a talented s***.""But -- all of that period and personal detail aside -- this film is a magnificent artifact. What an artist Kubrik was.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
14,Tweekums,A sci-fi classic,10,7 December 2012,"Opening before humanity evolved from apes we see a group of apes as it clashes with another group; fighting with hands and teeth. Then one day one of the apes finds a strange black monolith; shortly afterwards it learns how to use objects as weapons a new stage in its evolution has begun. Jumping forward to the near future another monolith has been discovered on the Moon. This discovery leads to a mission to Jupiter; its six-strong team consists of Dave Bowman, Frank Poole, three scientists in stasis and HAL, the ship's computer. As they approach Jupiter it appears that HAL has made an error; something unheard of for such a machine; if the mission is to go ahead as planned it looks as if Dave and Frank will have to disconnect HAL; something HAL will not let them do without a struggle! Once that problem is past and the ship approaches Jupiter things get very strange indeed.Love it or loathe it there is no denying that '2001' is one of the most significant science fiction films ever made. It might not feature exciting laser battles or strange alien creatures and its pace is distinctly slow but it is still a must see for fans of the genre. The effects are brilliant; the ships don't look like models and the apes do not look like people in costumes despite the fact that they are. Most films can usually be summed up in a few sentences but it is impossible to really do that here as I'm not one hundred percent certain what it is about despite having watched it a few times perhaps this is why it is such a great film; it leaves the audience to decide on a lot of matters without it seeming like a cop out. The cast of relatively unknown actors does a fine job; most notably Keir Dullea who plays Dave and Douglas Rain who provides the voice of HAL; making it one of Sci-fi's best known characters despite the fact that all we see of it is its glowing red 'eye'. Stanley Kubrick did a fine job bringing this far-reaching story to the screen; if you haven't seen it yet I'd certainly recommend checking it out; especially if you are a science fiction fan.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
15,BA_Harrison,"In space, no-one can hear you yawn.",4,12 December 2015,"I was born in 1968, the year that saw the original release of 2001: A Space Odyssey; of course, I didn't really get into sci-fi cinema until almost a decade later, when that other movie—you know, the one with the droids, blasters and aliens—broke box-office records. Now aged 47, and fully prepared (or so I thought) for a more cerebrally challenging experience than George Lucas's space opera, I've finally caught up with Kubrick's celebrated sci-fi 'masterpiece'. And I haven't been so bored in a long time.It's not that I need bucket-loads of action and excitement to enjoy a sci-fi movie—I have deep affection for leisurely '70s genre efforts such as Silent Running and Dark Star (both of which clearly owe a debt to 2001)—but Kubrick's film takes pomposity and tedium to a new level. Perhaps if I was stoned, as I imagine many of the film's original fans were when they first saw it, and watching on a cinema screen instead of a TV, I might have been a little more impressed: the visuals are undeniably awe inspiring, the music is grandiose, the psychedelic finale is a trip, and there is much symbolism and narrative ambiguity for intellectuals to chew over, but at two hours and twenty minutes, with very little dialogue and a tortuously slow pace, I struggled to stay awake.In short: give me a lightsaber battle any day of the week.4/10, mostly for the surprisingly effective ape-man suits and the highly detailed spacecraft model effects.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
16,moonspinner55,Voice of HAL a performance unto itself...,6,27 August 2005,"US spacecraft bound for Jupiter is controlled by ""foolproof"" computer. Audiences in 1968--mostly the college students who were becoming the country's foremost film enthusiasts--were determined to believe that Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" was a deep thinker (they came to this conclusion because it baffled and confused them--therefore it must be deep). The assemblage and presentation is remarkable, no doubt about it, but how deep the film actually goes is up for debate. Kubrick clearly has filmmaking prowess to spare, and his picture is a stunning achievement on a visual level (one can hardly comprehend how he managed to get this work on the screen without interference--and, if there was behind-the-scenes trouble, that achievement becomes even more heroic). Still, this voyage involving two astronauts battling a brilliant and power-mad computer of their own making is an abstract, psychedelic head trip, either intellectually stimulating or somnolent depending upon one's perceptions and patience. I found much of it, particularly the final act, cold and alienating. I also wasn't overly impressed with the elongated prehistoric prologue, even if the now-celebrated edit from flying bone/weapon to space station in the stars has become the stuff of legend (for the deep thinkers, this clunky-abrupt cut is Exhibit A). You cannot doubt Kubrick's mastery of the cinema (he also produced the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Arthur C. Clarke, from Clarke's uncredited story ""The Sentinel""), and yet the movie has no personality apart from HAL's dejected-spiteful-pitying voice. The terrific cinematography is by Geoffrey Unsworth, with assist from John Alcott. The voice of HAL is Douglas Rain (and it deserves legendary status). The actors--Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood--seem cast for their dullness (intentionally I presume), yet one does eventually tire of them. Kubrick also triumphed when he used classical music to punch up the visuals, putting a pop-art stamp on these legendary pieces. Four Oscar nominations with one win: Best Special Visual Effects (awarded to Kubrick). Five BAFTA nominations with three wins: Best Sound Track, Best Art Direction, and Best Cinematography (awarded to Unsworth). A follow-up, ""2010"", from Clarke's novel--but without Kubrick's participation--arrived in 1984. **1/2 from ****",2001 - A Space Odyssey
17,dbdumonteil,Absolute masterpiece,10,22 June 2001,"On a scale from 1 to 10,a ten would not be enough for such a masterwork. 1968 was the definitive landmark for sci-fi movies.So innovative was the screenplay,so devastating were the pictures,so haunting was the score that Kubrik's movie took our breath away,mesmerizing us ,turning us into creatures in rapture,in awe .Some scenes are so admirable,so sublime,that they make you cry:remember the ape discovering the power of a tool,the spaceships floating while exotic ""Blue Danube"" is heard. This movie could go on four hours and hours ,no one would notice.One hundred years from now,future scholars will write exegesises of the bewildering finale.As vain and futile as the quest for the Holy Graal.Our connection to the movie is subliminal,the long ""psychedelic"" sequence comes as a perfect metaphor.Remember ,in Ingmar Bergman's ""seventh seal"",the lines :""questions are more important than the answers"".Kubrick wanted the movie to stir something inside of us,to speak to our subconscious.And AC Clarke ,who co-wrote the screenplay mischievously added;""this is a fiction;reality will be certainly stranger"". No sci-fi movie comes close to 2001:""star wars"" does not really appeal to adults the same way ,by a long shot .""Close encounters"",while aping some of Kubrik tricks,remains puerile and spoils everything by showing almost everything in its turgid finale.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
18,Quinoa1984,"the proverbial ""good"" science fiction movie- meant to be seen on a BIG screen",10,13 January 2000,"Years from now, when quite possibly film studios decide that filming and screening motion pictures for theatrical distribution no longer will work out financially and make everything for DVD and TV and, Lord help us, cell phones and I-phones, 2001 will remain as one of those reminders of what would be eternally lost. If films like this can be made on celluloid and *intended* to be screened in full 70mm or 35mm glory for all to see in a packed theater, then there should be hope.Because, as it stands, Kubrick's masterwork, aside from being the rare landmark to be an attempt at transmogrifying the form of film itself (as Spielberg once noted, it's not entirely drama or documentary or science fiction), is all fine and well on TV, particularly in full widescreen DVD. But, at the least for those who have problems with the film (and it's not hard to have them), it could be a universal likelihood that it's so much a pure visual experience, so visceral and surreal and all 'als', that it deserves no less than to be seen at least once up tall on a screen too many feet tall (and, fingers crossed, someday on IMAX?) 2001 has caused more debate than during presidential primaries. What the hell is up with this movie? The fact that we question it- and, perhaps, even ourselves for why we thought the way we did- is part of the experience, and the mystery, and depending on how much or how little you're willing to take on that mystery will determine what you think of the film. Is the monolith really an alien, or some nothingness that one can project whatever on to? Why does it make the high-pitched sounds on the moon when made into photo-fodder? Where is that crazy room that Bowman goes to at the end? And don't get me started on the 'star child'. It's all of this that, for me, makes it so unforgettable, and something that enriches the experience the more times its revisited.To be fair, even as much of a Kubrick nut I am, it's hard to say that I wasn't bored the first time seeing it at the age of 12 and not used to sci-fi/fantasy that went this... well, slow isn't the word exactly, but meditative, patient, like a story that is in no need to rush itself in lieu of the stylistic choices of the director. But a few years later, it worked better, then better still. While it goes without saying that it might just fall flat for some time and time again, for me it's one of those things like a marvelous piece of music, where revisiting it is part of the enjoyment of familiarity, but at the same time you might rediscover something else, or you might have even changed since the last time.It's surreal, trippy, courageous, revelatory, frustrating, bewildering, and firmly structured. From the continuously mind-blowing visual fx by Kubrick and Douglas Trumbull, from the ominous presence of HAL 9000(possibly as the eventual continuation of a bone thwacking ape), from every careful but broad-stroked piece of direction and subtle piece of acting, it's popular art at a high water mark. It's probably not the greatest of all films, but many others can only hope and try their absolute best to reach the levels Kubrick and Clarke reached, how it plunged the aspirations of what is ""out there"" among the stars and the galaxy to an intellectual point via the confounding magic of cinema (yes, I used the word magic).",2001 - A Space Odyssey
19,JohnHowardReid,Still packs a wallop!,10,8 July 2017,"Quite simply the best sci-fi film ever made. However, stand outside the theater when the audience is coming out. You'll hear people talking about how impressive the special effects were, what a mind- blowing experience the film is, but what was it all about? The clue is in the third chapter of John's Gospel when Jesus tells Nicodemus that ""unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God."" If you don't understand this, you won't understand the film, because the screenwriters apply this saying in both a literal and a figurative sense throughout the action. The context of the climax is entirely theological and it's because of the film's strong religious overtones even more than its brilliantly conceived vistas of man's technological horizons, that 2001 has acquired such a reputation and such a cult following.The special effects, are not only marvelous, they are astounding. Not only do they stagger the imagination, they are absolutely perfect, technically. I could not spot a single flaw. And the technicians have even allowed for the distortion on both sides of the curved screen! The special effects in 2001 are easily the finest and the greatest achievement in special effects work in any film ever made.Now, as to the story. It seems at first to be moving along the lines of ""The Forbidden Planet"" and its sequel ""The Invisible Boy"". Then it takes a page from one of Jack Finney's ""Time"" stories, and finally concludes with an image obviously borrowed from the fade-out of Cecil B. De Mille's ""The King of Kings"" and derived from the text: ""Except a man be born again, he shall not enter the kingdom of heaven."" It also is worth noting that the baby is not presented realistically but is akin to that depicted in such 15th century paintings as Lochner's ""Adoration of the Child"".So far, all is straightforward. But when we come to ask ourselves why the director chose this rather peculiar method of exposition, we are on much less safe ground. Except for the business of the mysterious oblong, the film sticks very close to fact for most of its length. It has, for example, recently been discovered that life can survive in a vacuum for up to even two minutes. Also, it has been confidently suggested that the induced hibernation of humans for long periods is not only completely feasible but imminent. Even the ultra- intelligent computer is predicted to be a reality within the next 30 years.All this might be assumed as fact-to-be. But when the space ship arrives at Jupiter, the film takes the plunge and definitely joins the ranks of the avant-garde both in theme and presentation. In an amazingly hypnotic sequence, the full impact of the Cinerama screen is used for the first time to assault the senses of the viewer. The mind reels under the impact of the speed of coruscating flashes of multi-hued light.Technically, the film cannot be faulted. The art direction and photography are superb, the direction is consistently inventive, and the actors come across well. Even the use of canned music is nothing short of inspired — with space stations free-wheeling to the accompaniment of ""The Blue Danube"" and a heavenly chorus singing ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"".Although there have been many science-fiction films in the past, this, I believe, is the first time a film-maker has tried to project the future scientifically. Of course, there have been films like 1984 and First Men on the Moon, but they are obvious fantasies. No, this film had its genesis back in 1938 in an exhibition at the New York World's Fair in which, by the use of models, the great Norman Bel Geddes projected his own amazingly accurate vision of a Future that has now come to pass.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
20,wes-connors,HAL Opens the Doors,10,30 September 2007,"Since so much will be written about this film, let's be brief. I have seen ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" all the way through, twice. There are some parts I've watched separately, but I saw none of the film until AFTER 2001. So, obviously, it has a timeless quality. I consider Stanley Kubrick's work on this film to be art, which really doesn't ""age"". I believe there is also a point where ""flaws"" become irrelevant, and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" reaches that point.It's probably been said (I will look at the other comments this evening), but the portrayals of Keir Dullea (as Dave) and Douglas Rain (as Hal) are absolutely spellbinding. I do consider Mr. Rain's portrayal of ""HAL"" an acting performance; consider, also, how much Mr. Dullea accomplishes without speaking.

22,sunwarrior13,An Epic Sci-Fi Film,10,7 March 2012,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a science fiction film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick. It was co-written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, partially inspired by Clarke's short story ""The Sentinel"". The story deals with a series of encounters between humans and mysterious black monoliths that are apparently affecting human evolution, and a space voyage to Jupiter tracing a signal emitted by one such monolith found on the moon. Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood star as the two astronauts on this voyage, with Douglas Rain as the voice of the sentient computer HAL 9000 who has full control over their spaceship.At the ""Dawn of Man,"" a group of hominids encounters a mysterious black monolith alien to their surroundings. To the strains of Strauss's 1896 Also sprach Zarathustra, a hominid invents the first weapon, using a bone to kill prey. As the hominid tosses the bone in the air, Kubrick cuts to a 21st century spacecraft hovering over the Earth, skipping ahead millions of years in technological development. U.S. scientist Dr. Heywood Floyd travels to the moon to check out the discovery of a strange object on the moon's surface: a black monolith. As the sun's rays strike the stone, however, it emits a piercing, deafening sound that fills the investigators' headphones and stops them in their path. Cutting ahead 18 months, impassive astronauts David Bowman and Frank Poole head toward Jupiter on the spaceship Discovery, their only company three hibernating astronauts and the vocal, man-made HAL 9000 computer running the entire ship. When the all-too-human HAL malfunctions, however, he tries to murder the astronauts to cover his error, forcing Bowman to defend himself the only way he can. Free of HAL, and finally informed of the voyage's purpose by a recording from Floyd, Bowman journeys to ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite,"" through the psychedelic slit-scan star-gate to an 18th century room, and the completion of the monolith's evolutionary mission.The film is frequently described as an ""epic film"", both for its length and scope, and for its affinity with classical epics.With assistance from special-effects expert Douglas Trumbull, Kubrick spent over two years meticulously creating the most ""realistic"" depictions of outer space ever seen, greatly advancing cinematic technology for a story expressing grave doubts about technology itself. Despite some initial critical reservations that it was too long and too dull, 2001 became one of the most popular films of 1968, underlining the generation gap between young moviegoers who wanted to see something new and challenging and oldsters who ""didn't get it."" Provocatively billed as ""the ultimate trip,"" 2001 quickly caught on with a counterculture youth audience open to a contemplative (i.e. chemically enhanced) viewing experience of a film suggesting that the way to enlightenment was to free one's mind of the U.S. military-industrial-technological complex.The film's projections of the cold war and antiquated product placements may look quaint now, but the poetry is as hard-edged and full of wonder as ever.But nevertheless,it is an extraordinary, obsessive, beautiful work of art.One of the most influential of all sci-fi films -- and one of the most controversial -- Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity -- and folly -- of mankind.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

25,Hey_Sweden,"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that.",10,17 September 2018,"A half-century later, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" remains a remarkable achievement for its visionary producer / director Stanley Kubrick, who wrote the screenplay with noted author Arthur C. Clarke. Its visuals were state-of-the-art at the time, and they are still impressive all these years later. It depicts the contact that mankind has with aliens over thousands of years, beginning in the ""Dawn of Man"" when various ape-men puzzle over a strange new artifact in their world. It then makes a hard cut to the early 21st century, when space has been colonized and something amazing has been discovered beneath the surface of the moon. Then, we jump ahead again to a mission to Jupiter, commandeered by astronauts Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). They will have their hands full, dealing with a problematic artificial intelligence named HAL (voiced by an eerily calm Douglas Rain), after which Dave is taken on a truly startling final journey.It's breathtaking to see the results of an obviously huge amount of work. Due to its widescreen photography (by Geoffrey Unsworth and John Alcott) and its sound design, this is one picture that would really rock on a big screen. Kubrick is quite daring in his approach, crafting a film that moves so slowly that it could bore people with short attention spans. But this does help in portraying a certain monotonous and empty feeling when people are working in deep space. Other elements lending ""2001"" distinction are Kubricks' use of many classic compositions, from the ""Blue Danube"" to (most memorably) ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"". The script by Kubrick and Clarke offers a stately, intelligent approach to the idea of working in outer space, complete with colourful but rather antiseptic environments. Described by some as basically a tale about evolution, and the role that these extraterrestrials played in it, it offers no easy, clear-cut answers, but instead leaves details (including the ending) open to discussion, which has kept viewers pondering it for decades. Provocative stories like this, that fire our imaginations and intellects, are often the ones with true staying power.The performances (the cast also includes William Sylvester, Daniel Richter, Leonard Rossiter, Margaret Tyzack, Robert Beatty, and Sean Sullivan) do not blow a viewer away, but are perfectly low key and do suit the material. Rain deserves a lot of credit for creating a legendary ""villain"" through just the sheer relaxed tone of his voice.Sadly, this is NOT going to suit all tastes, but audiences who favour sci-fi pictures that stress the ""science"" aspect, and attempt to appeal to adult intellects, will find it richly rewarding, no matter the run time.Originally screened at two hours and 41 minutes; later cut by about 19 minutes. The version on the Blu-ray runs two hours and 29 minutes, complete with an overture, intermission, and exit music.This delivers the kind of movie experience that discerning viewers don't easily forget.10 out of 10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
26,preppy-3,"Selt-indulgent, painfully slow and just boring",2,23 October 2008,"There are spoilers throughout this review.This starts at the ""Dawn of Man"". A bunch of apes find a black monolith and start to evolve slowly. Then it cuts to 2001. A black monolith has been discovered on the moon--buried. When the light hits the monolith it starts to emit a message to the moons of Jupiter. Astronauts David Bowman (Keir Dullea), Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and some other astronauts (in suspended animation) are sent to Jupiter to investigate. However their computer HAL (with the creepy voice of Douglas Rain) goes crazy and kills everybody except for Dullea. Dullea gets to Jupiter and ""enters"" a black monolith floating in space. He's then in a room being watched over by alien beings. He ages rapidly and dies...but becomes a ""star child"". It seems he has been chosen (for whatever reason) to show the next step in evolution to man. Basically the monolith is a gift from some alien beings who watch over the entire universe. They helped the human race evolve. The monolith on the moon was buried so man would dig it up. When they got to it the signal sent to Jupiter was to alert the aliens that man was ready for his next step.That's MY view of it. Everybody has different interpretations of this movie.I have vague recollections of seeing this back in 1968 at the age of 6 (the film is G rated). I remember the apes at the beginning scaring me...and then falling asleep. Since then I've seen it multiple times at revival theatres and, on one occasion, saw a brand new print with stereo at a play house. Yes--the special effects are impressive. Yes--the music is great. But the movie is long, far too slow and just boring! It moves at such a slow pace that it's sleep-inducing. There's very little dialogue but that's a blessing because what there is is pretty lousy. The human characters have no personality whatsoever and speak in monotones and simple short sentences. Lockwood and Dullea are supposedly buddies but I never got the feeling that they even liked each other! This isn't anything against either actor--these poor guys are given nothing to work with. For instance when HAL kills Lockwood and the other astronauts what's Dullea's reaction? Nothing. He barely raises an eyebrow. I don't blame Dullea--I think he was just playing it like director Stanley Kubrick told him. How can you care about characters who are given no personality or motivations? You know there's a problem when HAL comes across as more real than Poole and Bowman! Also HAL gets paranoid and kills Frank. Could someone please tell me how a COMPUTER gets paranoid???? They give an explanation (sort of) in ""2010"" but it was pretty stupid. There are a few good things about this. Douglas Rains' voice of HAL is suitably creepy. Lockwood strips down to his shorts at one point showing his muscular body. The entrance into the star gate is still impressive (if far too long).People seem to forget that a lot of people hated this movie when it first came out. MGM executives thought they had a disaster on their hands and most people couldn't make heads or tales out of the plot. During a break in a premiere screening for studio executives someone said, ""Something better happen in the second half or we're dead!"" But, inexplicably, audiences seemed to love it and it's now regarded as a masterpiece. Aside from being thoroughly bored by it I find it cold and impersonal too. The message seems to be that man is an insignificant little thing in the universe. It's all in the hands of these gods and you can't do anything to change it. That's a pretty creepy message but the movie drags out everything to a ridiculous degree. Boring, slow and sleep-inducing. The 2 is for the special effects and Dullea and Lockwood (I like both actors despite this movie).",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This is enough to Elevate this Evolutionary Story and Seminal Work to a Status that is almost Beyond Criticism and is only Open to Interpretation.The number of those Interpretations are as Mind-Boggling as the Film itself. It not only is one of the most Meticulous Efforts in Movie History, it virtually remains without an aging look or a dated pretension. The Visual representation of Space Travel, the Electronic Technicalities, the Dumbed Down Humans with very little to Contribute Intellectually or Verbally, and the overwhelming Musical and Sound overlays are but just a few of the Flawless Prognostications.To say that it is a Meditative Movie with Complex Contemplation would be Accurate. To say that the Pacing is Slow would be an Understatement. But to say that it is a Failure as Art or Entertainment would be a Conceit that is Without Foundation.It is Ultra-Art. It is a Pristine Picture with an Ambiance befitting its Philosophical and Cosmological Story. One cannot come away from this Film without an Opinion. Even if that Personal Reflection is one of Disdain, it has achieved its Purpose to Enlist a Reaction. It is a Visionary, Visceral View of Ourselves and a Commentary on Our Purpose and Place in this incredibly Vast and Vacant Universe that is as Old as Time and as New as Our Experiences and Expectations can Allow.Trying to Quantify and Describe this Universe and Our Place in it is most likely a Futile Exercise in Ethnocentrism, but that doesn't stop Poets, Writers, Artists, and Scientists from trying. So here is one of those Examples and one of the Most Impressive.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
28,utgard14,Kubrick's Masterpiece,10,21 June 2014,"What can I really say about one of the greatest films of all time that hasn't been said already? The first time I saw it as a teenager I was left amazed at what I had seen but at the same time confused as to what it all meant. This was the first movie I saw that didn't spell everything out for me. It took time for me to learn to enjoy that. It's a beautiful film. I've heard it described as visual poetry and I think that is as accurate a way of putting it as anything else. The visuals are stunning. The special effects, sets, costumes are all first-rate. I recently watched it with my girlfriend who had never seen it and has tastes that are strictly mainstream. She was in awe of the look of the film, particularly given its age. Not enough good things can be said about Kubrick's use of classical music in this, as well. It's a masterpiece that deserves every bit of praise it's received. Obviously a film that every serious film fan has to see. It might not be to everybody's tastes but it's an experience unlike any other and, in my opinion, worth repeated viewings. For those of you interested, there's obviously the Arthur C. Clarke books that are worth reading but I'm also going to recommend you check out the Jack Kirby 2001 comics. They're trippy and lots of fun!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
29,grantss,Good...but not great. More style than substance.,6,19 September 2015,"Good...but not great.Not quite the classic it is made out to be. Visually stunning, yet slow-paced with a tangential, random ending. Not really an actor's movie: dialogue and emotion are limited, so not much to comment on in terms of performances.Kudos for it being ahead of its time as far as science fiction dramas go. The visual effects are still amazing 40+ years later. Worth watching to see what all the fuss is about, but prepared to be underwhelmed in terms of coherence of plot and profundity. Quite overrated.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
30,Boba_Fett1138,"Still one of the best- and certainly most unique, thought provoking science-fiction movie out there.",10,24 December 2011,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is truly a milestone in the history of filmmaking. It showed the possibilities of what you could do with the science-fiction genre, besides having aliens trying to conquer the Earth. It showed that there was a reason as to why the word science is in science-fiction. But not only just story-wise is this a great movie within its genre but also technically. It really is one of the most complex movies you'll ever see, which is however mostly simply because it leaves up a lot to your own interpretation. To me the movie has always been about the evolution of mankind. Every time the human species comes across a monolith, it marks a step forward in its evolution. But the movie never explains where the monoliths come from, or what it truly does. Does it come from space? Or perhaps it's a sign from God! It never turns into a religion versus science discussion but instead leaves everything completely open to your own interpretation. This especially goes for its ending, which director Stanley Kubrick and writer Arthur C. Clarke themselves didn't even had a real explanation for.It's actually really one of the oddest movies ever made, once you really start thinking about it. It's really not a movie with a clear, beginning, middle and end in it. Instead it could be divided into different acts, of which most of them are involving different characters. Yet everything still feels perfectly connected and in perfect harmony with each other because the movie always remains consistent with its pacing and style. The action moments are not shot and edited any faster than its mystery moments and its science-fiction elements are not any more or any less exciting than its more horror-like moments.Yes, I think ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" actually has a great horror vibe to it as well! This is all thanks to HAL 9000, who basically is one of the best horror characters of all time, even though the movie itself is of course far from a conventional horror movie. Thing that makes HAL 9000 so great and such a scary character is that he is nothing more but a red light-bulb, who is yet more and more starting to show strange human tendencies. He is so unpredictable and also incredibly powerful, since he can basically control the entire spaceship, which all makes him a quite scary and threatening character.Visually and also especially technically this is a great movie. Most of the effects in this movie were thought up and created specifically for this movie and even now days they are still great- and convincing looking. But I especially love the realistic approach of all of its science-fiction elements. It's a very detailed movie, that thought of about everything it seems. From how space-food would be like in the future, to space toilets and ways of how humans would communicated with each other and with computers.It's also really a movie that lets its images tell most of its story. The movie starts off without dialog and also the last part of the movie is completely without any dialog. Some people will be bothered by its slow pacing, while others will be fascinated by the way the movie is slowly being told and developed, without ever laying out things clearly for you. It's truly a thought provoking movie, that deserves your full attention, so just don't watch then when feeling tired or not in the mood.One of the many great and truly unique movies, from the brilliant but complicated Stanley Kubrick.10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",2001 - A Space Odyssey
31,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,I am speechless...,10,11 December 2004,"Having just seen this fantastic film, I'm left puzzled, amazed, impressed and in complete and utter awe of Kubrick's cinematic genius. I had not expected anything to impress me as much as A Clockwork Orange, but I was pleasantly surprised. While I do find A Clockwork Orange to be a better film, I must say that this comes incredibly close... and what determines this might be the fact that, while I fully understood A Clockwork Orange(at least after my second viewing) I'm quite confused by this film. I don't entirely understand the ending, and a few various things throughout the film, but that doesn't lower my score. Not the slightest. Do you know why? Well, partly because Arthur C. Clarke, the co-writer of the screenplay once said: ""If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered."" And partly because the very visuals of this film warrant a perfect rating of 10. I would be lying if I claimed to ever have seen such beautiful visuals as the ones throughout the film, and in particular the very end... stunning. Simply stunning. Something that I found interesting was how many times Kubrick simply used the visuals to tell the story(as opposed to dialog) and how often he simply let us enjoy the sight of the spacecrafts or the planets... instead of giving us a few unsatisfying quick cuts like a typical Hollywood director would have done. Kubrick is in no hurry to tell us this story... in fact, he wants us to relax and just be whisked away on this journey. He sets a mood like no other director has ever done, and he never breaks this mood. His use of music, while not as deliciously ironic as it is in A Clockwork Orange, is great. There are two scenes which have been referenced so many times, both content-wise and music-wise, in so many different mediums that I doubt anyone can keep track of how many parodies or references there are to them... this is, of course, the famous Dawn of Man scene, and a recurring external space scene. The plot is great. The pacing is good, considering that it's Kubrick... usually, his films are slower, but this one never really felt that slow. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is all great. The music/score is great. The visuals of the film are amazing. I know I'm praising every aspect of the film here, but I truly think it is that good; it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and definitely the best visually. Finally, I'll just mention that normally I hate science fiction that deals(even slightly) with extraterrestrial activity/life and space travel. I recommend this film to any fan of high-quality science fiction and any fan of Stanley Kubrick. 10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
32,view_and_review,Can I extract the middle?,6,5 March 2019,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a cinematic wonder. I'm not old enough to have seen this movie in theaters but I have availed myself of many films from the 50's and 60's and this movie just shattered barriers. It is light years ahead of anything at that time. It was light on dialog but what it eschewed of dialog it compensated with visual stimuli. There wasn't a single word uttered for the first 30 minutes nor the last 30 minutes thereby leaving a lot open for interpretation. I can't say that I was a fan of the two extremes of the film but I loved the middle. That's not to say I was looking for a plot to be spoon fed to me, it's just that some artsy filmography I like and some I don't. The middle of the film however--dealing with A.I. in the early days before we referred to it as A.I.--was groundbreaking, trendsetting, and astounding. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is without doubt a classic of the highest order.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
33,neil-476,Late to the party,8,23 March 2010,"Strictly speaking, I should have been in the queue for 2001 when it was first released - aged 16 and a major science fiction fan, I can't understand how come I missed it, and didn't pick it up until a cinema re-release 6 years later, when I saw it 3 times in 3 days.You can take it that I really liked it.The intervening years have cooled me down somewhat. I still like eye candy, but we're spoiled for it these days. I still like spacecraft and sci-fi generally, but ditto.And this leaves me looking at 2001 solely on its own merits.When I saw it in the 70s, I had read Clarke's short story The Sentinel shortly before, and I therefore had a pretty good idea of what the story was. Standing back and looking at the movie and imagining myself in the position of someone coming to it cold, it must have been a nightmare. I guess it would be possible to figure out the link between the monoliths, although possibly not until encountering the one on the moon - fabulous though the jump-cut from bone to orbiting satellite may be, I'm not sure it actually explains anything. The Jupiter mission is straightforward enough, but the final sequence is baffling to anyone not in the know.This was not a friendly film to offer to the general public although, to be fair, there is no reason why it should have been. I read aggressively defensive comments disparaging those who have trouble with the movie because it does not offer a readily comprehensible narrative, and I find myself thinking that, while there is no reason why Kubrick should have done so - his choice, and I respect that - it is perfectly understandable for members of the film-going public to be a little bemused not to find the narrative they expected. People expect things to be explained and, to some extent, it is perverse not to make that explanation available given that it exists.For all that, this is trailblazing stuff from an effects point of view, with a stunning vocal performance from Douglas Rains.By the way, count me among those who think Kubrick took it at rather too leisurely a pace.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
34,evanston_dad,The Best Movie I Never Want to See Again,8,30 September 2005,"I used to think ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was a Great Movie, but now I'm not so sure. Now that I've seen it a few times, I feel like I've gotten all there is to be gotten from it, and the thought of sitting down to watch it again triggers my brain to begin thinking of all the other things I could be doing with my time. Is that the sign of a great movie? Shouldn't we be able to revisit great movies again and again and find something fresh about them years after they initially hit the screens? I don't know.Anyway, ""2001"" is at least a terrific movie and an important one. No science fiction film made since can deny the influence of this movie's vision of space. Many of the special effects look more realistic than the computer generated effects of today. And while I defy anyone to truly explain the meaning of this film with confidence (I wonder if even Kubrick could have), it certainly makes you feel *something,* even if you're not sure what that something is.On the first viewing, the pacing of the film seemed stately and fitting for a film about drifting through the cold depths of space; now it just seems ponderous. It's even more pronounced now how little the human actors register in this film, and how HAL (which is just a voice, really) steals the show. And when I was younger and more eager to accept the opinions of film scholars and other purported know-it-alls, I thought the ending was profound and full of meaning; now it seems pretty obtuse and vague.But when it comes right down to it, Kubrick's worst movie is anyone else's masterpiece. His movies never feel comfortable with human emotions, so the fact that this movie could almost exist without humans at all comes as little surprise. His style has always been slow, but it comes as a welcome change from all the frenetic, hyper crap being produced now. And at least this movie makes you think, even if it doesn't provide any answers, which again is more than I can say for most of the movies playing in theatres this weekend.So I may not rate ""2001"" as highly as I once would have, but I fully support its place as one of the most audacious and significant films of all time.Grade: A",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It opens with prehistoric imagery as a tribe of apes discovers a tool called weapon, which introduces the wrath of war. It is a portrayal of man's senseless nature in violence and the inventions we use against one another. Eventually the apes are disturbed by the sudden appearance of a black rectangular object. We are then given a brilliant time lapse as a bone hurls through the air to a cut to a spacecraft. Amazing visual wonders aboard the craft including a computer named Hal that seems to have a mind of its own. Director Stanley Kubrick is brilliant especially having already made Dr. Strangelove and Lolita. Unknown cast include Keir Dullea who attempts to counter Hal but consequently faces the unknown future. William Sylvester is seen making a video call to his daughter before disappearing. Gary Lockwood plays an ill fated astronaut also out to counter Hal. And Daniel Richter is the head ape in the opening tribal footage.

William Sylvester plays an official of US Astronautics in the first hour while Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood play the two functioning astronauts in the second half.Created by Stanley Kubrick (director/writer) and Arthur C. Clarke (writer), ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is an artistic sci-fi film about human evolution, advanced technology, the wonders of space, the routineness of space travel, artificial intelligence and the mystery of extraterrestrial life. It mixes elements of ""Planet of the Apes,"" which debuted over six weeks earlier, with aspects of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture,"" which came out eleven years later and was obviously influenced by this one-of-a-kind movie.It begins with the ""dawn of man"" as a curious introduction before jumping forward to the 21st Century, which has been called the longest flash-forward in cinematic history. The depictions of space travel and life-in-space feel wholly authentic.But ""2001"" is peculiar in that it rejects traditional techniques of narrative cinema and is often a nonverbal experience, which leaves some viewers in awe and others bored. It's not about conventional thrills, but rather disquieting awe. It's not easy entertainment, but meditative, transcendent art. The 1985 sequel, ""2010: The Year We Make Contact,"" is more standard and less ambiguous yet a worthy companion piece.The soundtrack mixes classical compositions, e.g. ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" by Richard Strauss, with four creepy modernistic compositions by György Ligeti. The parts of the movie that utilize the latter pieces really evoke an unsettling sense of the unknown.My favorite part is the astronauts' exchange with HAL, which involves almost an hour of the runtime and is the only part of the film that generates a low-key sense of suspense.Personally, I don't believe that humankind began as apes (rolling my eyes). But, even if this were true, where did the apes come from? Did they just spontaneously manifest by accident? If so, when? How? Biogenesis is a scientific axiom meaning ""life proceeds from life."" So what life form originally created the apes or the simple organisms that supposedly evolved into apes?The film runs 2 hours, 29 minutes.GRADE: A-/B+",2001 - A Space Odyssey

39,zetes,By Light Years the Best Film Ever Made,10,6 April 2000,"2001 warps beyond every other film ever made. I have seen it nearly a dozen times since I first saw it in 1997. I bought it right away on VHS, and when I got DVD, it was the only VHS tape I replaced with a DVD.
So why is it the best film ever made? Simply because it transcends narrative. No other film has really done that. Even surrealist films are rooted in narrative. Avant-guarde films sometimes do not use narrative, but they become only moving paintings. 2001 has narrative, but it never insists on it. It lovingly displays the amazing visuals. The narrative itself makes me feel that humanity could be so much more. Kubrick usually is kind of pessimistic, but at the end of 2001, he shows Dave's transcendence. And he is moving towards Earth to bring the rest of humanity with him. Although it shows the state of humanity as it exists now as violent and unsympathetic to the plight of others, it shows hope for our future. I have a rather large complaint about how some people look at this film, though. The introductory comment to this film on this site mentions understanding it more since that person has read the novel. This is all misinformation! Kubrick was inspired by the Clarke short story ""The Sentinal,"" which I have read. It is not really worth it. If you've ever seen Clarke on The Discovery Channel's ""Mysteries of the Unknown"" or whatever it's called, you know how pompous he is. The visions in 2001 are completely Kubrick's. Arthur C. Clarke was just a trampoline off which he jumped. The novel is not an original. It was written alongside with the film, and it was published afterwards. The university at Champaigne-Urbana celebrated Hal's birth in 1996, the date it gave in the novel. It is 1992 in the film, of course. Those ungrateful losers. That is the difference between a technology nerd and a cineast. Then Clarke completely milked the greatness of this film to make a living. If you want to see how terrible he really is, see the sequel to 2001, 2010, which he wrote. It was so awful that I killed it after 20 minutes. Pay no attention to Clarke and his leech-like behavior to this masterpiece.Those complaints, of course, have nothing to do with the actual film. To me, it is the most inspirational film ever made. I would watch it over anything. infinite/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
40,Sylviastel,This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.,8,1 March 2018,I first tried to watch this film on a long flight from Hong Kong to London but I never saw the middle. The film is beautifully short by Stanley Kubrick and crew. He was definitely a master in beautiful colors and scenes. My problems with the film is the lack of storyline. The movie seems endless at times with the lack of storyline and the pacing of it. I know it's a masterpiece by film standards. The shots and visuals are enough to make me watch it again just not so soon. Kubrick was one of my favorite film directors who wasn't afraid to take risks and challenges. Keir Dullea was fabulous in the movie though. I believe the film needs to be on the big screen to be fully appreciated for its glory.,2001 - A Space Odyssey

Even when I first watched this, walking in with no familiarity, I was bewildered, but still couldn't look away. It asks huge questions and let's the viewer come up with their own answer (that's a gamble; rarely does it come off just right). Different interpretations of the film's meaning abound. Unconventional is a great way to describe this.But when all is said and done, it's an adventure, as grand as they come; space travel, artificial intelligence, evolution, the unknown It's one of my favorite movies, and I'm always pleased to see it being screened at revival houses. And if you happen on one showing this in 70mm, pounce on it; the argument can be made that ""2001"" relies less on plot and more on sight and sound, which means people aren't kidding when they say this is an experience.10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
42,SimonJack,"A far advanced sci-fi film for its day, with fiction far beyond science",7,15 October 2021,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" clearly has excellent sets showing the material and equipment aspects of space travel. For that part of this film, the research and study by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur Clarke, and the input sought from NASA and other expert sources, was exemplary. The basic scenes of space craft and travel are very accurate and realistically portrayed. That part, and the general screenplay of space travel, are excellent. One might think of this as the first element of this movie.The second element is an interesting, if haunting, picture of a computer that can ""reason"" itself into control of a space mission to the point of committing murder. I don't recall ever having heard or read much attention given to that aspect among the critics when this film came out, or since then. Yes, there is considerable comment about HAL, but little thought is given to a ""thinking"" computer that commits murder. This second element constitutes the largest portion of the film. The interplay between the space crew - Dr. Dave Bowman mostly, makes up more than half of the film.The third element is what gets the most attention, it seems, by everyone; yet it takes up the smallest portion of the film. Depending on who's critique one considers, this aspect of the film is described as artistic, imaginative, futuristic, psychedelic, incoherent, bizarre, weird, nonsensical..... The descriptives go on and on.The history of this film is interesting in itself. When it premiered, a significant number of people walked out during the show. It received more criticism than praise by critics and later commentors noted that many people were smoking ""strange cigarettes"" in the theaters. The reference was to psychedelic reactions or ""trips"" high on drugs. The film was further edited with Kubrick cutting nearly 20 minutes from the quite long show, and it was released, then re-released, and released again over the next few years. The film didn't cover its budget in the first go round, but by repeated releases it eventually made a considerable profit. Kubrick had words for the harsh critics of the film, especially in New York. He said they were ""dogmatically atheistic and materialistic and earthbound.""These decades later, the film has been viewed much more positively. Film historians, critics and movie buffs have offered all sorts of explanations and dissections of the film, especially the highly fictional last aspect. The visuals of Bowman's experience, whether something he is supposed to be really seeing within the movie, or purely imagining, are very colorful, quick, and tossed together. It is a kaleidoscope of fiction. It might be how one could imagine a drug trip as someone who has had such tries to explain it to someone who hasn't.Among the various comments about the film are that it is a type of Odyssey, borrowing from Homer's ""Odyssey."" Some see religious reincarnation or new worlds. Others see any number of philosophical connections.I don 't know about any of that, or if Kubrick and Clarke actually borrowed or intended any such connections. Anyone who can recall their imagining something in the future - space travel, adventures, great achievements or conquests, etc., can understand how the fictional life portrayals at the end could be imagined. Why not? It's fiction.I suspect that the early dislike for this film by many was a reaction from expectations about an interesting, exciting and intriguing adventure in space. Something along the order of ""The Martian"" of 2015. So, when the film so slowly plods along with the computer interacting with the crew and they one-by-one get eliminated, it no doubt felt more like a mystery in space than a sci-fi film. Anyway, the fictional time warps and aspects like that that this film gets into at the end have been aspects of other sci-fi films since then, most notably in various sequels of the ""Star Trek"" films.For the technical and scientific portrayals and qualities, this film is exceptional for its day. In sci-fi, I prefer more of the space challenges and adventure types of films, rather than the fictional off-the-chart speculations about time warps, and far out concepts. While this is a good film that some may enjoy, it's not likely that many in the 21st century culture that seeks faster and faster games and excitements would sit still very long for this slow film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
43,StevePulaski,A film that will grow with you,10,23 April 2014,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a rare movie experience, one of mesmerizing visuals, meticulous craft, full of valuable interpretations, and a work to stand the test of time. Even as computer-generated imagery (CGI) has given animation, action films, and fantasy pictures an antiseptic sleekness and a practical way to showcase certain unforeseen sequences as if they could really happen, films like Star Trek: A Motion Picture, its corresponding TV series, and 2001: A Space Odyssey existed in a time where amateurish special effects where what was predominately available. Director Stanley Kubrick and the studio of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), however, found sources to provide beautiful and limitless cinematography and special effects work in order to bring space into theaters all over the world. This achievement alone is enough to warrant 2001's placement amongst some of the most important films of all time.That's just what 2001 is - one of the most significant films ever made. Its use of special effects is incredible, its themes ranging from existentialism to human and mankind's value in the face of excelling technology, its developed and authentic style showcasing space exploration, and its use of detailed visuals all make its placement on such a list a worthy one. Too many people get caught up in trying to find ""the best"" films that they forget about the ones that made splashes, which circumvented into impacts, game-changers, and iconic works. 2001 is an iconic work from a director who, had he never touched cinema, may've set cinema back several years.The film is divided into four vignettes that detail man's interactions with advanced and incalculably valuable Monoliths, otherwise known as high-powered machines that do much of the thinking for humans when it comes to space travel and exploration. The first vignette concerns ""the dawn of man,"" following ape-like beings trying to find food in a vast desert, the second concerns passengers aboard a Pan-AM space plane that learn of an epidemic occurring at one of the Lunar bases they're destined to come in contact with, the third and longest shows a group of scientists traveling aboard the spacecraft ""Discovery One,"" joined by the advanced, supercomputer HAL 9000, a machine that should be helping them on their journey to Jupiter but instead seems to be hindering them, and the fourth concerns Jupiter and beyond.Each of these vignettes could easily spawn individual reviews, and because of that, it's difficult to look at 2001: A Space Odyssey as an entire project. In one-hundred and forty-eight minutes, the film manages to be often enthralling, wondrous, and on occasions, maddening, as some scenes shine and other scenes seem to drag. But all is well, as there is always something occurring in Kubrick's realm of directorial flair and Geoffrey Unsworth's unmatchable cinematography.With all the praise 2001's visuals have earned, it seems like nothing more than a waste of time to address them once again, but they must be. Unsworth's detail is simply exquisite, whether he is showing the vast openness and emptiness of space or he is showing the calculated quarters of these large and sometimes quite ominous spacecrafts. Pay attention to Kubrick and Unsworth's use of the color red, as it often is used to denote fear, vulnerability, and uncertainty. In addition, consider some of the unique and trickier visual sequences, such as the famous Star-Gate scene, where thousands and thousands of colors hit the screen at once, causing a mass amount of pressure and unbelievable visual annihilation on ones retinas. The scene was accomplished thanks to slit-scan photography, which is where a slide that has been slit is inserted between the camera and the camera's subject, resulting in a disorienting but indescribably beautiful and unique work of art.Because of 2001's plethora of visual techniques, along with its lengthy runtime, there's a lot to see but also a lot of detail to miss in terms of sights and themes. With this being my first viewing, I was astounded by how useless and void of significance the human characters are in this film. They essentially have no value outside of being devices for which the Monoliths and the technology work off of. This is quite the bleak future Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C. Clarke.2001: A Space Odyssey works the best when there is no dialog or character interaction and we're left to focus on a spacecraft drifting in the cold loneliness of space or we're watching the stars sit amongst the darkness. This is cinema at its most meditative and beautiful, especially with the wonderful score that chimes in at just the right times. The film goes down in my book for one of the best uses of a particular piece of music, in this case, the film's frequent use of ""The Blue Danube."" There's so much in 2001: A Space Odyssey, between its visuals, its score, its themes, and its commentary, that it easily warrants more viewings, which I plan to get on in the future. This is the kind of film I can see doing different things for me at different points in my life. Perhaps a second viewing will assure its themes, which I'm still trying to grasp and understand, become more vivid and clearer, where maybe a viewing when I'm an adult affirms realities about the world around us. I'm optimistic for the film to progressively get more insightful and more enriching as time goes on; that's one thing many modern, big-budget films boasting grandiose visuals and effects have a difficult time with.Starring: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, and Douglas Rain. Directed by: Stanley Kubrick.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I mean, I saw this movie when I was a kid, and I didn't like it. Now, I have a growing appreciation for movies, and I wanted to write a comment from a more grown up point of view. I had 2 hours to spare and I watched this movie, I swear I nearly went insane. I normally put on the subtitles, in case I miss something or misunderstand the dialoug, 89% of the movie is silent! Apes?! I could just go to the zoo and say I saw this movie! I could watch ""Star Wars"" and say I saw this movie! It's the same friggin' thing. I'm not trying to be so harsh on this film, but how can anyone find this entertaining?! How?! Unless you are 150 years old, that is the only way I could understand. Geez, people. This movie is so out dated and needs to be thrown away, especially from the top 250! Why are so many bad movies on top 250?! I'm getting sick of these over hyped movies! 1/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
45,blanbrn,Well done imagery. A film that was well made during it's time period(1968).,7,29 June 2007,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" made in 1968 is a film that really done a good job to show a glimpse into the future the imagery, and scenes with special effects are beautiful another thumbs up for Stanley Kubrick. The special effects shown are super making one feel that space is a magical place, and Kubrick even played with the viewer when the screen goes totally black with the music playing as the viewers mind starts to wonder. And from the start by showing the dawn of civilization with the apes this film started with a message to show how times and history changes man and especially the future of technology just remember up in space the talking computer! Really a wonderful made film for the year 1968, it did a good job by showing how some of the future would be especially the rise of technology and how dependent that man became on it. A film of great visual image and effect.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
46,MovieAddict2016,I admire its theatrical scope but it has not aged well at all,10,19 January 2004,"I bought Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" on DVD along with the (far superior) ""Clockwork Orange."" I have watched it since I was a child and admire this movie for its theatrical scope - as a movie buff, this is a milestone for me and my viewing experience because it is a breakthrough in narrative and for that reason alone I am thankful. I will always remember it and always take it into mind as one of the best examples of a director holding an audience and controlling them in his grip.But (and this is a huge ""but"") it has not aged well over the years. Many of its scenes that depict space travel had audiences sprawled in awe - it was the first feature film to really depict outer space as something realistic (and man hadn't even landed on the moon yet!). But compared to today's films, it is not very good. It is corny, overlong and unrealistic. Back then, it was a reason to see the film. Now, it's not impressive at all. This may seem ignorant, but think about it for a minute - why should we praise a film for being ""the first of its kind"" when other films have come along and done the same thing, much better?I understand doing this to a certain extent - but to say ""2001"" is great solely because of its effects and for being ""the first"" is silly, as far as I see it, because much of it now just isn't very good. Cinema elitists enjoy explaining the reason it is still ""great"" because of its effects. The point they seem to always bring up is ""...at the time of its release..."". I understand this but _now_ it is no longer fascinating as it's been done many times since.Kubrick is too fascinated with long empty passages of nothingness. It's like some self-indulgent ego-trip - take the opening for example. Four minutes (!) of absolutely nothing occurring on screen, just eerie music. Finally it opens, like some sort of epic opera and we are shown the planet's eclipse with the famous soundtrack, etc.I find this incredibly poor storytelling, not because I think it's ""boring"" or ""too slow"" but because it is pointless. I admire long movies (""Once Upon a Time in America"" 4-hour version is wonderful) but ""2001"" has many scenes that go on endlessly, needlessly. There's a difference between slowness (any Leone film will be) but at least Leone uses this as a canvass for exploring something - Kubrick, many times in this particular film (and maybe only this film), doesn't really ""show"" us anything meaningful. It's like we're staring at a moving spacecraft for two minutes. I check my watch at three minutes when the music is starting to tell us it may be over soon and I think, ""Did that in any way actually improve the story itself, or show us anything useful?""No. It's basically bragging to the audience - ""look how good it looks."" Problem is it looks like crap nowadays.The critics tend to love this long nothingness because of its artistic merits. And I somewhat understand this - I can understand praising ""2001"" for its uniqueness, its powerful narrative. But the fact of the matter is that as a movie it's simply not very good because of this! It has dated very poorly. E.g. the space station segments - they are one of the only moments in the film with extensive dialogue. The ""futuristic"" suits are laughably '60s-ish and some of the ideas in the movie about communication via video, etc. are ludicrous.That happens in any movie after a certain amount of time, but ""2001"" almost entirely depends upon this. I feel the actual story itself is weak. Kubrick is at a loss for anything useful so he delays it by continually showing us exterior shots of spacecraft and planets in tune with classical pieces.It just gets to be too much after a while.This all said, please understand I am not putting down this movie. I still admire it very much for what it is and will watch it for years to come. But as a piece of entertainment, as a movie...I find it poor and self-indulgent on Kubrick's behalf. It lacks the satirical bite of ""A Clockwork Orange."" The end sequence is horribly outdated with drug-trip visuals (it was rumored to have been one of the movies stoners would go see on a regular basis!). Like everything in this movie, it goes on too long - look at ""Easy Rider"" and ""Midnight Cowboy."" Both have '60s/'70s druggie sequences but both end before becoming intolerable - ""2001"" goes on too long...My review may seem very incomplete, ignorant and contradictory but if I had to explain it all in summary I'd just say this: ""2001"" is a piece of art, but it is not a good movie in any way. I have seen art house films with better plots (""Punch-Drunk Love,"" ""Magnolia"") and more involving stories. ""2001"" is a showcase for special effects and directorial styles - but now it is very outdated and alienating and this is my biggest problem with it. I can't rate this movie because I would rate it 5/5 in some ways, but very low in others. As a movie it's simply not very good - as a breakthrough/unique art-house type picture it's a great example of how a director can control a movie to the fullest.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
47,Red-Barracuda,A truly landmark achievement,10,29 March 2010,"Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the great examples of cinematic art. Images and sound are combined faultlessly to tell a story that is simultaneously very simple and extremely abstract. Although there are some enormous concepts at the heart of this movie, equally important is how aesthetically and aurally beautiful it all is.The film opens with the epic sound of Richard Strauss's Thus Spoke Zarathustra, which heralds the alignment of the planets in the solar system in a single unbroken line. This unique stellar occurrence signals the first interaction of the mysterious extra-terrestrial beings with the inhabitants of planet Earth. This is the Dawn of Man. The moment at which an alien hand subtly interacts with the primitive life on our planet and sets a seed that will ultimately lead them on the way to technological advancement and through that to an understanding of the universe that will prepare them for the next level of evolution. The way in which these mysterious beings kick-start this human advancement is simplicity itself. They plant a giant black rectangular monolith in their midst. This completely unnatural edifice has a curious effect on the primitive creatures who encounter it. The appearance of the razor sharp lines and perfect symmetry of the dimensions, along with the strange feeling of touching its un-naturally flat surface has an odd effect on these ape-men. It is a trigger. It is the first time these primitive minds have been forced to experience an abstract thought. The very exposure to something so alien and unnatural forces them to start viewing their world in a slightly different way, firstly leading to the use of bones as weaponry. Soon these meek creatures are the masters of their land and on their way to complete dominance of their planet.The natural result of this process is technological advancement and this leap forward is illustrated with one of the most audacious edits in film history when the first man made tool – a bone – is inter-cut with an example of a highly complex human construction: a spaceship. The point has been made that high-level human technological advancement has resulted as a direct consequence of the first encounter with the mysterious black monolith. At this point it becomes clear that Kubrick is using music very specifically. As we watch the space-transporter float through space and dock with the revolving space-station the music that soundtracks this is Johann Strauss's The Blue Danube. This beautiful, complex piece of classical music indicates aurally the advancement of man too, in terms of high artistic cultural achievement. This is in direct contrast to the avant-garde music that plays whenever the alien presence is felt. This mysterious experimental wall of sound perfectly invokes an alien intelligence. It builds up to a crescendo every time the monolith appears; climaxing unforgettably in the trip through the star-gate. This music simply represents alien interaction.It has to be said at this point too that the design work used for both the exterior and interior of the spacecrafts in 2001 is exemplary and frankly has not aged in the 40 years plus since the film's initial release; a remarkable fact considering the advances in special effects. There is something still undeniably beautiful and fantastic about how the hardware is presented in this film. This leads on to another of the key themes – what happens when man-made technology becomes so advanced that it starts to develop its own consciousness. When HAL decides to take over the mission to Jupiter in an icily cold and deadly way, this question is posed directly. And the answer is that mankind has to be very careful with technology, as the results could be deadly. In the same way as Man is shaped by the aliens, HAL is created by Man, and, similarly, it has a propensity to murder if the situation requires it.After the man vs. technology segment the film enters its final act. This is the famous star gate sequence where the final surviving astronaut, Dave Bowman, arrives at Jupiter just at the moment that the planets align once again in a straight line. A third black monolith satellite then opens the star gate and Bowman travels through in a visually spectacular sequence. Via this trip Bowman gains an acute understanding of the formation of the universe, the creation of stars and galaxies. He is then transported into a version of our world created by the aliens; in here he quickly grows older and older until he dies and is reborn as the star-child. Through him man has been taken to the next level of existence.2001: A Space Odyssey is a masterpiece of cinema. It is one of the very few films that can claim to be pure science fiction. Its dramatics are sparse and its pace is slow. But it needs this deliberate pace to accentuate its scope. It makes you feel the vastness and loneliness of space and the mysteries it conceals. And it openly invites you to immerse yourself in the beauty of it all. It's a crowning achievement in showing what cinema can be as a pure art-form. This is certainly not a film for everyone, its themes are so big that it lacks the human touch that some may feel is important. For me this is not a concern as by immersing myself in this film I am able to truly feel the mysterious nature of our solar system and the universe in general, and as well as being a visual tour-de-force, it always leaves me with questions and not just answers. And I like that.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
48,Rainey-Dawn,Timeless Classic,10,2 July 2014,"2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is another brilliant and thought provoking film dealing with the interesting topic ""the circle of life"" - dealing with humanity's primitive primate state. The movie will take you on an adventure throughout time and space that is not quite like any other science fiction story.2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is considered to be a movie masterpiece - and rightfully so. It is a timeless movie that all lovers of science fiction and science facts should enjoy. It is also a movie that all movie connoisseurs should see - the film is a classic.2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a movie I can watch again and pick up something different with each viewing.On another note: The movie's theme by Alex North is one of the best and most memorable film scores... it's just as much of a powerful classic as the film itself.10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey

50,thesar-2,"Meanwhile, 2001 Minutes Later",3,25 April 2013,"I think Lex Luthor said it best: ""Some people can read War and Peace and come away thinking it's a simple adventure story. Others can read the ingredients on a chewing gum wrapper and unlock the secrets of the universe."" I'm part of the first example there, while most find 2001: A Space Odyssey a masterpiece in filmmaking. And no doubt whatsoever: the cinematography, score and way-ahead-of-its-time space adventure is perfect. I will stand behind that statement throughout this review. But, sadly, those are the only positives I could come up with for this incredibly long and simple film.Before I continue, I must warn: this contains spoilers. I say this, because, as of tonight, April 24, 2013, I had never viewed 2001: A Space Odyssey before and I attempted to avoid as many spoilers as possible. So, if you haven't yet experienced this, watch at your own risk and then continue.Previously, I proclaimed that ""I attempted to avoid as many spoilers as possible."" Sadly, with a movie that has been talked about, researched and inspired countless of ideas/movies over the decades, it's hard to not view some of the key scenes, listen to the wall-played classical-music score or learn of the film's characters (HAL 9000, anyone?) Well, nothing I've seen, heard or learned prepared me for the absoluteslowestmovieIhaveEVER SEEN.The movie begins in darkness, for a few minutes. Sure, I heard music, but nothing on the screen. Quite literally, I thought my BluRay disc was damaged.(Oh, sorry. Backing up a bit: Since I've never seen this before and it's deemed a ""classic,"" why not watch it for the first time on the excellent BluRay format? That, however, wasn't my first intention, actually. I wanted to purchase The Shining on BluRay, but after pricing the disc, I found, for just a few dollars more, there was a triple feature of The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey and A Clockwork Orange. I've already seen numbers one and three, but heck, why not experience my initial reaction to 2001: A Space Odyssey on BluRay? Purchase: made.)Just when I was about to give up, the infamous primate scene emerged. Well, okay, not quite yet. Enter in many landscaping scenes and then about 20 minutes of zero dialogue and primates eating, drinking and eventually enamored by a good sized monolith, or black rectangular prism. Many years later, Wall-E would attempt the same feat with its opening act without a shred of dialogue. Pixar was much more successful in keeping my interest.I digress. Fast-forwarding to (oh, what year was this based in, again?) the ""far-distant future"" while retaining the styles and dialogue of the 1960s, doctors embark on a mission of wonder of said monolith (now, ??) on the moon. Without explaining too much and opening up way too many doors, we will fast-forward again, but now, on a mission of wonder to Juniper. Only this time, we, well, 1960s American Audiences, get their first taste of later-down-the-road Android Ash from Alien. Apparently, after a communication breakdown – literally, HAL/ASH must complete the mission even when the humans are wiser to him.This should make me laugh, but like the opening 2-3 minutes of nothing, the movie chose to keep in the merciful INTERMISSION the audience was blessed with back in 1968. And I almost did laugh, thinking this snail-moving movie needed one. But, after a few minutes, I was tempted to fast-forward myselfsomething I never do while watching movies for the first time. Finally, what followed turned out to the most acid-tripped and psychedelic third act I've ever seen.Now, I didn't necessarily rate down the movie for the, what we call today: a cheap screensaver, because these are aliens and in their minds back then, anything's possible. But, what followed proves to me: Director Kubrick was on drugs. He had to have been. Truly.If you do travel down this hallucinatory journey, you'll see what I saw, or what I couldn't believe any more if Godzilla miraculously had showed up and explained, in English, verses his native Japanese tongue, what the last third of this movie meant.I fully understand where this movie was coming from and the year it was released, but what I couldn't get past were some basic and major flaws:A> Computer program HAL 9000 controlled the entire ship, and even the vessel to kill one of the men who wanted to shut him downbut couldn't control the second shuttle when another man wanted to rescue the obviously dead astronaut? Or, further, he failed to control the temperature, pressure or live-support when said ""hero"" returns to the ship and goes to deactivate the deadly computer program?B> People of Earth, or higher-ups, that is, wanted to make first contact with the alien race that ""faced"" Jupiter's planet from Earth's moon. So, they programmed HAL 9000 to make sure the ship got there. The first sign of trouble was a transmission breakdown and HAL 9000 thought best to let it fail with ""hopes"" of fixing it later. If the higher-ups wanted to both explore the alien race and document it, wouldn't it be a top priority be to keep the communication up and running?C> Since I've never been to space, nor plan to, it's hard to prove this is a flaw: when one character decides to venture into the vacuum of space without adequate protection, albeit briefly, he's perfectly fine. Even though, I GUESS this could work, it was hard to get past and take the rest of the movie seriously.The movie's based on a short story, and it shows. It's an extremely thin plot stretched to the max. While I appreciate the scope of this project, especially the timeframe of release, I do not believe it holds up today. I'm glad it inspired numerous other projects, because it takes one good idea to make the future better.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
51,FeastMode,my notes,3,30 June 2019,"This movie had some good directing, some innovative concepts, and some remarkably impressive scenes for being filmed in 1968. There were a bunch of scenes where I was really wondering how they pulled that off in 1968, especially the zero gravity and artificial gravity scenes. This movie clearly influenced many future Sci-Fi movies. Even with all that, I really hated this movie. I hated it more than a 1.5 but I had to give it credit for what I mentioned before. I was SOOOOO BORED. There were points in the movie when I wanted to cry from how bored I was. Every scene was overdone, every scene went on too long.the acting was horrendous, there was no character development. The dialogue was abysmal. the narrative and pacing were discombobulated. there wasn't much of a plot and the story doesn't make any sense. It just makes up a bunch of madness and uses lots of symbolism and metaphors, hoping you will chalk it up to an ""ambiguous"" ending. screw that. this movie was garbage.what takes real skill is being this ambitious and making it actually make sense. Interstellar does this perfectly. And I know everyone will say that interstellar got so much inspiration from this movie, which it clearly did, both based on the similarities and Christopher Nolan saying he loves this movie. But Interstellar took some ambitious concepts and made a real, all-around great movie out of them. (1 viewing)

There was a 3 minute long intro with a black screen and music playing. The dawn of man intro was almost 20 minutes long with no dialogue. The first dialogue was spoken 26 minutes into the movie. And we didn't really get much of it excluding some long monologues. We also had about 15 minutes of trippy colors with no dialogue or indication as to wtf was happening.When Dave realizes Hal killed the other astronaut and has decided to leave him to die, he doesn't seem concerned, or afraid, or distraught.

52,ElMaruecan82,"An intelligent masterpiece, victim of its own greatness ...",8,4 October 2010,"2001 is the perfect example of a movie I wanted -as a movie fan- to love but I couldn't, I didn't hate it either and I still consider HAL-9000's part as one of the most thrilling sequences from any Sci-Fi film.A strange feeling inhabits me when I watch this film, I feel so alone that it's like it tunnels me into the deepest side of my soul, which is my innate condition as a mortal and my instinctive fear of death. The death scene in this movie is the greatest depiction of whatever death would look like, a hypnotically scary immensity of nothingness, that's what space is all about : death. 2001 is a movie about space, space as death, death as loneliness, and loneliness as our Human Condition.There's no eating, no feeling, no loving, no caring in this films, even the 'little girl' sequence seems so 'badly done', I mean unlike Kubrick's usual work, these things that are so important for us, poor mortal souls, seem so futile and pointless in 2001, because space is death. But space is also synonym of escape and quest, quest for immortality by escaping our human condition, it's like the key of 'immortality' is our dehumanization, a dream impossible to reach, because the alternative of our mortality isn't depicted as being a machine, but being a God-like figure, like Dave, when he was ""terminating"" Hal-9000.God created men in his own image like men created HAL, the most intelligent creature/creation after man, but HAL exploited his own intelligence to kill his own creator, like men use their powers to kill God by killing the spirit of God that lives in their hearts, the spirit of God being the emotions, the feelings, love, compassion, everything that separate us from animals. I've always considered the relationship between Dave and HAL as an allegory of our humanity, and that's what makes the movie so depressing and pessimistic, our humanity is characterized by our intelligence, a double-edged sword, and our feelings so useless (in Dave's situation) when compared to the cold and monolithic death, this duality, feelings and intelligence is what makes things happen whereas death is nothing but nothingness and immobility, and unfortunately, it's the only certitude (even the existence of God is debatable)The movie is an invitation to contemplate a death-like world that would strongly remind us of our human condition, it's a quest for an unreachable immortality, because as powerful as we are, we can't become God, like HAL failed to become the only Master of the Vessel, becoming a machine is renouncing to our feelings, which is the key for self-destruction and annihilation of the humanity, and feelings are as useless as a drop of water in the desert of fate, Dave lived a long time but ultimately died. But as useless as feelings are and as dangerous as intelligence is, they're our most precious assets, what characterizes us the most as human, we can't become God, we can't become machines, we're only humans and our future is nothing less than our origins, our quest for immortality lead us to reconsider our conditions as mortal, but also highlights our miraculous condition as living creatures, life is a miracle, death implies life and vice versa, the beautiful shot of the fetus at the end invites us to forget about our individual death but think of us as an 'immortal' species, as an extraordinary civilization that reached immortality through intelligence combined with feelings : culture, ideas, arts, creations, beauty and Universality. The key of Immortality is Universality, to think of ourselves as humans, not as individuals since the Creator is the only immortal individuality, we can become God-like only as a collectivity, as the Humanity, Creator of its own Civilization.The movie is a masterpiece, one of the most intelligent and probably the most universal films ever made, (why intelligent? because it makes so many points with a few dialogs and action) but it is victim of its own greatness because Kubrick couldn't make his point in a different way, he's a great director and found the right tone, and the perfect visuals ... that's why I felt bored so many times, Death is a hypnotically scary immensity of nothingness, the movie had a hypnotic beauty, was thrilling and scary during the HAL's sequence, was immense by its dimension, beauty and philosophical value and many times, there was just emptiness, nothing special happened, because that's the way it is, sometimes, nothing DOES happen and in death, nothing will ever happen. The point of the movie, was its strength and its strength was its weakness. There are so many beautiful shots in this film, so many stunning sequences, an incredible score, but it was impossible for the movie to be so universally intelligent and entertaining in the same time.The Beauty of 2001 is like men's intelligence, a double edged sword, and its genius is as unreachable as immortality... all I can say is that I ""get"" it, but I can't get it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
53,paul2001sw-1,A ballet in space,8,10 January 2004,"Surely the oddest blockbuster ever made, '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a testament both to the remarkable ambition of its director, Stanley Kubrick, and also to the spirit of an age.  Unlike almost every other science fiction film before or since, Kubrick chooses to play it slow, building an atmosphere instead of spoiling us with action: spaceships (presumably plastic models, in an age preceding computer-made effects) dance ballets while the phenomenon of zero-gravity is represented in a manner that would surely have been familiar to M. C. Escher.  With immense audacity, Kubrick allows  us almost no dialogue for the first half an hour (except for a few words spoken by, of all people, Leonard Rossiter!); and throughout the film, he conspires masterfully against his audience, daring to keep us in the dark about what is really going on.  It does have to be said that the ending inspires David Lynch style misgivings (the final revelation is only that there is no resolution); but as with a Lynch film, this film transcends the logical purpose of plot.The film is also interesting because of when it was made, just before the first moon landings, in an age when optimism in technological progress was probably at its height.  It's easy to laugh at the dated aesthetics of ""the future"" as rendered in this film, but also mistaken: the whole point is that '2001' is not set in ""a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away"" but in a medium term that is in fact already past.  Man made it to the moon within just 24 years of inventing the jet engine: '2001' represents an imaginative peek beyond the limits our (then apparently rapidly expanding) horizons. That willingness to look beyond is what lifts the film above cheap futurology and keeps it fresh, even in 2004.  Arguably Kubrick's best film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
54,gbill-74877,Masterpiece,10,21 February 2019,"Absolutely brilliant.I'm probably not going to say anything that hasn't already been said a million times before, but I loved:HAL. What extraordinary moments and interactions these are - that voice, those tight shot on HAL's cold all-seeing 'eye', the slow realization that HAL is up to something. In an age that wonders about what robots and AI will lead to, this was well ahead of its time.The special effects. With big moments and lots of little touches Kubrick transports us to space, whether it's spinning, floating, or drifting, and it all holds up very well 50 years later.The symmetry of 'The Dawn of Man' bookended with 'Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.' Early man reaching up to a mysterious monolith and take the first crude step in evolving; modern man reaching a distant monolith and seeing things far beyond his understanding, and maybe taking another step at evolving? There are other parallels; we go from early man using an animal femur as a club to kill early on, to Dave quietly killing HAL by unplugging him/it. We go from tight shots on HAL's eye to Dave's as he tries to fathom the psychedelic mind-blowing experience.The score. So well chosen, starting with the epic sound of Strauss's 'Also sprach Zarathustra'.The scope. Man reaches for the stars, into the unknown, so vulnerable in the vastness of the universe, and also vulnerable to his own technology. The scale is cosmic, and we see that the jump from early man to man in space really was as sudden as the jump in the film. It explores man's place and fate in the universe, but is wisely ambiguous and open to interpretation.The aesthetic. It all goes so well together. The visual appeal, the use of grand music and silence, it's all very poetic, and there is great attention to detail. The all-black monolith, such a perfect symbol that there is greater knowledge out there, but hard to comprehend. There is such a unifying, artistic vision Kubrick brought to this film.I saw it when younger a few times, and was put off a little bit by its slow pace. I think it's perfect now.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This film is not made to entertain, but to awe and inspire. This film not only knows how to tell such an amazing story, but this film is widely recognized for it's visual effects. Even in today's computer digital age, I was very impressed. The special effects added a whole new dimension to as what we know as film today. This film is a piece of art and it has many interpretations on what humanity was in the past and will be in the future.Stanley Kubrick's film is a tale spanning many millennia. After a stranger obelisk was discovered by our primate ancestors, we head to a colonized space where a group of astronauts and super-machine HAL embark on a crucial mission to Jupiter.This film doesn't have many big name stars here, practically none at all. Keir Dullea is practically the only person we get to know and he does a pretty good job. He does lots of interacting with HAL and is crucial to the important man vs. machine part of the film.Overall, this is nothing short of perfect. I'm sad there are not any films like this one being made too often. This is a space opera, a mini-horror film, and an awe-inspired film combined in one. The scene involving Keir traveling through the wormhole is just one of the greatest. If you have love for cinema, this should be on the top of your list. It pains me to say that this film will easily bore the average movie-goer, but this is a true work of art. I rate this film 10/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
56,secondtake,"What is Greatness--in movies, over time, from here?",10,14 June 2009,"2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)It seems foolish to write a review of such a widely, and probingly, reviewed film--there are whole books on it, including Arthur C. Clarke's own The Lost Worlds of 2001, and the movie is detailed beautifully on Wikipedia. In short, the movie is so unafraid to touch on the biggest of issues, and to do so without conventional religion, it's totally brave and gripping. It is also technically astonishing--the upside down stewardess, the music, the future and the past so compatible. If you can slow yourself down and just get absorbed, this is a true original, and a really beautiful one.In a fun way, 2001 is a personality sorter. There are those who love to wallow in meaning of life enigmas, and others who want to enjoy life and laugh and cry. I oversimplify to make a point. For those who want to be whisked away on a mind trip without a drop of action- adventure, and end with an LSD-style interior apocalypse, this is the movie of choice. If you require an actual plot, with a conflict between actual humans (and not just a droning computer antagonist), then hesitate.So, if it's a great movie for me, is it completely overrated to someone else? And can I get that? Well, yes, I can see how it might bore someone completely. Completely. So for my kind of personality, it must connect to something else that really matters. I saw it in the theater when I was ten, in 1968, and it gloriously shook me up, maybe even changed my life. I am sure I was already a good agnostic (a ten year old agnostic being what it is) and so the ambiguity about the meaning of the universe in 2001 was awfully disturbing. It both confirmed the impossibility of knowing anything beyond our own world, and it made me love the beauty of every moment that we have, now, while it's here. Whether it helped form an impressionable boy or just paralleled his inner nature, I can't say. So I loved it, and love it. The movie is elegant, dreamy, spacey (yeah), and trippy. It can't be watched indifferently, but unlike a shocking movie, this demands not a reaction but an immersion. That's me. I like to wallow.A good friend who loves many of the movies I do hates 2001, along with Pauline Kael (who gets hung up on the evolution/reincarnation issue) and other smart, open-minded, movie-loving reviewers. Such is the status of 2001. But my friend, as deep as he is, is a social person, and he loves human interaction and plot much more than philosophical excess. Why would he like the simple nothingness of this movie, which is nearly a silent movie from start to finish? What, beyond individual taste, in some broader, universal way, makes a great movie? The absence of a few terrible reactions. The presence of astonishing ones? Is greatness in art, music, literature--any creative work simultaneously held high as a shining example and held down for critical analysis--always relative? It doesn't seem like it. Some movies really are better, otherwise, what are we to make of 100 best film lists, or film studies programs devoted to Kane and Potemikin and The Godfather? The brilliant, innovative, risk-taking minds and bodies who poured themselves into 2001 really did have some edge on the less brilliant, less innovate people involved in other films, whatever they are. I'm not talking money here, or even expected creativity--that weird quality of knowing what pretends to be creative and achieving the look, but not the essence of originality. There are qualities that can be circled in a great movie: 1) something never remotely seen before, 2) something taken to the far edge of beauty, and 3) something that has resolution, a term we use in art school for work that seems to know what it wants to do and achieves it, regardless of whether you like it or not. A movie is great for me in more personal ways, but I'm asking universally--what makes a movie simply ""great."" I suppose this is stupid, and it's definitely long-winded.And rules are bogus, but maybe these are starting points. It's certainly easy to see what is not successful in this movie, in ordinary terms--the acting is generally atrocious (except the apes, of course), though this might be on purpose. Even the casting is questionable. I've never liked Keir Dullea in his role as the protagonist. This might be Kubrick's little bit of intuitive genius here, because he's picked an actor who has less life than the computer, and he does not undermine the movie even as he is overwhelmed by it. His acting is stretched into the mechanical, underplayed zone as a counterpart to HAL's emotive cunning. As a creative director looking to push movies artistically, Kubrick goes two steps beyond his own epic and stiff Spartacus in a decade when the American movie scene was rediscovering a new humanism and realism through directors like Penn (Bonnie and Clyde, 1967) and Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, 1968), and actor/director Dennis Hopper (Easy Rider, 1969). It stands apart from these, an evolutionary dead end on its own terms, but hugely influential in terms of vision and technique.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

58,Bored_Dragon,I finally saw it on the big screen,10,26 November 2016,"I watched this movie several times at intervals of several years and every time I barely made it to the end. I attributed my inability to like it by saying that I was too young to understand it, that I was not in the right mood, and so on. In the end, I gave up. Until tonight, when I finally got a chance to watch it at a cinema.I gave it one more and last chance...Every cadre of this movie, standing by itself, is a work of art, followed by an excellent sound. Together they build a fantastic atmosphere that in a movie theater has a hypnotizing effect and it compensates for almost complete lack of plot. If I saw this back in the '60s in a theater, I would almost certainly give it 10/10. But watching it at home, on a small screen and without a quality sound system, this hypnotizing effect is lost and what is left is a pretty much boring movie that seems like it would never end. That's why I rated it seven, the average of visually beautiful and audibly genius film, and the fact that I usually give the movies, which I must compel to endure, two, maybe a three. But tonight's experience proved my theory that this movie must be seen in a theater to be fully experienced. After watching it on the big screen, I changed my attitude toward this masterpiece and I'm giving it a ten.P.S. Ending scene, with the baby floating in space, is surely one of the creepiest things in the history of cinematography. Usually, I have nightmares for days after seeing this movie, just because of that damn baby.Objective quality for a movie from the '60s - 10/10
Audio-visual experience - 10/10
Entertainment - 3/10, because it's still boring",2001 - A Space Odyssey
59,851222,Great and exceptional motion picture,9,29 December 2014,"Greetings from Lithuania.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is truly a great and unique motion picture. By saying unique, i mean boldness of this picture. It is great because of many things - truly unique storytelling, simple and at the same time difficult plot, the special effects which in the year 2014 looks great, classical music incorporated with dazzling and breathtaking visuals and a scope larger then life. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is not a trill ride or ""lets grab a popcorn and watch some sci-fi flick"" type of picture. To truly appreciate it, you have to sit down and simply enjoy it - it's like watching a painting, and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a true art. This movie is segmented in parts, and all of them are truly great in they own way. The most sophisticated and after 2nd viewing still unclear to me is the last part, probably for which i'm giving a 9/10 for this classic. I know, art sometimes isn't meant to be understood, but nevertheless, for me it was a bit to much. Overall, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a motion picture, that can truly be called an art. It's never going to get old, even if humankind will reach Jupiter one day, this motion picture will always going to be viewed as a classic art of movie making. It's bold, unique, gorgeous sophisticated and unforgettable.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
60,kenjha,A Snail Odyssey,4,2 June 2009,"Kubrick has made some great films. He also made this drivel - a space film that moves at a snail's pace and has no plot or meaning. The first third of the film, including the never-ending opening sequence with monkeys, is mind-numbingly boring. The last third, a psychedelic trip across space and time, is fascinating - if one's on drugs. Only the middle part, featuring that funny guy HAL 9000, is somewhat interesting. To the masses who adore this indulgent nonsense about monoliths and star babies, it supposedly reveals great truths about life, the universe, and everything. The real truth is that the emperor is not wearing any clothes.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
61,jacobjohntaylor1,The most overrated science fiction of all time,4,5 March 2016,This movie very overrated. The best scenes fiction of all time is Godzilla. This is just hype. It is very slow and the last 20 minutes a confusing. It not as bad as the 1978 remake of Invasion of the body snatchers. But it is not at good. It is not well written. It is very slow past. This movie is a wast of time. It is also a wast of money. Do not see this movie. Do lesson to people who hype it so mush. The Star wars movie are a lot better. The King Kong movie are a lot better. Godzilla is a lot better. Do not see this movie. It is not a good movie. It is a very bad movie. Some people are traveling thou space. And it nothing as good as Star trek. Not even close. The sequel 2010 is a better movie. And that was not a very good movie either.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
62,sol-,My brief review of the film,10,3 January 2005,"A whimsical, often spectacular view of a future in which advances in technology dominate the world. It is well shot and although slow-moving it is intense and enjoyable throughout. The featuring of classical music to establish atmosphere works brilliantly; it provides a feeling of awe, mystery and intrigue  the same aura that Walt Disney worked in creating 'Fantasia'. The special effects, both sound and visual, are still spellbinding by the standards of today's technology. Aside from the technical pluses of the film, it stands strong as it is one of not many films out there that has something important to say about humankind, and where the human race is heading in terms of our increasing reliance on machines and our unquenchable thirst to discover. Despite an ending that is hard to understand, it is even harder to overlook this film a true cinema classic.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Actually, I have a degree in media studies and a great interest in science, science fiction and anything thought-provoking (the technical term is ""need for cognition""). But I am just baffled by this film and why it is so esteemed. It is simply slow, empty and lifeless. When absolutely nothing is happening on screen, am I supposed to feel or think something profound? Even when my professor explicitly explained to me why this film is so great, I still cannot convince myself that it is so.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
64,Movie Nuttball,2001: A Space Odyssey,10,14 September 2004,2001: A Space Odyssey is a terrific film and is one of the greatest! There is so much to this film that there is to much to explain! All of the people in this film are very good. The beginning is a one of the most unique introductions ever in a film in My opinion. The Apes all looked real and the behavior and characteristics were good. The mystery that surrounds everything is fantastic. Hal is really a baddie and I just love the horror and spookiness in some scenes. The special effects are simply beautiful and is arguably the greatest and most realistic looking ever in cinema history! The music is fabulous! Though some of the things in the movie maybe easy to figure out I for one have not figured out everything in this movie. Anyone looking for a superb science fiction mystery then I strongly recommend 2001: A Space Odyssey!,2001 - A Space Odyssey

It all comes together so well in its strange little way.  The first time you see 2001 you come out confused, remembering the way the music and the images fused together, how space travel comes out as a cross between biblical allegory and psychedelic trip, but you want to go back and see it again.  Yes, it can be slow in places.  Yes, the ending is open to interpretation and probably makes no sense.  But the very fact you remember it must make it a good piece of work.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
66,Thanos_Alfie,Sci-Fi era...,8,28 January 2015,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is one of the most famous Sci-Fi movies of all time. In this movie we have a mysterious and obviously artificial object which has been discovered beneath the Lunar surface. So in order to examine this mysterious object humans send their men and an intelligent computer H.A.L. 9000 to succeed on this.I really liked this movie because this movie began something new for those times which I believe was pretty difficult. It did not just open some new horizons but it showed to people something new and succeeded on this. Although is an old movie I have to say that the visual effects were really good if we consider that it was filmed in 70's (won the Oscar of Best Effects, Special Visual Effects). The direction of this movie which made by Stanley Kubrick was simply outstanding.Finally I have to say that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a must see movie which everyone has to watch. This movie if we watch it today we will think that is a simple Sci-Fi movie and nothing more. But do not forget something, when you watch this movie you have to remember how old is it and what represents for those days.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
67,poe426,The Douglas Trumball Show...,10,13 September 2014,"I cite Douglas Trumball (though he was only One of MANY) because HE has gone on to great fame because of what he did in 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY- AND because neither HIS name nor the names of any of the other visual fx technicians who worked on the movie are listed as they SHOULD be- as co-directors. (Would 2001 be the classic it is without those fx...?) Still, although it was Trumball and company who actually played the tune, it was Kubrick who conducted the orchestra. (Six of one, half dozen of the other...?) Storywise, 2001 leaves gaping holes big enough to house a million Monoliths. Why, for instance, did the aliens give Man his very first WEAPON instead of a tool that might make for a far brighter future (the wheel, say)? And was there just ONE Monolith, or THREE? Was the Monolith on Earth the same one that was later discovered on the Moon (or the one that appears at the end of the movie)? The entire Moon sequence could've been cut without adversely affecting the narrative in any way, but I must confess a fondness for The Blue Danube Waltz. Was HAL sabotaged by the aliens to somehow TEST Man's worthiness to make it to The Next Evolutionary Step? 2001 leaves a lot of questions unanswered (I saw it TWICE in theaters, hoping to pick up on details the second time around that I'd missed during my first go, but no such luck). The greatest success, early on, seems to have been with the very ""stoners"" who would make Tolkein's books runaway hits, but there are STILL a lot of unanswered questions.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
68,johnnyboyz,The filmic equivalent of a masterpiece painting.,10,12 January 2007,"Although I'm not a big fan of the sci-fi genre overall, I'm well aware of Stanley Kubrick and remain a big fan of his films. As it was with '2001: A Space Odyssey', the film completely blew me away.With some very haunting music throughout and some superb use of classical tunes; 2001: A Space Odyssey gets its experience across via visuals twinned with melodies rather than all out, fast, choppy action which entertains on a different level. With lengthily takes, long compositions and drawn out activity; the film had quite an effect on me as I sat there in rather a bemused awe that a film like this actually existed, let alone managed to hide from me for all those years, let alone actually be produced in 1968. Its sheer unpredictability and grace makes it, like most other Kubrick films, something you have to settle down to watch properly rather than put on any old film.The fact no human is actually present for the first twenty or so minutes and the opening consists solely of apes at the dawn of mankind is fascinating in itself and although there are complaints of it being too long and that the only real important thing we get out of this start is the fact the monolith makes it presence known as evolution happens, it's built up in a way that we can start to relate to the apes; see what they're going through and ultimately, get a feeling for the long timeframe that's going on as evolution takes place only every million years or whatever so this long, slow opening does serve a purpose: to create the feeling time is going past.Once human characters are thrown into the fray (via that famous cut you've no doubt heard of) certain conventions of psychological horror/drama are present in characters building up another place through eerie rumours and negative opinions through dialogue. This occurs when the doctors around the tables are badmouthing the place where the monolith has mysteriously appeared; somewhere the guy we've just spent the last ten minutes solely with is going; and it's truly unnerving. This is also a great chance to blend in some future things through humour and whatever else. These things include the fact Pan-Am now make space rockets to the fact the gravity toilet instructions run all the way down the side of the wall as it's so complicated to use and yet, is merely a toilet. Great stuff.When the next 'stage' of the film occurs after the mysterious monolith wins round two on mankind; the, arguably, most well known segment of the film kicks in: the exchanges on board the space ship containing the HAL 9000 computer. This is probably my favourite part too but only because the dialogue, exchanges, tension and brain bending camera work all work together as one. The chess game early on in the segment which is so easily missed amongst the rest of the beauty is an early indication and warning that the HAL 9000 isn't as tame as you'd think and beats the human crew member rather easily, obnoxiously asking the pitiful human if he resigns the game to which the crew member submits. During the rest of this segment, bizarre things like seeing the ship from the computer's point of view, watching it attempt to lip read the crew through sound proof glass and the title 'intermission' coming up during this is really something to behold, thus, it makes something like a simple close up shot of a red light staring right back at you something that has never been so eerie in a film before.The final piece in this puzzle occurs at a location that I won't spoil but after all this space and spaceship setting, suddenly appearing in this new location is very disorientating and, again, takes you aback since you just can't predict it. What do all the colours and shapes mean that flair up just before this and why are still images of the surviving space team member flashing up at random intervals? I feel this is the monolith sucking in the character into another dimension, possibly into itself, where it nurtures and grows the character so old, that it has to re-birth it. Stunning stuff.With ambiguity, humour, colour, randomness, fantastic use of music and very eerie suspense; 2001: A Space Odyssey is probably one of the greatest films of its genre and rightfully deserves its praise.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
69,Petey-10,Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick take us to an unforgettable journey into space and beyond,9,17 December 2008,"The story begins from the dawn of man, from the prehistoric era when the apes ruled the Earth.A rectangular monolith is being discovered by some of them, an object placed by aliens.In the distant future the evolution has taken the man into space.Another monolith is being found from the surface of the moon.In the year 2001 S.S.Discovery with its crew, captains Dave Bowman and Frank Poole and their computer HAL-9000 are on their way to Jupiter to find out what alien force is watching us.After a while HAL starts causing some trouble...Arthur C. Clarke, who we sadly lost at the age of 90 last March came up with the story of 2001.He was inspired by a short story called ""The Sentinel"" he had written in 1948.Clarke was such a great science fiction author and this is such a fantastic story.Stanley Kubrick, who we lost in 1999 at the age of 70 made Clarke's story into a film.And what a great film it is.The cast is very good.Keir Dullea plays the part of Dr.Dave Bowman.Gary Lockwood is Dr.Frank Poole.Douglas Rain provides the voice of HAL.William Sylvester plays Dr.Heywood R. Floyd.Vivian Kubrick, Stanley's daughter is seen as his daughter he calls squirt.Margaret Tyzack is Elena.There's a lot of classical music used in this movie that works brilliantly.There's ""The Blue Danube"" by Johan Strauss there.György Ligeti was behind most of that fantastic music.This is a movie that's hard for you to fully understand.Even Arthur C. Clarke once said: ""If you understand '2001' completely, we failed.We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.""I've seen this movie a few times, four perhaps and it hasn't totally opened to me yet.But nevertheless it's a very cool movie experience.2001: A Space Odyssey came 40 years ago, in 1968.After all these years it still looks great.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
70,leplatypus,The proverbial good science-fiction film (tv),10,16 August 2016,"The quote is from Kubrick himself and it's still totally accurate for this movie. I don't know if any film fan can appreciate it but it's really a must see for all SF fan: we got everything: space, aliens, robots, origin of humanity Beyond this theme, it's a rare movie that mixes brilliantly a challenging script with amazing visuals! Sure as the movie is from 1968, some effects look sometimes a bit out of time but it still has more punch than most SF movies done after! For me, the explanation comes from Kubrick's simple vision: he shots SF like real daily life, with no big things: a big frame and slow pace are just needful as what we see is already extraordinary! I have fun to watch it now as I have picked Clarke's novels as my summer books (proof of the enduring quality of the work) and so I have just finished to read the novel: the two are really variations around the same stories and really help each other. This movie is also a moving memory as I remember to have watch it as a teen  in my grandmother's bedroom!

71,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""2001"" is a cinematic piece of art, not a movie",8,6 February 2008,"The best way to describe ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is to call it beautiful. It portrays space with an unsettling and exciting quiet and the late Stanley Kubrick proves why he is a film-making legend.Everything from each angle, the score, to the amount of time you have to sit and think about what the heck is going on appears to be so carefully thought out and brilliantly executed. The special effects for the 60s are stunning. The symbolism and suspense of this excessively long journey into the contemplation of human existence are simply remarkable.That said, ""2001"" is something more of a motion picture masterpiece, not a ""movie"" in the modern sense of the word. With nearly an hour and a half of silent or score-only footage, ""2001"" is simply not meant to entertain in the modern sense of the word. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke leave much to be desired and answered and it appears they preferred it that way. It is a visual exploration into human existence and requires very open but deep focus, much like that of a poem, to even scratch the surface. It is difficult to access, but a pleasure to watch.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
72,Anonymous_Maxine,"Stanley Kubrick's ambiguous science fiction epic continues to baffle audiences around the world, even more than three decades after it was filmed.",10,2 April 2001,"The obvious question that someone is going to ask after watching 2001: A Space Odyssey is, `What was the meaning of that damn monolith?' Well, as is the case with the majority of great movies, 2001 spawns thinking and discussion. A movie that answers all of its questions neatly and in a timely manner can rarely be anything more than something to watch to kill a couple of hours. But 2001 is so creative and so mysterious that you really have to think about it and even watch it a few times over before you can begin to come up with a coherent meaning from it. This is a science fiction film for the thinking audience, as opposed to the fast food schlock that is cranked out by Hollywood (Mission To Mars, Pitch Black, Supernova, Armageddon, and other such nonsense), but with the obvious exception of the excellent Apollo 13. Kubrick's superior directing skills are a large part of what makes this movie such a classic. The circular space station provides him with an opportunity to film some unique versions of his traditional tracking shots, and there is also something to be said about the way that he was able to make a menacing character out of a computer that had no features other than a monotonous voice and that unblinking red eye. The award winning special effects easily surpass the vast majority of the computer generated special effects used in science fiction films today, flawlessly creating a world of zero gravity and isolation. There were several different methods that were successfully utilized in order to create a convincing outer space setting, such as near constant tilted frames, amazingly effective rotating sets, ever present humming sounds from the machinery, among other strange sounds, as well as the slowness of everything, which is present throughout the entire film, at least the entire film after that world famous jump cut.Speaking of which, I think that the cut from the bone flying through the air to the space ship floating through space was not done as well as it could have been. I think that the cut should have come a few frames sooner, when the bone had just started moving downward, so that the cut would be smoother, with the slow moving space ship. The story that follows also poses the question of how the monolith got to the moon, and even whether or not it is the same monolith as the Neanderthals found in the powerful Dawn of Man sequence. Was it really put there by an extraterrestrial species? Was it capable of moving on its own? What exactly was the effect that it had on individuals who came into contact with it? In the Dawn of Man sequence, it seemed that it gave at least one of the Neanderthals the intelligence burst of learning how to use something as a tool(or a weapon, in this case). But later in the film, it seems to have not only an intelligence (as it screams just before being photographed), but it has a less readily identifiable effect on humans  in particular, on Dave Bowman. Dave is in space near Jupiter, he goes through some sort of warp, and suddenly he is in a strange mansion, and soon there are a number of editing tricks in which Dave sees his older self, and then becomes that older self. Soon, he is so old that he is barely alive, and the monolith appears in the huge bedroom in which he lies. He slowly reaches out to it, and then turns into that famous mystical fetus that this film has come to be famous for.Does this mean that the monolith is some sort of evolution stimulant? Did Dave evolve beyond present human kind to a state above the inconveniences of these vulnerable human bodies that we all possess? Who knows? Maybe Stanley Kubrick doesn't even know, but that's really not the point here. The point is that the movie really makes you think  and not just about the meaning of the monolith, but also about the underlying theme about man vs. machine. 2001: A Space Odyssey is famous for a lot of things. It's famous because it was directed by Stanley Kubrick, of course, but also for a lot of other things - the opening sequence, that jump cut, the mysterious monolith, the realness of it all, even for the look of the Jupiter spaceship, which bears a strange resemblance to the Even Horizon. The sequel, 2010, clears up some of the mystery of this film, but even though that film is very good (although not as good as this one), that tying up of loose ends is not necessary for 2001 to remain one of the best and most fascinating science fiction films ever made.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
73,southdavid,Star Chores,5,24 March 2020,"Alphabetical scrawl through the films on Sky Movies has me land on ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" on a lockdowned Saturday afternoon.Two astronauts, David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are on a mission to Jupiter when their ships computer HAL (Douglas Rain) suggests that a piece of kit is broken, although with further investigation this proves not to be the case. Unaware of any issues with their artificially intelligent system previously the guys talk privately about the idea of rebooting HAL, an idea the sentient computer doesn't find appealing.Try as I might, and my little film nerd heart would really like to, I just can't come around to liking ""2001"". I can appreciate the artistry of the special effects - revolutionary for the time - and I love the scope of the film. Human evolution laid out from start to finish. But I just find it too much of a chore to get through, particular that closing half an hour - which I don't think I've ever made it through without at least a bit of fast forwarding. I can also appreciate that the performances are good, the classical music is iconic in this context and I can see why it's become such a cultural touchstone. I love Kubick films, and love that he's such an auteur, in the time of auteurs, that he can make a film as wildly loose and esoteric as this one.But none of that appreciation transfers into what I want from a movie, which is either to be entertained or educated and despite all the will in the world, I'm yet to find that with ""2001"".",2001 - A Space Odyssey
74,Vartiainen,"Mind-boggling, especially for its time",7,25 July 2018,"One of Stanley Kubrick's greatest works - which is saying something - and still considered by a great many people to be the greatest science fiction film ever made.It is a film that takes us from the very beginning to the very end. Starting from space, slowly and majestically approaching prehistoric Earth, settling us in to witness the birth of mankind. And it keeps going on from there. All the way to the end.The one thing that impressed me the most about this film is its technical supremacy. This is a film that was made in the 60s. Computer effects had barely been imagined back then and they wouldn't be widely used in decades. And yet this film has some of the most amazing visual shots I've ever seen. I frankly have no idea how they even made some of them. Or, at least, made them without going to ridiculous lengths in set-building. And it looks great, perfect even.As for the story, it's a Kubrick alright. None of the man's films are what you would call fast-paced, but this right here just might take the cake. I enjoyed the beginning a lot. The slow pace allowed for the majesty of the imagery to shine and it reflected the slow build-up of mankind rather beautifully. But the space scenes did not pick up the pace, and I do think that they should have. Just a little bit. I get that the style is what it is and when the mood leans more towards horror, it does work, but I still think that the same story could have been told in a briefer fashion. Easily.Still, I cannot fault the film too much. It is quite unique in its mood, approach, story and scope. An iron hard classic for a reason and definitely an inspiration for all the science fiction that would follow. Owe it to yourself to give it a chance.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
75,FiendishDramaturgy,"The film you love, but hate to watch",5,22 January 2005,"It seems to be trendy to have lovely things to say about Stanley Kubrick's Space Odessy. Like A Clockwork Orange, this is one of his films that I just cannot tolerate to watch. The story is beautiful, and the directing style is inspired and true genius at work. There, I said it. But the musical score seems to be the star, and frankly, it's nerve-wracking, unintelligent classical droning just totally put me off this film. It's a migraine generating cacophony which sincerely has your hand twitching involuntarily towards the remote.It does have a beautiful story, if you can wade through the noise to discover it. It does have wonderful performances, if you can hang in there that long. It does have some innovative ideas in the genre of science fiction, if you aren't brain dead by the time you get to them.Personally, I don't want to have to work that hard to enjoy a movie, no matter how good, it ultimately is.Based on content, it rates a 9.8/10.Based on musical score, it rates a 0.5/10.Based on performances, it receives a 7.8/10.Based on the watchability factor, it rates a 3.2/10.That's a combined average of 5.325/10 from...the Fiend :.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
76,hellraiser7,The Enigma of Space,10,28 May 2020,"We are all driven by questions throughout all our lives, it is our internal need to always have them answered whether it be the smallest ones like asking a girl out to prom, which video game. Down to the biggest questions like what planets and star constellations does that uncharted galaxy millions of miles away have or existence itself. Just like the vastness of the universe, there are a vast number of questions that we still ask about the universe and life itself. We may get some answers but were there are several answers there will be a million more questions that come even as time and evolution go on, they will always be there.This is one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time, it's another of my favorites in the final frontier sub-genre of sci-fi. And of course, this is based on a book by one of my favorite sci-fi authors Arthur C Clarke and my third favorite film by one of my favorite film directors Stanley Kubrick.What is interesting about this film is that it doesn't feel so much like a movie but actually an experience as this is a film that is more about the visuals, what you see and what you feel about them. It's executed sort of a ballet, but in space from that music that you would probably hear in those productions down to the movement itself.There is so much to this film, it's hard to put most to all into words it's something you have to see to believe. I really love the effects and models, it's all practical there is no bull crap CGI which makes the film all the better because the film was done with care and effort and not some half assed effort.
From the look of space and the planets and the viewpoint of them, which is amazingly accurate, down to the ships themselves.My favorite ship is the Jupiter mission ship which looks awesome, I remember the scene when the camera is just constantly panning right of the ship, we keep seeing how big the ship truly and as the sequence continues I remember thinking ""how the heck much bigger is it"". That darn ship probably is as big as three to four shopping malls combined, which also made me wonder what else was on the ship. But I also really like those small circular crafts which are equipped with robotic arms which I just though was cool being able to both fly but also get certain things while in space.The story structure is interesting and was different for its time as the film is broken up into segments that are interconnected mainly by this one monolith that affects man throughout time.I'll just say four sequences I like as I don't want to give too much away, from the first one which takes place in the dawn of man based on Darwin's theory. Anyway in this we see one of the ape men after touching the Monolith it then takes up a bone and is just making little movements with it but then as we see it then swings it down on the skeleton of the ant eater like creature. It's such a simple scene but it's one that just speaks volumes, where we are seeing the birth of man's first idea but also man's first piece of technology/tool, as it's said sometimes the biggest things are birthed from humble beginnings.Some of the docking sequence of a space shuttle coming to the station. The music in that is just beautiful as that's probably a score you've heard in dozens upon dozens of baileys. But it just fits perfectly from just the way they move which is slow but beautiful as it goes well with the music.Dave and Hal 9000 rivalry, this is interesting as it's once again the age-old motif of man versus machine. The rivalry is a battle of wits as Dave is confronted with a conundrum of a physical puzzle as to how to get back on the Jupiter ship. It was one of the most suspenseful confrontations ever because here was a man that was dealing with a computer program that is smarter than him which makes it almost like a war against a god. I remember being on the edge of my seat, praying that Dave will find some way if not to outwit Hal which is next to impossible but find a way to get around him and prevail.The stargate sequence, which is just fantastic, not much I can say about that one as it's is just one big kaleidoscope in motion, that just draws you in and never lets go. From how long it went, it just made me wonder how much further did this stargate go and what other colorful treats are we going to see.
This film has a lot of things. For one thing it was prolific on our technological era. We see the use of computer tablets and video phones. However, fascinating the tech is we see there are some drawbacks, how it's created a disconnect and social distancing. In one scene Dave and some other guys are eating dinner and are watching their personal tablet screens, we see both are sitting together but their not looking at one another, engaging in any real conversations.But also A.I. as they have an intelligence computer to work with called Hal 9000. Hal 9000 is another of my favorite fictional villains. Just that red glowing eye, despite being a sensor it still feels like it's an evil red eye constantly watching. But also, that voice that sounds so calming but also just plain cold, there is just no warmth in Hal's voice which makes sense as Hal was programed with intelligence but no conscience.I'll admit as a kid I found it scary that technology could advance so far but also be so dangerous. Hal, we see is something that is curious about everything mainly the people, but doesn't understand their content. It also operates on cold logic; it wants the mission accomplished one way or the other. Hal is also interesting because there is an enigma with his character, as we hear further on he starts to sound almost human, which makes you wonder is he just lying and imitating those emotions of fear to save his own life, or if he's evolved and is really expressing emotions. It sort of makes you wonder about when mankind itself went thought the same process.The thing I really like about the film is how enigmatic it is, there is much unexplained mainly the monolith. We never really know where it came from or what it even is though it seems to be some sort of communication device. Was it made by aliens or God himself, your guess is as good as mine? The mystery of it reflects our own questions we ask about the universe itself, despite our evolution and scientific advancements we have more questions than answers about space and life itself.This is an intergalactic odyssey that takes you to space, beyond and the infinity of mystery.Rating: 4 stars",2001 - A Space Odyssey
77,Captain_Couth,Stanley Kubrick's vision of the future!,10,5 February 2005,"2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a breath taking look at a possible future through the eyes of Arthur C. Clarke and under the direction of Stanley Kubrick. The movie itself is more of a visual work of art than anything else. All of Kubrick's future (no pun intended) trademarks can be found in this film (cold sterile sets and the Kubrick ""stare"" to name a few). The two made an awesome team. A shame that they never worked with each other again. Imagine the possibilities.The movie follows the stages of man's evolution under the watchful of the ominous monolith. Who or what exactly the monolith is or what it represents is up to the viewer to decide. I have an opinion but I'll keep it to myself. Beginning with the dawn of man and civilization, the evolved simian and to the year 2001. Man has reached the stars but will they enjoy what they discover? From Earth to the Moon to Jupiter, man has traveled hither and yonder. But they still don't grasp the basic understanding of life in general and it's continued evolution Does the discovery of the monolith on the moon have anything to do with it? Will Dr. Heywood Floyd and his men learn the meaning of it? What about Dave Bowman and his crew that orbit Jupiter? You'll have to find out when you watch this classic science fiction flick.I enjoyed this movie ever since I was a child. I have never seen anything like this before. The visuals and the music are extremely haunting. Kubrick has made a masterpiece (only to be topped by his brilliant film Barry Lyndon). A cinematic enigma that's has so many possibilities.Followed a few years later with a direct sequel. Not as brilliant as this one but satisfactory for die hard fans of the novels.Highly recommended.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
78,billcr12,Bad Kubrick,1,5 April 2012,"I will begin by admitting that I don't like space movies, including Alien which is a slow and uninteresting bore. 2001 has a similar setting without a creature chasing people around a space craft. Instead we get computer named Hal repeating Dave ad nauseum. The film is supposed to be a deep and meditative reflection on the universe and the place we humans belong within it. Stanley Kubrick worked with the science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke on the script with several rewrites. I believe the pair may have ingested a mind altering substance while putting 2001 together because it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Three years later Kubrick released A Clockwork Orange, which is my favorite film of all time, so I have no explanation for his earlier work.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
79,BeneCumb,"Ahead of time then, timeworn now",6,2 May 2013,"Due to my age and native country, I was unable to see the film soon after its completion and even prior to the use of modern digital technology. On the other hand, I am not a fan of ""arid"" sci-fi films, such as Solaris or Stalker - I find them protracted, stolid, and too commonplace. Long scenes without text lines, lengthy stills of space technology, kitschy interiors are the thing I usually tend to avoid. But as I regard Stanley Kubrick as a talented filmmaker, I have decided to watch (again) all his main films - but 2001: A Space Odyssey turned out to be a real challenge... Of course, I admit its particularity and skillful use of state-of-the-art technology at that time, but watching it in 2013 was not impressive to me. Moreover, there were no catchy characters and performers to remember (unlike in Star Wars trilogy, for example). For fans of Kubrick and/or elderly sci-fi admirers, probably. I would be surprised if middle-aged or young viewers get a memorable experience from the film in question.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
80,freemantle_uk,A film that needs repeated viewing,10,23 June 2008,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a classic sci-fi film, an example of Stanley Kubrick's genius as a director. I admit I didn't like it as much as other Kubrick films at first, but another viewing made me see what a brilliant film it was.The film is very complex and tackles a number of themes, such as science and space travel, evolution, religion, discovery, the future of computing and alien life-forms. I personally think it is about man's yearning for discovery and wanting to improve themselves.The film starts off at the dawn of man we look at a small of apes struggling to survive. They are forced away from their waterhole and were on the brink. It was only when the apes use bones as tools that the they are able to reclaim there waterhole, but become murderous and warlike. After that the film skips forward to the future and we see that man has been very advance, starting to make large space bases and colonising the moon. A team of scientist discovery a strange black monolith on the moon and start to study it. It is then skips future another 18 months and the film focuses on a mission to Jupiter and we look at two astronauts, Frank and Dave, and the computer HAL. The mission seems to be going smoothly enough until HAL makes an error and the crew decides to disconnect him. HAL however knows what they plan to do and takes drastic action to stop this, including murder. Its was Dave that was only able to stop him. After this we knew see Dave go through a wormhole around Jupiter and the film becomes very surreal.This film is multi layered and many fans of this film have discussed what it means. I have given my opinion earlier. This film gets the science right and from a technical viewpoint, very impressive. The music is classical and very memorially and fitting for this film. There are also a lot of memorially scenes which have been homaged and parody a number of times. I personally really like the scene when Dave is disconnecting HAL and HAL is pleading for his life.This is a film that needs to be watched a number of times.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
81,ianlouisiana,"Man and Superman.Arthur C,.Clarke's theory of evolution.......",9,6 January 2008,"Whenever a movie based on a work from another medium is considered it is imperative to take into account the original source.However many times Mr S.Kubrick is referred to as a ""genius"" and ""2001"" as a ""Masterpiece"" his role in the production was to re - interpret another man's vision.Even if one took the Auteur theory ""Reductio ad Absurdam"" no movie is ever the sole work of the director. Mr Arthur C.Clarke's ""The Sentinel"" was written 60 years ago.At that time the only rockets were adaptations of Herr von Braun's V2 which,3 or 4 years earlier had the sole modest - if deadly - ambition of clawing its way high enough into the sky to drop on London. By the time Mr Kubrick was considering making ""2001"",the Apollo space programme was well under way.Of the two Mr Clarke's vision was the more imaginative and percipient. Certainly ""2001"" is a remarkable movie by any standards,perhaps,along with the vastly different ""Alien"",at the very peak of the Sci - Fi pantheon.Mr Scott's masterwork,made 11 years later,shows space travel as routine,boring and a little grubby,in complete contrast to Mr Kubrick's concept of it as a new and exciting step in freeing Mankind from the confines of Earth. Furthermore,the Clarke/Kubrick collaboration reaches far wider,no less than the elevation of Man to the next step in the evolutionary scale. Having performed some Herculean tasks the surviving astronaut is finally reborn as a""Starchild"" thus marking the beginning of a new journey for the species. Generations of moviegoers have grown up whose only knowledge of the movie is via the video or more lately,DVD.However grand their Home Cinema equipment may be it can only give them a very limited idea of the magnificence of the original visuals and the almost overpowering soundtrack.Occasionally you can catch a theatrical production and I most strongly urge you to do so if possible.Only then can you appreciate the impact the movie had on my generation forty years ago.

82,PWNYCNY,A qualified success,7,31 July 2005,"Recently I viewed this movie again. Although the story becomes muddled starting with the Jupiter and beyond sequence, nevertheless the movie deserves praise for its special effects and its attempt to delve into the origins of man. And although the story has little action and sparse dialog, it nevertheless succeeds in engaging the audience's attention and maintaining a certain level of suspense, at least for the majority of the film. The problem is that the film ends not with a bang but with a thud. What starts off as being intriguing and at times almost sublime ends in a quagmire of uncertainty as the audience is left wondering what to make of the final scenes. Leaving the audience guessing is not a good way to end a movie and for that reason the movie can be characterized only as a qualified success. When I first saw this movie years ago, I was so intrigued by the music and special effects that I would have rated it a 10. But, alas, time marches on and so does my taste in movies. Recently I happened to watch this movie again and to my chagrin I found it BORING. What made the movie even more unpalatable was the pretentious and muddled story ... or message ... or cryptic allegory ... or whatever, that left me feeling profoundly annoyed. What the heck is this movie about anyway? I liked the beginning with the actors jumping around in monkey suits screaming at each and fighting and, well, acting a lot like people, but when the movie introduced the obelisk ... and then the space station ... and then the talking computer with an attitude ... and then the astronaut growing old ... and then a baby in a capsule looking at earth ... I knew that somewhere there was a message, but it was a message not received by me because frankly, my dear, I didn't give a hoot. The one character in the movie I liked, in fact the only character in the movie that is worthy of the term ""character,"" was the computer. If the movie had just been about the computer, and how well he ... or she ... or it ... sang ""Daisy,"" I might have liked this movie a lot more. This movie is an example of people getting in the way of a perfectly good story. Let the computer explore space. People have more important things to do.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
83,ackstasis,"""Its origin and purpose still a total mystery""",10,6 December 2007,"Beauty is an often-overlooked component of modern film-making. We are often so overwhelmed by complex story lines and fast-paced action that we forget to simply sit back and admire the sheer beauty of celluloid. Engineered with intricate precision by passionate, experienced hands, a film can transcend the boundaries of simply being a film. It can become a work of art. '2001: A Space Odyssey' is not a film to be watched by one in any hurry. To the unprepared viewer, the leisurely pace of the narrative may first come across as ""slow"" or ""tedious."" However, to those lucky enough to be able to appreciate its brilliance, the film is a relaxing, meditative journey that you can't expect to forget any time soon. The film relies, not on dialogue, but on stunning visual imagery and an eerily appropriate classical score, to explore its themes and advance the limited plot. In fact, the first spoken word appears almost thirty minutes into the film, and, in total, less than forty minutes of dialogue constitutes the total running time.Following the enormous success of his classic apocalyptic black comedy, 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964),' director Stanley Kubrick became enthralled by the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and so collaborated with noted English sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke to create ""the proverbial good science fiction movie."" The two decided to adapt and expand Clarke's early short story, ""The Sentinel,"" written in 1948 and first published in 1951. In a nutshell, and at its most literal level, '2001: A Space Odyssey' tells the story of Mankind's evolution, either prompted or surveilled by ominous black Monoliths, the tools of an unseen advanced extraterrestrial civilisation. Through the coldly-sinister HAL9000 computer (chillingly voiced by Douglas Rain), Kubrick also explores the expanding role that technology will play in the future, and whether or not our complete dependence upon it will inevitably result in our own destruction {also an important theme in 'Dr. Strangelove'}.Many of the film's detractors often complain that the story poses complex questions about Mankind's origin and place in the Universe, but without offering any answers of any kind. I can see how the film's ""open-endedness"" might be infuriating to those who are eager for a neatly-packaged explanation, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Though one might miss it on first viewing, Kubrick has plenty to say about the way he views humanity. For example, the opening ""Dawn of Man"" sequence depicts the crumbling society of the early hominids, as they attempt futilely to scrounge out an existence in the arid landscape. The inexplicable arrival of the Monolith (accompanied by György Ligeti's endlessly-creepy ""Requiem"") precipitates a profound change in the mental capabilities of the Apemen  they are now able to exploit tools to stay alive. That famed match-cut from the soaring bone to the orbiting spacecraft four million years later is so simple, and yet it conveys so much about the human race. Worth noting is that Kubrick originally intended those spacecraft to be orbiting nuclear weapons {the Cold War being at its peak around the time of the film's production}. The cut is a way of enforcing that, given his intelligence, Man will always use it to develop ways to destroy himself (remembering that the bone was used to kill the leader of an enemy tribe).Another sequence that remains hotly-debated almost four decades after the film's release is the controversial ending, a psychedelic wormhole of colour produced by effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull using slit-scan photography. Following his journey through the ""Stargate""  a breathtaking trip across the bizarre expanses of the Universe  Dave Bowman is deposited in a sort of fourth-dimensional observational chamber, its classical decorations both familiar and alien, where the greater beings who engineered the Monoliths can keep an invisible eye on him. In this room, having finally defeated his tools, Man must face one final challenge: his own death. Throughout history, human evolution depended so much upon its technology/tools that it almost replaced us. In the end, it tried to destroy us (i.e. HAL). Now, just moments from the death of Mankind, separated from his tools, what do we have left? The final act of a dying Dave is to reach out his withered hand towards the Monolith that stands before him. This image of 'reaching out' with an extended finger was directly borrowed by Kubrick from the famous painting found in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel artwork -- of Man extending his finger to touch God's hand. Note how, following Dave's epic transformation/rebirth into a Starchild, Kubrick juxtaposes the Earth's razor-thin atmosphere with the frail fetus in its womb, stressing the fragility, preciousness and vulnerability of the planet on which we dwell.There's really no adequate way to explain why '2001' is such a magnificent and special film to me. It is, above all else, a motion picture that appeals to our emotions, and the feelings of awe, wonderment and terror that overcome me are simply indescribable. In judging films, I prefer to reserve the term ""masterpiece"" for the films capable of completely drawing me into their world, of making me forget that I'm watching a movie. I want to feel as though I am there. Shortly put, '2001' achieves this more effectively than any other film I have ever experienced. If you need any further explanation of why I value this film so greatly, then consider my experiences with one particular sequence: Dave Bowman, in order to re-access the Discovery and disconnect HAL, must enter the spaceship through the emergency airlock, exposing himself to a total vacuum for an extended period of time. As the breathable air finally began to fill Dave's surroundings, I found myself taking a breath for the first time in almost half a minute. I was there.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
84,mjneu59,Kubrick re-writes the cinema rulebook,10,11 January 2011,"Stanley Kubrick's landmark sci-fi epic blew a lot of minds back in 1969, and at the dawn of the 21st century the film lends an even more compelling perspective to our place in the cosmos. Kubrick and co-writer Arthur C. Clarke ask more questions than they answer, which is only appropriate, since their scenario follows nothing less than he entire evolution of human consciousness, moving in daring narrative leaps across time and space from the genesis of primitive intelligence (notably, an act of violence) to Mankind's first, enigmatic encounter with infinity.And yet rarely has a film drawn on such a monumental canvas communicated so much by saying so little. Kubrick embraces a truly cosmic vision of exploration and discovery, but the ideas are expressed with an equally cosmic reticence perfectly suited to the arid emptiness of outer space (the human astronauts show even less emotion than their renegade HAL 9000 computer). Ironically, it's the void itself that leaves the deepest impression, and the film is able to capture its intimidating silence and sense of disorientation using a spare economy of images and sounds: a spacecraft racing silently over the barren, blue lunar surface; the mammoth Discovery probe en route to Jupiter, floating through the loneliest reaches of the solar system; and above all else, there's always that compelling, opaque black monolith, hovering in perfect symmetry between the sun and the stars.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
85,drqshadow-reviews,Breathtaking and Risk-Taking; Kubrick and Clarke's Offspring is a True Masterwork,10,24 September 2020,"This timeless collaboration between Stanley Kubrick (the progressive filmmaker) and Arthur C. Clarke (the conceptual novelist) is more of a thoughtful anthology, three distinct but connected stories, than a single cohesive whole. It might even be argued that the tripped-out last act, technically a coda to the HAL 9000 arc, makes for a surplus fourth chapter, but we don't need to get too in-depth on that point. There's almost too much to laud.Stylistic mash-ups like this one, pairings of intrinsically unique mediums, don't always go well, but 2001 manages to harvest the best of both worlds without losing the innate qualities that make each so successful. We share the heady, scientific honesty, deep intellectual enigmas and pinpoint social forecasts of a great science fiction novel (or several, as it were), plus the majestic visual effects, tangible characterization and meticulous timing of a top-shelf motion picture. In other words, Kubrick stuns us with artistry, dramatic proficiency and general ingenuity, while Clarke sees to it that everything still feels human and tickles our brains with limitless abstract possibilities. What a perfect partnership.Inconceivably influential, too, as the stark point of transition from the hammy Flash Gordon tinfoil swashbucklers of the 50s and early 60s to the more intelligent, considered space operas of the forthcoming decade. This is a film that was released before we set foot on the moon, but already seems to know how a prolonged life amongst the stars will feel. There's so much to love, from the magnificent cinematography (my GOD, such photography) to the deliberate pacing (allowing us to step inside this world and appreciate its nuances). The sweeping symphonic score (which sees to it that we scarcely notice the EIGHTY COMBINED MINUTES without dialogue) to the haunting, perplexing thematic storytelling (loaded with smart, understated performances).If anything gives me pause, it's the deep sense of impenetrability that often settles over long stretches of screen time, particularly that daring (and baffling) climactic sequence. But then, as Clarke said so succinctly just after its release, ""If you understand 2001 on the first viewing, then we've failed."" This is one nut that's worth the effort of cracking. A certifiable masterpiece that still leaves me asking, ""How did they do that in 1968?""",2001 - A Space Odyssey
86,st-shot,Magnificent self indulgence,9,8 June 2014,"Stanley Kubrick's slow go science fiction piece demands patience from its audience as he bombards it with endless visual and audio extravagance at a sometimes snail pace that challenges one's concentration and endurance. It is a film experience to be survived with an outcome that will either dazzle you or bore you to tears.Something or someone is dropping large domino shaped monoliths about the galaxy. They seem to exude a superior intelligence bent on spreading the wealth where it takes on Earth enabling evolving mankind to kill and conquer through weaponry. When another monolith is discovered far into the future on the moon, Earth sends an expeditionary team comprised of five humans and one sharp self confident computer, Hal 9000 to inspect and follow the trail to Jupiter to get the lowdown. Dissension breaks out on the ship however and the mission is jeopardized.2001 is a visually stunning experience to behold on the big screen. It asks a lot of its audience and caught in the right frame of mind a cinematic experience of the first order. Ultimately it comes down to whether your mood is in alignment with Kubrick's tedious at times self indulgent floating rhythm. For nearly the first half hour there is no dialog for the remarkable opening transition from the dawn of man to present day space travel. Accompanied by a spot on music score (Strauss, Khachakurian) you are carried through space in a graceful and awe inspiring fashion both inside and outside the ship. The suspense ramps up when Hal goes rogue but even at this juncture Kubrick maintains his deliberate turgid pace that for some may ask too much. The visual fireworks really explode in the final segment partnered with an auditory assault that is to be endured rather than passively enjoyed as the last surviving astronaut roars toward Jupiter.2001 is a milestone in sci fi cinema; the halfway point between Melies Trip to the Moon from the 19th century and the ease at which advanced technology in this day and age can achieve creating similar terrain. Kubrick's use of sound and score to accompany his odd angled flowing visuals is indeed as mind blowing an experience one might have in 20th century film but his pace is painstakingly slow at times and you may find yourself wanting to abandon ship. Since it's opening decades back I have made half a dozen attempts to stay the course with this beast of a movie and finished it three times, twice with disappointment results. The one other time I completed it I walked out truly blown away. It is the one that remains with me and it is a very rewarding experience informing perhaps that the fault is in ourselves not the star, Stanley Kubrick.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
87,GiraffeDoor,Another interesting failure.,5,30 April 2019,"It's hard to know where to begin with this movie or how to say something that hasn't been said before.I'd rank this with Eraserhead and Under the Skin of movies I dig stylistically for their visually conveyed plots and enigmatic tone but ultimately is little more than an interesting failure because of the lack of plot trajectory.The montagecraft and visuals are stunning but that counts for little without substance and this movie lacks that both in characters and plot, no amount of originality can make up for that. I dislike how polarized the dialogue level is; we either get none or a suddenly very candid scene and the final plot line with HAL does drag. When a deliberately cool voiced machine has the most personality of anyone in the movie you know there's a problem.I wrote an essay on this movie and it's underlying meaning when I was 15 so I'm not going to say there isn't a lot to chew on philosophically but this isn't a philosophy book. A lot of the cinematic tricks (even the iconic bone to ship cut) is messily handled.At about half the length this could have been good but I suggest you go in just treating it as a feature length music video with spoken asides. The music is pretty well chosen except for an obnoxious usage of Blue Danube. BASIC!!!!!!Ultimately a somewhat admirable, very interesting and absolutely pretentious affair but a different handling could have made it the best movie ever.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
88,MaxBorg89,"Weird and hard to understand, but captivating nonetheless",10,23 July 2007,"When I saw this movie for the first time, at the age of 14, I actually hated it: it was too slow (I had to repeatedly press the fast forward button on the remote control, especially during the last 20 minutes) and I did absolutely not get the ending. It took me two more viewings to understand that was the point: nothing ever happens quickly, man's rise to power was a slow process and therefore humanity's decline (Kubrick's favorite theme), as depicted here, should require an equally long amount of time.In fact, the director's idea is that often our greatest accomplishments are in reality an anticipation of decay. This is shown most clearly in the (very) long opening sequence, where a mysterious black monolith appears and presumably affects the planet's inhabitants (apes), as they learn to use bones as weapons, thus getting one step closer to progress but also much closer to extinction.The movie then cuts to a different era, in one of the most beautiful images of sci-fi cinema: one of the apes throws a bone in the air and as it goes back down it morphs into a spaceship. Apart from skipping centuries or even millennia in a very creative way, this also has the purpose of underlining the connection between the prologue and the rest of the film which, as indicated by the title, takes place far away from Earth in a distant (at the time this movie was made, that is) future. In particular, the focus is on a space station where a group of astronauts, led by David Bowman (Keir Dullea), are helped by a supercomputer named HAL 9000. HAL is, by his own definition, absolutely perfect and incapable of doing anything wrong. Or at least he was before the black monolith started showing up again, causing the machine to behave strangely and put the men's lives at risk (this was later reused by Kubrick, albeit differently, in Full Metal Jacket). What is happening? What is that black object, and what does it do?These questions remain unanswered, and given the director was the most notorious perfectionist in the history of cinema there has to be a good reason. Perhaps the answer is to be found in Kubrick's personal opinion about films: he believed watching movies was similar to dreaming, which is why some of his most famous works feature dream-related material (A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and the nightmarish, pun not intended, Eyes Wide Shut). In his mind, images were much more powerful than words, hence the limited dialogue in 2001: like in a dream, what really matters is what we see, not what we hear. Kubrick lets the visual elements speak by themselves, with nothing more than classical music as a companion (the ""dancing"" space vehicles and asteroids are among the most fascinating and iconic shots ever). When someone speaks, it is merely to move the plot forward, even though in one specific moment (the last scene where HAL ""appears"") it is used to highlight the film's most ironically moving sequence.Dreams are intriguing because we do not always understand their meaning and usually only remember a few images. 2001: A Space Odyssey is exactly the same: maybe the epilogue will never make sense, but the visual memories that have been left behind ensure the movie has a well deserved place in any Top 50 list of the greatest pictures of all time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
89,Fluke_Skywalker,Beyond the Infinite,10,26 May 2014,"At this point the technical brilliance of Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' is absolutely beyond reproach. Where there is still room for debate is in its tone and dramatic style. The dry dialog, flat acting and lack of dramatic flourish as well as the long and narratively unnecessary musical sequences are seen by critics as fatal pretense. To its fans--and there are obviously many--these are the very things that help to set it apart from the crowd.I won't pretend to fully understand the more metaphysical aspects of the final act of '2001', but I contend that it's not necessarily a film that's meant to be understood so much as it is to be experienced. And what an experience it is.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
90,Lechuguilla,Cosmic Art,10,6 February 2005,"Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We ""see"" our primordial past, and we ""infer"" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. Not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story. For perceptive viewers, the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe.In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think the sleek, black monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Maybe. Without doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. Mystery is more profound than explanation.""2001 ... "" is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime.

91,jimbo-53-186511,"A visual & technical phenomenon, but it's about as exciting as a party political broadcast",2,21 June 2015,"Out of the 16 films that Stanley Kubrick has directed this is the fifth one that I've seen and I can safely say that it's by far the worst of the bunch; it's hard to believe that this bloated bore of a film came from the same man that directed such great films as The Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket, but hang on folks I have my own theory...Everyone comments on how this film is a ground breaking piece of science fiction and I must concede on those comments; 2001's visuals are astonishing, the special effects are mind-blowing and still hold up well today, the set designs are also authentic and impressive. This film has also paved the way for many other science fiction films. The problem with this film is that (aside from a very vague narrative about the evolution of mankind) there is very little else going for this film. It felt to me like Kubrick was more concerned with creating a 'Concorde' moment in the world of cinema rather than creating a film with an interesting story that will actually involve the audience. Yes it ticks all the 'technical' boxes, but there's no emotional involvement, there's no-one to care about and nothing to be interested in.Normally, a score in a film is used to evoke fear, excitement, or tension but here the score is just used for the sake of it and is massively over-used. In fact, it got to the point where the score became more irritating than anything and there were long stretches when it was used at the expense of both character development and plot development.The only mildly interesting part of this film was when the crew started to have problems with HAL, but this aspect of the plot was short-lived and the resolution to this aspect of the story was far too formulaic.2001: A Space Odyssey really does seem to be a 'marmite' film whereby you either love it or you hate. As an average film viewer who doesn't claim to have any sort of pseudo-intelligence I've got to confess that I found the whole film boring and pretentious.

92,Nazi_Fighter_David,The final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...,9,11 August 2005,"""200l: A Space Odyssey"" is a supremely intriguing space-travel journey with a profound look at mankind's future... It is one of the very few great films of our times... It gives us something to think, talk and argue... It wonders about our importance in the universe and ignites our imagination and curiosity... It inspires us to dig for insights...As a science fiction fantasy, it is one of the most original films ever made... Kubrick's camera dances to the ""Blue Danube"" with planets floating exuberantly through the light years... It's an experience in the poetry of motion, a rich statement to the power of cinema...But ""2001"" reveals that it's not really a science fiction film after all... It's, instead, a philosophical enigma, a magnificent meditation on man's place in the grand scheme of things, and a quest to understand ourselves by knowing all else...""2001"" is a unique film about man's evolution told in almost subliminal terms... The people in this classic science-fiction epic hardly matter... Kubrick relates a chronology in images of thingsthe mountains, the desert, the technology, the space capsule, the computer named HAL (who is more interesting than the humans), and the time warp... The final landing scene is the very hallmark of cinematic genius...As a terror story, too, it is a towering achievement (not on the same scream-inducing level as Hitchcock's ""Psycho""), but in an innocent and far more haunting way...The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man... In Kubrick's fantasy, the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth... Man has indeed evolved!As a spectacle ""2001"" assaults the mind, eye and ear, with stimulating images and suggestions... We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment... The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth; the ""Starchild"" returning home to charm the orb...""2001"" is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet...""2001"" is also a work of great visual acuity... It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man... Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery... They insist upon an answer where there can only be a question... Every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of Kubrick's film But for those who can accept mysticism, the climax is deeply moving...",2001 - A Space Odyssey
93,sauravjoshi85,A must watch space movie,9,25 March 2020,"2001: A Space Odyssey is an space science fiction movie directed by Stanley Kubrick and stars Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester and Douglas Rain as the voice of HAL 9000 the super computer.The movie is based on the discovery of one monolith that appeared at the dawn of the man.The movie is one of the finest movie and was way ahead to it's time. Director deserves a huge applause for the perfect display of the outer world which was still a mystery in 1968. The movie is very vast and epic to be rated.The movie is undoubtedly a visual masterpiece with one of the greatest special effects and display of space, stars and planets.For regular viewers the movie is slow and could be boring. There is not a single dialogue for the first and last 25 minutes. The display of Ape man also disappoints little as they were acting more human and less apes.The screenplay is slow with limited dialogues. The background music good but gets louder at some places. Acting is good and special credit to Douglas Rain for his epic and perfect voice as super computer.Overall the movie is slow with little complex ending but keeping in mind the year movie was produced we have to ignore the little flaws and should appreciate the superb movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
94,MissSimonetta,Thought provoking and beautiful,10,7 November 2013,"This definitely requires more than one viewing. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) not only boasts some of the most stunning cinematography and timeless special effects on film, but it has a story with so many layers that a revisit or two is mandatory if you even want to begin to understand it. The ending alone has been baffling people for over forty-five years. Another hundred could pass and there will still be discussions about this film.Just do yourself a favor, relax, and watch this. Don't expect lots of action or dialogue, or the sort of roller-coaster rides that science fiction movies have become. This is a film you are meant to reflect on and mull over in your mind hours afterward. It's not for everybody, but for those who are willing to go for something a bit more thoughtful, give it a whirl. The two hours and forty minutes are worth it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
95,rooprect,"If only one film makes it off this planet, it should be 2001.",10,25 January 2012,"If the Earth was about to blow up and I could choose only 1 film to survive us, it would definitely be this. What's funny is ""2001"" isn't even my favourite movie. But I believe it tells the story of humankind better than anything else I've ever seen on the big screen. Essentially it asks the age old question ""what is the meaning of life?"", and for my money, it provides a very satisfying answer.What makes it such a phenomenal work of art is that it is able to address some of the most divisive, incompatible human attitudes (in particular, religion) and present us with a model that we ALL can accept. Judeo-Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Scientologists, Fundamentalists, Existentialists, Atheists and even Satanists can find truth in this film because it applies no labels. Like the mysterious yet commanding ""black box"" that appears in the film, it remains exactly that: a sealed black box which can be anything we choose to see.The black box may represent God. Or it may represent science. Or it may represent history. Or it may represent individuality. Make up your own mind, and you will learn a little something of yourself. Really, this movie is like a puzzle with infinite solutions, designed to teach us about ourselves by what we see in it. It's truly interactive. No other film has ever made me feel this way.The plot is almost irrelevant, so I won't bother summarizing. What you should pay attention to are the themes and questions the movie addresses.1) Are we alone in the universe? 2) Is there a point to life? 3) Are we heading in the right direction?By the time the movie ends, you should have an answer to all three, and yet all our answers will be different.SO WHAT THE HECK IS THE MOVIE ABOUT? OK, since you've read this far, I'll give you an idea. The movie is about evolution. Not just your Darwinian natural selection stuff, but a compelling proposal that evolution was (or continues to be?) guided by some extraordinary force. If you like, this is the marriage of God & science that we've all been waiting for. Or if you like, it's a testament to pure science. Or pure God. Like I said, Kubrick allows for every possibility. And I have to hand it to him for remaining so tight-lipped that nobody ever knew what his personal feelings were on the matter.The film starts in prehistoric times with a tribe of moribund ape-like creatures on the edge of either extinction or excellence. Then we jump ahead a million years or so to find humans in a similar state of stagnation yet on the edge of another fantastic evolutionary step forward. Finally we jump forward to catch a glimpse of what evolution may have in store for us in the not-too-distant future. If it sounds like a documentary, I suppose it almost is, except without Marlon Perkins talking over it. We are expected to fill in the details ourselves, and that is the beauty of what this film does. It takes a purely objective approach and manages to lead us to our own satisfying conclusions.A word of caution. I don't think you're supposed to ""get"" this film on one viewing. I certainly didn't, and I've never met anyone who did. Even Roger Ebert (who ranks this as the greatest film of all time) was initially lukewarm about it when it premiered in '68. So if you feel like you just got cheated, or if you have no idea what everyone's raving about, please be patient and give it some time to sink in. I saw this movie when I was 16 and loved the middle part but hated the ending. Decades later I saw it again and suddenly understood it better. But I confess there's still a lot I haven't realized. I suppose as I get older and hopefully wiser I'll continue to interpret new ideas. And that's why this is the greatest movie of all time. It is about evolution, and moreso it EVOLVES WITH US.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
96,Kdosda_Hegen,Film made for theories.,7,1 May 2020,"This film is so different from everything else. Where do I even begin? I'm pretty sure this pretentious surrealistic film is made purely for people to interpret which what I'm going to do. I've read a lot of explanations and honestly I find most theories lame, of course, I'm not saying that everyone's explanations are lame, just the ones I have read, but at the same time, I'm not saying mine is any better. Anyway, I'll try to explain how I understand this film:
It is made into 4 chapters.Chapter 1 is about human evolution. We started as apes, but it showed how slowly we evolved. It doesn't show the whole progress, but the main elements are there. I think it is the best chapter of the film, from both technical aspects and plot-wise. Some of the editing and sound mixing are truly spectacular.Chapter 2 is about people finding the monolith and underestimating its powers. People disrespect the anomaly creature by taking a photo of it so they get punished.Chapter 3 is about the dangers of A. I., people underestimated the computer, trusted everything in its hands and it became self-aware, so it overtook the spaceship possibly due to its prior mission orders and the fact that humans may jeopardize the mission. It's pretty good, but it's so slow, the pacing is bad. Also, I think some movies did a better portrayal of the dangers of A. I. like Ex Machina (2014)Chapter 4 is there the Space Odyssey turned into a Space Travesty (joking). What I believe happens here is that the monolith left the previous place and now travels in space and happens to get next to the spaceship. So the monolith makes Dave to travel through space and time after which he gets stuck into a place that is outside space and time. He suddenly gets old because of time traveling and sees himself getting older until he dies and turns into a restless spirit that forever floats around the universe and will never find peace. Or something like that.All that being said, I think it was an interesting experience. It's a technical marvel for sure and it being surreal and pretentious doesn't hurt it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
97,andrewchristianjr,NOT FOR EVERYONE.,8,5 June 2020,"Very strange movie. but strange is not synonymous with ugly. the plot touches the philosophical, eternal soundtrack, special effects and sublime scenography. only really complicated flaw, you can not expect to understand it immediately and it is not a film for everyone.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
98,slokes,"Brilliant Experience, So-So Story",6,27 November 2009,"Watching ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is like being run through a washing machine. You come out feeling a bit cleaner, a good deal more jumbled, and all wet.It is a film in four parts. 1) A gang of prehumans discover how to defend their waterhole from a rival band by using bones as weapons. 2) An executive from the National Council of Astronautics visits a base on the Moon to investigate an incredible excavation find. 3) On the first manned flight to Jupiter, Astronauts Bowman and Poole have trouble with their computer assistant, HAL. 4) Bowman goes on an incredible journey beyond the known solar system and comes out the other side looking both very old and very young.Behind all these elements is the sometimes invisible, often active presence of a flat black monolith, inert in itself but capable of producing powerful reactions.What it all means, other than an often confusing 2 hours and 20 minutes, I don't know, but you have to give it up for director Stanley Kubrick. He made a film unlike any ever made, dealing with vast cosmic themes and philosophies, and it connected both with its own time and on to the present day. ""2001"" is still ranked the greatest sci-fi film of all time in many quarters.The images of ""2001"" remain powerful in isolation, and the overall story captures the evolutionary nature of man's existence in an often gripping way. But between the long shots of spacecraft docking and the odd Gregorian-style portentous chanting, the self-importance of this movie does grate, not to mention the thinness of the story.The part of the film that gets the most attention, the standoff between the astronauts and HAL, is alternately fascinating and labored. HAL seems to be ready to do to man what we saw man doing to those pig-like tapirs in Part 1, and it's up to Bowman to avoid being left behind by the evolutionary tide, not to mention being marooned in space. Long sections of astronauts moving in slow motion showcase the brilliant special effects but go on too long.What's good is very good, though, a terrific standoff between Bowman and HAL, brilliantly dramatized by actor Keir Dullea and the eerily dispassionate voice of Douglas Rain, with a chilling, powerful finale. There's even some humor. ""Take a stress pill and think things over"" is pretty funny when uttered by a killer about to get his.My favorite part of the film is the second section. Again, this features long slow-moving scenes, though used to better effect. The Strauss waltz accompanying the station-docking sequence still blows you away. William Sylvester as the Council executive, Dr. Floyd, has a striking cool efficiency about him that comes as quite a transition after the apemen in the opening. This sequence moves slowly but well to the mystery at the center of the story: I was disappointed to have it over with as quickly as it was.Some may wish Kubrick dropped Part 1. I wish he had dropped Part 4, which just throws a lot of half-baked concepts in the air and doesn't bother resolving any unless you happen to read post-film interviews with Kubrick or Clarke. One long visual sequence suggests what it might be like to be trapped in a Guitar Hero game programmed by H.P. Lovecraft.The last image is supposed to be triumphant, somehow, but winds up looking lost and sad. ""Going up or down?"" Dr. Floyd asks earlier in the film. Down was what it felt like to me. ""2001"" is great for what it is, a brilliantly thought-out and arrestingly executed enigma. For me, the enigma is this: How can a film be so great without also being that good?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
99,TOMNEL,"A classic for many reasons, but not a perfect movie.",8,2 February 2007,"When released in 1968, these special effects blew people away...and I can see why. These are some great special effects, even for now. It seems as though Kubrick's whole reason for making this was to capture the beauty of classical music being played to long scenes of interesting space sets and special effects. While it was very interesting for it's time, it's lost some pizazz now that every movie has this. However the part of the film that is still really interesting today is the Dawn of Man opening segment where man's ape like descendent's learn how to commit violence. It's amazing how ape like they actually got these creatures to look, while still having a weird human like quality to them. The biggest story in the film was a spaceship's extremely intelligent computer Hal is taking over the ship. It's an interesting plot, but one that doesn't kick in until late in to the film. The main problems with this movie are it's lack of a real central plot and no explanation for many supernatural things that happen, but nonetheless, this is still a classic for many reasons, but even a classic can be flawed.My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 147 mins. Rated G",2001 - A Space Odyssey
100,Steffi_P,"""Take a stress pill and think things over""",7,12 January 2011,"Since its release in 1968, this has been a movie which divides its audience into lovers and haters. Sometimes (often?), those who love it will dismiss those who hate it as simply ""not getting it"". This attitude is not only snobbish, it maybe even misses the point of the picture. 2001: A Space Odyssey is not really a picture that one must ""get"". Its plot is not exactly labyrinthine, and while its meaning is obscure it is deliberately so, as Kubrick himself shied away from being philosophically explicit. In other words, if someone tells you they know what Kubrick was trying to say with the movie, they are wrong.So what exactly is the problem then? Contrary to what some might assume, it is not the slow pace of the picture that I find alienating. Certainly there are dozens of pictures with faster paces and shorter runtimes that I find far more boring because they are unconvincing, too wordy or just generally poorly executed. In fact it is the methodical pacing that gives Space Odyssey many of its best points. Take the early scenes with the apes - not a shot is wasted there. It is in fact an extremely efficient summary of the brutal and dangerous lives of these creatures, all told with an atmospheric quietness, building up to the eeriness of the monolith's appearance and the stylised bone-smashing scene. The following spaceship sequence, ""choreographed"" to the Blue Danube waltz is graceful, balletic and quite beautiful to behold. Later, the scenes with HAL and Keir Dullea become a kind of space horror, with the long shots and mechanical noises adding to the creepiness. There's also great tension built up by having the scenes of Dullea trying to get back on board through the airlock played out in painstaking real-time. And it is the achingly slow process of HAL being shut down that helps to make it such an intensely poignant sequence.So 2001: A Space Odyssey is, for the most part, an expertly rhythmic motion picture, and from its rhythm comes its power and its emotion. Where the problem comes, and I think the point where most of the audience is lost, is in the final act. When we are sitting through a ten minutes of lights zooming past, colour-filtered landscapes, and weird avant-jazz noises, the picture has lost its sense of aesthetic beauty, and gone into the realms of artistic pretension. No-one can really enjoy this sequence. Some might claim to ""appreciate"" it, and yet it is clearly a tonal piece with little actual meaning, so there is nothing really intellectually pleasing about it either.I have to admit though, a lot of my dislike for this picture is only relative to the adulation lavished upon it by its fans. It irks me that the match-cut with the bone and the spaceship is so widely applauded, when there is an almost identical (and far neater) cut in the Powell and Pressburger picture A Canterbury Tale, and besides there are better (but more subtle) match-cuts in Space Odyssey, such as the one from the monolith against the sky to the shadow on the plain. And I'm a little cynical about the fuss made over the scientific accuracy of the space flight stuff, when the picture is so unscientific about Darwinian evolution. Don't get me wrong; I'm not citing the match-cut or the scientific inconsistencies as problems in themselves, only pointing them out as examples of the sometimes misguided way in which this movie is seen as being exceptional. Perhaps then what 2001: A Space Odyssey suffers from is its own reputation. Considered in itself, the picture has a great deal to love about it and only a little to hate.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
101,ShootingShark,My Mind Is Going,9,15 March 2008,"An inexplicable perfect monolith is discovered buried beneath the surface of the moon. A second, much larger monolith is identified in Jupiter's orbit and the spacecraft Discovery is launched to investigate. As it approaches the location, the ship's supercomputer starts to malfunction, threatening both the success of the mission and the lives of the astronauts.This marvellous movie is almost more than just a movie; an incredibly intense, ethereal, mindblowing, near-religious experience. Its themes are the hugest imaginable - the nature of existence, mankind's evolution, technology and death, and visually it is arguably the most oustanding film ever made, a stunning succession of perfectly crafted eye-popping images. It's a work of art which raises the bar for what a movie can be to a level that has rarely, if ever, been equalled. For someone like me, who enjoys classical photography, science-fiction stories, thematic visuals, existential concepts and challenging films which encourage the viewer to think, it's just the best. Discussing the film's many mysteries - is the monolith a cosmic alarm-clock, does it directly inspire Moonwatcher to evolve, why does Hal malfunction (Peter Hyams' excellent sequel, 2010, provides a neat explanation for this), what exactly happens to Dave in the end - are much better discussed with friends over a drink than in a review, except to note the movie's amazing hypnotic power. A lot of pretentious films were made in the sixties (La Dolce Vita, Week End, Easy Rider), most of which are fun but look terribly dated. This movie, despite its age and now being set in the past, looks as sharp as ever, and its aura and influence continue to grow. In technical terms, the film is peerless. Its development of special photographic effects techniques - all of which were closely supervised by Kubrick personally - is legendary. Specifically, it pioneered the use of front-projection mirrors (all of the apes and animals in The Dawn Of Man were shot in a studio), highly detailed model work utilising (non-computerised) motion control, and the slit-scan animation process used for the Stargate sequence near the end. The spaceship shots look as good as (and I would say better than) the latest CG techniques, but what really makes them so spectacular is the length Kubrick holds them for, elegantly spinning his camera into and around the craft with beautiful, dizzying skill. The film is also chock-full of astounding physical effects, typified by the amazing control room in which Dave and Frank spend most of their time, which was a forty-ton revolving set built on a centrifuge. The final masterstroke is Kubrick's inspired use of his rough-cut spot score of classical music, which is the perfect accompaniment to the beautiful images. The combination of vivid music and visuals - particularly sequences like the Johann Strauss Blue Danube / Moon Landing are uniquely harmonious. There are too many memorable scenes in this film to mention, but I think my favourite is when Dave murders Hal in the blood-red CPU room by slowly removing his memory circuits, as Hal emotionlessly regresses into infantile insanity - it's perhaps the most astonishing and original death scene in cinema. I always consider this film a great test for movie lovers. If you admire and enjoy it, you're a true cinephile. If you think it's boring, slow and confusing, you've missed the point and need to go back to watching TV commercials, which you know and love. Written by Kubrick and legendary science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, very loosely based on the latter's 1951 short story The Sentinel. Trivia - the little girl who answers the videophone is Kubrick's younger daughter, Vivian, who later made an excellent on-set documentary about The Shining, which is a must for all fans of the great man. On viewing this film, it's difficult to find words to describe my admiration of Stanley Kubrick's directorial genius. There just aren't enough superlatives to describe his visual flair, complete focus and total lack of compromise. Here is a man trying and succeeding in reinventing the structure and form of cinema. In terms of artistic comparison with his peers, he equates to something like Verdi, Mozart and Beethoven rolled into one, when everyone else is Barry Manilow. His film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, is a masterpiece, a joyous celebration of the mysteries of existence and one of the greatest movies of all time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

103,davidmvining,Kubrick's greatest film and one of the greatest ever,10,21 November 2019,"This is a terrible way to start this retrospective, but this is the first movie on the list where I would consider replacing with another. My top ten list is political in nature in that it's designed to drive those who are exposed to it to places in film that I consider important. Stanley Kubrick is a giant in the world of cinema, but I have two movies that he made that I love equally, the other being Barry Lyndon. That being said, let's talk about the movie at hand.I've never read a review of this movie that said it was poorly made. I've read negative reviews, for sure, but no one ever says that it's poorly photographed, or that the effects look fake. It's remarkable to me how uniform the opinion of the technical merits of the film are across the decades.Stanley Kubrick was a photographer before he became a filmmaker. He learned how to frame a shot with a combination of simplicity and meaning that is often never replicated in most movies. I think that manifests in a common visual feel to his films where I get the sensation that he didn't like movement in the frame. Kubrick didn't film purely from a stationary tripod like Ozu, but movement was always combined with a certain stillness. Look at the introduction to life aboard the Odyssey.On first glance, there's a lot of motion there. The camera moves left to right and back again. Frank is running in a circle. It seems like there's just a lot of motion going on, except that Frank is never anywhere but at the center of the frame. Despite all of the movement present, the focus of the shot never changes its position within the frame.This stillness at the center of motion transfixes me. 2001 is a movie that if I catch a glimpse of on TV, I end up losing the next hour or two of my life to it, almost simply at the power of the visual images. I think that the ability to calmly focus on that which is most important in the shot is one reason that I find all of Kubrick's movies, but 2001 in particular, to be so absorbing to watch.Big IdeasAnother point that no one seems to argue about is that the movie is big in both visual scale and in terms of ideas. Disagreement arises about whether the movie does anything interesting with the ideas it brings up, but I haven't read anyone calling it small. And the ideas at its core are very big.I think one way to figure out how to watch this movie and try to dissect what is there is to refer to the foreword to a book on Kristof Kieslowski, the Polish filmmaker who made The Decalogue and The Three Colors Trilogy. Here's the quote:I am always reluctant to single out some particular feature of the work of a major filmmaker because it tends inevitably to simplify and reduce the work. But in this book of screenplays by Krzysztof Kieslowski and his co-author, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, it should not be out of place to observe that they have the very rare ability to dramatize their ideas rather than just talking about them. By making their points through the dramatic action of the story they gain the added power of allowing the audience to discover what's really going on rather than being told. They do this with such dazzling skill, you never see the ideas coming and don't realize until much later how profoundly they have reached your heart.Stanley KubrickTo Kubrick, his ideal was to dramatize ideas, not to talk about them. For that, I'm sure he'd prefer a conversation instead of a visual based medium. So, taking that point of view in mind, how should one approach 2001: A Space Odyssey specifically?The key, in my mind, is the opening sequence, The Dawn of Man. From a traditional point of view, this extended dialogue free sequence that involves no named characters who appear later in the film seems superfluous at best. However, I would disagree, I think it's central. Man at this stage is little more than the beasts that it shares the barren landscape with. Man and beasts are picking at the ground next to each other, neither has an advantage over the other. When man comes into conflict with other man, there's little more than impotent demonstrations of size. Then, the monolith arrives without explanation.After this exposure, man begins to understand the world around him as more than a source for food and water. Man picks up a bone, pushes it back and forth, noticing the effect that pushing one object against another can have for the first time. Man goes further until he's slamming the bone against other parts of the remnant skeleton and destruction occurs. It is this lesson that gives man the leg up over other men and, by extension, the rest of the animals (for the other man is still no more than an animal in comparison).
The monolith gave man insight, and when the monolith appears again tens of thousands of years later, man has progressed very far. No longer scavengers on the ground, we have mastered the Earth and reached the moon, where the second monolith is buried (""intentionally""). The next push by the monolith is more complex, sending man to Jupiter.Without the Dawn of Man sequence, the monolith seems more opaque to me. We, as the audience, are not supposed to fully understand what the monolith wants, but that opening provides greater dramatic context about that idea. The monolith is pushing human evolution. First it took us on the first step to conquering the Earth, what will the next monolith teach us?QuestionsHere's something about 2001 that I think bothers a lot of people. If they get through the dramatic interpretation of what's on Kubrick's mind to find the ideas, all they end up finding are questions without any real answers.What is the monolith? Where did it come from? Where is it taking us?There are no explicit answers to those in the film itself (there's more explanation in the series of books by Arthur C. Clarke and in the movie sequel, 2010: The Year We Make Contact), but it does provide us with something a bit more interesting. This is where we get to the ""whoa"" part of the film, Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.People tend to put up this sequence as a something of a joke. Upon the movie's first release, people would go to the film and get really high just to watch this part of the film, and it's easy to see why. It's trippy with weird colors and sights. It was also unlike anything anyone had ever really seen before. The visual effects supervisor, Douglas Trumbull, created a series of optical effects that felt futuristic and otherworldly (you can see the same fingerprints on his work through V'Ger in Star Trek: The Motion Picture).But, dramatically, you need to go back to The Dawn of Man to see what's going on. In the first sequence, the monolith provided early man with the knowledge of tools, something mundane to us but which was world changing to them. What's the next step up from where we are now? I don't know, and I imagine that you don't either. The light show (especially in combination with the choice of music, Ligeti's Requiem) shows us the character, Dave Bowman, moving from that which we can understand to that which we cannot until he suddenly appears in that hotel room.It is here that we see Bowman live out the rest of his natural life in a comfortable and knowable environment (whether that actually plays out in real time or if he actually spends decades in that room is unclear as it should be) until he makes the next evolutionary jump. He must die before he's reborn, an implication that the human race, in order to evolve to our next stage of life, must die first.HALIt pains me whenever I see HAL 9000 on a list of movie villains.To me, HAL is the one sympathetic character in the film, and I think that was by design. The humans in this film are all played fairly flat by the actors. They're almost non-entities. Frank and Dave are largely interchangeable. They look a fair bit alike and there's no real indication that they do anything different on the ship. In fact, when it comes to mission actions, they each go out to the satellite dish and perform the same task (first Dave, then Frank) as though neither one has any advantage over the other.HAL, though, is different. He's engaging, shows emotion, and is central to the mission in ways that neither Frank nor Dave are.Looking at Frank, Dave, and Dr. Floyd from earlier in the film, we see bland people who represent the character of humanity in this vision of the future. They are mostly boring. HAL is humanity's attempt at the next step in evolution, and they created someone more interesting.But, the devil is interesting and it doesn't make him good. Why do I consider HAL to not be a villain?If you look at the sequence of events that leads HAL to murdering the entire crew, I think it's easy to see. HAL detects a fault in a unit on the satellite dish. Dave brings the unit back and they find no fault. They all agree to put the unit back. Frank and Dave then go into a pod to discuss without HAL overhearing them. In that discussion, they decide to effectively kill HAL. HAL can also read lips, by the way.HAL read their lips and figured out what they were going to do, so he kills Frank and attempts to kill Dave (unsuccessfully). And, in a fit of cold logic, kills the hibernating three scientists on board knowing that they would deactivate him after waking up to find that he had killed the other two crewmen.If you ignore literally everything leading up to HAL's decision to kill Frank, he's obviously a bad guy, but including everything before hand makes him a far more sympathetic character. He was acting in self-defense, and when Dave Bowman goes into his brain to begin to pull bits out, killing HAL slowly and regressively until he's no more than a baby, singing ""Daisy"" like he did when he was first introduced to the world, it's tragic. Killing HAL is not a victory.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
104,Spleen,The only film in history worth seeing for the special effects alone,10,7 November 1999,"... And it ALSO has an intelligent script.  Conventional wisdom has it that no film needs both at once.The special effects have never been surpassed.  Remember this: unlike their digital counterparts, those gracefully sliding model spaceships look better, the bigger the screen.  I gather that Kubrick was still holding out against the digital tide at the very end of his life, insisting on animatronics rather than animation in his unfilmed `AI'.  Good for him.There IS one flaw - or at least, it appears to be a flaw at first.  It's the lighting.  The parts of the spacecraft in shadow ought to have been all but pitch black, since they are never exposed to anything stronger than Earthlight, and sometimes not even that.  Instead the shadows are the pale blue ones we'd expect to see at mid-afternoon on Earth.  Kubrick surely knew this was a mistake.  I suspect he simply wanted a very bright sunlit look that inky shadows precluded: and since we certainly feel the how pitilessly harsh and pure sunlight is in outer space, he probably made the right decision.What else can Kubrick do, apart from design the world's best special effects?  He's one of the few people who can use classical music in the score without making a fool of himself; and the only one, so far as I can tell, who can use Ligeti in the score at all.  He can deliver moments of pure dispassionate terror.  Most important of all in this kind of epic, he can make us feel that we're watching history itself.  I admit you may find it next to impossible to work out what happens at the end.  Not that it matters.  I gather it can be done: and you can always cheat and look up the answer in Arthur C. Clarke's book.  You'll probably be glad Kubrick was so elliptical.Did I mention the importance of a big screen?  Well, I'll mention it again. Travel to another city, if you have to, in order to see `2001' in a cinema.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

106,onepotato2,Miraculous,9,25 November 2007,"I love this movie. I give it enormous credit for being one of the earliest (and still rare) movies that cannot be watched without engaging the world of ideas; due to both the subject matter, and the terse style by which Kubrick advances the story. The viewer is asked to make enormous leaps between disparate and often wordless sequences, that don't telegraph meaning overtly. Understanding or enjoying the movie isn't possible if you refuse to be thoughtful or if you're a passive viewer. This was an affront to older audiences (See ""Rock Hudson"") conditioned to believe that entertainment was the first, last and only purpose for movies; and it was a revolution for younger audiences who were ready and willing to explore films potential, and see what was next in the 60s. The movie of ideas, and not the asinine, self-important ""issue"" movie that Hollywood loves to reward, is the highest use for film. Sadly, most movies ask nothing of viewers. Issue movies only ask that you bring your overblown, overvalued morality with you, and reach a conclusion the entire culture already agrees on. Give me a difficult movie that makes some demands.2001 is also entertaining. Humanity reduced to a pissing match with a computer is both chilling and extremely funny. (HAL: ""Dave, I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over."") Although I think the HAL plot line is a bit normative for a movie this ambitious.I'm not a member of the Kubrick cult, but I'm in awe; the movie is absolutely fearless, audacious & cinematic. It's a Rorschach test and a zen koan. It trains your attention purposefully on the awesome & the mundane; reminding viewers that most communication does not advance any complex plot in our lives or any noble purpose. It's used to pass almost useless info back and forth, to achieve trivial goals and to make small talk. Socially, we are ants.The attempt to predict how a mission... how an excavation on the moon would look, etc. are either dead-on or very interesting guesses. The movie would have been intriguing even if all it did was introduce the sober design logic it uses, and it's general thoughtfulness; i.e. the monolith has the dimensions of the first three ordinal numbers, squared: 1x4x9. On this viewing I was struck by the question of how the canvas of a movie screen might be used. Is film imagery about portraying things that aid the viewer in constructing a narrative, or is it about vicariously experiencing a characters vantage? The sequence in Dave Bowman's cage accepts both readings depending on which way it's to be understood. The sequences with the monolith suggest that the genre ""ghost story"" is separated from ""metaphysical exploration"" by only the thinnest of lines.Every frame of this movie is thoughtful AND beautiful. Hollywood has been able to do that, what... 4 times?. I'm a big fan of Citizen Kane, but that movie concerns, first and foremost, film technique, a wunderkind narrative, and a clever borrowing of a magnate's life. It doesn't make me think deeply about non-filmic ideas to any great degree; other than the obvious bromides about money not buying happiness, controlling people isn't being loved, etc.I'm struck now by how 2001 is overlooked in the ""best films of all time"" polls. 2001 is the better film, making it (for me) the most important film made in film history. Kane will have to settle for 2nd.Critic Stephen Hunter of the Washington Post quibbles that the movie is dumb because 2001 wasn't like this. (?!) How can you even respond to a remark that far off-course?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
107,Seraphion,"A good mystery thriller, but necessarily an entertaining one",5,18 September 2014,"The story opens in a very absurd way, forcing the viewers to look at what's supposedly the inspiration for Planet of the Apes movies for the whole 25 minutes or so. No dialog, just monkeys telling monkey tongues. But then the cinematography of the space condition and how they execute them is just an awesome job. Never before while I watch a movie I was intrigued into guessing at how did they do those anti gravity shots. The concepts of the futuristic technology are also very nice, and as we can see, they are not very different from what becomes reality nowadays. But that's all there is to it, and you'll only get them on little bits and pieces along the movie. Stanley Kubrick really likes the overall depressingly lonesome and gloomy mood of his work here. Despite the very good presentation of two conflicts, maybe three of you count those crazy monkeys, the abundance of duration without dialog, or even without meaning in the eyes of some, is overwhelmingly irritating for me. The acting overall is quite a nice job, despite the kind of stupid accents done by some.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Originally he stated ""It was best to feel it, rather than try to clarify some outlandish concept (which might sound foolish)."" Though I don't want to give away the explanation, if you have never seen it. The movie is indeed so far ahead of it's time, it's actually predicting way too much of mankind in 2001, a man mission to Jupiter, really? It was produced at a highly exciting time (for space exploration) and when you certainly had to use your own grey matter just to stay with this epic 'Science Fiction', extravaganza. The opening and closing theme by Richard Strauss, is simply magnifico!

And, really, all of this praise is truly deserved! It is a beautiful work of art, and even if you didn't like it (which is perfectly understandable), you should REALLY still appreciate the special effects in this film. It changed science fiction film history, and just film history in general.I mean, if the Academy hadn't given the Oscar to Kubrick for best visual effects, it'd probably be the biggest Oscar snub of all time! Of course, I don't take the Oscars all too seriously, so it wouldn't impact my life or anything.The film is broken up into a few parts, all eventually being connected to a black monolith. The unconventional structure of the film makes ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" even more interesting.Besides the unconventional structure, this film is experimental in many ways. It has some pretty experimental visuals, filmmaking techniques (including a particularly famous jump cut) , and a powerful and strange ending that begs to be analyzed by everyone who sees it! While I'm not the biggest fan of over-analyzing movies, this is definitely an exception through my eyes. The film clearly wants the viewers to interpret and analyze it, and that is what makes it even more interesting.Kubrick is clearly one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. The already mentioned experimental techniques and visual effects have truly influenced some of today's great filmmakers. The film also has a genius use of classical music. The music and the visuals match together beautifully, A lot of people may believe that this film is boring or nonsensical. While it is understandable to have those opinions, I was never bored during this film. It has intensity, mystery, and, of course, beauty!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
111,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,This is only for people who love Kubrick,2,30 May 2021,"The 1960s was a decade of many things. The topic that was not of this world during that time were literal space travel, like moon landings. Space and future science fiction stories would all become a staple for those ten years and onward. In film, more and more movies were beginning to revolve around this kind of setting too. From the late sixties, this film was one that has left people talking about it despite its bashing on release. More significantly, the man behind the film Stanley Kubrick is another reason why this movie has the reputation that it does. One thing to keep in mind is, Kubrick is not your standard director. So to expect something familiar or something close to familiar would be not wise if interested in seeing this film. That's not saying this movie is bad, but it is tough to get through.The story, adapted by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke author of the original literary work, is about a small space crew who goes to find out about a mysterious dark slab of whatever. This is about as much as the audience will receive on this. For a film that runs two and half hours, the next question is, what else goes on? Well...a lot of scenes that go nowhere. The biggest crime this film commits against its audience is robbing them of their time. Despite its run time, it seems Kubrick added almost all the wrong ingredients to make full use of the story and its characters. There are several irrelevant scenes that appear throughout the runtime which do not provide any clarity or explanations related to the plot at hand. Such wasted time went into presentation and very little into development.One can sympathize with being meticulous with a project and making sure establishing shots look good. However, when those kinds of shots take up multiple sections of the narrative, then the story ceases to captivate the viewer's attention. There are very few characters that take the focal point of the story. William Sylvester plays Dr. Floyd who's informed of the strange dark free standing tabletop. Then the writing jumps to Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), two humans aboard the space ship investigating the mysterious item. Accompanying them is their super computer guide HAL9000 voiced by Douglas Rain. Unfortunately, the only character who actually comes out remotely memorable is Rain's performance as HAL9000. However, this doesn't mean the computer is a well-rounded character. Most remember HAL9000 because of the soft and creepy voice over work Rain provided.Another issue with the execution is the tone Kubrick is trying to convey in the story. There are moments where the scene being portrayed feels like it supposed to be whimsical or lighthearted and then it abruptly shifts to what should be a horror film. These kinds of emotions are felt especially because of the music. Pacing though is by far the worst element to this picture. Most film fans are aware of how controlling Kubrick was with his films. Coming from a photography background, Kubrick seems to enjoy focusing on various shots in order to convey a message or have the viewer create their own message. However, for example, when the viewer has to see how a character executes a piece of machinery step by step, it is beyond boring. Taking the time for certain things are needed. Taking the time all the time is not.If there's one thing that does work to this film's credit is the cinematography. Why? Well it's Kubrick's biggest strength. With support from Geoffrey Unsworth who would later shoot for Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980), the visuals are great for their time. With much of the backgrounds being mattes, much of looks photorealistic. There's no discrediting it. It's just that, these shots would've been better suited being sold as art at an auction, not in a movie. Lastly the music used in the film is okay because it is so well known now and launched several parodies later on. But with knowing that, it can't be taken as seriously here either. Topping that off is that originally composer Alex North scored the movie, only for Kubrick to ultimately not use it. Thankfully North got a release of his score. It would've been nice to see it used instead.Presentation is the word for this film. All other important components that make a movie work come dead last. However, anyone who enjoys Kubrick films should find it enjoyable, although that's not saying much. For anyone else, there's practically no story, the tone is misguided and the execution takes forever to gain traction.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I had to read a lot about its hidden meaning to truly appreciate what Kubrick was trying to show us. Kubrick relies on limited dialogue and conveys a visual experience instead. It will take the average viewer time and reflection to figure this movie out, if one can figure it out. 2001 is so ahead and transcends so much that we are used to in terms of plots, twists and so on when it comes to film.2001 is about the human experience and the spirit. It delves so deep into what we are as a species. It also shows how AI can be a hindrance to human evolution. It is only until the astronaut cuts this off that he can get closer to the next level. Kubrick shows that AI is not true human evolution, we are semi-civilised and never thought about our own progress.

There is VERY little story, and the little that is there is not interesting.

116,brando647,"Absolutely Epic in Scope, Visually Stunning, and a Bit of a Rough Watch",8,17 January 2011,"I've watched Stanley Kubrick's epic science fiction film for the first time within the last few days, and it certainly gets into your mind and sticks. I've found myself thinking about it often, pondering over the subtext of the film and seeing what conclusions I come to. Kubrick has created an abstract film where each viewer is left to their own devices to find meaning. It begins in the past, as an extraterrestrial monolith spurs our man-ape ancestors to use their first tool/weapon. Thousands of years later, as man begins exploration of the lunar surface, a second monolith is discovered. It beams a powerful radio signal to Jupiter, leading to the next phase of man's interstellar journey. A mission of the utmost secrecy is dispatched to Jupiter. Two astronauts (Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood) attend to the ship's operations with the assistance of the advanced AI, HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), with three scientists in hibernation. Complications arise when HAL, who appears to have evolved enough sentience to feel emotion, becomes paranoid of the astronauts intentions and turns on them. Those who complete the mission will be catapulted into the next stage of evolution.I've gone years hearing about how epic Kubrick's film was. I'd tried watching it once as a child, gotten about ten minutes into the ""Dawn of Man"" sequence, and given up. It's certainly a rough watch for those with shortened attention spans. Kubrick fills his science fiction opera with long-winded scenes of slow-moving space vehicles drifting through their operations while classical music tinkers in the background. The dialogue is minimal and, with the exception of the Jupiter mission sequence with HAL and the astronauts, serves little purpose except to set the stage for the journey being undertaken. This isn't a commercial film meant to appeal to the masses. Kubrick has done what few others have successfully accomplished: used the film medium to create a piece of art. Images and music come together to tell a story of mankind's evolution and where it might eventually lead. The story is hardly the traditional three-act structure audiences are accustomed to, and the characters are barely developed. That's because it's not the characters that are important here, it's the human race as a whole and a vision of our next phase in the universe. The characters are merely tools in the story, and don't really carry it themselves.It's a trippy experience and I'm not so bold as to claim I fully understand it. The entire final act of the film is a fantastic mind-trip of color, sound, and psychedelic visuals leading to an odd conclusion in a glorious bedroom setting. I hope to avoid spilling too many details and urge those who are curious to watch it themselves, not that my descriptions will make the end any more clearer. Kubrick has stated that each audience member is to draw their own meaning from the film and I see it as being that humans must transcend their reliance on technology to achieve the next stage of evolution. The astronauts' confrontation with the similarly-evolved HAL 9000 seems to act as a final challenge to overcome this dependency, as well as their near-equal in evolutionary terms. The entire HAL sequence is my favorite part of the film and will probably remain one of the most memorable movie sequences ever (particularly the last bit as HAL sings ""Daisy""...it's so haunting...). As much as I want to share this film experience with friends, I'm aware it's not for everyone. Even with my intense interest in the film, I had a hard time sitting through some of the drawn-out sequences and the 2.5 hour run-time is pretty daunting. If you can manage it, it's worth watching because it can make for some fantastic conversation with other fans when it's all said and done.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
117,bkrauser-81-311064,Too Clinical to be Engaging,7,6 December 2013,"According to legend, during the premiere of 2001, Rock Hudson walked out of the screening yelling ""Will someone tell me what the hell this movie is about?"" Today I feel his frustration. Is the movie a marvel? Yes. Is this film ambitious? Yes. In the words of Bernardo Bertolucci a film ""made in poetry instead of prose?"" Yes. An entertaining film? Well...define entertaining. For while those on its wavelength would certainly benefit from having watched what is still regarded as not just a gold standard in science fiction but the ONLY standard in science fiction, others not inclined to watch ten minutes of flickering, tunneled lights shouldn't bother. My unbiased mind tells me I have just watched something near perfect, yet my biased, more affecting senses yen for something a little more emotionally rewarding.I honestly find 2001: A Space Odyseey to be prosaic. Stifled from the movie's top-heavy ambitions and need for perfection that it cannot register on an emotional level; at least not to me. It justifies itself by sending a message about technological society and how one day we will move beyond the tools we use to a higher form of consciousness.It's a message worth postulating and the midriff of the film properly highlights the movie's motif of said tools used for mutually assured destruction versus self-discovery but can't we encompass these themes into a tighter package? Then again I suppose if the film's point was introduced in familiar wrapping it would be easily digestible but also easily forgettable.Stanley Kubrick's work as a whole just doesn't hold much sway with me. His earlier work like The Killing (1956), Paths of Glory (1957) and Spartacus (1960) are to me, the perfect balance between intellectually stimulating and emotionally satisfying. Dr. Strangelove (1964), A Clockwork Orange (1971) Full Metal Jacket (1987) have their moments if only for their macabre sense of humor but 2001 along with Barry Lyndon (1975) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999) remain in my eyes, Kubrick at his most aloof.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",2001 - A Space Odyssey

They awaken to find a featureless black monolith has appeared before them. Guided in some fashion by the Black Monolith, one man-ape realizes how to use a bone as a tool and weapon; the tribe learns to hunt for food, and kills the leader of their rivals, reclaiming the water hole.Millions of years later, a Pan Am space plane carries Dr. Heywood Floyd to a space station orbiting Earth for a layover on his trip to Clavius Base, a United States outpost on the moon. After a videophone call with his daughter, Floyd's Soviet scientist friend and her colleague ask about rumors of a mysterious epidemic at Clavius. Floyd declines to answer. At Clavius, Floyd heads a meeting of base personnel, apologizing for the epidemic cover story but stressing secrecy. His mission is to investigate a recently found artifact buried four million years ago. Floyd and others ride in a Moonbus to the artifact, which is a monolith identical to the one encountered by the man-apes.

123,sme_no_densetsu,A wondrous journey from the dawn of man to beyond the infinite,9,9 July 2008,"Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is rightly recognized as a cinema classic. It is a film that everyone should see at least once though those who appreciate it will certainly not restrict themselves to a single viewing.In fact, given the complexity of the story, multiple viewings are recommended. The plot is relatively simple (at least until the later stages) but it is the underlying themes that will occupy your thoughts. The film leaves much up to the interpretation of the viewer, so there is plenty of material to ruminate upon.This is a film that says a lot by saying very little. There isn't much dialogue and sound of any kind is typically kept to a minimum. The story is mostly told in a visual manner, at times augmented by deftly chosen music. In particular, the segments supported by Strauss's 'Blue Danube' waltz are among the most beautiful ever committed to celluloid.Overall, Kubrick's direction is impeccable, as is the cinematography. Amazingly, the special effects (which earned the film it's sole Oscar) are strikingly realistic, even by today's standards. The music is also top-notch, not to mention genuinely iconic.The actors don't have a lot to do but they perform their roles admirably. Ironically, the most memorable role is the super-computer HAL, which conveys more with a voice than many actors do with their full range of body language.I've written this after seeing the film for the third or fourth time but only the first on the big screen. Let me tell you, if you ever get a chance to see this film in a theatre don't miss it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
124,punishmentpark,Not as captivating as it once was.,8,25 February 2015,"It must have been at least ten or fifteen years since I last saw '2001: a space odyssey', and must say I'm somewhat disappointed this time around. Even though, apparently, the meaning of the film has been discussed endlessly, the story is not all that complicated. Apes are confronted with a perfect object which shoot their development into the human kind. Stanley Kubrick assumes we all know what happened next and moves on, off into space. There, the same perfect object stuns mankind again. Then, finally man (in the form of an astronaut who is on a mission to investigate another case concerning the perfect object) is confronted with the object again, this time in a setting that seems to cut through time and space itself. And then you can still debate a lot of what's been going on, of course... does the object stand for death? Or the limitations of human kind? Or is there a significant circular motion present here? Etc..The first part of the film I found to be rather cheap and silly; actors in monkey suits, a desert with some okapis, two rival ape gangs, and then, suddenly, that object, and... bloody murder, and mankind is born! Apart from what Kubrick is trying to say (honestly, I'm not sure, but Darwin and - or versus - religion múst have something to do with it), it wasn't all that impressive to me.The next parts are much better, since the visual virtuosity is at times stunning and the space stations and such look terrific (ranging from 'two steering wheels put together' to a 'robotized spermatozoon', but still). The part with HAL is my favorite (check the swan song), things become pretty eerie and claustrophobic there. Also, the part where Dave 'finds himself finding himself and so on', in rooms that are a mix of very old and futuristic features, is just perfect. One more highlight: when Dave is exercising in his 'treadmill in outer space'.In all parts, I'm not always happy with the use of classical music, at times it is just to pompous. But, at other times, it works just perfectly, although I find it very hard nót to think about Homer's Osydssey with that one particular theme - Homer Simpson, that is.I remember my first viewing(s) being (utterly) captivating, but this time around it wasn't always so, especially in the first part. Still, plenty to enjoy and ponder about. The bits with the futuristic foods was quite funny at times, even though gen-tech food is a serious issue - even more so today (Monsanto)!A small 8 out of 10.P.s.: The Soviet-Union 'counterpart' movie 'Solyaris' (1972) - I never saw it before about a year ago - has much more emotional appeal on me, as opposed to '2001: a...' being more scientific and aloof.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
125,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,The film that defined science fiction cinema.,10,16 September 2015,"Stanley Kubrick was a man of many talents; he knew the mysteries of the universe, and only he could show the world a visually complex tale of space travel, alien technology and only scratching the surface of the secrets in the universe. 2001: A Space Odyssey is still a masterpiece not just of science fiction, but cinema as a medium.Kubrick made a film so ahead of his time back in 1968, that it's a bit of a wonder why so few films since A Space Odyssey have reached its level of cinematic ambition and complexity. This is one of the few films to show space as a void we're only just beginning to know about, not some battlefield that breaks the rules of the vacuum on command. This is a film that spans millions of years, from the dawn of man to the film's interpretation of our future.2001 is one of those rare films that has its sense of spectacle accompanying the story, rather than being separate from the story like many $150 million+ CGI fests of today. Kubrick made this film its very own thing: a film of science fiction that was well and truly ahead of the sci-fi films of its day. It still holds up visually and narratively to this day and will for generations to come.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
126,dunmore_ego,Also sprach Kubrick und Clarke,10,1 June 2006,"Long before Douglas Adams, in *2001: A Space Odyssey*, Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke tackle Life, the Universe and Everything.The result? Monolithic! A movie where everything exciting happens in the human mind. No aliens blasting at each other as if they were cowboys from 1870 Earth, or rocket sleds blaring loudly in space and explosions of spacecraft as if they were in an atmosphere; no plots to ""rule the galaxy"" as if it was a serfdom easily circumnavigated in a day or two - in the grandest irony, *2001* uses none of the conventions it was responsible for spawning in its wildly-inferior successors to the space-movie throne  the *Star Trek* and *Star Wars* franchises. And all other ""space"" dross that would issue from the mind of man.With the simple placement of an inexplicable, anachronous object  The Monolith - Clarke and Kubrick forge the best ""true science fiction"" adventure of all time. For this is how a truly ""alien"" intelligence might come amongst us  not in papier-mâché flying saucers or as disguised humans  but in the form of a seemingly benign message of superiority as non-intrusive as a hammer.The adventure begins with primeval ancestors of mankind  ape-like beings struggling for existence in a prehistoric African veldt  who come upon The Monolith, which acts as a stimulant for their latent intelligence. Soon these man-apes have conquered their surroundings through power, realized in the simple wielding of a femur bone.The action leaps ahead in what Clarke calls ""the longest flash-forward in the history of movies""  three million years, to 2001, when a manned moon base uncovers a Monolith not unlike that which woke our ancestors from their bestial slumber in prehistoric Africa. It is, like its prehistoric brother, black, featureless, light-absorbent and an utter mystery. After emitting a startling radio signal aimed at Jupiter, it falls silent.Cut forward once again, to the spaceship *Discovery*, on a mission to Jupiter to find out exactly why the Monolith spoke its single syllable there.After first viewing *2001*, you will dismiss Kubrick as indulging his inner hippie-chick with random futuristic images burdened with faux-portent due to the elitist soundtrack. After the second viewing, you will be contemplating which room of your house to sacrifice to your Kubrick Shrine.With a soundtrack so lush and awe-inspiring it kept hippies and music enthusiasts alike rooted to their seats in expectation, *2001* forged a new vernacular for the ""sound of space."" By applying well-known source music to his film, Kubrick breathed new life into Johann Strauss' *The Blue Danube*, György Ligeti's *Lux Aeterna* and *Atmosphères*, and of course, Richard Strauss' *Also sprach Zarathustra* (""Thus Spoke Zarathustra""), the movie's euphoric main theme, with its elegant horns, glittering organ and pounding timpani standing on hind legs and beating its chest like an alpha silverback.As Arthur C. Clarke has grown nauseated in telling, *2001* was not only culled from his short story *The Sentinel*, but from six other tales as well: *Breaking Strain, Out of the Cradle, Endlessly Orbiting, Who's There, Into The Comet* and *Before Eden.* With such a powerfully understated and enigmatic performance in both this movie and its inferior sequel, *2010: Odyssey Two* (1984), it is unlikely that Kier Dullea will ever be remembered for anything else - and unlikely that he will ever be forgotten. Dullea is Dave Bowman, who, along with fellow astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) faces the adversity not only of the Monolith's mysteries, but of their malfunctioning on-board computer, HAL 9000.Ultimately, it is for him that Destiny crouches and pounces on, as The Monolith works its wild wonders on his frail humanity Speaking in tongues, Kubrick and Clarke swirl Bowman through anomalies in the space-time continuum and craft a resolution to Life itself. With Bowman's transmogrification to that of Star-Child, his essence sloughing off physical flesh, his rebirthed cosmic embryo looks back on a distant Earth.Released in 1968, utilizing the hardest real science of its time, Clarke and Kubrick not only achieved Kubrick's dream of making the proverbial ""really good science fiction film,"" but gave their audience over to the most cerebral speculations known outside the marijuana-drenched hippie community. How to wrap our minds around nothing less than the power that engines the universe? Dave Bowman's transcendence is not a death  it is a subsuming. (As Carl Sagan epically notes, ""We are all star stuff."") With no mysticism or religion intimated, it is a grand vision of all things being one. Of all man's adventures of discovery, when our minds are thus freed, it will be our grandest odyssey of all.Thus spoke Kubrick and Clarke.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",2001 - A Space Odyssey
127,KUAlum26,"Another big screen marvel,utterly lost on small screen",7,12 February 2006,"I have always appreciated the visual marvels of this movie. The images are powerful and lasting,and the usage of classical music to add awe to the effects of mankind's venture into space was a very smart decision on the part of Stanley Kubrick and the editors of the film. HAving said that,I can think of far more engaging stories that have been committed to celluloid.The film,an adaptation of Arthur C.Clarke's 1963 bestseller,is probably best summed as a study in contrasts: the first,a dry look at the beginnings of man on Earth,learning to tame nature and each other,the second,mankind's utilization of technology and it's betray of man. The problems to me with this film are probably as much its most distinctive traits: namely,the pacing is glacially slow,there is precious little dialog and the visual image effects are drawn out to the point of tedium. If you are straining your ears for some sort of plot resolution or denouement from the characters involved,or seeking a central point of focus in this movie,you will be sorely disappointed. Having said that,this film is far better viewed on a large screen or an IMAX,because this film's qualities seem to befit a medium that allows for a sense of awe or wonder. Seeing this on a small screen broadcast or on VHS almost completely dilutes the experience. To true film fans,this film is AT LEAST worth a look or two.

But then I saw it again and begin to understand more of the concept. I do was impressed by the special effects used in this movie. I mean for 1968, everything seemed so realistic (except for the apes in the beginning of the movie). A rare gem. But it was not until I saw the sequel ""2010"" that made me really understand and appreciate ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".Spoiler: The movie is about the birth of a planet. To put it in more abstract and philosophical terms it is about the beginning and the end! Maybe this is too much for some of you,but if you keep an open mind and just watch you will be amazed by this movie which will end up in something of a ""trip"" The last 20 minutes just have to been seen. It is simply beautiful. Because there is no conventional story Kubrick's abstract approach works. You keep watching even when it doesn't make sense.

129,Cosmoeticadotcom,Great,10,1 September 2010,"the very reasons 2001 succeeds as a great film is not because it simply awes us, although moments do, but because, like all great films, it touches us, and deeply, in ways that many viewers are not even aware of, and none that require genius. The film succeeds in myriad little moments that all can relate to. I mentioned Dr. Floyd's banter with colleagues on the way to the monolith site, but there is the ecstatic 'first violence' in the murder of the rival man-ape early on. This is a vivid redo of the Cain and Abel myth, and how many of us wish we were so excited that we could toss an object into the air like the murderous man-ape does his bone weapon? Then there is Floyd with his daughter on the space videophone, and a circumspect Floyd being confronted by the smiling Russians. There is the scene where Poole gets a video birthday wish from his parents, and acts ho-hum about it. There is the scene where Bowman must release the recaptured corpse of his friend to outer space to save himself and the mission, and the very fact that, despite being on the mission for his cool demeanor, Bowman hurriedly forgets his space helmet to retrieve the body in the first place shows a deep connection between emotion and action that a didactic spoken resolution could never achieve. There are other moments, as well, but it is in these moments, often dismissed as banalities, that the film actually pulls the viewer into the tale. That so many critics miss these rather obvious connections shows just how attuned to lowest common denominator action, violence, and bluntly obvious things, most filmgoers are. Yet, it's the parallax of this lack against the grandness of the other parts of the film that pulls the mind like taffy between the antipodes. And it is this stretching wherein the film's greatness lies.Another point that goes unnoticed is how and why, if HAL is so 'insane,' the computer simply does not turn off all oxygen and heat inside the spaceship when the two waking astronauts sleep? Perhaps one of them needed to be awake while the other slept and would have simply unplugged HAL, but it does seem that HAL's flaws in programming, the ones that make him more 'human,' also make him a flawed antagonist. And this is yet another aspect of the film, lost in all the talk of its grandeur, and superlatives, that is lost on most viewers and critics, yet part of the doll within doll within doll like nature of the film that buoys its claim to all time great status. There's simply no doubt, after watching this film, that both it and its creator deserve the label great.

What it TOTALLY means is anyone's guess, but the film is filled with enough iconic images that you'll recognize anywhere from Polaris to The Simpsons (actually, the Simpsons uses a LOT of Kubrick references). Essentially, a trip through mankind, from cavemen to the then future (skipping out everything in between) 2001 treats us to a visionary and audio spectacle that's really hard to compare to anything else. I mean, the plot can go a million ways.. Is this about the beginning of man conquering inventions and the end, when the inventions conquer man (or at least attempt to?)

133,Jeremy_Urquhart,"The First ""Critically Acclaimed"" Film I Didn't Like",7,25 June 2011,"As a piece of art, 2001: A Space Odyssey could well be considered a masterpiece. The film was certainly ahead of its time in regards to special effects, and I must admit, I was initially impressed by the space sequences and the various other pre-CGI special effects. The main theme (Also Sprach Zarathustra) is amazing too.But for me to truly enjoy a film, I need to feel connected to it somehow, whether it be intellectually or emotionally. 2001 almost lost me in the first 3 minutes. Literally. The film opens with 171 seconds of pure darkness, a blank screen, with a mere droning sound in the background. I thought my DVD player had broken. What a way to start a movie; panicking about the fact your DVD player may be broken.Then the film starts, and the opening titles were great. Also Sprach Zarathustra sounded amazing, and I was excited. Cut to 5 minutes later, and I was watching monkeys yelling at each other. Coincidentally, I found myself yelling too. At my screen.The pain doesn't stop there, as I was then treated to an additional 2 whole hours of repetitive, tedious outer-space docking sequences, bland dialogue, stiff acting, an almost complete lack of emotion, essentially no cohesive narrative, and a vague and ultimately unsatisfying conclusion.Throughout the entire film, I was just waiting for a moment of engagement. I was waiting for that moment where I became engrossed in a rich, unique science fiction experience; the moment where my eyes opened and I realized the sheer genius of Kubrick's ""master-piece.""That moment never came, and I was so over-whelmed in disappointment at the film's conclusion that I broke down in tears. I'm not even kidding. I wept, sobbed, and cried. I'd wasted 130 minutes of my life watching a tedious, pretentious science fiction film. I'd gained nothing from the experience, yet I had tried so hard to get into it and enjoy it. Above all, I felt ashamed. You know, maybe I don't ""understand"" 2001. Maybe those lovers of film who hold their noses up the highest will look down on me and sneer, and tell me that I'm shallow, that I'm not willing to watch something without gratuitous sex and violence. They'd tell me that I shouldn't go sticking my down-turned nose into such a ""high-class"" film like 2001, and that I should stick to the Transformers movies. To which I'd reply, ""but Stanley Kubrick was my favorite director prior to watching this film.""Which is true, by the way. A Clockwork Orange may be one of my all time favorites. Both The Shining and Dr Strangelove are near masterpieces in my eyes, and I also thought Full Metal Jacket was great too.But alas, 2001: A Space Odyssey just didn't do it for me. Perhaps it was the fact that I found it too slow, too abstract, or perhaps it wasn't quite what I was expecting. Still, the film is not entirely worthless in my eyes. It did contain a number of special effects that I found to look impressive even in this CGI-infested day and age, and the film does also feature some interesting music and imagery. Other than that, though, I couldn't find it in me to like any other aspect of this film.It was the first film I've ever viewed that truly made me break down into tears, although not in the way that I perhaps had hoped.1.5 STARS OUT OF 5.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
134,TheUnknown837-1,"recently, I saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for the third time, but understood it for the first",10,1 February 2010,"For a long time, Stanley Kubrick's most influential and controversial movie, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", was a befuddling enigma to me. I've pondered over the movie for ages now, trying to reason really what it was about and more importantly, what I thought of it. A few moments ago, I saw the movie for the third time, but for the first time I understood it and I understood why it has gone on to become one of the most celebrated movies of all time. I'll be honest; for a long time, I didn't think much of ""2001"" and now that I look back on those previous two experiences of watching it, I feel a little embarrassed that I was so far off the mark before. I just had to learn that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was not a film to be taken at face value; it was about something else. And that something else cannot be determined by a majority. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is about the individual's relation to the universe around him, and because human minds are as infinite as the stars, they are just as varied.I always knew what ""2001"" was about in plot. It's a movie that is about humankind and man's relationship to the universe, composed of three stories that are interconnected in one of the most cosmically fascinating manners. The first part of the story concerns the dawn of man. The second relates to man's discovery of an artifact on the moon, hinting that maybe man is not the only intelligent being in the universe. The third revolves around a mission to Jupiter, in which the ship's computer, the famous villain HAL 9000, turns on the astronauts. And from here a fourth, most symbolic and controversial story emerges. That's what ""2001"" is about. *in plot.* What's it's *really* about is up to you.""2001"" means something a bit different to everybody. Some even think it has some religious (or even anti-religious) subtexts. Personally, I don't think so. To me, ""2001"" is about mankind's progress, but only in scientific terms. To my mind, it's about the progression of man from being a dumb brute to realizing that he possesses something that is greater than the stars and planets and his own machines that physically dwarf him in the universe. And the mysterious black monoliths whose origins go unexplained throughout the film are sort of like milestones in man's progress. And his progress is not his technological advances, but his intellectual ones. Throughout the movie, there is lots of symbolism about man's intelligence and how he uses it to overcome obstacles that lay before him. That's what it means to me.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a different kind of masterpiece. It does not work, as Roger Ebert noted, on a human level. The characters are flat and two-dimensional, acting is amateurish, there is not an extreme amount of development, but it doesn't really matter in a movie like this. The movie utilizes visual means to carry an impact to the audience and somehow this makes the movie even more powerful. I do think it would be even more of a masterpiece if it did work on a human level, but then the already stretched running time might slow down some more. Ironically enough, the most charisma and the most emotion comes not from our astronauts, but from HAL, the monotonous-voiced computer who turns lethal when threatened with his own ""life."" Stanley Kubrick won the only Oscar in his career not for directing, but for the special effects, which are jaw-dropping even by today's standards. They are especially awesome today, forty-some years since the movie's debut, because it staggers the imagination to wonder how they could have been done in the 1960s. But what makes these effects so special is not the mere fact that they are eye candy, but because they are used with imagination and delicacy so even the four-plus-minute sequences where very little besides objects floating in outer space coupled with Johann Strauss's waltzes can be mesmerizing.It took me a long time and three views, but at last I do understand why people cherish ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Not only is it a truly mesmerizing film, but it's a deeply symbolic one about man's folly and success. But what's best of all is that it means somethingand not something definite, but individualized. It meant something to its creators and it means something different to us as individuals. That's an odd parallel to life, isn't it? Now for some, the movie is too long and I agree the running time is a little stretched and Kubrick might have done the film some good if he chopped a few sequences of space exploitation, but overall, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is an amazing accomplishment not merely in special effects, but in cinema. It's a different kind of masterpiece – one that takes some getting used to it – but it is a marvel much like outer space itself.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
135,film-critic,2001: A Great Reason to Stay Home and Explore Space,10,10 May 2008,"""2001"" is a pioneer of science fiction film-making, which inspired a new generation and gave audiences more than just cheap effects with little green men. Kubrick created a film that makes you think, not just about what is happening on the screen, but also what the future holds. In 1968, 2001 seemed like a million years away, and this is what Kubrick thought we would look like  now, in 2008, if he were alive  he could make a film called ""2012: A Space Odyssey"" and this critic would believe his view of the distant future. Kubrick opens our film with the power of sound. Like an opera beginning its set, we are left in the dark as our musicians begin their concertos that fill our ears with emotion and the unknown. Beginning in this way, it takes us (in a positive way) out of the feeling of the film, and that we are sitting in the best seats of the house for a performance of the theater of the absurd. With words reminiscent of Beckett, Kubrick brings both a voice and a sound to this film that is difficult to find in today's modern science fiction films. A modern similarity would be the independent film ""Primer"", but even that is a long shot. What makes ""2001"" more than just a film is the classical music Kubrick uses. As the film progresses, it feels as if the music was made with this film in mind. The ""dawn of man"" with the booming overture as our ape ancestors claw at the monolith will, and has, remained a staple in the cinematic world. With this sheet of black metal, Kubrick created a sound and an image that could never be duplicated  while some have tried  the emotion and feeling when the Sun and Earth crest the monolith on Mars can never be reproduced. With a minimal script, language used as a secondary way to complete the story, the sound needed to be perfect  and the full bodied orchestra did better than perfect. It created a sound for a place that is devoid of everything except darkness  space.With my ogling of sound complete, there were other elements of ""2001"" that were equally sharp and powerful. By dating a film there is always the risk of arriving to that date without finding any of the predictions true, the film becomes a cultural hick-up and forgotten in the canyons of cinema. What makes Kubrick's film impeccable is its ability to grow outside of the normality of average science fiction. While it holds a date of 2001, it does not mean that the Kubrick's themes become dated. This is difficult to explain, but watching ""2001"" in 2008 still was impressive. The technological advances, the exploration of the unknown, the questionable ethics of evolution still resonates in today's society and I feel that Kubrick knew this while making this film. Sure, this was his idea (or perhaps Clarke's idea) of the future, but it is still the future. By book marking it with the unspoken birth of humanity and with the rebirth of the ""Space Child""  it transcends the 2001-esquire moments. What makes this film go beyond the 2001 pitfall is that rarely is it mentioned the actual date. Outside of the title sequence and the brief moment with HAL, this film could be placed anywhere  and it does. Do not be fooled by the title, this is still a relevant film today as it was yesterday and through the years to come.One still cannot speak about this film without talking about HAL and that infamous line about the ""pod bay doors"". It has become more than just cultural chatter, but wine-chatter with film snobs. It is an important and provocative moment of the film, but the events surrounding it contain just as much recognition. In one fell swoop, HAL changes and the dawn of man becomes a page in the history books. The machines have become smarter than their creators, and a new dawn has arrived. Kubrick's scenes surrounding HAL were phenomenally spooky. That looming yellow eye stayed with me long after the film and can be still seen in current cinematic releases. With one fell swoop of the camera, Kubrick created man, developed the monolith, brought fear into technology, and then attempted to explain the meaning of life. Overall, this film has impressed me completely. The Homer-esquire journey that we, the viewer, take on this film is unparalleled in any other cinematic adventure. No other director could have helmed this project as well as given the darkness, the fear, the hope, and the overall sense of excitement to the screen. Kubrick was a film pioneer, his voice can continue to be heard today with any science fiction film that is released, and it is all due to this one singular film that chose to open with darkness and the score of an opera, and end with the eyes of a child. This is a science fiction film, but it is more than that. This is a history book. It is a page of our life that nobody wants to see. The monolith could represent anything, and there are film classes that spend years discussing it  and that is why this movie will remain firmly rooted in our catalog. I loved the sounds, I loved the technology, I loved the dark vacuum of space, but most importantly, I loved the unknown. This was not a linear story that one could watch and forget about  out of respect to Kubrick  watch this film, watch it again  point out the unknown and keep it fresh in your friend's mind. This is a glowing example of why films are made.Grade: ***** out of *****",2001 - A Space Odyssey
136,proud_luddite,An Almost Masterpice,9,22 April 2019,"This science-fiction classic has four sequences all of which include a mysterious black monolith that has special powers: 1) a pre-historic story of a group of apes trying to survive; 2) a future in which humans occupy space stations and there is a concern of an epidemic at one of those stations; 3) a space mission to Jupiter in which two astronauts are at work with a computer, HAL 9000, who is supposedly perfect but maybe not so; 4) a truly ""spacey"" sequence to follow #3.Like many films, this one is to be judged on both style and substance. For substance, only the third sequence is clear and brilliantly made. The subtle conflicts between HAL and the astronauts has the tension of a horror movie. It is also worth noting that HAL seems to have more emotion than the humans. This is especially notable in a scene where one astronaut is indifferent and emotionless while receiving a recorded video message from his parents. The scene in which HAL suspects a conspiracy is one of film history's greatest.The other three sequences are still interesting but often unclear. It is debatable as to whether clarity is necessary as the intention was to get to the viewers' subconscious minds. While this works well, more clarity might have been more preferable to close at least a few links in the mystery.The style in all four sequences can easily be described as sublime. It's no wonder so many consider this film to be a masterpiece. Director Stanley Kubrick's use of visuals, and special effects with classical music is heavenly. The imaginative set designs of the space stations and vehicles are also amazing.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is over half a century old. While technology and special effects have advanced greatly since its time, the film's effect remains so strong that it is still the benchmark science-fiction film to which all others must be compared.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:

137,emasterslake,Amazing and one of a kind.,8,2 November 2005,"I first rented this movie back in Summer 2005. I kept hearing that this movie is very good.I was amazed on how they made this movie. It's special effects are like ahead of it's time. And this is older than the original Star Wars.This is about how the Earliest Human like creatures on earth experience a mysterious Black Rectangle that appears out of no where.It reappears on the earth's moon in an alternate 2001 A.D.A time where space stations and rockets are revolving around the earth.And a man sent on a space journey to investigate Jupiter. And a computer with a mind of it's own.Please know this movie is very long going with long silent parts that have little dialog.But still a great Sci-Fi flick to check out. The special effects in it are just amazing, it seemed like it was impossible to do that kind of stuff back then. Specially when this film was made 25 years before CGI was invented.If it weren't for this film George Lucas would never of gotten the inspiration to do Star Wars.It's rated G, since there's nothing too inappropriate for kids to see. But this is a little boring and long for a kid to sit and watch.Highly recommended to those who like old school Sci-Fi films.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Then it jumps to space travel and it lost me completely. I couldn't bridge the two scenes of the movie to make sense. Then, it gets very interesting with visuals and some explanation and without warning shifts again to a long space voyage. The rest completely through me and when we were walking out of the theater, I asked several people what was this movie about? Two passed on explaining it one guy said you have to read the book. I did and then went to see the movie again and it all made sense. This movie has to be explained or you get lost. You need a guide. Book is excellent reading...go from there",2001 - A Space Odyssey
139,hnt_dnl,The greatest film of all time!,10,15 April 2008,"Is 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY about anything? Is it about nothing? Is it about everything? This is the joy of this masterpiece. Who knows? Who cares? It has no real plot, no real storyline to follow, no characters to get into (save for one that I will mention later). Personally, I think it's about man's miniscule existence in a completely awesome, unknown universe. The fact is: we DON'T know what is out there and probably never will. This is what makes this film the best sci-fi experience in all of history. It captures the essence of space travel as it really is w/o ever being a boring film to watch. The ambiguous ending only adds to the allure of the film and makes one ponder, wonder, and dream. Tracking man's journey from its evolutionary origins and fast-forwarding to the year 2001 in the age of space travel and moon landings, the film is a testament to man's capacity to think, absorb, learn, understand (or at least try to) and explore a vast and ever-changing universe.As stated, the film starts millions of years ago to the time when apes were learning how to hunt, kill, eat, and seek shelter to survive the vast earth, then jump-cuts (perhaps the most famous cut in all of film history) to the year 2001 and man roaming the universe in search of other life forms. This cut on the surface is about the evolution of man, but it is symbolic of how the humans of the future still were still learning and exploring just like the apes of the past. Evolution never stops.The 2001 humans find a mysterious monolith buried on the moon during an excavation (the apes of the past also encountered a similar monolith). They send a group of astronauts on a fact-finding mission to Jupiter to learn of its origins and what it all means. The astronauts are led by Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). The Jupiter spaceship is controlled by an advanced, thinking, supercomputer with the acronym HAL-9000, and HAL-9000 is that 'character' that I mentioned before. HAL (a machine!) is the only character that we can relate to. HAL is supersmart, but very self-serving and diabolical, as a malfunctioning system threatens its very existence. So HAL schemes and plots against his astronaut companions to sabotage the mission. These sequences are among the most memorable in film history as the astronauts must outsmart HAL in order to survive and complete the mission.Bowman does survive and journeys through some kind of a black hole or wormhole to seemingly another vast part of the galaxy. This sequence still fascinates to this day. During travel, Bowman mysteriously ages quickly and then is actually re-born and the cycle starts over for him. Ambiguity has never been so fascinating! I just think that 2001 is the greatest film ever b/c of the fact that it doesn't have characters to love or hate and is about something more than just what most movies are about. The film never disappoints, as even the most acclaimed movies sometimes do.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
140,hall895,"Slow, frustrating film that leads to...what exactly?",4,14 May 2005,"This movie, hailed my many as an all-time classic, does have a lot going for it. It is beautifully photographed. The special effects were for its time revolutionary. And there is a truly fascinating story there to be told. Unfortunately it is in the storytelling that 2001 suffers. The film raises many questions, then spends over two hours not answering them. For much too much of that time absolutely nothing happens. But you stay with it because there seems to be the possibility of a great payoff at the end. Yet the ending frustrates just as much as all that came before it, perhaps more so. You may well find yourself saying ""I waited two hours for THAT? And what the heck was that anyway?"" I do not believe a movie has to lay all the answers out for you. Some of the best films of all time are very much left open to your own interpretation. But the answers we are given here are so unsatisfying and ultimately confusing that we wonder why we went through the trouble of watching at all.Again this movie does have a lot going for it and it is easy to see why so many praise it. It certainly seems to be one of the most polarizing films of all time. Love it or hate it, there is no in between. While I would not recommend it I must say the movie sets up a fascinating premise. The opening sequence which takes place in prehistoric times goes on a tad too long but is rich with symbolism and intrigue and sets up well the themes of the movie. Many are fascinated by the evolution of man, the questions ""Why are we here?"", ""How did we get here"", and ""What exactly is it all about?"" In this film, man sets off on a quest for answers to these questions. Unfortunately the answers don't satisfy. If it is answers you seek perhaps you should see the sequel 2010 which if nothing else sheds some light on what in the world the last twenty minutes or so of 2001 was all about. If you want to see the true genius of Kubrick then Dr. Strangelove or A Clockwork Orange will do quite nicely. Enjoy what is good about 2001....the beautiful photography, the special effects, the great and fascinating character of the computer HAL. But be forewarned that this long journey does not lead to a satisfying destination.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
141,marcin_kukuczka,Awe Inspiring Work Filled with Discoveries,9,1 November 2014,"A movie fan at one of the cinematic conferences once spoke up and said that the best idea in a film is not to give any ready made answers but leave everything open to viewers' interpretations. In this case, we are all a part of art that we watch, we admire, we criticize but, foremost, discover. This assumption proves particularly suitable for Stanley Kubrick's 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY inspired by a short story by Arthur C. Clarke.What strikes viewers most about the film are the questions that the theme provokes and answers that we are likely to find in ourselves. But...nothing ready on a platter! Not much is given to us except for thrilling experience of a journey, a titled odyssey. The central theme-ODYSSEY the location-SPACESHIPS/THE UNIVERSE. In that respect, it seems inevitable to quote Roger Ebert who rightly pointed out in his review that Kubrick's genius does not lie in ""how much"" but ""how little."" Almost everything is left to us, which makes it a very difficult screen achievement and, simultaneously reflective, such ""a philosophical statement about a man's place in the universe"" (Ebert).From the first sequence titled ""Dawn of Man,"" we see apes with an obvious aspect of imprisoning our vision within a certain framework. Nevertheless, soon, we discover that these apes begin to think. A sort of Cartesius' ""Cogito Ergo Sum"" or rather an inner existence that blends with the outer reality. Something driven by some supreme power? While we begin with dawn of man, we don't end with twilight of man. Here, rather, one could quote Steven D Greyfanus who observes that the movie makes a point about our existence and consciousness which are not self explanatory. Questions arise when a black monolith appears: a challenge for the apes...some mystery which will appear more times in the movie. Is it some limitation that emerges from it? Or rather some superior reality to discover only when man drowns in it?Steven D Greyfanus interestingly claims that ""2001: A Space Odyssey doesn't just depict a quantum leap forward in human consciousness — it practically requires such a leap, on an individual scale, from the viewer."" The movie is a challenge in itself, a challenge to rise above any ready made concepts of what a movie should be like, what it should look like, what it should evoke but encounter something new, even in the genre itself. To develop this point a bit, Greyfanus goes deeper comparing this odyssey to classical Odyssey by Homer...while in the mythology, the destination is clear, it is home, in the film, it is unknown. For can any man grasp the indefinite reality of the universe and its mystery? Roger Ebert memorably notes: ""the film is not about a goal but a quest."" The characters are the heroes of this quest. Mind you that many of them, in particular Dr Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) or Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) in the star sequence are the characters who rely solely on the intellect. In a truly unforgettable 'communication' with the on-board computer HAL 9000, there is, however, an intense desire for meaning, a quest for reasoning, search for answers. At the same time, there appears intense care not to allow any 'violation' of the mission's goals. But...at one point, man breaks a certain limit and goes too far. The realms of technology are going, the realms of human mind are going, what is left if the gravity of mind does no longer occur sufficient? The infinite that goes with Jupiter (not only the name of the planet but, for some reason deliberate or coincidental, the name of the Roman god).At that moment, we may all agree with Roger Ebert who says that it is a ""transcendent film"" and a ""silent film.""Primarily, 2001 SPACE ODYSSEY relies on visuals and music. There is not much dialog and if it appears, it is reduced to the maximum minimum, almost to a pseudo computerized interaction. There is not much 'humanity' in the language, not to say feelings. Even the 'Daisy' song or 'Happy birthday' that parents sing to their son seem to lack the basic enthusiasm and result in something artificial, robot-like. Visuals and music! The former is a unique achievement that helps us all experience the film in an unforgettable way. Seeing the movie on the big screen recently, I felt its intense effects to a grand scale. Kudos to cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth. Music, however, is an even more inspiring aspect.What a terrific choice of CLASSICAL MUSIC! Not only is it an undertone of a unique human ability, but there is another greater undertone to that. Let me quote Roger Ebert again. He observes that any music score would go with conventionalized methods of evoking action and would underline the storyline. ""The classical music,"" however, ""exists outside the action."" It is an ever present companion of man on his journey to the unknown, on his way to hear deeper, more profoundly. The waltz by Johann Strauss THE BLUE DANUBE seems to evoke a dance in the universe, outside of any gravity and within a greater power. Meanwhile, ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" by Richard Strauss marks the crescendo of emotions within phases of discoveries.The absolutely unpredictable finale brings everything to an uncommon conclusion, after all. You feel as if you have just started to watch this film. Time is not important but far more thought provoking is the fact that this art does not resort to pessimism of nothingness but appears to celebrate, inside us and outside us, the infinite mystery of human life.Prepare for something hard, sometimes vague and very odd, but worth enduring till the end.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

143,MrGKB,Despite the passage of nearly four decades...,10,19 July 2006,"...Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (hereafter ""2001"") remains benchmark cinematic science fiction of the highest order. No serious cinemaphile can deny the majesty and beauty of this film, nor can they deny its unique position in cinema history. Much like earlier films such as ""King Kong,"" the Kubrick masterwork ushered in a new age of film-making that paved the way not only for the giddy, fantastical, and profitable excitement of ""Star Wars"" (1977), a groundbreaker in its own right, but also an entire wave of ""smart"" films of speculative fiction, especially those involving machine intelligence. Think ""Silent Running"" and ""Colossus: The Forbin Project,"" ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" and ""The Terminator,"" etal, right down to recent films like ""AI"" and ""I, Robot"" (which is admittedly based on an Asimov tale that pre-dates ""2001,"" but never mind). All seem hardly possible without the trailblazing of ""2001."" All owe an inestimable debt to Kubrick's vision.It's most peculiar writing about a film I've seen more than twenty times in a movie theater, including several times on a Cinerama screen, and uncounted times on VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD. I almost feel as if I know it so well that there's nothing left to say about it, and perhaps there's not a lot I can add to the reams of reviews posted here on the IMDb and elsewhere. Still, the film has been a favorite of mine ever since I first saw it over 35 years ago, so it deserves at least a mention in my IMDb comments folder, right? Right.The impeccable Geoffrey Unsworth cinematography, the razor perfect editing of Ray Lovejoy, the immaculate production design, art direction, even the costuming; all illuminate the unmistakable vision of director/producer/co-writer Stanley Kubrick, one of the undeniable masters of film direction. More, ""2001"" is very much a piece of the Sixties/Seventies zeitgeist, an indelible cultural meme that spoke to the deepest yearnings and loftiest ambitions of those idealistic and turbulent years. The film's only real flaws now are the unavoidable anachronisms and its ambitious calendar of interplanetary travel. PanAm went belly up along with Bell, and it's a good five years since that mundane tic of the Gregorian calendar (millennial ignorance notwithstanding) and we're still a long way from Mars, let alone Jupiter and The Beyond. But ""2001"" still exerts the same power, still evokes the same sense of awe at the mystery and majesty of the universe, as well as our place within it.The film tells a fairly simple story in a somewhat oblique fashion: Humanity, nudged by an alien artifact, discovers tools, or more specifically weapons, and in the blink of one of the most famous jump cuts in cinematic history, masters technology, which leads inevitably to an alien beacon planted beneath the surface of Luna. What comes after, in a third act so lengthy it begins before intermission, is the true meat of Kubrick and Clarke's story, and the welcome introduction of one of the most compelling and thought-provoking cinematic villains ever created: the HAL9000 computer.I could fill out the rest of this commentary just talking about HAL, but will spare the wandering eye. Suffice to say, imnsho, HAL is the true protagonist of Act Three (HAL's tragic error of pride leads to his own destruction), but already I digress...Kubrick's film works so beautifully because he prompts his audience to think for itself, and does it primarily without words. Not to spite Clarke's simultaneously-written novel, which is worthy science fiction in its own right, but Kubrick's command of cinematic storytelling connects on a much more visceral, indelible level, deftly showing rather than telling. A thousand words of prose could not match the grandeur of ""The Blue Danube"" wedded to the intricate beauty of a shuttle docking with an orbital space station, or communicate the inherent humor of a man contemplating a zero-gravity toilet, nor could they match the psychedelically effective rendition of interstellar transport at the act's climax. Hard-nosed realists might argue that the provocative ending to Clarke's novel (""...but he would think of something."") is more satisfying than Kubrick's somewhat baroque and mystic one, but the message is clear: Man has risen above his darker nature (personified by HAL, and also Moon-Walker, the two characters who commit murder) and been transformed. Into what? Well, that's for you to decide.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is without question a film that demands to be seen on the big screen, the bigger the better. I can't recommend viewing it that way highly enough, though I imagine most anyone reading this will have slim opportunity to do so again until it enjoys an anniversary theatrical re-release of one denomination or another. A nice 40th sounds good to me!Edit: Okay, at this point (4.17.11), I'll settle for a 50th anniversary viewing.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
144,Stampsfightclub,a mind blowing Sci-Fi,9,1 January 2009,"Groups of men look to discover the mysterious black object which landed on one of Jupiter's moons many years ago.Stanley Kubrick's picture is a wonderful depiction of monkey to man to machine that generates so many issues and questions and answers so little.Made in a time when technology was advancing so rapidly this film showed a wonderful vision of what the future could possibly hold.Filled with spaceships and alien characters this is a marvellous fantasy that shows a believable view of the future, which starts with a beautifully bizarre introduction.2 minutes of music on a black screen followed by 20 minutes of apes on a planet and the adventure has only just started.This opening is the most wonderfully weird introduction in Sci-Fi cinematic history. This is unique and almost unbelievable it is that strange. You have to see this introduction to really appreciate the originality and you will not be disappointed. Perhaps slightly overdrawn but still undeniably remarkable.What follows is a mystery charged investigation about a black slab named the Monolith. This simple creation puzzles apes, men and machines alike. The strange object is a wonderfully bizarre instrument in the films picture and is the key element of the story and like Hannibal Lecter, has little screen time but has the biggest impact. The creation of the Monolith is a puzzle and one that is still being debated over today. The Monolith's representation as a devastating and terrifying creature is helped along by one of the best music scores ever created.Richard Strauss' Thus Spoke Zarathustra is one of the finest compositions to ever appear on the big screen as is the use of Gyorgy Ligeti who wrote the majority of the score.The plot further engages audiences with its twisting narrative and enter HAL, the computer who runs the ship heading for Jupiter. HAL is a wonder, a strong minded computer that has a personal edge who makes the film darkly humorous and is one of the finest non human characters in the genre.2001: A Space Odyssey is cinematic brilliance.

I recall animated discussion about the film on the drive home and at dinner that night.It was new ground! Sadly the film has not aged well. The special effects, so impressive some thirty years ago, look mediocre and sometimes plain silly. The fashions and furnishings, designed to predict today, more resemble Montgomery Ward circa 1960. In an age of today's short takes and busy camera work, 2001 seems stodgy, glacial and boring. Kubrick reportedly made his characters one dimensional on purpose. Yet today it amounts to just plain bad acting. This classic has not aged as well as others of the period.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
146,stamper,"Monkey madness, space ballet and an out of psychotic computer",3,4 February 2004,"With 2001 Stanley Kubrick succeeded in merging monkey madness, space ballet and an out of control computer by the use of an odyssey through space and time. What he did not succeed in, was in making a good film. Of course, by the standards of the time (1968) the effects were incredible and so were the monkey costumes (compare them with Planet of The Apes, which is also from 1968), but innovation hardly makes a film great. An interesting plot eventually combined with an intriguing style of filming does and that is where Kubrick went wrong with this one.
The first 15 Minutes of the film (I watched the 139 minute version), entitled The Dawn of Humankind' made up the best part of the movie. I especially liked the ending of that piece, when the music set in, fading into the space part of the film incredibly well. What followed this amazing transition was an amazing piece of space ballet. A real feast for the eyes. Then I guessed the stylish' part was over and the film would begin. I was wrong. In the 1 hour and 40 minutes to come there would be numerous overlong scenes of space ballet that added nothing to the plot and became quite boring over time, as did the whole film. Some of the scenes were quite pointless (in addition to being soundless). The part with the HAL 9000 computer was OK as well, but actually that about sums it up.
There is of course a storyline in this film, and it does connect monkey madness to an out of control computer by means of space ballet, but the way in which it is done just doesn't hold my attention. The space ballet could have been abandoned, because it did not connect monkeys to computer by means of causality but only by means of choice as did the vividly colorful voyage at the end. Sure the cinematography is great and the effects are amazing, but those two things are not the only things that make a movie.

147,gab-14712,Dare I Say Kubrick's Best Film?,10,11 October 2017,"When it comes to discussing influential movies of all time, I'd call you crazy if you did not mention 2001: A Space Odyssey. This film influenced science fiction of the future, so without this film there would be no Star Wars. This film influenced the style of future directors like Steven Spielberg and Ridley Scott, whom are fantastic filmmakers. Not only is the film influential, it's also a great movie in general. When it was first released in 1968, it was met with mixed reviews. People saw a vision that has not been seen before, and they had no idea what to think of it. I read reports of walkouts at the premiere that occurred and those who remained complained of boredom. The film is deliberately slow-paced, but my interest was held over the duration of the film. I loved the film very much, but there are so many complicated ideas. Your brain is meant to be put to use because of all these abstract ideas. I've seen the film three times already, and I'm still not sure if I fully grasped all the concepts of the film. But the bottom line is 2001 is more concerned about inspiring our awe, not thrills.One of the big reasons why we are supposed to feel a sense of awe is the music itself. You know, originally the film had an original composition by Alex North. Director Stanley Kubrick had a back up soundtrack he used to help him with the editing process. The problem is (in North's case) the music just worked too damn well with the film to not use it. He used various classical compositions such as The Blue Danube and Also sprach Zarathustra composed by Richard Strauss. The music played a huge role in the film. I feel as if it was used as the main dialogue. There is some dialogue of course, but the music tells the story and pulls the emotional strings. Kubrick's film has no dialogue the first and final twenty minutes of the film. It is all music, and the placement is right on the money.It's hard to describe what this film is actually about. There is no single plot line. Instead, the film and its themes are about the evolution of mankind. There are four main segments to the film. The first part takes place in prehistoric times. A group of apes discovered this shiny black monolith which of course is made by intelligent beings of some kind. Somehow, the monolith convinced the apes were able to discover that bones could be used as weapons. The next section takes place a few millennia later, and this is where we have the famous docking scene played to the tune of The Blue Danube. We are given a sense of realism of the docking because of the deliberately slow pace. After the docking scene, we discover a second monolith which delivers us to the next segment involving the spaceship Discovery and its intelligent mind, HAL. The ship is on a mission of some kind, although we don't glimpse many details. The final segment is the famous Stargate sequence featuring astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) as he travels through some wormhole to some unexplained space.This is one of those rare films where acting does not matter. There are not many actors present after all. Sure, I guess you could call Dullea's performance good, but he doesn't seem to matter in the film. The computer system, HAL probably shows the most emotion of anyone in the film. His voice even sounds panicked when he realizes he is about to be unplugged for good. This is one of the early films to use the theme of man versus machine. HAL believes he has good intentions, but at the sake of the astronaut's lives. He has been holding back information and later on in the minds of the astronauts, he is believed to be the bad guy.Ah, now lets talk about the spectacle of the film. The visuals are amazing, even today after all these years. We are now in the digital age, where CGI looks consistently impressive (or in some cases, not at all). But the special effects, designed with the help of Douglas Trumbull, look very convincing because the film gives off an aura of being a documentary, and the effects follows suit. They just look very real for the setting they are in. The spaceship itself looks real and I loved the docking sequence. Towards the end, where we witness the vast amount of colors and the Star Child, I was basked in a glow of delight watching the effects come to life.What I like about all of Kubricks film is that they ask us deep questions. For example, this film concerns mankind and evolution. The film asks us who we are and what is life about. Kubrick never gave in to tell us what the film is about. He opened the film up for interpretation and every idea is a plausible idea, according to Kubrick. We are just not skin and bones, but we are intelligence. We live not on planet Earth, but amongst the stars. These are just some of the ideas Kubrick was trying to convey. There are many themes to get out of the movie, being such an abstract film.This is Kubrick's most ambitious and most likely his greatest film he has ever made. I loved his previous film, Dr. Strangelove but he reaches news heights with this film. This is not a narrative story in the common sense so if you've never seen this film, just heed my warning. I love how the movie opens up for debate/interpretation and to this day, people debate about the themes and just how influential the movie is. Featuring amazing visuals and musical cues, 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the greatest, most influential movies of all time.My Grade: A+",2001 - A Space Odyssey
148,bankofmarquis,Truly...a masterpiece,10,4 March 2018,"Over the years, many, many words have been written and said about the 1968 Stanley Kubrick opus, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, but after re-watching it, there is only 1 word I would write about it...MASTERPIECEI have a long history with this film. My father took me to it as a 7 year old. I was intrigued by the Sci-Fi special effects, but mostly liked the monkeys at the beginning. I then saw it again as a college student in the early 1980's and was ""really into"" (for obvious reasons) the psychedelic special effects at the end. Later...in the early 1990's, during my Arthur C. Clark phase, I read the book and then re-watched the film and my understanding of what was happening on the screen gelled and, consequently, my fascination and respect for the themes and scope of 2001 opened up new doors of understanding. I think I have seen it another 4 or 5 times since then and have appreciated it in different ways each time.For this viewing, I walked away with a sense of awe of the sheer craftsmanship and audacity that Kubrick put up on the screen. The scope of the project in 1968 was (I'm sure) daunting with a subject matter that was just outside of normal vision, so for Kubrick to get a studio to o'k this film is mind-boggling to me.But...how does it stack up as a film? Very well, indeed.Told in 4 parts, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY tells the tale of mankind's evolution from ape-man to space explorers and the mysterious, monolithic aliens who help mankind advance along this line.In the hands of the great Stanley Kubrick, 2001 dazzles with pure visionary visuals, exploding heretofore unseen images on the screen. Showing us what could be possible in outer space visuals (not just paper plates hung on a wire against a star background). The film is full of Kubrick hallmarks - meticulously staged and choreographed scenes, stark colors - mostly one color with a dab of another color across the screen, and long scenes where not much dialogue takes place, but what is said (or not said) in the pauses speaks volume. Some would call this type of film making boring (and I have accused other filmmakers who have attempted this as boring and pretentious), but in the hands of Kubrick, this film is mesmerizing and continuously fascinating.The first 20 minutes of the film - the DAWN OF MAN portion - and the last 20 minutes - the JUPITER AND BEYOND THE INFINITE portion - are both dialogue-free. Kubrick let's the action and visuals speak for themselves. In between are THE MOON portion, which really serves as the audience introduction into the style and substance of the film, the wonderfully, Oscar winning special effects set upon a backdrop of classical music (who can hear Also sprach Zarathustra and not think of 2001)?It is during the 3rd - and most famous - portion of this film that a viewer will either engage or disengage with this film. This is the famous HAL 9000 portion of the film where 2 astronauts end up battling with a increasingly unstable artificial intelligence on a journey to Jupiter. It is here where Kubrick, I feel, is at his best. The long, uncomfortable silences and the glances between the two astronauts (played wonderfully by the oft-praised Keir Dullea and the underrated Gary Lockwood) leads to a sense of dread that is very reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock at his finest.I will admit that this film is not for everyone - and more than 1 of you reading this will attempt to watch 2001:A SPACE ODYSSEY and fall asleep during the middle of it - but for those of you that can plug into what Kubrick was achieving here will be rewarded with a very rich, very fascinating and very GOOD film that will garner conversation and criticism for many, many years to come.Truly...a masterpiece.Letter Grade: A+10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",2001 - A Space Odyssey
149,SmileysWorld,Visually stunning.Kubrick's best work.,8,4 September 2013,"This is one of those films that make me wish I had been around to see it on the big screen.I envy those that got that opportunity,because as visually stunning as it is on the small screen,it had to be 100 times so in the theater.The orchestral arrangements during space sequences were the best possible soundtrack for what would be a silent visual in reality.The other visual effect,such as those inside the space craft look to be way ahead of their time.As for the story,it plays just like a thriller as we have a great man vs. machine angle.Of all the Stanley Kubrick films I have viewed to date.This visually stunning production is by far the best.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
150,rbrb,Pretentious Nonsense,2,20 July 2014,"I have ""watched"" or sat through this film more than once. Goodness knows why. As at one of the same time it is exceedingly annoying yet also slightly mesmerizing but only because of its pretentiousness.There are some good special effects, but then again a lot of the fashion is very much 1960's , when the movie was made.In essence the story is about some strange objects found on earth, ""monoliths"" and a space ship which is sent to investigate. These ""monoliths"" -so the picture nonsensically suggests- were on earth when man was still evolving from monkeys and (I later researched) the film suggests these monoliths influenced mankinds development. But that conclusion was not made at all clear in the film.On the spaceship there is an onboard computer, called ""Hal"" who turns ""rogue"" for no apparent reason. Again only after doing some research I learn that the computer went crazy because it could not take being forced to lie to the crew. And/or Hal's behavior shows how we are relying too much on machines, etc.Then after quite a lot of tedium in the film the main character a spaceman endures some type of psychedelic journey(note this movie was made in the 1960's) when those ""trips"" were all the rage. He finds himself in a old fashioned bedroom, going through all sorts of transformations of himself until he becomes a fetus headed for earth.It is this last scene which is the worst failing of the film. As no way can or could the normal viewer have any idea what is meant to be happening. Seems the answer is-wait for it- that the spaceman has been captured by aliens and is going through some type of metamorphosis, only known to the aliens in its purpose. Blah, blah, blah.Despite some decent effects, music, production designs, et al the film is a total mess. Whatever the maker has said trying to justify this film, the whole thing looks like it was made up as it went along. The film maker believes he knows what the film is about but instead of conveying that to the viewer he causes them to be totally confused by a failure to communicate his vision properly or at all.And the movie is pretentious in the extreme and shame on all those people who claim this is some type of ""masterpiece"" . The story itself is wholly ludicrous and only because of a few redeeming features can I award just above the minimum vote:2/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
151,Angry_Arguer,You might never look at your PC the same,10,5 May 2003,"Seriously. What can be said about this movie that hasn't been already?  I shudder to think how any other director would've handled this project. Possibly the only other visionary who'd come close would be David Lynch. Nah, too radical.  Tim Burton?  Too sophomoric--that and he would've had too much fun with the monkeys.  How about Stan (the Man) Kubrick? Possibly.Kubrick does here what he probably has wanted to all his directing career. Create a purely visual experience without the annoyance of dialogue.  He also proves himself a master of classical music (indeed, between this and 'A Clockwork Orange' he proves that he knows how notes and images can be the most powerful tools) without using the annoyance of contemporary music. Indeed, many of the spaces scenes seem like music videos for Beethoven, Mozart, and others.Entertainment:  You do not watch this for entertainment, plain and simple. This is a soul-searching journey that might leave you stuck by the wayside if you can't understand it.  I will say this once and once only...""YOU ONLY GET OUT OF THE MOVIE HOW YOU REACT TO THE CHANGES, THIS ISN'T GOING TO SLAP YOU UPSIDE THE HEAD AND SAY 'THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT!'""If, after seeing this, you haven't had any kind of thoughts as to the purpose of humanity in this solar system, then you have missed the forest for the trees and the sky for the stars.On the other foot: This is Sci-Fi in the purest form.  There is no enslavement to other genres such as horror, suspense, or action.  Just the purpose of the science fiction field and that, of course, is the future of humanity and how our actions affect it.  I have said enough.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
152,fernandoschiavi,"2001 is a milestone in cinema in many ways. A unique sample of almost speechless narrative that promote even after decades, deep reflection and multiple interpretations",10,29 November 2020,"Works of this magnitude must be analyzed calmly and with arguments. We must always take into account the time when they were produced, their implicit and explicit intentions and absorb what is good and reflect on its content for our lives. One of the film's screenwriters alongside Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, once said: ""If someone understands 2001 at first, we will have failed. We wanted to raise many more questions than answer them"" and at another point said that the goal his and Kubrick's, when doing ""2001"", was to force the audience to reflect on an extraordinary number of questions.
One of the factors that most marked and left the film as ""untouchable"" today was the anticipation of facts by showing in a flash worthy of great visionaries, the arrival of man on the Moon more than a year before Neil Armstrong arrived until there, giving the audience even an image of the planet Earth straight from space without any image being possible even before the arrival of man on the moon. Kubrick's view of the Earth is very similar to that we have today, with just a lot more water and little land representing the continents. In 1968, it also managed to raise the hypothesis of artificial intelligence and other technological advances such as automatic doors, voice identifiers, telephone calls between space and Earth, upside-down movements, etc. If today, more than usual, it is already outdated, imagine it all in the late 60s.When building the script, Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke divided the film into different parts of human history. The first part shows the origins of humanity, with prehistoric primates fighting for survival on the ""Dawn of Man"". Kubrick develops the basis of the narrative slowly and without a word. With distant plans showing the beautiful landscape, using dry cuts in the image and sound, the director visually represents the rise of man over other animals. First, a group of monkeys use a bone to protect themselves from another group and to defend their territory near a puddle. Subsequently, the scene of the monkey hitting a bone with other bones of a dead animal visually represents the moment when he is already aware of this power of dominance. Soon after, a mysterious object appears in the world of prehistoric man, the black monolith. This monolith will be the link of history and cause many questions and discussions. Probably the monolith was deliberately implanted by an extraterrestrial at that time. In just a few changes of scenes, humanity is built: revenge, the birth of conscience, the emergence of the rational sensation of power, strength and dominance, intimidation through a tool (or weapon). But, magnetically, they are just primates, with one of them representing a kind of alpha male, with the phallic bone in his hand and arrogantly feeling powerful.Soon after Kubrick shows his ability above the ordinary by making the most famous and impeccable transition in the history of cinema showing a prehistoric monkey throwing a bone up, and we realize that when thrown up, the bone becomes the spaceship that begins the second part of the narrative, at the end of the 20th century, more precisely in 1999, in which an American space mission in which Dr. Heywood R. Floyd (William Sylvester) is located, discovers a black monolith similar to from prehistory, buried in lunar soil.
In the third part we are then introduced to astronauts Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) aboard the Discovery 1 spacecraft towards Jupiter, which is commanded entirely by the supercomputer HAL 9000 that controls everything on the spacecraft. HAL is the most advanced and complete machine, failsafe and has unusual intelligence and interacts as if it were a human with its crew. HAL is considered perfect until it makes a mistake, damaging the mission. In this part, also the most extensive and complex of the feature, the artificial intelligence of the most advanced time in the history of man is evidenced and the risks of this relationship of trust between humans and machines are also addressed with mastery. After an incident and waging a battle with the machine, Dave manages to restart HAL. That's when a video appears that had been recorded for the crew to watch when it was arriving on Jupiter.
The last episode shows the result of David's journey through a portal into space after surviving the HAL 9000 computer attack. The astronaut approaches the planet Jupiter to finally reveal the secret of the mysterious monolith and when he finally enters Jupiter's space field, the mysterious object suddenly appears and a festival of psychedelic images begins to appear on the screen in a frenzy of images that last for a long time with an unceasing soundtrack. When dealing with themes about human evolution, existentialism, technology, artificial intelligence and extraterrestrial life, Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke jointly created a masterpiece of seventh art. These profound subjects covered in the 1968 film have since opened the door to various interpretations, but one question has always been debated: what is the explanation for the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey? The end could very well be a metaphor for the fall of man in the universe. Had David, traveling through space, accelerated his aging process and reached the end of his life, giving rise to a new being that would be incarnated afterwards? Was it an illusion or a hallucinatory state, as in the hallucinogenic images from the previous scenes, created in your mind through the impact caused the moment you entered Jupiter's atmosphere? Years after the film's release in 1908, in a conversation with documentary filmmaker Jun'ichi Yaoi, Kubrick explained the ending. The director said that he wanted to represent that Dave was taken by divine entities, of very pure energy and intelligence. ""They put him (Dave) in something like a human zoo to study him and he stays there for the rest of his life. Dave has no sense of time. Everything just seems to happen like in a movie. And, according to him, the room where Dave is is a very inaccurate replica of French architecture (deliberately inaccurate) of what a human would find pleasant, just as we are when we try to replicate the natural habitat of animals in our zoos. Anyway, when (the entities) finished the work with him, as in so many other myths from all cultures in the world, he is transformed into a type of superior being and is sent back to Earth, transformed into a type of Superman. We just have to guess what happens when he comes back. It is the pattern of a great deal of mythology, and that is what we were trying to suggest. Some may consider Kubrick's explanation to be definitive, others may observe it in a philosophical bias in artistic creation. But we cannot deny that the director's explanation still allows for a large field of interpretation for the final scene.
The unity of Kubrick's film, therefore, is the beginning of everything: there is a slow evolution of millions of years and, simultaneously, it is shown that, in the belief of being so evolved, man has not ceased to be a primate. HAL - which is the result of evolution and not evolution itself - not only understands its superiority, but controls man, even attesting, in its manipulation, that a probable end of humanity is a reflection of itself: ""Human failure. That it has happened before. It has always been due to ""human"" failure. Regardless of its interpretation - and Kubrick leaves this very open, even though Clarke has tried to explain everything in the book he wrote based on the script - one fact remains: 2001 - An Odyssey in Space it is almost incomparable plasticity. Kubrick's direction, completely obsessed with centralizations and symmetries (notice how the focus of what he wants to show is always in the middle and how the left and right sides are the same), in addition to circles (everything, except the monolith, is circular), transports us to another universe, one that we need to slow down, decrease our demand for cuts every three seconds (or less) and for continuous action. It is a universe in which we must observe. Go beyond the narrative and check the details. Appreciate how the design of the production gives creative solutions to the lack of gravity, how Kubrick uses - or stops using - sound, music, to mark the moments.2001: A Space Odyssey is a milestone in cinema in many ways: artistic, cinematographic, philosophical, sociological, etc. When the work reaches its end, there are those who do not understand anything (at least the end), there are those who say they understood everything, and those who love or hate it. However, everyone can consider it a trip that proposes and achieves its original interest with excellence: praising thought and reflection. A unique sample of almost speechless narrative, which through genius shooting plans with special effects simply revolutionary for its time, and still packed by unforgettable classic songs and that promote even after decades, deep reflection and multiple interpretations with its open ending. Simply brilliant. It is Kubrick in the great work of his life, definitely marking his name among modern geniuses.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
153,joebloggscity,Seminal sci-fi classic that still amazes and beguiles.....,9,2 December 2009,"After 15 years, I've finally managed to see '2001' after reading the book. I've no idea why it took me this long to get round to it but it was worth it only in that '2001' is the first film I've watched on Blu-ray and it has been excellent. The film is an existential look at man's possible place in the universe. Beginning at the dawn of man and jumping to the 21st Century, this film charts a theoretical look at man's evolution in progress.The film poses questions on man, space and being. How you are to decipher the whole film is really up to each individual. What makes us human? Are we truly as advanced as we think we are? Is there life elsewhere? Thought provoking questions each one, yet surprisingly not over burdened in the film. Putting a philosophical question in a movie can be asking for derision, as cries of pretentiousness abound. In '2001' the film is one of the few that manage to do it and actually be praised for it. The points are accessible by anyone.Viewers must also note that this was made before man went to the moon, so much of it is really analysis on space travel as well. That goes even down to the basic aspects (e.g. how do you do the toilet in space?).You will be intrigued and amazed by it all, and be sitting there at points figuring out how they made some of the scenes before CGI etc was ever around. The scene where the man is running around the circular shuttle is even now quite brilliant. You will be sitting there wondering how they did the scene (over to the DVD extras).One for repeat viewing, and one that can little ever be questioned to be nothing less than a seminal classic of all film making.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
154,russem31,A mixed bag,7,2 December 2005,"This is regarded by some as a classic film for all ages. And in some sense, those critics are right. This film is a spectacle unlike other films of the time - the special effects in this film will inspire countless others like Star Wars 9 years later. Regardless, for me (as for some others), that's all it is, spectacle, a 3 HOUR spectacle that goes on and on. It is SO esoteric that it is probably way above most people's heads. And even though I understand what the filmmaker was going for, it is still too far-fetched for me. On the plus side, Stanley Kubrick makes proper use of classical music (in this case, Richard Strauss) and does have the aforementioned specular special effects. However, if you want to see a stronger focus on story, see its sequel 2010: Odyssey Two.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I recommend.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
156,Atreyu_II,Technically and visually stunning,9,19 September 2007,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is an extraordinary film and oh so significant. It must have been the pioneer of the science-fiction films and inspired later famous movies of its kind.Amazing and triumphant, it is also a completely different movie experience. Its formula is somehow similar to that of Walt Disney's ""Fantasia"", being a very artistic movie that focus more in art and images than dialogs, almost like a space documentary.Technically the movie is impressing and visually brilliant. The visual effects are stunning, the special effects are wonderful, the futuristic and advanced visuals are terrific and the attention to detail is not forgotten (even in the smallest details). This is pure and expressive art, combined with beautiful and unforgettable classical music.Speaking of classical music, Richard Strauss's ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" theme is one of the movie's trademarks, but even better than this one is the fabulous Johan Strauss II's ""On the beautiful Blue Danube"" waltz.The ""Star Gate"" sequence is the most incredible, indescribable and breathtaking part of this movie. Wow, what a perfect and extraordinary genial artwork! The sound effects were not forgotten as well during the entire movie. The combination of sounds is great. It accents the already quite realistic atmosphere of the movie.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" also deals with interesting stuff such as the human evolution, extremely advanced technology, artificial intelligence and extraterrestrial life.One example of artificial intelligence is the HAL 9000 computer, with his «perfect reliability» and soft and distinctive voice (brilliantly voiced by Douglas Rain). HAL 9000 is a great villain, being even capable of reading lips, which he does in a brilliant close-up and silent scene.The only things I don't particularly appreciate in this movie is the sequence ""The Dawn of Man"" (with pre-historical apes, so fake and unnatural that it's obvious they're men disguised as apes) and I also dislike the final minutes of the movie (after the magnificent ""Star Gate"" sequence). However, ""The Dawn of Man"" also has its good things, such as the gorgeous sceneries, luminosity and that weird and somewhat sinister vocal music when the monolith appears.During the first 3 minutes, all we see is nothing - we only hear a strongly suspenseful music. The title sequence is wonderful, with a satellite image of the Earth rising over the Moon, while the Sun rises over the Earth, all in alignment, looking like an eclipse. More or less in the middle of the movie, there is an intermission that lasts 2 minutes and we hear the same strong music.If this is already a formidable movie, the fact of being from 1968 amazes me even more and makes its greatness even bigger. I mean, just imagine: this was made such a long time ago, when computers and technology were radically different and not even close to be half as developed and advanced as nowadays. It must have been completely unbelievable in 1968! However, this is a movie that requires an open mind and patience because it is long, slow and has very few dialogs, which may make it a bit tiring. But nobody discusses its greatness.Without a doubt, this is a cult movie, a timeless classic, one of all time's greatest science-fiction films (as well as one of all time's great movies) and Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, which was written by Arthur C. Clarke and Kubrick himself. As for the cast, talents include Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, Douglas Rain, William Sylvester and others.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
157,LeRoyMarko,Grandiose,10,8 January 2005,"2001 is visually stunning. Dazzling. Most of the film is candy for the eye. And an other sense is well treated: hearing. The music is superb. Great choice of classical music. I must admit that it was the first time I saw 2001. And I didn't really know what to expect. I was taken aback right at the beginning with the apes running the show for close to 20 minutes. Of course, like others, I find the end to be very hard to decipher. But it didn't ruin the rest of the movie. Truly a great film to watch and enjoy. I'd love to see it on the big screen.Seen at home, in Toronto, on January 8th, 2005.90/100 (****)",2001 - A Space Odyssey

But, this movie is so incredibly slow that it is beyond boring. This is literally the most boring film I have ever watched in my life. Why do I want to watch monkeys jumping around for a half an hour and then watch a man walk through a ship for another half an hour? Why is this movie rated so high?

159,Pedro_H,Very memorable - but puzzling and limited.,7,15 September 2005,"A space mission aims to discover the meaning of transmission from the moon.How many lines have been written about this film? More importantly how many finished in question marks? Because this is a film that prefers to ask questions rather than answering them. The cinema of the imperfect, if you will.You can imagine the confusion this film must have created on release (in 1968) and it is easy to see why many didn't like it and many more stayed away. Indeed I only half like it - having actually seen it twice.Kubrick did a lot of his own cinematography and while he listened to others they rarely changed his mind. He was a film dictator, but like many great art dictators we should be grateful because other collaborators would have only left the mark of mediocrity.Do we criticise Beethoven for not collaborating with fellow composers or decry that Dylan didn't write in collaboration with a journeyman? (I would put Kubrick up with both of the above as an artist. As a man I wouldn't rate him higher than a junkyard dog.) This film may have the greatest span of time of any movie, but it is very limited. Space is a boring place says this film. Long, drawn out, nothing much of interest happens. What is interesting is man and machine - and maybe what they will find out. Although we get a lot a drum roll and very little fireworks.The classic music and the visuals are bombast that probably look fantastic on the big screen, but look a little silly on the small. To deafen and to blind are actually without skill and are little more than a carnival stunt.What I like about this film is that it fights emotions rather than plays upon it. Death matters little and the whole feel is cold and frigid. It hardly leads one to want to go in to space (as millions would like) nor put your life in the hands of machines.The sets are stunning and stand up well today, even after so much has happened to make space exploration a reality. Indeed the dwarf the humans and lead Keir Dullea is a lesson in non acting anyway.Every generation of film fan will see this film at least once, so there is nothing left for us to fight for, but I prefer films with a bit more of a story and less of feeling of self-importance based on spending vast amounts on the sets.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
160,rebeljenn,I wasn't impressed,5,23 October 2005,"2001: A Space Odyssey is regarded by some as one of the best films in history. I am not one of those people. Although it is an escape into the future and into space with underlying political and cultural messages common in 1960s films, the film did little to impress me. Maybe it is because of the time that I was born into. I felt that a lot of the movie went along very slowly, from the peaceful apes throwing sticks into the air to the scenes of astronauts floating in space, abandoned by their large metal craft.I wouldn't recommend this film to the average movie viewer, but it is one of those films that should be watched by serious film viewers. No guarantees that you will think it's the best film ever made. It certainly isn't in my eyes.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
161,tonypeacock-1,A film that left me so angry like no other!,4,5 May 2019,"A film has never left me so angry. Confused. Brain aching.
I really wanted to understand it but I was left with more questions than answers.Director Stanley Kubrick has delivered some great films, films which I've often rated highly. One thinks of The Shining, Eyes Wide Shut, his black and white opus Paths Of Glory starring Kirk Douglas.For many 2001 is a career peak for Kubrick though. The 1968 production just doesn't hit those highs for me.It is a long film. Slow moving but not an epic length film like Gone With The Wind or even The Godfather films.Anyway, back to 2001.
It has good points. Some excellent set design of the interiors of the space station and special effects of space exploration. A deserved Oscar win for Kubrick's special effects. Remember in a film era before CGI.
The effects have aged a little but still hold up. Remember it was over fifty years ago.The beginning of the film or Dawn Of Man sequence doesn't seem to be linked to modern/future space exploration rather Planet Of The Apes as pre-humanoids battle in tribes over food and water.
However we see the use of weapons for the first time as the bones of a rotting carcass of a zebra like creature are used by one tribe against the other.Excellent set design, matte backgrounds and ape costumes like Planet Of The Apes.
A strange black monolith appears supposedly from nowhere. It reminded me more of the Ed stone from the 2015 UK General Election. What is it? Where did it come from? First unanswered question.Cut to 'modern' day supposedly set in 2001!
Tourists travel to an orbiting space station aboard a Pan Am branded vehicle wearing 'grip shoes' to counteract the effects of gravity. Clever product placement and gadgetry like an old James Bond film. Virgin Galactic take note!Now the space exploration takes place that I link this film to. All set to classical music.
The music at first is 'relaxing' but st times over used and quite frankly annoying.From a moonbase, strange happenings are being covered up including the appearance of another multi million year old monolith buried beneath the surface of the moon that seemingly is emitting signals towards the largest planet in the solar system, Jupiter. Quell a multi year voyage there.The voyage to Jupiter (not the moon as in the 1901 film) is where some semblance of story develops.
Manned by two live astronauts Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) an three further astronauts in 'suspended animation'. There life systems computer controlled and set to the bare minimum to conserve energy needs and therefore food. Placed into the state pre voyage?A state of the art IBM computer, the HAL9000 controls most actions on the ship.
However Bowman and Poole think strange things are happening. Is it the work of HAL?The suspicious activity continues as the ship nears Jupiter. Here the film lost me in a psycadhelic haze as Bowman enters Jupiter's gaseous atmosphere?Then we see Bowman in a room seeing himself age and see another monolith.The film ends as some floating starchild foetus hovers over planet earth to the chords of classical music like the start of the film.Totality confused!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Looking at the voting, as of today, 40% of people who rated this film rated it a solid 10...few films score that highly! This film was absolutely mind-boggling back in 1968 and it has stood the test of time. Stanley Kubrick has a knack for making immortal films and this is definitely one of those! The SFX were quite advanced for their day and the visuals still hold up well. The mix of music was perfect! Who'd have thought of a classic Blue Danube Waltz while docking a space craft?

163,RonellSowes,A Film Like No Other Brilliant And Absurd,6,20 April 2021,"Groundbreaking, innovative, brilliant and absurd. These are a few of the words that one might use to describe this film. 2001: A Space Odyssey is film like no other and its difficult to classify it as good or bad. Rather it almost belongs in it's own separate category because it's something wholly different. It's such an unprecedented film that viewing it isn't like watching any other movie. In some ways it's as dull as watching paint dry yet by sheer originality there's something intriguing about it.The film's plot is not much more than a wisp and the scenes that really contribute to it probably amount to thirty minutes. This makes sense when realize that the basis for making this film is for the visual effects. Whatever else this picture may be, it's a visual masterpiece that did what no movie had ever done and has inspired countless of filmmaker's and their films. It holds up in its awesomeness half a century later.The only reason I can offer to see 2001: A Space Odyssey is to see it. Perhaps you may be one who is swept of their feet after seeing it or maybe you'll be left (like me)nonplussed. It invigorates your mind and it numbs it. It borders on brilliance and absurdity. It goes places no film ever has and probably never will.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
164,perfectbond,A true science fiction epic that lives up to its reputation,8,12 February 2003,"I should mention that when I watch films, acting is the component I am most interested. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, the acting is more than compotent, but it's strengths are in other areas of the cinematic endeavor. It is the sets, the props, the special effects, and the score that are the strengths of this film. Needless to say director Kubrick and his collaborators did a masterful job in envisioning and bringing to the screen their very convincing concept of the future. Praising Kubrick's directorial abilities is much like nonchalantly saying Shakespeare was a great writer! Great science fiction film, 8/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
165,ofpsmith,A very thought provoking film.,10,2 February 2014,"2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a film that really makes you think. It raises questions like ""Are we giving machines too much information?"" ""Is technology going at a rate where human beings will be replaced by machines?"" ""What was up with the last 20 minutes?"" Well, Stanley Kubrick was very good at making you think about these things. His ability to draw you into the suspense is shown here. His artistic ability is shown here. His message is shown here. And his ability to end a movie without any of the questions shown above is shown here. It's sort of like an experience movie, especially during the end. So here's the plot. A space mission showcases the work of Dr. Frank Poole, and Dr. Dave Bowman. They are helped by the computer HAL 9000. HAL eventually realizes that Dave and Frank are planning too disconnect him so he eliminates Frank but not Dave. Dave saves himself from being killed by disconnecting HAL. It's sort of like a film in 4 parts. Part 1 is the part with the apes. Part 2 is the part with the moon mission. Part 3 is the part with Dave, Frank, and HAL. Part 4 is the part with the portal. I highly recommend this film. It's definitely one of Kubrick's best.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
166,jdkraus,Don't get it; don't care for it...an ultimate waste of time,8,11 November 2007,"I honestly don't get what is so great about this movie. Sure, it covers controversial topics like evolution and A.I., but it is all done through images rather than dialog. Many people that I know like this film from that very reason; well, no offense, but when I see a movie, I look forward to actors acting, and a clear storyline.Visuals are great to have, which this movie certainly fulfills, but it is not enough. All it took was classical music and a green screen to make this movie. I can understand it was a big deal in the 1960s but come on; any fool can do that. This is all I got out after seeing this movie: -The first five minutes are of blackness with blaring classical music. The next twenty minutes of the movie is nothing more than apes jumping around and using bones to beat one another senselessly.-When this FINALLY ends, the next five minutes is a distant shot of a modeled space station that the camera zooms incredibly slowly towards it with some pretty music. After this, there are actually PEOPLE in this movie. Wowit only took a half hour to see some people! -So these people are on some sort of mission, which makes up the next thirty minutes of nothing more than boring dialog (at least there was some talking). Then all of the sudden, they all die for no reason. The next hour of the film is the introduction of the ACTUAL story with the protagonist Dave and the computer A.I. Hal. Predictably, Hal malfunctions and decides to kill everyone, forcing Dave to be the hero.-Now that two hours have passed, I sleepily wonder what the rest of the film is. Well, I'll just say that the next ten minutes is what John Candy quoted from Spaceballs, ""They have gone to plad."" Following that, the remainder of the movie is an old man in robes eating at a table in a white room muttering to himself, and then a swift change to an alien baby sucking its thumb.I did not get a single point from this movie, just a borefest of pretty images that I can find in any Terrence Malick film. There was nothing captivating or enchanting with this movie. I wish I could get the two and a half hours I lost from watching this waste of a so-called ""classic science-fiction film"". 1/10 -If I was able to, I would give this a fat zero.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I haven't, and Ive tried more than once, to get thru to the end. Its not a film worth watching, nor spending any time over. Bit Surprised to see Leonard Rossiter in a small part, but even he couldn't save this from what I can only describe as ""monotonous"" and time is short and you and I surely have better things to do!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
168,raymond-15,A somewhat disappointing prophecy about things to come,8,21 June 2004,"There are some imaginative ideas in this film but with the passage of time since it was made the element of surprise and amazing feats described are now every day occurrences.  Space craft landing on distant planets....computers that are voice-activated.  Astronauts are now the new explorers....the great adventurers reaching out into the dangerous unknown spaces.  We read about them every day in the newspapers and we see them floating around in their weightlessness on our TV screens.This film is not a documentary nor a drama (there are far more exciting films) but rather a man's artistic interpretation of what might be in his future.  The film is divided into segments beginning with the dawn of man. The episodes which follow are only mildly linked with what has gone before. The most obvious perhaps is the tossing of an ancient thighbone into the air and in the next episode we see a spaceship which somewhat resembles the shape of that thighbone. Some of the other linkages must be left to the imagination.In one sequence we get the impression of the spaceship (isn't it huge?)hurtling through space by the use of colours streaming from a central point giving quite a good 3D effect. But since this film was made the computer graphics have advanced to such a degree that everything in the past pales into insignificance.I cannot imagine how such a mighty spacecraft could be launched.  Nor is there any attempt to suggest how this was possible.  I presume it was built in space beyond the earth's atmosphere.  As I said this is an art film not a how-to-do-it documentary.I was disappointed with the salon that the astronaut enters when he reaches Jupiter.  The furnishings look so familiar with tables and chairs, wine glasses and knives and forks.  I never imagined that the beings on Jupiter looked like us nor had the same life style.As for the mysterious black monolith that pops up from time to time, every one is forced to use his own imagination as to what purpose it serves. I do not know.  I can only surmise that it has some kind of regenerative power which creates beings for the next step in man's development.  A sort of super cloning device.  Imaginative, yes.  This assumes of course that we are on the right path to the summit of excellence.The most exciting moment in the film is the argument between the astronaut and the computer when the computer informs him that something has gone wrong and danger lies ahead. The close-ups of the astronaut's intense expression are well done.  Most of the other characters are not developed to any extent and consequently less interesting.In my opinion...interesting, but not Kubrik's best work.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

170,tomimt,Still one of the greatest,10,24 February 2005,"2001 is probably the most philosophical movie I've ever seen in my life. It's meanings and themes shift through every time you see it and you always find something new from it. It is a long movie, but it never turns tiresome. Ages ago, before man was aware of his surroundings a bunch of man apes were living their life. On one day, a huge monolith appeared and suddenly apes begun to evolve. They figured out how to use weapons. From this we shift into the future, where similar artifact is found from the moon. Soon scientist are sent to research it... and the it happens, the monolith sends a message, which is tracked towards Jupiter. So, a group of explorers are sent forward to see, what is out there.Now, this is not a very typical sci-fi movie. There are no big bangs, no blood thirsty aliens but just two men and a computer. Main characters of the movie are Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea), Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), which is one of the most memorable movie villains ever. Yes, the bad guy of the movie is man made super computer. But it's not HAL's fault really. HAL is just doing what it is programmed to. Acting is very good throughout whole movie, but most memorable part is HAL 9000, which is one of my favorite performances in movie history.Special effects of the movie are truly spectacular, when viewed on when they were made (1968) and even in todays standards, which is very rare thing on older special effects. They did not win special effects Oscar (only one on Kubricks career) for nothing.20001: Space Odyssey doesn't let you go easily. You really need to think what you see. Kubrick didn't want to serve you readily chewed dish of pseudo philosophy ala Matrix, but a genuine possibility for the viewer to really reflect himself and humanity.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
171,Christian_Dimartino,Stanley Kuberick's masterpiece.,10,18 July 2011,"2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the grandest sci-fi tales of all time. In it's own unique way, the film is dark, light, and when it should be, thrilling, and probably groundbreaking for its time. The special effects are on Spielberg's level, and this was before his time.Another great thing about it is that its hard to describe. Because there is so much imagination here that if you try to describe it you will kind of lose yourself and look stupid, but I'll try to describe it anyways. The film shows man through the ages, starting from the dawn when we were monkeys, and flashing forward to 2001 where there are space colonies.The film's main plot doesn't really kick in for a good hour and a half. There are only a few characters in the film, but the main character is an astronaut named Bowman(Keir Duella). While on a mission, him and another astronaut plan to destroy HAL, the computer system that runs the ship. But HAL overhears them, and isn't going to stop without a fight.This is the best film director Stanley Kuberick has ever done. The special effects are extraordinary, dreamlike, and groundbreaking for the film's time. The film was made in 1968, and Kuberick did the special effects, and won the Oscar for them.I know that there are still a lot of mysteries to be answered from 2001: A Space Odyssey. To be honest, you've never seen anything quite like the last twenty minutes. The music sets the perfect tone for this film. While you're watching it, you'll hear the music, and you will feel unsafe.And even in the times without the music, you will still feel unsafe. 2001: A Space Odyssey is unlike anything you've ever seen and goes beyond your imagination, and that is the main reason why its one of the best science fiction stories ever to be put on film.A",2001 - A Space Odyssey
172,emm,Kubrick's groundbreaking sci-fi film remains a classic milestone for the future.,9,20 March 1999,"Let us remember Stanley Kubrick as a genius of provocative filmmaking, and also a prophet of events that came and went. 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY has survived the test of advanced time. Not just in eye candy, but the imagination of living in an artificial world where new forms of communication are evitable. This is science fiction a step forward in fantasy that becomes reality. In this case, things already have...Don't thrash the movie's opening sequence. Try to picture your mind the living standards man would use later. With a few primates hanging around the barren land of Earth, there is a point of significance about the future of civilization. ""The Dawn Of Man"" instantly becomes ""The Dawn Of Computer"". The primates' ways of intelligence is applied for the next challenge in an artificially run setting like the year 2001. Smart thinking from Kubrick!As I've said numerous times before, visuals do not always make the movies, but this is an exception when you had a movie that revolutionized special effects. For 1968, expect the impossible. If you have remembered seeing this in the theater, it's because you had terrible seizures from looking at the most vibrant graphics and pyrotechnics ever mastered on film. No object is ever tacked onto the print (like the Starship Enterprise), and they look like glimpses of future sci-fi hits including STAR WARS. But if you have developed severe hemorrhoids after the film was over, it was because of the knockout ""hyperwarp"" scene. Its amazing display of dazzling colors and quick speed still rivals against the eye-heavy, eye-demanding visuals of today's movies. Give this one another thirty years to prove itself worthy as time and technology progresses. Truly incredible!Like I mentioned, Stanley Kubrick acts as a prophet by using ideas that soon become reality or has already happened. The supercomputer HAL-9000 is a perfect example, which lead to modern operative machines and devices running on simple chips and bits of hardware. And did this movie predict a form of network communication like the Internet? Computer malfunctions? Artificial intelligence? If time had only told us, the answer is strictly ""yes"". But let's continue to believe that this is a science fiction movie without inducing panic.There may be thousands of other possibilities to discover from this masterpiece. We've learned an awful lot out of this one, though. I don't mean to say it ""is"" the greatest thing ever created (and no, TITANIC ""is"" not the greatest, either), but if we can dig deep into Kubrick's finest talents of a genuine Hollywood classic, we'll know that 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY can easily withstand all of the mediocrity that will continue to play in the high-tech multiplexes.A perfect ""9"" winner from you know who!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
173,bigverybadtom,"Great Special Effects, Repetitive Story",6,23 April 2011,"I saw this movie in a high school class, and the teacher explained things along the way as we watched. The theme of the story is clear enough-big black monoliths are affecting humanity's evolution over time, starting with our primate ancestors learning to use objects rather than just hands and feet to fight and hunt, and immediately jumping into where we start exploring outer space. The astronauts who reach the Moon (remember the movie was made the year before we actually put men on it) see another monolith, but nothing evidently happens right away.Then there is the falling-out between HAL, the intelligent computer which runs the manned spaceship traveling further out into the solar system, and its human crew. It is unclear why this occurs, but the result is only one human crew member survives, and in the end...presumably he evolves into something greater than human. Whoever is behind the monoliths is never explained or hinted at.The special effects are spectacular for the era. The overall storyline, however, is not really deep.

174,virek213,The granddaddy of modern science fiction movies,10,14 July 2001,"Every director who specializes in the sci-fi/fantasy genre, from George Lucas to Steven Spielberg to James Cameron, has acknowledged the influence of this epic 1968 Stanley Kubrick/Arthur C. Clarke collaboration.  And it's very easy to see why.  It remains very daring, very probing, very mysterious, and, for many people even today, enormously enigmatic.2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY began life as a modest attempt by Kubrick and Clarke to make the ""proverbial good science fiction film.""  As we all know, it involved into something more.  Its lengthy metaphysical exploration of the forces that shape Mankind's destiny evolved into a $12 million enterprise that, once released in March 1968, set off a firestorm of controversy among critics and audiences.  But young audiences took to this film in such droves that it quickly became a cult classic.  Kubrick's use of classical music pieces for ""2001"", including the ""Dawn"" sequence of Richard Strauss' tone poem ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"", became equally legendary.Combining monoliths, malfunctioning computers, fears of technology dehumanizing people, and a sequence that, for my money, remains THE ultimate cinematic special effects display (the Stargate), ""2001"" is groundbreaking cinema at its most earth-shattering.  Sixteen years later, it would be followed by ""2010"", a sequel that is a far better movie than its detractors would have you believe.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
175,gigan-92,Daunting Imagery And Sounds,10,4 June 2011,"This movie, one of Kubrick's greatest, is in every sense of the word epic. Before anything else let me say the cinematography was amazing with every frame. As most know, this movie revolutionized space travel in film, the dawn of amazingly detailed miniatures and sets that set the standard for science fiction films to this day. The shots are not brief and to some drawn out. However, it was done for the main purpose of admiring the beauty and wonder of technology, specifically the advent of exploratory astronomy. It's a very intriguing concept and one Kubrick handles without giving into the clichéd tendencies of fast-paced sci-fi/action flicks of today. Especially ones such as myself that love the genre and when watching such films sometimes wish fascinated audience members could gawk at an enormous space craft only a moment longer.Along with that, the beauty and dazzle the future promises, there's a dark underlying theme of the threat of technological advancement. You can see it from the start with the apes and the striking power that simple primitive tool brings. HAL only compounds this. The film in itself is rather abstract in a sense that it takes quite a bit of analyzing to grasp any sense of it. My understanding of it is that of a Nietzsche allegory, more specifically the concept of Apollonian and Dionysian in society. In the film, we see society as it began, with the apes as a mostly Dionysian society filled with chaos and a animal-like sense of simplicity. It's the origin point of man, which to me has always been a point of Kubrick's films. To display to audiences that despite mankind's advancements man is still just another animal with the same savage instincts as beasts, just cluttered and disguised by morality which is still just a concept dreamed up by philosophers. Calling it nihilist or not, so be it, it is a simple embrace of logic. Mankind strives ever so hard to achieve the Apollonian society, one of pure enlightenment and rational thought fueled by advancement in science. In the world set up by Kubrick, mankind has achieved this state of being and have become chillingly machine-like. The vast mystery of space is something that is not marveled at as we see a character sleeping in a bored fashion as he rides on a space shuttle and later another character sees a happy birthday wish from his family and has an almost stoic reaction. It's implied that neither have seen an actual human being in the flesh for quite a bit of time and yet their focus is entirely on their mission.HAL is the threat of a purely Apollonian society manifested. He suffers the human tendency to make an error though, and this is perhaps due to the fact that his flawless logic has become humanized by human emotion: fear and paranoia such. Dave achieves something in the end, to me a simple form of life that is in essence pure and possibly neither Apollonian or Dionysian, via the monolith. There's quite a bit of room for interpretation in this grand and certainly strange movie. It's use of music is seldom but beautiful and chilling to hear. The moments of silence seem to have even more profound reaction. A must see by all means.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Then, there are movies like Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" that created the myth, and simply are.""2001"" is the prime example of why Stanley Kubrick is the greatest director of all time. He was able to traverse many different genres throughout his career, and in doing so created the mythic templates by which all other latter films in those genres would attempt to emulate. Prior to this film, he made the greatest satire ever in ""Dr. Strangelove."" Following this film, he made the greatest costumed period piece in ""Barry Lyndon"" and the greatest ""modern"" horror film in ""The Shining.""

The amazing visual effects and the set designs with their painstaking attention to detail still hold up to today's harshest scrutinies. I dare you to find a movie from any period that looks this good. It makes today's CGI laden films look like visual puke. It also presents us with a prophetic and realistic look at what might happen to our society as it continues to evolve and become more dependent on technology, and the quandaries of creating Artificial Intelligence. HAL, the super computer, is without a doubt the coldest and most profoundly dangerous villain ever to grace the silver screen.On its most simplistic level, ""2001"" is the most arresting combination of visuals and sound ever captured on celluloid. What make the film so transcendent are its philosophical and spiritual posturings on man's place in the universe and just how ""alien"" our first contact with outside intelligent life may be.

183,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: I'll Explain The Ending,10,31 August 2002,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a classic. It just is. From a drama perspective, it's accessible (I'm not a drama fan), and you can't beat Arthur C. Clarke (the writer) for deep issues about the meaning of life, evolution, aliens, and artificial intelligence.From a science fiction perspective, it's incredible that the film is still powerful over 30 years later. Unfortunately, back when ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was released, space flight was big Big BIG with the forthcoming Apollo landing on the moon. Nowadays we see so much computer graphics and spaceships that it's a little old hat and I'm forced to admit that some of the sequences are, well, slooow. But the film still holds up remarkably well compared with its 1960s peers.OK, here's my explanation of the ending, and I won't spoil it for you if I say vaguely that ""it's weird"". Weird it is. The explanation has two parts:(a) It's an acid trip. Yes, this film was made in the 1960s.(b) Aliens aren't just people in funny costumes who share our principles and ways of thinking. They would be very, well, ALIEN. The weird bit at the end isn't supposed to be taken literally. It is supposed to unnerve you and make you get a taste of how strange, different, yet wonderful aliens would probably be.Who should see this film:-- Everyone. If you're only going to see one sci-fi film in your life, this would be a good choice, or ""Contact"", or ""The Terminator"", or ""Gattaca"".I'll give 2001: A Space Oddssey a only-barely-losing-its-perfection 10 out of 10. And definitely check out the movie ""2010"", which is just as good!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
184,Horror-yo,"Too dull, very pretentious, self-indulgent, and incomplete",6,13 December 2017,"This film gets all its well established notoriety and popularity from how philosophically suggestive it is, for the questions it asked, and for its penchant for visual imagery and artistic visions.A film is only as poignant as its scenes are during the actual viewing time, not days later when thoughts are compiled together to the point of creating a layer that practically exists on its own independently from the film itself. If the film depicts something profound then it should be felt as the viewer is watching, the methods assembled to convey a thought or concept should be efficient enough for the viewer to be submerged with emotion as he's actually watching. This film settles for grazing questions, for suggesting there might be interesting things to be found here, for merely opening up drawers loaded with files without ever picking one and pointing to an interpretation. It's too vague to even be abstract in quality, it's just random. There's a sort of meaning behind it all, but no closure on any of the notions being touched on - and the worst problem is even if there were, it would be so darn CRYPTIC it would just be a ridiculously overcomplicated confusing way to achieve its goal. The film creators are in the obligation as professionals of supplying the right elements for the viewer to understand the point being made, or else, he's not really even saying anything, it's just words and phrases floating in midair.The whole concept of AI becoming sentient and taking over on its own initiative was older than this novel or film so A Space Odyssey can't be awarded the full credit for the original idea, it was merely borrowing the thought of the evil computer machine turning on its human creator, without adding any more flavor to it, and building a scene around the notion to be inserted into a mainstream production. It's well made, but that's all. The conspiracy against the two human individuals was carried out in a completely linear fashion and the protagonist's return to the ship and dismantling of HAL 9000 was just execution of the narrative.On the monolith: it's interesting in concept, and the genuinely anguishing ghost music in the background is efficient along with the ominous camera angles... but again, it's all up for interpretation of the wildest kind. Some far-fetched ridiculously cryptic explanations can be found out here on the internet, but the most sensible one for me was the monolith was simply the catalyst to human development: the person was describing how the monolith was a perfect geometrical figure with straight angles and perfectly straight lines, which would in a somewhat symbolic way inspire the apes to progress and adopt the underlying concept of precision and therefor moving forward into technological advancement (hence the tools later, so on..). Too vague a meaning anyways past the ape stage really...The film is intentionally very slow-paced which isn't a problem in itself only that the slowness is directly associated with the pompous attitude of the film: a movie that starts off with a pitch-black screen and 5 whole minutes of abstract soundtrack music, repeated later in the film, classical music used several times during scriptless scenes... the artsy fartsy psychedelic trip at the end which is really the film-makers discovering a new technology at the time and abusing its most basic functions for about 15 minutes straight.As a whole it does look absolutely great however: the space ships are very detailed in design and actually look real hovering in space, the futuristic technology and furniture and overall colors and shapes are interesting and quite pleasing aesthetically. It should be said as of this writing some 50 years after its release it really aged fantastically well and the imagined novelties of the future still don't come across as ridiculous as in most such films' visions.The ending scene is, again, poetic, thought-provoking... but doesn't cop out from the film's general ineptness at being clear and taking responsibility for saying something tangible and exact and further contributes to the pretentious attitude of this Kubrick ""masterpiece"".
 
Some films are misunderstood, some films are over-understood...6/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
185,asda-man,PhenomenHAL,10,14 December 2014,"Last night I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey for the very first time. I don't know what has put me off seeking it out for all these years. Perhaps it's because I'm not a big sci-fi fan, however I am a Stanley Kubrick fan. I particularly adore The Shining and love the way Stanley Kubrick soaks up a hypnotic atmosphere so that the film becomes an experience. After seeing some clips on the strange documentary, Room 237, I thought that the film looked right up my alley! I've also heard nothing but hype for years with people calling it one of the greatest films ever made, so I was extremely excited when I sat down to watch it.Unfortunately watching it, for me, was a little bit like sex. You want the first time to be the best, but in honesty, the more you do it, the better it gets. I had a banging headache throughout the first half and so really could not appreciate the loud music and atonal sounds because it was just so painful! Halfway through, I had to leave and get myself a Tesco headache pill and towards the end of the film it did go away. I also left to go to the loo about three times, as I had a lot of coffee to drink so that I'd have the stamina to stay up and also to sober myself up.Why am I telling you this? Well, I don't know. I think to get the full 2001 effect, you need to completely immerse yourself in it, but I struggled to do this. However, that doesn't mean that I didn't appreciate what I saw. In fact, I'm pretty sure that what I saw was an absolute masterpiece. I was completely sucked in, right from the beginning where sinister music played for about five minutes over a blank screen. It's such an unusual way to open, hinting that the film you're about to see isn't your usual rip-roaring science fiction adventure. We then get that glorious famous music with a beautiful image of a sun rising over the Earth. It's an amazing title sequence which made the hairs on my neck stand on end.I think it's a stroke of genius having the first scene, in a film which is largely set in the future, be set at the beginning of time itself. It must have been so jarring for audiences in 1968, of course everyone knows that the film starts with the monkeys now because it's so widely talked about. Speaking of the year in which it came out, I cannot believe that this film was made in the 60's! I saw it in blu-ray and it looked like a film which had came out last week. It's easy to see why it so disliked when it first came out, because it's just so ahead of its time. Although, some of the monkey suits did look a bit naff!We're then thrown into the year 2001, where (apparently) space travel is an everyday thing and stewardesses wear bright pink clothes complete with a strange bubble hat. To be quite honest with you, the remainder of the film is very difficult to put into words. It's pure art in the form of film. It's a rarity these days, however people like David Lynch and Nicolas Winding Refn are striving to keep it alive. There are long sequences of spaceships flying overhead to classical music and people walking slowly upside down. It all creates a certain feeling and experience which you have to see for yourself.2001: A Space Odyssey doesn't really have much of a plot. Astronauts find a strange giant tablet on the moon, and then some more astronauts go on a mission which I don't entirely understand the purpose of, with a creepy robot called, HAL, which is of course now an iconic character. It's strange because a lot of the film is incredibly slow and, dare I say it, boring. But there's something about it which keeps you interested and locked to the screen. Scenes which would last five minutes in an ordinary Hollywood film, last up to half an hour here and it does create a unique and immersive experience which stays on your subconscious for a while.A lot of the film is very haunting. The choral chants whenever the strange black tablet appeared created a wonderful atmosphere of mystery and impending doom. I also found the scene where HAL sings, very creepy. Of course, the most talked about scene is the Lynchian finale where we're plunged into a psychedelic and hypnotic fantasy world. The final scene makes absolutely no sense, but it most definitely haunts you. I couldn't help but have chills all the way up my spine when the music plays and the baby looks right towards you. It's scary and very powerful.I think subsequent viewings are going to make 2001 a definite favourite of mine. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. After seeing this now, I find it strange how people are comparing it to Interstellar. Interstellar is a somewhat conventional and fast-paced sci-fi adventure, albeit an absolutely astounding one! Whereas, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a slow art film. They're impossible to compare! Both of them are masterpieces in their own right though. It's a film which will definitely stay with me, and I look forward to plunging myself into its world again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
186,oOoBarracuda,2001: A Space Odyssey,9,27 April 2016,"Well, my mind was officially blown by my second undertaking of a Stanley Kubrick feature. Being a huge fan of auteur David Lynch, I was greatly looking forward to watching another film of Kubrick's. Before this viewing, I had only seen The Shining (and who hasn't) so I was ready for more Kubrick. This 1968 Sci-fi epic starring Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, and William Sylvester tells the cautionary tale of modernization and the advancement of technology, and what that advancement means for the human race. When a group of astronauts is sent into deep space, they realize the horrors of the possibility of technology taking over humanity. Dr. Heyward Floyd (William Sylvester) eagerly and hastily sets up another deep space mission which he provides little public details of to those around him. Dr. Floyd hurried to the Florida launch station with his guarded secret to attend a meeting with a top official that would get his project off the ground. He then learns that a discovery has been made below the moon's crest that predates human existence. Energized by this undebatable proof of extraterrestrial life, Heyward assembles a group of scientists to investigate the phenomenon, only to be turned away by the piercing scream of a magnetic disturbance once they arrive at the scene. The conscious members on board the mission are Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), they are on the trip with other members ""hibernating"" until they reach Jupiter. Hal 9000, an artificially intelligent supercomputer maintained many ship functions and interacted with the crew daily. After a series of events in which Hal attempts to cease communication with Earth, the crew decides to disconnect Hal fearing their isolation from Earth. Sensing the emerging disdain of the crew, Hal attempts to cause the death of the crew to protect its own operating system. A fight between man and machine ensues and the battle can only be won by willpower, and endurance, and which party can overcome the crippling fear of isolation. I was glad I was forewarned about the need to ""stick with"" this film. It opens with a 20 minute plus sequence that felt like I had strapped in for a Nat. Geo. documentary. The audience is 25 minutes into the film before there is any dialogue, which was an incredible feat for a modern film. The sound completely takes over the film overwhelming the audience with its ever presence. The sound acts as an independent character revealing the slow deterioration of the crew involved in the mission. So incredible was the sound that it is almost enough to drive the audience crazy, akin to the characters who are mentally declining as the film progresses. When there was more than hollow noise and high, shrill moans, there was an overabundance of Strauss music, adding to the out of this world experience of the mission. The acting in this film was wonderful, with the strongest performance being the unseen Hal 9000 who commands the picture. The cinematography is nothing short of masterful, and I realized quickly why Stanley Kubrick's direction is so oft cited as brilliance. The sets were so intricate and grandiose that they added to the mysticism and realism of a space ship flying through the galaxy. The colors are also spectacular adding to the brilliance of the plot. Kubrick, in a display of his directorial prowess, utilizes the most inventive camera angles I have ever seen, creating an unimaginative level of depth to his film. Kubrick is certainly an auteur and one that I can't wait to explore more of. Isolation is a force in which can bring the most intense human behavior. Silence and being alone can lead to the mental decomposition in even the strongest of individuals. The intensity of isolation was fully explored in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Hal 900 seeks dominance, and the overtaking of humans by artificial intelligence has been a fear of humanity since the Industrial Revolution. The battle between Hal and the human members of the crew was waged over the overwhelming isolation and fear of being replaced by the other. The evolution of humanity has injected new fears into our psyche, and few directors could have brought that war and vision to life; thankfully, Stanley Kubrick took the task, and left audiences with nothing less than film mastery.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
187,saru2020,A brilliantly made masterpiece,10,9 February 2020,"Watching it after nearly half a century and it still feels as if it was released just recently except its long dialogue-less scenes. This itself makes this film one of the gem. It is definitely one of the masterpiece In Cinema, nothing more to say beyond that.
This film is not for the common audience as it has so many inter-linked layers which makes it suitable only for those who like decrypting the layers and finding out the linkages between the scenes and filling up the gaps with their our versions.
Thankfully, there are so many demystifications out there if you're not one of those creative types and the beauty of this film is that it fits into any of those decrypts, because that's how generic it is intentionally made by the creator such as to let the audiences to fill the gap as per their imaginations, which again makes this film as a very unique film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
188,phenomynouss,Epic,10,20 January 2010,"There is no other word for it. Any amount of hyperbole would simply be insulting. Hyperbole is what things like this are made for.The film is a feat of visual effects that even in this day is frightening and spellbinding in how REAL it looks. Even the best CGI today can make something appear real, but it will ALWAYS just be on the very finest edge of artificiality. Virtually no part of this film ever slid through that edge. Every part appeared insanely real.The prelude, ""Dawn of Man"" is itself a little film that brought me to tears with how amazingly, artfully done it is.The sequence in which Heywood Floyd and the rest gaze upon the Monolith on the moon was one that kept me frozen stiff in fear and wonder like no other work of art has ever done.Every single word spoken by HAL9000, coated in the thickest layers of smooth, deadpan articulation, is a horror of might and machine, and HAL's end is more heartwrenching and gutwrenching than most other movie death's for human characters.The entire ""postlude"", Jupiter and beyond the infinite, was an all-out display of technology and wordless storytelling that seems at first to step into the realm of the ""pretentious artsy indy film made by an arrogant art student"", and then destroys any inclinations towards that notion, and becomes the very avatar that those pretentious art students aim to recreate with their seeming randomness of images and ideas.I was in tears for so many portions of the film. Not from joy, not from sorrow, but from the sheer emotional power the film had that I have never seen from any film, book, play, television show, or game ever. Epic.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
189,owen-watts,I'm Scared.,8,13 June 2020,Torturously slow and phenomenally beautiful - what the purpose of it is I can only guess.Wrongly.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
190,Rickting,A masterpiece is an understatement,9,12 August 2014,"2001 A Space Odyssey is a enigmatic and captivating journey into space, as Stanley Kubrick blasts his audience with the full force of his meticulous genius. 2001 is an abstract movie, with various segments (Covering the dawn of man to the far future) linked only by a mysterious black monolith. This is a pretentious film admittedly, and some will find it dull. That's absolutely fine. This is a classic, but one not everyone will enjoy. With its long running time, lack of narrative coherence and dialogue and refusal to give answers, why is 2001 regarded as one of the best films ever made? Because it is one of the best displays of the power of the cinematic medium ever created and it is an extremely deep movie, with a multitude of interpretations and explanations. It's a cinematic master at the absolute peak of his power; with unforgettable, hypnotic, almost hallucinatory imagery which takes us into straight into the abyss, combined with hauntingly powerful themes which question mankind's place in the universe and effective sound, this is what cinema was made for.2001 is rarely dull, and its slowness and emotional distance make it even more fascinating. As a visual experience there are quite possibly no parallels whatsoever, but there are some strangely moving scenes in the film as well, and the entire sequence featuring the legendary HAL 9000 is suspenseful and gripping. The part with the apes is less interesting, but it does end with the best transition ever: The amazing match cut where a bone turns into a spaceship. 2001 is a difficult film to describe and the extent of its power, both emotional and sensory, is difficult to explain. It is simply one of the most entrancing- and maddeningly cryptic- movies ever made and since there are so many interpretations, the film carries on even after it finishes. Some may prefer more action packed and less elusive science fiction films, and it could easily take a couple of viewings to fully get 2001. However obscure and mysterious it is, or however pretentious, the truth cannot be avoided: 2001 is a masterpiece and one of the best cinematic experiences in the history of the medium.10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
191,Aylmer,2001: A Solar Bore,3,9 February 2001,"Possibly the most overrated science fiction film ever made, 2001: A Space Odyssey is more eye-candy than substance. Supposedly the film tells how extraterrestrial powers are behind the evolution of intelligence in humans or something to that effect, but in my opinion the film brings this message out in a very heavy-handed and overblown way. The first 20 minutes or so of the film aren't much more complex than your usual National Geographic primate documentary, instead with actors in ape suits in the place of real apes. Of course for no discernible reason, a monolith appears in the middle of an ape-tribe's camp overnight and merely the act of briefly pawing it makes them smart enough to use bones as weapons. Kubrick was obviously trying to make the monolith and its powers seem mystical and beyond the realm of human comprehension, but in this case he leaves too much to the imagination, as in failing to explain how the monolith got there, how it distributes intelligence, and why it would do such a thing. It's never explained, as very little is explained over the course of the film. Most of the film seems similarly vague and ambiguous, resulting in a downward spiral of confusion and boredom.Shortly afterward, the audience is bombarded with shot after dreary shot of space ships floating around in outer space. This entire 5-10 minute sequence serves absolutely no purpose other than to woo and wow the crowd with special effects. In this case, this ""classic"" science fiction masterpiece is no better than your average Hollywood special effects spectacular nowadays. With modern audiences no longer wowed by such effects, the sequence seems hollow and boring, made even worse because the pay-off is two extended scenes of William Sylvester attending meetings on a space station and a moon base. These may well be two of the most boring and pointless scenes ever to make it into a theatrical film. Possibly Kubrick meant to contrast modern, boring man with the prehistoric (and also boring) primate man. None of it really comes together though as there is no sense of collision between these two sections of the film, and hence no cohesion to hold it together other than the appearance of the monolith, which for no discernible reason emits a high-pitched scream at Sylvester and his team of astronauts.The highly touted sequence involving HAL, the ultra-intelligent super-computer who terrorizes a deep-space exploration mission to Jupiter, seems kind of a side note to the greater story, and doesn't really fit in at all with the whole monolith/human intelligence theme. The Jupiter Mission would have made for a good movie in itself, and is by and large the most interesting section of the entire film, but once again, what does it have to do with anything? As can be expected, the ending is also highly pretentious and tries to put several meanings past the audience at once, not only making no sense whatsoever, but also remaining completely boring. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that definitely hasn't stood the test of time, and will do little more than bore its audience during the year it was meant to depict.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
192,MichaelMargetis,"""I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."" - H.A.L.",9,19 July 2005,"# 1 Best Film of 1968It's been thirty-seven years, but whenever I hear 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss playing on the radio, in a commercial, on television or in a movie, I always think of the illustrious motion picture, '2001: A Space Odyssey'. It was a film surrounding space travel and life in space in the future by one of the world's most celebrated filmmakers, Stanley Kubrick. '2001' was Stanley Kubrick's first big-budget film, his most memorable film and many film critics and movie buffs alike agree it's his most genius work. Part of the reason why '2001' was such a hit was because of the amazing special effects (for the time - it was 1968) and the haunting and brooding classical music score that blended perfectly into the peace and quiet of outer space. While wowing audiences with its spectacular visual effects, '2001' also challenged their intelligence and view on human life with deep philosophical ideas and messages lodged deep inside science-fiction picture. People have praised '2001: A Space Odyssey' as being the crowning work of an extraordinarily gifted filmmaker ahead of his time, and other have panned it as being jumbled, frustrating, deliberately confusing and very undeserving of it's praise. I have finally witnessed one of cinema's most talked about and debated over epics, and I can assure you it's not only an excellent movie, it's one of the best made motion pictures of all time, thanks entirely to the very meticulous and conscientious vision of Stanley Kubrick, the finest film director to ever grace the world.'2001: A Space Odyssey' is set in the beautiful and peaceful confides of outer space, where humans (mostly doctors and scientists) do astrological research from expansive spacecrafts. A lot of what we have today (and what we had when the book '2001' is based upon was written) has now been replaced with artificial intelligence (robots) in Stanley Kubrick's invisionment of what the year 2001 would look like, taken of course from Arthur Clarke's groundbreaking and controversial novel. The story surrounds two doctors on a mission up in space, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). Their mission is leads them to the moon, to find an artificial relic, which can lead to the discovery to a new and mysterious life form. The two are helped by H.A.L., the creepy-voiced computer of the spacecraft, who develops a mind of it's own and eventually turns on them. H.A.L. turns on the two astronauts when he (it, really) refuses to save them in fear it will jeopardize their mission. The film becomes a sort-of survival story after that for Dave (Frank dies, when he is failed to be saved by H.A.L.) which eventually leads him to what the mission is looking for, taking him on a five minute journey filled with vibrant and e colors and graphics through the depths of outer space, eventually resulting in Dave seeing himself aging and eventually dying, and being re-born as a extra-terrestrial. 2001's ending may be one of the most talked about, debated and argued about film endings of all time. There is no solid explanation for it, and Mr. Kubrick (as well as author Arthur Clarke) leave it up to you (the viewer) to figure out. I personally found the ending to be extremely frustrating and mind-numbing the first time I saw it. I just couldn't grasp it, until about four days later I began to deeply admire it. In my opinion, '2001' is very anti-technology (hinting it will one day destroy us), but offers hope for us in the future. Stanley Kubrick provides the absolute best direction of his career with '2001: A Space Odyssey' that it is nothing short of appalling he didn't receive the Oscar for 'Best Director'. Without Kubrick, there couldn't have been a movie of '2001', period. Only his rich, elaborate, sophisticated and undeniably gorgeous could make '2001' what it is then and today. In other words, if any other filmmaker was to touch it, the project would crash and burn. Kubrick fills the movie with aching beauty ever second of the runtime, not only with the direction but the screenplay he co-wrote with the famous novel's author, Arthur C. Clarke. The acting in '2001' is really nothing special, but it doesn't have to be because the last thing '2001' is about is the performances. Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, Leonard Rossiter and Douglas Rain (who provides the chilling voice of the vengeful computer, H.A.L.) are all decent, but nothing really memorable (well, just Douglas Rain's voice). The film suffers by being a tad overlong, and it's also very slow moving in the beginning, but I forgive it for that. The film's cinematography, visual effects, musical score, set decoration, screenplay and sound were all Academy Award worthy, and in my opinion '2001' should have taken home the Oscar for 'Best Motion Picture of the Year', but it wasn't even nominated. If that doesn't prove to you how short-sighted and ignorant the Academy voters are, I don't know what will!In conclusion, I don't even recommend '2001'. I plead, no I demand, you dash to your local videostore and rent a copy. You may enjoy it, you may not, but you will definitely be thinking about it the next morning and it will for sure enlighten you. '2001' isn't as much of a film as it is a landmark in cinema. '2001' set the bar for many extraordinary motion pictures to come, and I'll say it again, none of it would be possible without the genius of Mr. Stanley Kubrick. If you've already seen it, I recommend you buy it on DVD, along with Kubrick's other films in his DVD Collection including his work from 1962 to 1999. '2001' may bore you a little, but when it's all over it will give you a slightly different view on things. Grade: A-MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #85",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The art direction and the special effects in space were stunning for their time. I now own a copy of the film and every now and then I just put it in the VCR and it doesn't matter where it is, I just watch and am blown away by the consummate film-making. Kubrick was a film genius who made great films (Paths Of Glory, 2001) admirable ones (Barry Lyndon) and messes (Eyes Wide Shut, Shining, Lolita).

Part 3 is the journey of a ship to Jupiter.The visuals were jaw dropping in 1968 and paved the way for Star Wars in 1977. What's it all about? Kubrick and notable sci-fi author Arthur C.

In the movie 2001, dialogue is minimized, allowing a classical score and great cinematography to take center stage. While this absolutely helps the film in some ways, it also makes the explanation of who the higher beings are and how they exist extremely unclear. What made the book great to me was the thematic considerations of human society relative to the higher beings, as you see evolution and transcendence of the physical world by the beings and, in the end, Bowman. There just wasn't enough to give the audience full appreciation for Bowman's journey and how shocking and difficult to deal with Hal's betrayal was.

It is stylistically a very interesting film, with great visuals and a great sense of mood that it creates. But in the end it delivers a message that 'god' is so alien and seemingly disinterested in us, that we might as well be alone in the universe. There is no way to communicate with that thing, even when we follow its own invitation. I don't like that kind of message, and what I like even less is the gratuitous ending that spent an eternity making that point. It felt more like abuse. It was also self-indulgent, and that's something I find alienating. The film also suffers from a lack of narration. For the most part, the film is an experience, not a story being told. In the second of four acts, we follow a scientist on his journey from Earth to an orbital station, then to the Moon, then to an excavation site on the Moon. Yet nothing happens. He has a few utterly meaningless conversations and holds the least informative speech in history. Why this was done is beyond me. If the goal was to underpin the general feeling of alienation in the endless and utterly incomprehensible universe, then it may have worked to some degree, but it still came across as poor screenwriting. In the end, the film both impresses and disappoints.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
201,CinematicInceptions,"Might be great, but wasn't for me.",3,17 January 2016,"I can understand why people see this as a classic movie because I think that for all the issues I have with it, it does have a thought provoking story. However, I still think it is perhaps the most overrated movie of all time for the simple reason that it shows too much of all the wrong things. Whether they were or not, it feels like Kubrick and company were showing off with their gigantic spaceship sets and dazzling light scheme at the end. It looks nice and everything, even fifty years later, but after about thirty seconds of seeing the ship traveling to Jupiter, I'm ready to see something actually happen instead of five more minutes of the exact same thing. The whole movie could probably have been about 80 minutes long, 110 would have been acceptable. I'm not denying that they did a good job on it, but I just couldn't keep my eyes open for most of it.Some of my dislike for it might be a personal preference since I think that character is typically the most important aspect of a movie, and character is the main thing that 2001 lacks. People talk about how chilling HAL is as a villain, and I agree that he/it adds an interesting element to the plot, but he's nothing terribly special as villains go. As for Dave and Poole, you won't find more wooden protagonists in any movie. I think this was intentional to add to the overall feel of the movie and emphasize how small a force humanity really is and how little we know, but it's still worth noting that our characters are pretty bland.The story follows a group of astronauts investigating a monolith that we are lead to believe has helped shape humanity. It starts off with about half an hour of showing apes transitioning from animals into sentient beings that had the capacity to use weapons and go to war with each other in a sense with the help of a monolith. Then we see modern (or at the time of release it would have been slightly futuristic) humans investigating another monolith on the moon. Eventually, the protagonist Dave has to gain control of his craft over HAL as they travel to Jupiter to continue the investigation. Then things get very weird to the extent that I would have a hard time explaining it in words. I don't quite know what happens at the end of the movie, and I didn't care to think it out after watching it because I was just glad it was over. I think Kubrick was trying to give us some form of really deep inspiration with the ambiguous and entirely unexplained ending, but it's a bit beyond me. I don't know if fans of Kubrick will like this since I haven't seen any of his other material. I don't think it is likely to appeal to most modern audiences just because we like our movies to have a bit of a faster pace, but I wouldn't discourage anyone from giving it 30 minutes to try it out. I will warn you that the ape scenes are some of the more exciting moments of the film, though and that the tone changes quite a bit after that. So whether this deserves to be a classic is not something I'm can say with certainty, but it at least didn't fit my tastes. Overall Rating: 3.8/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
202,nickenchuggets,"""I'm sorry Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that""",10,20 August 2021,"This is an enormous movie to talk about, so I will just start by saying it really is astonishing how such a thing was accomplished in the 60s. However, when you stop to consider the one and only Kubrick was behind this, it suddenly seems much more believable. 2001 is a film that has done a great deal to influence and shape other science fiction movies that have followed it. There are many reasons for this, including the way the movie accurately portrays space travel, the loneliness of taking part in an extraterrestrial voyage, and most importantly, the awe-inspiring camerawork. If you've never seen this movie, there's no way for you to understand. The camera angles and cinematography on display here are out of this world (literally). Kubrick used a lot of wide shots in order to give a realistic feeling of scale to the viewer and help them understand how vast and seemingly endless the universe is. A strange thing about this movie (even though the movie as a whole is strange) is how despite its impressive runtime and huge scope, there's not much in the way of a storyline. It's not that there isn't much to look at, because there certainly is. It's just that the plot will leave the average audience absolutely confused beyond belief, even after finishing the movie. It begins with (of all things) a group of prehistoric monkeys fighting each other. An odd, black, rectangular structure appears before them, seemingly from out of nowhere. The monolith seems to influence their way of thinking and make them more intelligent, allowing some of the apes to use primitive weapons and beat their rivals savagely to death. Thousands of centuries later, a Doctor Floyd is busy travelling to a type of secret base on the moon's surface. There, he encounters the same rectangular object the apes saw millions of years earlier. The movie then abruptly moves to a large spaceship called Discovery One, which is conducting a voyage to the gas planets in the outer solar system. Dr. David Bowman is taking part and is responsible for answering to the deceptively sinister HAL 9000; a supercomputer with a glowing red eye that controls the vast majority of the ship's abilities. Some time later, HAL tells David something is wrong with the ship's exterior, prompting him to go take a look in a pod-like vehicle. HAL gets proven wrong and David finds nothing wrong with the ship. Meanwhile, David and another scientist enter a pod to discuss HAL's behavior, which has been getting more hostile as of late. He believes that he can do no wrong because machines (unlike people) are programmed to be infallible. Little do the men know, HAL absorbed every word of their antagonistic conversation. When Dave's friend is outside of the ship later on, HAL cuts his air supply and kills him. He also terminates the life support on the other scientists in cryogenic stasis, killing them as well. Dave goes outside in a pod to investigate, and HAL locks him out of the ship. He lets Dave know that despite the precautions he took, he was still able to read his lips while talking to the other scientist. After HAL refuses to let Dave back into the ship, he goes in through an airlock, disconnects HAL's wiring, and finds a video saying how the true mission objective is to go to Jupiter to find a radio message. This message was apparently sent by the monolith. Once at Jupiter, Dave experiences something unlike anything ever seen before, and he is engulfed by a gigantic wave of swirling, colored light beams. This lasts for quite some time, and when it comes to an end, he's suddenly in a bedroom as an elderly version of himself. As he lies on the bed, the black rectangle appears one last time. It turns him into a fetus and he floats in the earth's orbit in a small ball of light. I really don't understand the ending of this movie, and to be fair, most people would say the same. It's just really weird. There are, of course, many theories as to what it (and the entire movie) means, but those are too lengthy to get into here. What I can comment on are the performances, settings, visuals, and other things you can observe just by letting the movie play. There's no real main character of this movie, that is until the plot introduces the spaceship Discovery. Keir Dullea as David Bowman is a faithful portrayal of a man who has left his homeworld in order to venture into the unknown depths of space. Climbing into the ship for the first time ready to leave earth, he must have felt how the great pilots of the first world war did when they stepped into their planes. New technology can be very dangerous because of its untested nature, and brave men are required to make use of it. Dave embarks on the mission anyway since he is ready to do whatever it takes to advance humanity's understanding of science through exploration. HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain) is definitely the main villain of this movie, although you can argue he's not very antagonistic. He serves as the direct antithesis to Dave, but is introduced as merely the artificial intelligence that controls the spaceship Discovery. At first, this seems like a fine idea, letting computers run spaceships and do mundane tasks. Machines do repetitive processes well. Later on, HAL shows that he is much more than a mere computer. By controlling the ship, he leverages control over the fates of all men onboard. He decides who lives and who dies, which is why Dave must ultimately shut him down. Probably the most amazing aspect of this film for me is how every single visual effect in it was achieved without using a single computer. All the spaceships, strange patterns of light, and everything else was done physically. They used a lot of miniatures to create many of these effects. When you're watching though, you have no idea. It looks that real. Another part of this movie that makes it what it is is the soundtrack. Kubrick utilized a lot of classical music, most memorably during the first few minutes. This is important because 2001 does not have as much dialogue as a typical film, so the music is a useful method for making the audience feel a certain emotion. There are some scenes in the film that feel pretty slow, such as the one or two instances that involve a bunch of guys talking at a press conference, but mostly, I don't see how anyone can be disinterested in 2001. I can't think of many other movies that even come close to being this revolutionary. Science fiction has definitely been done before this, but the sheer size, scale, and multiple interpretations of this film are what makes it one of the best ever made.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
203,MattBrady099,2001: A Space Odyssey - Movie Review,10,18 November 2016,"LIFF30 2016 #5""Daisy.""So I just saw ""2001"" at a film festival and it was kinda incredible. Why do I feel like I just ticked off my bucket list of things to die before you die. I've been waiting a long time to watch this on the big screen. I already seen the movie about 3 or 4 years ago, but my memory of the film isn't that strong. So when I was picking what movies I wanted to see at (LIFF), and this was on the list, as the festival also shows classic movies.Re-watching this movie was quite the experience. Nothing like a massive screen and loud speakers blasting off beautiful music while drifting in space. From the dawn of man till the end of human life. The cycle repeats.But seriously, what can I honestly say about ""2001"" that hasn't been said already. It's one of the greatest Sci-Fi films of all time. It's groundbreaking and pure genius. Even at the slower pace parts, I was still engaged. After it was over, I was contemplating on it.For a 1968 film, it's visual effects still hold up today and looks way more convincing than today. Well, there was a couple of effects that was noticeable, but the rest (which is mostly practical) still looks amazing. The ""Star Gate"" sequence is one example of a trippy and a breathtaking effect that it owned Kubrick an Oscar.Every shot in this movie is like something you would hang up on your wall. Kubrick has been known for being a perfectionist of his work. This is a work of an artist that doesn't just get praised for how much he dose, but how little. Three years of making this - you can get easily attached to your work that after awhile you find the hidden beauty of the story. Do it 40 or 127 times until you get what you want and exactly how you wanted. A similar method that Chaplin use for ""City Lights"". But it isn't just images that kept me attention and I don't think Stanley was intending on that. There's plenty of scenes that goes on forever, not for spectacle, but more of use to inhabit everything that's going on.It also helps that music in this is so beautiful, but very eerie at the right moments. I can take the monolith on the moon scene as a great example of the bone chilling music. It may be scary for some, because of ""Requiem for Soprano"" playing in the background, but I kinda see like this:Man discovers a 4 million year old structure buried under the surface of the moon. Perfect angles and a disturbingly flawless complexion. imagine if this event actually occurred in reality and you were sitting in front of your TV when a breaking news bulletin interrupts your program. Just imagine the weight of the emotions you feel. There is no explanation for how this structure could even exist. its impossible! It will be the most reality-shattering event in the history of the world.It's one of my favorite scenes of all time, because the scene alone perfectly captures that feeling. No explanation. No answers. No reason.Overall: Films like ""Space Odyssey"" is why I love movies. Extraordinary and beautiful work of art. ""2001"" isn't just a classic for it's effects or the show stealer Hal9000, but how it wants to inspire and enlarge us. A space voyage that evokes questions and kept the audience in awe for 48 years.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
204,baileycrawly,"""Open the Pod Bay Doors, HAL""",8,2 April 2020,"A lot of people don't like this movie, and putting the label on them stating they just don't ""get it"" really isn't fair. Because a lot of the criticisms against the movie are valid. The lack of dialogue and extended musical/visual scenes are definitely not something the general film-going public nowadays will flock to see (it's an absolute shame, but it's the reality). It truly is a slow-paced movie without much of a plot, too, which a lot of people dislike the film for.
Today, on its fifty-second anniversary, i have finally decided to sit down and view the film from start to finish, and I have to say I'm thoroughly impressed.
This isn't a movie that is designed to be watched like other movies. It's not something you can put on in the background while you're making supper or doing the dishes; this is a film that requires you to both watch and contemplate throughout. The stunning visuals (that held up over the years, I might add) only serve to amplify the beauty in simplicity that Kubrick was going for in this film.
With 2001: A Space Odyssey, you really get out of the movie what you put in. If you're looking for casual entertainment that can provide background noise while you surf your phone, this film will be a major disappointment. If you're looking for some deep plot, you'll also, likewise, be disappointed. George Lucas said it best himself when he explained the plot as being ""razor thin."" It's an extremely basic story told in a very grandiose way. It's pretentious (I don't mind), it's rambling (somehow I ended up enjoying all the extended sequences), and it's unlike anything else, which is both a good and a bad thing. Good in the sense that, aside from being parodied and tributed (not a word) to absolute death, there hasn't really been anything to my knowledge that has come out that felt like an imitation of this film. It's a bad thing because I would definitely have loved for Kubrick to explore this kind of filmmaking a little more in his lifetime.This is a confusing, baffling, mind-bending movie that requires more than one watch, without question. Film students adore it; Kubrick and sci-fi fans around the world hail it for what it accomplished both cinematically and in terms of its unique story-telling antics.
The immediate response coming fresh off this movie is definite confusion, but a curiosity to gain better understanding of what played out on-screen and how such a thing applies to me in my own life.Definitely a satisfying, if simultaneously maddening, experience.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
205,Angeneer,Breathtaking,9,5 December 2000,"This film is awe-inspiring yet minimalistic, slow paced yet with thousands of years of time-range, emitting loneliness and warmth, grandeur and insignificance. A true work of art with imposing classical masterpieces playing at the background. It asks the questions and doesn't always give the answers. Moreover, what to say about these excellent visual effects, there are so many contemporary films which would be ultimately embarrassed. It is hands-down the defining sci-fi movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
206,bsinc,Mind boggling special effects,9,1 February 2002,"The main reason why I liked this movie, besides the brilliant musical accompaniment by the Strausses, were the amazing special effects. And this movie dates back to, well a very long time ago, 1968 to be exact. I don't know how he did it, the scene where the spaceship is landing on the moon, and the dome starts to open, or the one where  Dr. Poole is running around and around. It blew me away, and even if t is just a cheap trick, I don't care, it looks fenommenal, the way special effects should - so that you don't notice that they're fake. Well these certainly did not. And I just love those scenes where the spaceships are cruising and you hear the classical music - so perfect. And the movie itself wasnt bad -just very, very bizarre.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
207,moviemanMA,2001: A Cinematic Triumph,10,20 August 2005,"Great movies always have great quotes. Gone With the Wind has, ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"", Casablanca has, ""Here's looking at you kid..."", and The Godfather had, ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse..."". All of these lines show emotion and give the movie it's tempo. Yet one of the most famous lines of all time comes from a movie that has very little dialogue. ""Open the pod bay doors, HAL..."" This is the line from 2001: A Space Odyssey that made AFI's 100 years...100 Movie Quotes list, enshrining all of those lines we keep saying long after watching the movie.In Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick takes us on an incredible voyage from the dawn of man to space age. We see how man has evolved and keeps evolving. The movie starts out with an overture and then we enter a barren landscape. The only life appears to be a few boars and the creatures in focus...the apes. When a black monolith appears in the middle of their clan, they begin to evolve ever so slightly just by discovering the first weapon...the club. From here Kubrick zooms us to Earth's orbit.Here we meet up with Dr. Heywood Floyd, a man who's mission is to see what is going on at the lunar. What they discover is another black monolith like the one the apes came into contact with. Figuring out that it came from Jupiter, we now climb aboard the vessel heading their with Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole. Also on the ship are more scientists and explorers. They are in hibernation, being kept alive by the on board computer, HAL 9000. HAL is everything a ship needs. It guides the crew, helps them, talks with them, and even connects with them. It can conduct interviews and just about anything a ship and its crew needs. The HAL 9000 series is a foolproof machine that seems to be the perfect unit for the job. The only problem might be that it is too smart and can actually...feel. When a piece of equipment malfunctions due to unknown causes, Dave and Frank question HAL's method for solving the problem. They feel as if it is working against them and the mission. It seems that HAL knows something that they don't. This is the start of a whole different problem for Dave and Frank.This film is a standout in a genre that is full of gems. 2001: A Space Odyssey shows incredible achievements in Special Effects, winning and Oscar for Best Effects in 1969. The quality I most admire of the film is how real it appears to be. The flow of dialogue, of which there is very little of, sounds like something you'd hear if you worked on a space station. It sounds at times like everyday life. The cinematography is fantastic. Much like all Kubrick films it has the Stanley Kubrick quality in the way it is presented. It is very original and fresh.Kubrick's direction is so well crafted. This is by far one of his best pieces of work. He has 9 movies on IMDb's Top 250 list which is more than half of all the films he has made. 2001: A Space Odyssey will open your eyes in a way you can't explain. Kubrick's camera direction, musical selection, and overall timing of the movie is perfect. It's a movie light-years ahead of it's time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
208,Rautus,A great sci-fi classic,10,12 November 2007,"2001: A Space Odyssey is one of those movies that really sticks with you just like A Clockwork Orange, Stanley Kurbrick does a great job with the directing. The shots of space ships and the space stations is incredible, the effects are also impressive. The film tells us about the Evolution of Man since 2001 shows the Dawn of Man where mankind was apes then goes to future where everything is high-tech, the transition between the two times is beautifully done. The acting is great, the voice of HAL is so calm yet so creepy especially when he turns against them.2001: A Space Odyssey is a creative, fantastic sci-fi classic that should be seen, one of Stantley Kurbrick's masterpieces. Check this out. 10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
209,blackmamba99971,Instant most popular movie,10,19 July 2010,"This is quite the ultimate classic science fiction film. 2001 at the time was in fact ahead of its time from the master Stanley Kubrik. Using sounds and music which gives a kind of ballet in space. Orchestral soundtrack using Bach and Strauss was ingenious of showing us the deliberate way of matching the movements of ships that coincide with each track. Including the eerie sounds from the Monolith when Floyd reaches the dig site on the moon. The special effects from Douglas Trumbull was quite possibly the pinnacle of what movie making really is, which led Trumbull on to films such as Close encounters of the third kind, and his very own film - Brainstorm. The idea of showing man in his early stages of evolution to the present was wonderful. Adapting to their surroundings, with the help of the Monolith that just appears one sudden morning as the tribe had begun to awaken from a daily sleep. The same haunting sounds from what people can see is that the Monolith is a type of teaching tool, that embeds signals inside the human mind, yet without actually interfering on how it involves on how the tribe goes on living. Questions of our role in life had started because of Kubrik's influence in this film. And using the Hal 9000 computer shows us that no one is infallible to mistakes. This is by far the most important film to date, which holds many attributable factors to those who also make science fiction films. The sets and designs were hand made, no computer technology was involved in creating this awe and inspiring movie. Excellent to watch on those off days from work.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
210,majikstl,Empty space,6,19 April 2004,"Seldom has so much awe been directed at a film with so little to say. The message that 2001 imparts can be summed up simply: Intelligence is the element that made apes into humans and will eventually cause humans to evolve even further. Shorter still: Intellect = evolution. Not particularly profound. Not particularly controversial. Not even particularly original. Just a common sense observation. But director Stanley Kubrick's penchant for pretentious rambling and oblique storytelling invites viewers to make desperate attempts to look for greater meaning, which simply is not there. As the old saying goes: There must be a pony!Which is not to say the film is devoid of substance. Buried in the middle of the film is a Jim-dandy episode of ""The Twilight Zone."" When the astronauts find themselves at war with HAL, the computer that serves as both their servant and their master, the film -- finally -- develops into a compelling drama. The situation itself is suspenseful, plus, it lends itself to many interpretations: Man versus machine, man versus his God, intellect versus instinct, the future versus the present, etc. Dramatically, visually and intellectually, the film does, ever so briefly, live up to its hype. The heart of the film beats strong. Unfortunately, the heart beats in a body that is grotesquely deformed.For a film that looks so sparse and lean, 2001 is ridiculously flabby and out of shape. What is amazing is that so much of what is romanticized as being mystical and philosophical is really just contrived and sometimes just plain silly. The infamous black monolith is a mere MacGuffin, a gimmick that lamely propels the story and loosely ties together the film's three acts. The controversial and endless ""dawn of man"" prologue drags on far past the point where it has anything to say and yet still reveals so little about either the film's plot or mankind. The ""star child"" finale is, to be kind, cute, but no more insightful than the rainbow at the end of E.T.The adoration the film has acquired has an almost cult-like arrogance to it: ""The film is great because we 'get' it and those who don't are just too stupid or shallow or, well, just not one of us."" Yet, when pressed, few even attempt to venture a guess as to why the film is awe inspiring, brilliant and revolutionary. Instead, the film's defenders only make excuses for the film's failings: It's boring!  ""No, it's meditative."" The scenes are repetitive and drag on too long! ""No, Kubrick trusts the viewer to absorb the beauty and the depth of the images, which transcend conventional film pacing."" The ending makes no sense! ""No, the film defies conventional logic."" Why? How? ""Well, it has to, otherwise why would it be like it is?""
The ultimate paradox about 2001 is that Kubrick is hailed as a genius because he has made a film that raises more questions than it ever hoped to answer. The mere fact that it is so vague in its intentions angers some, but it overly impresses others.  To argue that the film is great just because it can't be easily explained is no more honest than saying it is lousy because it can't easily be explained. And for my money, a genius is one who provides answers, or at least theories, not one who just asks questions.
The irony is that even with all the pretentious hot air with which Kubrick over inflates his epic, he still gets his basic message across. To survive, the astronaut Bowman must defeat HAL, but in doing so he, at best, only delays his own extinction. The evolution of intelligence, even in a corrupted state, will be man's undoing. Mankind is doomed to outsmart himself.  And the same can be said for Stanley Kubrick.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
211,TheDonaldofDoom,Slow and elegant,8,3 January 2019,"You can see films like Instellar in 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I'm sure plenty other films that were influenced by it. A paints a radical picture of the future of humanity, but it starts off showing our origins. The apes' ability to use tools is presented as the moment that they became men. The switch from the flying bone to the space shuttle is a really good way of showing that it all started with the ability to use tools. This technological progress is what a lot of 2001 is about. Progress from bones, to spacecraft, to a supercomputer that threatens man's very future. Out-of-control AI is the theme of many modern sci-fi stories but here it is in a 1968 film.Space Odyssey demands that you enjoy it at its own slow pace. And that's fine, it makes it a sort of meditative experience. It's well shot, from the pretty sunrises in the first chapter to the elegant shots of spacecraft. This is supported by perfectly chosen music such as Sunrise, which inspires awe, and the Blue Danube, which conveys the Universe's cold beauty.A creepy element of Space Odyssey's futuristic vision is HAL, the supercomputer. There is some really good cinematography here. As the two crew members realise the threat HAL poses and plan to switch it off, the camera's position lets you see it in the background. You just know it's lip-reading them. After its attempts to stop Dave returning to the craft fail, it's fascinating to see it start adopting a different, fearful tone. Of course, whether or not it actually feels that emotion or is just imitating it is left ambiguous.As the final chapter shows, the ultimate evolution of humanity is transcendence. Man becomes Firstborn, reborn again, represented onscreen as a baby. The twist, that would go on to be recycled in films like Interstellar, is that the monolith that guided man to reach for the stars, was itself produced by future man. It's a satisfying end to a film that is all about transcendence. Overly optimistic this film may be, but it is good to explore the positives of technological progress rather than just our pessimistic expectations.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

213,emperor_bender,Wow...what just happened?,10,24 October 2008,"After I watched this movie, I thought to myself ""Wait...what just happened?"" And if I had immediately posted a comment on it, I probably would have given it a 7.However, I read up on the movie and whatnot and found out the point was to actually BE disoriented. I thought to myself ""Hey...I WAS confused as anything! Kubrick and Clarke did their job right!"" Kubrick's movies are always perfect to me, and after re-thinking this movie, this one was no different.Lets start off with the acting. Very well done. The best performance was by Keir Dullea as Dave Bowman, the protagonist. There were excellent supporting roles by Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, and Leonard Rossiter. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Douglas Rain, who played the voice of HAL, the computer on board of the ship and ""extra crew member"". I also really liked the ""Dawn of Man"" scene with the gorillas. Particularly Daniel Richter as the lead ape, ""Moon-Watcher"". I thought he did a very VERY good job and the costumes and whatnot were very authentic.Next for the effects. All I can say is WOW! The effects in this movie were better than movies TODAY. I did not believe this movie was really made in 1968 until I looked it up again. The effects were just THAT good! The ship scenes were some of the best ever seen on film.Now for the plot. Very very very good but very very very confusing. I was thrown off several times and every time I got back on track I was thrown off again. This seems to have been intended however. Well, their aim worked and I ended up leaving with more questions than answers.This movie is a work of art and there are literally none like it these days. Its sad that such a great movie like this is so unique and that no more are like it, then again they would find a way to mess it up eventually.10/10.Kubrick fans do not wanna miss this one.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
214,dead47548,Breathtaking.,10,8 January 2008,"The word ""masterpiece"" doesn't even begin to describe the stunning brilliance of this film. It is more deep, profound and complex than any other work I've ever seen. I am still completely baffled by elements of it. I have my own interpretations, as everyone does, and I can see the connections between everything but I'm sure it is far more complex than my rather simplistic interpretation. Just everything about it (the ""Dawn of Man"", HAL, beyond the infinite, the monolith, the Star Child) is absolutely mind blowing. I still can't seem to grasp my head around the perfection that I just experienced. Technically speaking, it's a marvel. The cinematography and visual effects are sensational, and it is rare to find ones superior. I wasn't bored for a second. There are a few instances where the story seems to drag a little bit, but it's necessary to further the story and explain everything that is occurring. Without these little drags, the story would be just full of holes and situations that are left unexplained. However, Kubrick recognizes this slight dullness and uses remarkable visuals, cinematography and a booming score to keep the viewer thoroughly engaged no matter what the situation. It's been over an hour and a half since I finished the film and I am still stunned, basking in it's supreme magnificence. Certainly one of the finest achievements of all time, and easily the best Kubrick I've seen so far. Exceeded any expectation I had.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
215,p-jonsson,Magnificent...and excruciatingly boring.,6,27 January 2019,"I got this movie recently when it came out on Ultra HD Blu-ray simply because it was missing in my collection and, being a Sci-Fi fan, missing 2001 in my collection simply would not do. It is a movie that was made to rely almost entirely on the visuals. It could be said that it is a visual symphony if that makes sense. Thus it was filmed on 70 mm film and in 6 channel stereo which, at the time was a huge thing. Thanks to this it actually made some sense to transfer this movie to Ultra HD Blu-ray since the originals were really good enough even though the movie was made in 1968.I remember watching this movie as a kid and was profoundly disappointed. I thought come on, where's the adventure, not to mention any form of action? Today I can more appreciate it for what it is. A visually stunning movie. I also can more appreciate the fact that the movie is trying to be scientifically accurate instead of going all out on the fiction part. The parts where gravity, or rather the lack thereof, was portrayed, that was really high tech movie making at the time. I also noticed now, when re-watching it, that all the screens are actually flat which also was really far in the future at the time. Actually it was still pretty much in the future back in 2001.However, even today, I have to say that I find the movie excruciatingly boring. It is two and a half hour long and it moves very, very slowly. It takes 50 minutes of movie time before we actually get to the main part of the movie and get onto the Discovery for instance. No matter how great the visuals are, there's only so much boredom I can stand before it starts to get to me.In the last 30 minutes or so the movie starts to become very psychedelic. The part where Bowman is pulled into the vortex, the stargate, is going on forever and in the end it just becomes a blur of headache inducing color effects. The final parts of the movie with the three Bowmans of different ages is just weird.So,as this is a non-professional and personal take on the movie I cannot really motivate more than 3 out of 5 stars.I hadn't actually planned to review this movie. Everything has really already been said about it but I could not refrain after having read this crap at Rotten Tomatoes:""Critics Consensus: One of the most influential of all sci-fi films - and one of the most controversial - Stanley Kubrick's 2001 is a delicate, poetic meditation on the ingenuity - and folly - of mankind.""It's pretty well known that Rotten Tomatoes is the absolutely worst movie rating site around and the so called ""critics"" are useless culture elite morons with an over-inflated opinion about themselves at best and politically motivated SJW asswipes at worst but still.What the hell is controversial about it? Reality check, there's really nothing controversial about it at all. It is just a fictional story in the future. Then we have that crap ""the folly"". What bloody folly? If anything the movie shows a much better future than what we got. A future where the politicians apparently promoted advancement of science and space exploration which is the direct opposite to the money and oxygen wasters we have today.Sure, if you indulge too much in smoking funny mushrooms or are politically motivated you can probably ""interpret"" the hell out of any movie and ""find"" whatever message you want but it is still BS.Well, that was my (controversial?) take on 2001.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
216,Finfrosk86,A technically good snooze fest,5,18 December 2014,"Don't believe the hype. This movie is dated and for the most part, very boring. I mean like, really, really boring. Yes, the visuals are great for their time, and there are cool elements here, but it is way to long, and very little actually happens.I can enjoy old movies, I mostly like newer movies, but there are lots of good old movies too. And I can appreciate visual art, I am a visual artist with a visual brain, so it's not like I am a simpleton who only likes action movies. I like all kinds of movies, if they are entertaining. This is just not, except some parts here and there.People get very mad when someone criticizes this movie, because everyone thinks it's supposed to be this fantastic classic, and maybe it is, but it is a boring classic. But don't rate this super high just because everyone else does.On a couple of occasions it's interesting, for a minute or so, then it's straight back to snooze mode. Old movies are not always good just because they were good back in the day. It racked up some stars from me, because I really liked some of the acting from the main character, and of course the special effects who are incredible considering they are soon to be 50 years old (oh my!), and a couple of things I won't mention any further to not spoil, but all in all I was not entertained by this. Rather watch The Shining again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
217,charchuk,A pinnacle of science fiction cinema,10,6 June 2007,"It's amazing that a film like this is from 1968. Even comparing it to the other sci-fi classic of that year, Planet of the Apes, it feels decades ahead in its visuals, its story, and its style. While Apes is fantastic, it feels like a film of the '60s, with the cheesy effects, melodramatic acting, and obvious use of soundstages. It is very much a film of its time. This one, on the other hand, could just have easily been made today. The panoramic shots of massive spaceships are breathtaking, almost a decade before Star Wars accomplished the same thing, and the amazingly accurate future inventions shown in this film reveal Kubrick's incredible vision. Undoubtedly one of the best science fiction films of all-time, and certainly a major influence upon the genre for years to come.It's certainly not an overtly entertaining or enjoyable film to watch - the long stretches without dialogue and the exceptional patience with which each scene is granted make the audience feel every one of its two and a half hours. It obviously doesn't appeal to everyone. For someone who is in awe of the care present in each scene, though, it's a breeze to sit through. The fact that the film is bookended by twenty minute-long segments of dialogue-free film doesn't bother me at all, as the images and visuals are so strong and so interesting that it makes no difference to me at all if there's dialogue or not. Plus, the dialogue that is present in the film is so purposefully inane and harmless that one is forced to focus on the visuals. Almost the entire story is presented through images; I think there's only one speech directly related to the plot.The first time I watched it, my favourite act was the third one, with HAL. That was probably due to the fact that it contained the most dialogue, had the most plot, and had that creepy robot with the eloquent speech. I thought everything else in the movie was unneeded and just dragged it down - especially that psychedelic ending. Now, I can appreciate the contribution that each act makes to the whole; how the entire story is told throughout the film. I haven't yet read the novel, but I'm interested to see just how similar it is, because this story really is quite incredible. And, though I still don't understand the ending, I can appreciate just how brilliant it is. I think I don't understand it (wholly) because we're not meant to; our first contact with extra-terrestrial will not be as linear and straight-forward as Hollywood makes it out to be, and this film reflects that.The acting is good, the dialogue is fine, and the sets are kinda dated, but this film is all about the images. From the iconic shot of the ape throwing the bone that morphs into a spaceship, to the classic appearance of HAL, to Dave's final journey to the alien intelligence, it is the visuals of this film, much more than the script, that tell the story. And, though it's nearly forty years old, it's not nearly as dated as every other film from its era. That, in itself, is an incredible accomplishment. The fact that this is a terrific film is even more amazing.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
218,zzhhhqing,I admired Kubrick very much,9,12 May 2020,"Commenting on one of his five favorite movies, Li An said: ""I admired Kubrick very much. I can't say exactly what kind of movie it is about"" 2001 Space Walk "". I watched this movie for the first time. At the time, it deeply attracted me. It felt like an illusion experience after taking psychedelics. ""Today, I experienced it on the big screen of the archives. The repaired version made this illusion worse and penetrated into every nerve.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
219,rooee,A giant leap,10,7 February 2011,"Kubrick's monolithic mid-period masterpiece is as remarkable as much for what it has NOT influenced in sci-fi filmmaking as what it has. So while special effects took a giant leap in 1968 (thanks in no small part to Douglas Trumball, who would give us a grim new world in 1982 with Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, the original ending to which made use of a series of helicopter shots lent by a certain Mr Kubrick), to this day we still have the sounds of swooshing of ships and zapping lasers in the vacuum of outer space. Then there is also the small matter of awe. Other than Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris, it's hard to think of another example of a science fiction movie with such an unflinching commitment to spiralling wonder.And to think it all came from a (very) short story named The Sentinel - a tall tale about a pyramid-shaped creation half-buried on a Moon populated with ""degenerate plants"". (Well, it was written over 20 years before humans set foot on the thing.) Kubrick and Clarke's screenplay plonks this lunar discovery into the second act of a four-act epic. Long before that there is early, ape-like Man. The mysterious monolith appears to the Moon-Watcher and his flock, perhaps signalling the birth of religion. Jump-cut a couple million years (as you do) and the age of technology reigns - so Man is able to detect a magnetic anomaly on the Moon, which leads Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) to our species' second audience with the strange black block. It's pointing toward Jupiter. So begins the third act, wherein astronauts Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Poole (Gary Lockwood) set sail for the great Red Eye, along with their infallible red-eyed companion, HAL, who represents the pinnacle of Man's technological endeavour. Paradoxically HAL also represents the limitations of technology, inadvertently highlighting the need for Man to transcend his current form. This paves the existential way for the final act, which sees Bowman enter a Jovian Stargate and undergo an exhilarating process of accelerated self-actualization. And then... well, my personal belief is that the final frame is the most profound image in cinema. No, in art.Clarke and Kubrick surround their characters with the clinical environment of technology, almost to the point of fetish - what delightful convenience, what intricate design! - only to strip it all away in the final reel, where some kind of apotheosis occurs in a cosmic hotel room decorated in the design of pre-electronic Earth. Luminous floor aside, we could be back in the time of Enlightenment.Much has been made of the technological prescience of Kubrick and co-writer Clarke. There is Heywood's video call to his daughter (Vivian Kubrick, who would go on to make the documentary The Making of The Shining, as well as score Full Metal Jacket). But look closer and you'll also notice that the screen is FLAT. And what are those contraptions Bowman and Poole use to watch the news on BBC 12? They look an awful lot like a certain popular tablet computer... This was 1968, remember.It's easy to throw around words like ""pompous"" and ""pretentious"" when viewing conceptual art. Clearly, if a viewer finds it does not affect them on an emotional level, then the natural defence is to attack the intentions of the artist. In the case of 2001: A Space Odyssey, not unlike the National Socialist Party's (mis)appropriation of Nietzsche's ""Ubermensch"", it is possible to read the Starchild as a god figure, or perhaps a blandly consoling religious promise of what is to become of us beyond our corporeal suffering. This is a perfectly reasonable interpretation, if argued intelligently. The key word here is ""interpretation"", made possible by the bold ambiguity of the text. Fanboy gushing and angry backlash are rendered equally irrelevant in the presence of the wellspring of true debate. Love it or hate it, 2001: A Space Odyssey has substance enough to furnish conversations for centuries to come.For all its grandeur and its intellectual rigidity, this is a warm, often amusing, deeply human film: a celebration of Man's practically infinite synaptic potential.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
220,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Possibly the most important film of all time,10,31 July 2009,"I first saw this movie in my 8th grade science class at Maple Grove Junior High. I found it to be the most absurdly boring and pointless movie I had ever had to sit through. I was young, I was naive, and I had a lot to learn...Now, upon second viewing, at age 24, it is easily, in my opinion, one of the most important films ever made. The story alone makes most other movies feel ant-like.There are movies that are made to please an audience, and there are movies that are made to be a piece of art. In my opinion, this just might be the absolute greatest piece of abstract art in the form of film to ever be created thus far. A few years ago when The Fountain came out, I thought I had seen the ultimate art film - but I had no idea what was sitting around the corner waiting for me with 2001: A Space Odyssey...From the moment the movie starts, you're abrasively attacked with banshee-esquire sirens and a pitch black screen - you have no idea what's happening, but you are becoming a victim of the movie's concept. From the very beginning, you are not only watching a movie, but you are a part of it. For the remainder of the following 140 minutes, you will very slowly but tastefully witness some of the most powerful moments that could ever be imagined in the history of mankind - from the dawn of time, to what is imagined as the possible end... and beyond. This is a movie that simply cannot be put into words. It's an abstract experience that everyone takes differently, unless of course you are a philistine, a non-intellectual, or if you simply have no interest in why or how we exist, then most likely you will take nothing from it at all.I can say, it is a movie in which when it was over, I had no idea what had just happened in the end. But that's one of the brilliant aspects of it. I have my ideas, I have my theories, and I still have plenty of questions. It leaves you hanging in the best way.I won't even go into it but this is certainly one of my new all-time favorites. I'll never forget the shot of the apes screaming at their confusing discovery for minutes upon minutes... after a few I began to get tense. I shot up and shouted with ascending volume, ""what the **** IS THAT THING?????!?!"" - that shot never leaves my head. And ""that thing"" is still the ultimate life mystery... or at least the best representation of it that I've ever seen.I can't wait to watch it again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
221,anton-6,Kubricks best film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,29 September 2001,"The first time I saw it I did not think so much about it.It was: beautiful and weird.But the second time I find out that this is by light years thebest Science-Fi ever made and it is Kubricks best film ever. A stunning time travel that is very mind blowing.
Then I would like to say that the people who have comment on this film  said that it´s boring have wrong!!! First of all I did not find this a bit boring and I hope you understand that is is no star wars.
You can go on and Analyze and talk about this forever without really getting an answer:it´s ART!!!!!
RATING: 5/5(just a note: I have comment before on the films:Nosferatu(1922) which I  rated 5/5  and Young Frankenstein(1974)which I rated 10/10 but I have changed my mind so I give Nosferatu(1922) 4+ out of 5 and Young Frankenstein(1974)a 9/10)",2001 - A Space Odyssey
222,kdnor2011,Changed cinema from a direction point of view.,4,8 September 2011,"I finally saw 2001: A Space Oddysey about a month ago after almost a lifetime of hearing how great it was. How it changed the art of cinema, and is Stanley Kubrick's Magnum Opus. Then a little bit before I watched it, I saw the review by Confused Matthew. Confused Matthew, for those who don't know, is an internet reviewer who mostly reviews movies that he didn't like, that the mojority did like, examples include: Back to the Future Part 2, The Lion King, No Country for Old Men, Minority Report, and this. Normally I disagree with him, but unfortuantly this time I agreed, while 2001: A Space Oddysey is no where near terrible, it is probably one of the most over rated movies I've ever seen.Really the best way I can review this film is to just tell you to go watch Matthew's review, because he pretty much says what I think.Now I do agree that this film did change cinema in terms of direction, visuals, all that. This truly is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, had I never known, I never would've guessed that this movie was made in 1968. Kubrick is a great director, and now that I've seen a some of his movies, I can consider him one of my favorites. But really, the best way to describe this movie is ""empty."" I literally fast forwarded through an hour of this movie, I nearly fell asleep twice, and it is because half of the movie is just spaceships flying across space, looking at landscape, people walking around. And sure, the visuals look nice, but look at the six Star Wars movies, they looked nice, and they actually had plots. Even though I fast forwarded through an hour of a 2 hour 14 minute movie, I didn't miss anything.They go to Jupiter, the HAL 9000 goes crazy, kills most of the crew, then Bowman goes through the stargate finds himself as an old man and then turns into a fetus. What does it all mean? You know what, I couldn't care less. Sure HAL was pretty cool, but he really was only in about twenty-thirty minutes of the movie. Yes, I know that I'm pretty much repeating what Confused Matthew said, and I tried to give it a chance, I even came on to MFC right after watching it and saying it was basically OK. Yes, the visuals are amazing, but if you want to see a really good Kubrick movie, go see THe Shining, that's a brilliant movie. Hell, go see A Clockwork Orange, it was weird, but good, I think. Full Metal Jacket, sure the first half is far better than the second, but at least stuff happens in that second half.I know that this film is loved by millions of people, and to be honest, I don't hate the film, but I don't see myself ever watching it again. If you like it good for you, but I'm with Matthew on this one.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
223,Rammstein-2,Read the book - it's a lot better,6,24 January 2000,"Despite the fact that the book and the script 2001 were written simultaneously, there is no point denying that the book is much better. It is a good film, yes, but there is one detail that I just can't get by: it is so horrendously SLOW.Other than that, it's a special film all right. Weird, esoteric and bizarre at some points, but nevertheless it manages to keep all the yo-ho Star Trek out - it's almost scientific in itself. As for the minor glitch of foreseeing space stations the size of cities and inhabited bases on the moon - well...I wouldn't citizise too far. Arthur C.

The good news is they still drink coffee in the future, and from a giant thermos too. I take comfort in that. Don't get me wrong. This is one boring monster of a movie. I mean, you'd be halfway through most other pictures before Kubrick gets to the first line of dialog. In essence, this is a three-hour visual essay on how man sets out to fathom the far reaches of the solar system, but all he finds is himself. Sort of like ""Star Trek The Motion Picture"" meets ""Contact"", perhaps with a slightly better color scheme. It all comes down to what you want from a movie, but if you're looking for action, emotion, a sense of humor or any plot, this isn't for you. People will go on about how ""2001"" made history when it came out, but I'm not buying it. Pharmaceutical history maybe. It's a twelve-reel sleeping pill.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

226,RiffRaffMcKinley,The most amazing sci-fi movie of all time,10,9 June 2007,"Even in a world full of ""Independence Day""s and ""Star Wars"" flicks, the special effects of ""2001"" are still inferior to none. However, the effects of ""2001"" are not the only mind-blowing element, thanks to a top-notch director, an astounding story, and a small but wondrous lead cast.The stars in front of the cameras may seem to be Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood as the bold Jupiter astronauts, but the real stars of the show are two inanimate objects: ultra-logical computer HAL-9000 (""whom... one addresses as Hal"") and the ultra-enigmatic black monoliths scattered throughout our solar system. Stanley Kubrick rightfully favors a cerebral style over cheap mile-a-minute thrills, even though there comes a time late in the film when thrills do come around. The reason it's so good is that the thriller element never overpowers the drama, the sense of discovery, or the general legitimacy of the film's artistic capacity. Kubrick's use of classical music instead of an original score doesn't hurt, either (this is the only time I could ever actually listen to any of ""The Blue Danube"").The most awesome scene ever captured on film is the earth-shattering climactic sequence when man first meets something truly bigger than himself, a nonstop barrage of incredible sounds and colorful sights that still can't top the rest of the film in general. I don't know how else to explain it-- ""2001"" is spectacular entertainment at its best.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
227,buckikris,A Failsafe Is A Must For A Hal 9000.,8,25 November 2014,"I just watched 2001-A Space Odyssey last night. I found this movie kind of weird; but cool in a way. I hope this makes since; and I know it changed how Sci-Fi movies were made from then on. This film was before my time so I guess that's why I found it somewhat strange. I think George Lucas got it wrong when he called Star Wars a space opera. This movie is a space opera to me, just because of the way it was filmed with classical music infuse with the dialog. I love most Stanley Kubrick films; and found this one interesting. The only problem I had with it was the beginning, Dawn of Man sequence, I thought it would never end. It's not like I didn't get it either, I did, the beginning of all things. I don't know if I am the only one that feels this was; but it was just a tad nerve wracking. The movie is good the whole journey into outer space amazing; and I bet back it 68 it was a mind-blowing experience. I found the movie start to peak when they uncover the Monolith on the moon; and the whole space station scene remarkable. When the Discovery mission left for Jupiter, that's when it started to get very interesting. When have the Discovery with a crew of 5 total, 3 in hibernation and to awake and monitoring the controls, etc.. Dr. Bowden and Dr. Poole think it's great to have a H.A.L. 9000 on board with them, what could be better. When H.A.L., informs them of a malfunction on the ship they go out and bring it in to repair. The problem begins when there is no problem, Poole and Bowden start to wonder. They begin to wonder about H.A.L.; and begin have a conference . They both go into a pod turn off the audio; and start to form a plan. They do not realize that H.A.L. can read their lips. Poole and Bowden want to disconnect him they do not trust him . This is where the viewer notices H.A.L.. H.A.L. begins to take over, kill the three remaining Astronauts by shutting down their life support systems. Then he sabotages Poole life support in space. Finally when Dave gets in, he shuts H.A.L. down for good. In the end when the Monolith gives us a laser like light show, was pretty cool. The ending I didn't quit understand unless the Monolith aged Bowden in someway. It could also be that maybe the Monolith was showing him the future. All in all I liked the movie; but I am more of a fan of 2010. I think 2010 explained it in more detail. It is a good movie and if U like Kubrick films you shouldn't be disappointed. Kris L.

This movie is said to be best space movie ever made. I disagree. Yes, it might be best space movie of it's time but not of all time.Movie doesn't make perfect sense to me. The story is normal, the characters don't really get through you and the ending made no sense to me. The movie was unnecessarily slow paced and too long (2½ hours). Movie didn't have any proper explaination.I just think this movie is too much overrated. I liked this movie just because it was ahead of its time wheather you talk about visual effects, general idea of the movie and the idea of what space was like.Overall, I liked the movie for the reasons I told earlier but at the same time I would same that it is overrated and boring.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Since the film predates the moon landing, I still don't know how the hell he did it. Its plot, while interesting in a whacky sublime sorta way, is really not all that important to the experience. The acting too is true to all of his other films; well done but just a little on the warped side. It all comes down to the photography.

I think I would have to say that in my opinion, this is the greatest movie ever made. I don't know what else to say, I am that moved by this film. It has to be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen on screen. Stanley Kubrick's films tend to be really long but they always go by fast for me and this one went by the fastest. It's unreal! Everything about this movie is genius. The story is captivating and wonderful from start to finish. Some may say it's a little slow but I loved every detail. There are so many different feelings and emotions that come along with this movie, it's almost overwhelming. I loved the visuals and anyone would be crazy not to.

I've never seen anything like it before and doubt I ever will again.I'll say this categorically - it is *not* the best movie ever made, not even close. It's not even as good as A Clockwork Orange which is magnificent.But it is superbly crafted, deep, and ultimately so thought-provoking that it deserves a place in the hall of fame for its sheer visionary content.Yes, the plot's a little fragmented, and none of the characters are particularly personable, but the truth is the story isn't about them.It's a tale of existence, of viewing and perceiving the universe and understanding that 99.999999% of everything is way beyond our own comprehension.As for the Planet of the Apes comparison another reviewer made, well Planet of the Apes clearly concluded - one of the greatest endings cinema has ever bared witness to.

232,dvc5159,Apothetical.,10,30 November 2008,"A stunning, spectacular, psychedelic, intense, and fascinating trip into outer space, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" remains not only the greatest science fiction film, but also one of, if not the, greatest films ever to grace our screens. I kid you not.Every shot is filled with beautiful scenery and effects (that are still impressive today), that will stimulate your mind and make you ask yourself the purpose of life. How? Why? You will have to see it to believe it. The best thing about this movie is that it is daring, DARING, to show such questions off in an abnormal manner towards an unexpected audience. ""Why are we here? How did we came to be? Are we creations of God? Are we our own God?"". Yes, it is as philosophical as they say.I am simply stunned at some other people's comments. Bored? BORED?! You say? Shocking. You are one of Hollywood's victims, watching most of their propaganda that either makes people joyfully glee or kicking each others' guts out with stupid comedy or political references shown in their films. No. Get a life. Watch this film. Ask yourself the meaning of life. Repeated viewings are required to get the full message. Each new viewing gives new questions and new answers. The slow pace of the film is necessary for you to absorb these questions and answers. Yes, this is a calling, told visually.What director Stanley Kubrick has done here is too good for mere words. He and co-creator Arthur C. Clarke became science fiction masters, right after this film, and it is easy to see from here. The film shows visually stunning sequences, mixed in with beautiful, harrowing and haunting music to create a spectacular, exquisite and wondrous event for the senses. This is not just any film, this is film art at its best.From the lavish set design that is all-too realistic, to the grim realization that it brings forth, this film is magical. A moment not to lose as you find yourself in the deepest chasms of outer space, from a space station to the deep end of Jupiter. Also, man's evolution is made evident with the Dawn of Man sequence, also masterfully interpreting primitive apes who use bones as weapons, then the famous ""jump cut"" shows a nuclear/laser satellite over the mid-air bone. Showing a ""weapon of mass destruction"" prophecy. It seems all too real now.Space exploration. The film was made in 1968, and is set in 2001. Although that time limit has come and pass, some, but not most, of the things shown in the film are not invented yet. It still shows that mankind still has a long way to go even after all those inventions and progresses, both in real-life and on the screen. The Final Frontier, as Star Trek would put it. Man may not conquer it. But we can experience its beauty.Technically speaking, it ticks all the boxes. The scope is wide. The effects are great. The cinematography is beautiful. The music is haunting. Keir Dullea's makes us feel for his character. The villainous HAL 9000 is cold and chilling to the bone, like the icy cold of space. The direction is mesmerizing. The script sublime. The shocks genuine. The chills up your spine it brings. The majesty of it all. Who am I kidding? Word's simply will not do this piece of art justice.If this does not gain a position in the Top 20, never mind the Top 250, I urge you movie fans out there to see this film. It's an absolute must. If you don't, consider yourself a liar if you claim that you're a fan of science fiction, movies, or art, whatever the cause. It's a film event that must be behold by all, told by a master filmmaker, who truly is one of, if not the, greatest filmmaker who ever lived.The film has inspired numerous films, like ""Star Wars"", ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"", and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". Even it's theme of questioning human existence is explicitly delivered in the almost-equally masterful anime franchise ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"", which I urge anyone to see if they liked this film. But really, this film is the great-granddaddy of them all. It shows science fiction in a serious light, and eroding any shred of camp value of the '40s and '50s.Forget George Lucas. Step aside, Steven Spielberg. Move over, Ridley Scott and James Cameron. Stanley Kubrick is The Man and you better believe it.People, this film is apothetical.Overall: 10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
233,Med-Jasta,Terribly amazing,1,15 June 2021,"I give this a 1 star because ultimately it's not enjoyable. Who can actually watch this movie? Because that's what movies are about. This can come in many shapes and sizes but this movie is unwatchable. I think people confuse it's enjoyably with it's technically achievements. Don't get me wrong, this is one of the most important movies of all time. But is it good? No. It's not good. And anybody who says it is is lying to themselves and either doesn't want to ruin their nerd credit or they want to make their film school teacher happy.Everything looks great. The special effects are amazing. And in context it's even more stunning. Especially because since it's release directors have cited this movie as an inspiration. And many movies were either made or rose to their potential because of this. This movie was the first legitimate A list sci-fi movie. The story lines are good. But the way the movie is presented is not. Everything goes on for way too long. It's boring as all hell. And when a story line ends or a self indulgence passes and things start to go somewhere we are quickly thrown into another pretension.This really stinks of sci-fi of the time. Everybody will say that it's artistic or some other crap but when it comes down to it so much of this movie is showing off the special effects. They paid a lot of money for it and they're going to get their money's worth on the screen. But no Kubrick wouldn't do that, he's an artist, right? Well he did it and you were all duped into thinking that a lot more was going on than actually was. This is how sci-fi was at the time and this movie is no different.No one can pretend that Kubrick wasn't pretentious and self indulgent. His movies are revered as untouchable these days but if you are able to think on your own you'll see that he does so much stuff just for the sake of doing it. He's contrived and disingenuous. He's not story driven, he's counter driven. He's the PT Anderson or Tarantino of his time. They are chalked full of cool things but in the end they aren't good movies. A few are.This movies biggest problem is that it goes out of it's way to not explain anything. I'm all up for a little ambiguity but this keeps you in the dark, leaving you to guess at best. If it was cut by about half I'd be able to stomach it and could accept it as visual experimentation. But since you are stuck watching so many things repeat over and over not only is the point made but it's driven into the ground and ruins the original effect. Like in the last sequence, after about 30 seconds of trippy patterns the coolness goes away and it gets old, then annoying and then boring. When if it was much shorter the effect would have maintained it's intent. Then we move onto the landscapes and all this repeats. Then he turns old and is reborn as a baby possibly? It's up for interpretation just like the rest of the movie is. Which is a bunch of BS if you ask me. A movie has a story, it's not a fill in the blanks how you want to kind of thing.I looked up the book and low and behold the plot is explained. I don't know how any of that was supposed to show up on the screen. The whole ending makes sense and is really cool and would have made these things that happened relevant. Don't even give me some crap of saying that this movie is art and that people just don't get it. Do you get it? Can you actually explain this movie? Or are you just guessing? I think the story was there and Kubrick either got caught up in all of the cool stuff or thought that it would be so unconventional to not have it make any sense. I would say he was on drugs but as we all know he claims that he wasn't. So we only have his ego and artistic pretensions to explain this movie.I know my opinion isn't popular on the internet. It is in real life because I have never met anyone that actually likes this movie. They all say the same things that I said. But it's okay to be yourself and be an individual and not succumb to per pressure to maintain your artistic credit. After all we are just talking about opinions here.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
234,DeBBss,"Stanley Kubrick, How Did You Do This?",8,1 June 2020,"Many people love 2001: A Space Odyssey for its thought provoking screenplay, but for me, it's special effects. 2001: A Space Odyssey blew my mind like no other film I have ever seen. That's because this film was originally released in 1968 where visual effects were practically nonexistent. And in my opinion, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Stanley Kubrick's best movie solely because of how visually impressive it is.The plot is incredibly slow, just like any other Stanley Kubrick screenplay. You never get a clear explanation why things are happening, so you really have to put the pieces together. To really understand 2001: A Space Odyssey, you need an explanation video or something because 2001: A Space Odyssey is very confusing. I personally don't like these types of screenplays, because in my opinion, it's a very pretentious and lazy way to get you thinking. I do like the themes that are given throughout the story. The themes that are explored are way ahead of its time, like A.I being dangerous and unpredictable. The screenplay is impressive none the less, and it's still great to this day.2001: A Space Odyssey is not a character film, it's more about the visuals and screenplay. As I've said, the visuals are the best part about 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are many scenes that are still mind blowing, like the running scene. Also the scenes where we get to see outside of the spacecrafts and look into space are amazing. It was so masterfully done that it actually looks real. These practical effects can still stand up to CGI effects, as they are both fairy realistic.2001: A Space Odyssey is a fantastic film where the visuals blow your mind more than the screenplay. What's so amazing about this film is how it was released in 1968 and still looks just as good as the movies that are released today. It's truly an amazing film that will stand time better than what's being released now.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

238,Hermit C-2,( A top 10 film) It can change your life.,10,22 April 1999,"What made ""2001..."" such a memorable moviegoing experience for this young person back in the late 60's was the realization that the filmmaker required you to THINK for YOURSELF, a rarity then, before or after. So many films lead you by the nose to an obvious conclusion, then congratulate you for doing it. Kubrick challenged his audience and showed confidence in them. Many people complain that the meaning is too obscure for them to understand, and I admit I wasn't all clear on it until I read Arthur C. Clarke's novel. Watching the movie it is easy to miss some crucial information. But the experience was still overwhelming to me anyway, even when I wasn't fully sure of what I'd seen. A viewer shouldn't feel thick-headed because everything is not revealed to him or her at once. The movie has plenty of rewards anyway.To those who have grown up in the post-""Star Wars"" era, the movie might seem especially slow and even dull. Indeed, when I saw it again around 1980 it seemed that way to me. But further perspective has once again placed it on its lofty pedestal. A young viewer today should try to keep in mind that in its time, it was showing off state-of-the art techniques.It's beyond my meager ability to give any comprehensive or definitive look at a phenomenon the magnitude of ""2001"". All I can say is it showed me that a work of art, in this case a movie, could truly be mind-expanding, and as such actually change one's life.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
239,ilpohirvonen,Symphony of Evolution,10,4 February 2011,"Today I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey for the second time and therefore decided to write a little essay-like review. There seems to be three kinds of people with regards to 2001; people who bash the film for being boring and slow-paced, people who praise it as a masterpiece and the greatest science-fiction ever made and people who are somewhere in between. It's a film about futurology, evolution and the cycle of life. It deals with the progression of man when he faces the unknown and creates new devices to research it. Kubrick had collected an enormous amount of knowledge of past and presence to create the perfect illusion of future.2001: A Space Odyssey is built on traditional conventions and dramaturgical structure. It's divided into three acts, as most films are, and it follows an usual pattern. But in the name of thematics Kubrick had abandoned the conventional plot. But the film is not an eternal riddle that can't be solved. The biggest reason why the film comes across with such criticism is because people see it on lists of 'the best science fictions' and so on. People don't know what they are about to see and after being brainwashed by mindless modern Hollywood; don't understand a thing. There still are much more trickier philosophical science-fictions out there, for instance, Andrei Tarkovsky's masterpieces Solaris and Stalker -- which I warmly recommend. Especially Solaris has been compared with 2001 dozens of times. If western science-fiction, which Kubrick here represents, researches the physical boundaries of man and mankind; eastern sci-fi researches mental limits -- Tarkovsky studies a situation where man should act humanely under inhumane circumstances.The first act starts with a prologue sequence where prehistoric men, apes, live and try to survive -- the dawn of man. There's a huge leap of time taken from the first part to the second; from four million years ago earlier to the year of 2001. But then the leap from act two to act three isn't so far at all - 18 months. This seems to reinforce the idea that Kubrick wasn't interested in time, ironically in a film about progression, but in state, 'mise-en-scene' and space -- and, for Kubrick, film is much more of a visual form of art than a narrative.One statement of the film is that man is still the same which is told to us through the three part structure. In the beginning -- the dawn of man -- an ape found a bone of another animal and learned to use it as a weapon. Then we go through this brilliant shift to the year of 2001 where man has created technical devices with his superior brain that at the same enslave him, and this cycle culminates to the rebirth. This three part structure is experienced again, in the end, when the man travels forward in time. He sees images of him going through the cycle of life; he gets older, dies and is born again. The rebirth, the final image of the fetus, is powerful and spellbinding. It makes the cycle of life perfect. The baby is its own world, its own reality and it is ready to learn, progress and research -- looking down on Earth and us.2001: A Space Odyssey consists of nothing but images of the spaceship, with the exception of the first sequence. The cold, white steel walls, the blue shades and chambers of the spaceship represent inhumanity of man. One particular scene is a good example of this, science and technology turning man into an inhumane creature, where the man gets a birthday video message from his parents. He doesn't care to reply, just asks the computer system HAL to lift up his seat, and when HAL wishes him a happy birthday he instantly replies ""thank you."" Techonology has become man's best friend and all humane relations have disappeared - another clue can be found from the laconic conversations between the spacemen.It's also a film of contrasts; cold steel and the warm ground of the prologue, the humming sounds of the spaceship and the distressing silence of outer space, the blue shades and the blue color which is all around the ship; the only dose of red, love and warmth, seems to be coming from the computer system HAL. In the surrealist sequence also the complementary colors of blue and red meet each other; the mountains and the gorges. In the spaceship the crew eats food through a pipe but, in the end, in the Rococo room the man eats a normal meal -- on a plate. Man has went back to the old times: Rococo furniture, paintings and the food. But is still the same.The monolith has occurred a great deal of discussion and will do so in the future as well. It's clearly the motive of the film and collects symbolic meaning to itself as time goes by. First in the dawn of man it is an unknown object which the apes research with great fascination. In 2001 it once again appears just as unknown to the man as it did to their prehistoric grandfathers. They research it and discover that it is a new, and the first, artifact to be found by man from outer space. Towards the end, where the film starts turning into surrealism, the monolith floats in space -- far away from the hands of man. For once more it appears in the Rococo room where the man sees images of his life. It's in front of the man's bed as he tries to reach it, but can't. The monolith; the unknown is so far away and unreachable.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
240,Eternality,A meditative journey into the nature of our existence,10,11 July 2010,"Hands down, and without a shadow of a doubt, 2001: A Space Odyssey is the greatest science-fiction picture ever made. Even if something similar is attempted today, it will inevitably still be streets behind Stanley Kubrick's influential masterpiece. After making a name for himself with classic films such as Paths of Glory (1957), Lolita (1962) and Dr. Strangelove (1964), Kubrick bolstered and cemented his reputation as one of the greatest filmmakers ever to grace our planet with the release of 2001, at a time when space exploration looked real and promising.2001 is a meditative journey into the nature of our existence. Kubrick explores many themes, most notably that of existentialism, man versus machine, and the cycle of life. At the beginning of the film, the director brings us back into the prehistoric age when humans looked like apes. The quest for survival slowly turns violent, from getting food and avoiding predators to forming ""clans"" to fight against each other for territorial rights.This is greatly juxtaposed with colonized space, which forms the bulk of 2001's remaining two hours. In one of the most stunning jump cuts ever, we see an ape-human throw a bone up into the bright sky and as gravity pulls it down in one swift motion, it suddenly becomes an image of a satellite (shaped like that bone) floating in dark, infinite (and gravity-less) space. In that mind-blowing split moment, Kubrick hurtles us thousands of years into the future.Colonizing space ironically leads to even deeper isolation. And this is felt by two crewmen onboard a manned flight to Jupiter. Actually, the phrase ""manned flight"" is misleading because the huge spacecraft they are in is completely controlled by a powerful and error-proof intelligent computer called HAL. Now, Kubrick plays on the man versus machine theme with devastating consequences for both sides. Reliance on technology could be a boon or a bane, and till this day, there isn't a film every year that does not ignite the hot debate over this.A final major theme of 2001 is the concept of the ever-continuing life cycle of human existence. The final sequence in which an astronaut finds himself inside a coldly detached room somewhere in space and sees the physical image of himself – a frail, old man having a meal, and then dying on a bed – not only provokes thought about the transient nature of life, but also asks of the question: Is there more to life after death?Kubrick seems to argue in the positive by presenting to us the blissful image of a star child overlooking the universe. Does it symbolize reincarnation, the continuation of the cycle of life? Or being one with the Creator? Or immortality? Up until then, and much so to his credit, Kubrick has not explicitly brought in ideas about religion, though one can argue that ""the monolith"", a rectangular grey block made of an unknown inert material that appears in four key moments in the film, is simultaneously a symbol of mystery, and the ultimate black box containing all the answers to our existence. In other words, ""the monolith"" could be God.2001 features Kubrick's unique melding of imagery and motion to the sound of classical music. Man-made space objects rotate and float across the length of the screen, as slow as the director would allow them to move so as to imitate the reality of motion in space. Working together with the famous Arthur C. Clarke (who co-wrote the screenplay), Kubrick brings astounding realism to his craftwork, building models of space objects to their finest details, and winning his only competitive Oscar in his career for Best Special Visual Effects.Kubrick's strong eye for visual symmetry (where props are placed and spaced equally) is also apparent and this would later go on to be a hallmark of his visual style in films like A Clockwork Orange (1971), and The Shining (1980), influencing a new generation of filmmakers including Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, 2007) and Duncan Jones (Moon, 2009).Perhaps the only drawback of 2001 is its very slow pace, which may frustrate on the first viewing (I felt the same way too). However, its snail-like pace will suit subsequent viewings better, especially when appreciation for Kubrick's craftsmanship, direction, and filmic vision mature with time. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a towering achievement, a science-fiction masterpiece that will never be equaled. It just might be Kubrick's greatest contribution to cinema.SCORE: 10/10 www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com All rights reserved!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

242,jose-cruz53,One of the 40 best films ever made,10,12 October 2012,"The United States has produced about 40,000 full length feature films released to the market. This one belongs to the top 0.1% in terms of quality. It is certainly one of the best films ever made, if one is able to experience it adequately.It competes with The Empire Strikes Back to the throne of science fiction, though they are two very different films. This one is simpler in terms of plot, but more complex in artistic terms. This film is perhaps the most ambitious ever made (though the Tree of Life is also very ambitious, the difference is that this film manages to attain its objectives, while the Tree of Life fails to engage the watcher adequately).What's this film purpose? It is to show mankind's evolution from apes to a new type of being. Also, the film shows that mankind's intelligence appears to have been created by another species and that mankind has itself developed a new intelligent species: Hal 9000. So its a film about intelligence creating intelligence.Another good touch is the extensive use of 18th century classical music and 18th century architecture at the ""alien hotel"" in the end of the film, since the 18th century was the beginning of mankind's exponential economic and technological development that is (apparently) poised to lead it to the stars.(spoilers alert)Some commentary on the story of the film:Also, the only well developed character of the film is not a human, it's Hal 9000, and he/she/it is a very interesting character, fearing the mission's strange characteristics, Hal invents a malfunction with the ship in order to psychologically signalize his/hers/its stress to the rest of the crew, however the rest of the crew fails to understand poor Hal and instead they decide to kill him, Hal reacts in the same way people would: he decides to save his/her/its life by killing the rest of the crew.{end spoilers alert)Overall, one of the best films ever: 10/10, though not as good as some films I know.

1. The opening sequence featuring the monkey's, is not only engrossing, but it brilliantly shows how man came to rule using tools, thus setting up a constant theme during the film: evolution and its consequences.
2. The score is both tantalising and iconic. Even when the score chops to induce an ominous atmosphere, it's still hauntingly beautiful.
3. The space set design is incredible. It's not only stunning, but intricately designed.
4. Douglas Rain (HAL 9000) gives a fantastically bone-chilling voice-acting performance, and Keir Dullea (Dr. Dave Bowman) delivers a brilliant performance.
5. The sound design is great and it really heightens the drama, especially when the movie cuts-back to complete silence.
6. The directing and camera-work is stunning. It was clearly precisely planned out.
7. The tension and suspense is built up amazingly via the score, sound design, the long and penetrating close-ups, as well as the acting.
8. The entire ending sequence of Dr. Dave Bowman travelling space and time is utterly enrapturing and well-shot.Cons:
1. The monkey costumes are not fake enough to be distracting, but they are fake enough to notice.
2. The movie's pacing starts to drag at certain points as it slows down.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Had I written this then, I would gave give this an 8. It's slow pace and little dialogue had appeal, but not enough for me to love it.I am 20 years old now, and after seeing reviews and researching it, I decided to see it again. (Look up Chris Stuckmann's review on You Tube for an example.)At a used DVD store, I got it on New Year's Eve, and than I saw it the next day. I now have a new proposal for this movie: This is the greatest film experience ever produced!The movie does not really have a ""plot"" per se, but it's rather a compilation of sequences of special effects that thread into a story about humanity, and how technology affects it over time.This creates many impressive scenes, one in which a monkey discovers how to use a bone as a tool, but then uses it as a weapon-first against other bones, and then an armadillo. Another with laser lights near the end, as well as the star child in the film's finale.I referenced Chris Stuckmann's review. In it, he mentions that the movie hypnotizes the viewer. This is absolutely true! Many scenes, like laser lights segment, put me in awe and filled me with wonder.There is very little dialogue, like I said. However, more is said with the images than whatever could be said with words. We see man evolve(I disagree with evolution but it fits with the narrative), advance in technology, the technology overcome man, and man overpower it, among many other elements.My Grandma saw a couple minutes of the movie with me, exactly 2 hours in. There was no dialogue, but a rainbow of colors flashed on the screen. She walked away to go in her room and said ""I think you wasted your money."" She said that about the American Film Institute's pick for the 22nd best movie ever made!Keep in mind that 2001 is not a movie you watch, but rather experience-and what an experience it its!Forget about 10 out of 10 stars, I give this an unlimited amount of stars.

248,jgcorrea,A MILESTONE IN FILM HISTORY,10,22 August 2018,"As far as meaning, significance and cultural instigation are concerned, 2001 features innumerable referential approaches: to mankind, to God (and/or to the Demon), to the future, to our responsibility as of 1968 as we faced new realities; to the rediscovery of language; to the brand-new systems of knowledge; to the man-vs. -machine struggle. Stanley Kubrick directed this iconic film, in which mankind finds a mysterious, obviously artificial object buried beneath the Lunar surface and, with the help of an intelligent computer HAL 9000, sets off on a quest. Hal is error-proof - his ontology is infallibility. (And Nota bene the homophone pun: Hal is pronounced as hell. Beforehand, during the Paleolithic period, primates faced the mechanics of their primitive, primary life, and their capital objective = simple resistance, at a biological level. Those mankind precursors were not yet fully superior to other animals because they did not have the capacity for symbolic communication; they only communicated through signals. They mastered no connotative capacity at all, only some kinda denotative capacity. Their booming intellect was still impotent for making abstractions. Then an immense, polished, geometric, rectangular monolith, - the revelation of the newly coming Neolithic revolutionized universe (the Polished stone Era) - and subsequently the discovery of the media and the instruments - extensions of our physical members. The unknown monolith is almost an apparition of God. Also the germ of thought. The ape-man assaults the skeleton of a dead animal, picks up a bone (which had previously been used as a weapon to win the battle for a water pool ), begins to brand it euphorically, while disrupting the skeleton, throwing it up in the air and - incidentally the greatest anecdotal ellipse in the history of cinema: - and the bone fuses into a 2001 spaceship, sliding through the imponderable silence of the cosmos, to the sound of Johann Strauss' Blue Danube. The phenomenon is then repeated: the monolith is found on the moon, and the astronauts who approach it exhibit a similar behavior to that of the primates, when they touch it. An expedition to Jupiter, with three crew members in hibernation, only to be restored to their vital faculties when they arrived at the destination, the other two alive, and the electronic computer (Hal), leading the ship. Kubrick & Arthur C Clarke conceived the behavior of the Cyclops-eye machinery by, say, matching Homer's Odyssey. Something like Hal may indeed become reality and be capable of own emotions and mental initiatives. There resides the impasse for mankind, with its philosophical implications.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
249,revival05,One of Kubrick's best movies ever.,10,5 June 2000,"I have a cousin who saw this movie once. His reaction was... awful! He thought it was the worst movie he'd ever seen in his life. I wasn't surprised a bit, since I knew I understood it, and I knew that it was movie making at it's purest form.                               Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director and this movie is one of the main reasons. Because, let's face it, there isn't a film that's quite like 2001. Not in the sci-fi genre or anywhere else.                               When I sit down to watch this movie, I never try to understand it or take it that serious. I just let it pass. I'll just let it go on, and I see the movie just because the pleasure of it. The pleasure of seeing something that beats everyone else, when it comes to being original.
                              This is a milestone in moviemaking and I have forever respect for Kubrick, for bringing this movie in my life. Let 2001 forever let us know how empty the space really is.                              9/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
250,mcjensen-05924,Another Kubrick Disaster,1,1 September 2021,"Quite simply stated, with a few exceptions, Kubrick doesn't know how to make an interesting or even somewhat coherent movie. The movies he's most famous for, this one included, are immensely dull and meandering messes. There's no transition from scene to scene it just jumps randomly here and there. After the first hour there's several things you will be sick of, likely forever. The sound of monkeys screeching and classical music. The opening sequence goes on forever and serves no real purpose. I eventually muted the volume. When actual people finally show up on screen, they can't act! Looking back there's always at least one person in his movies that displays a shocking lack of talent. Usually in a rather large if not leading role. The dialogue is absurd nonsense, circular and redundant. How was your flight? Good. Oh, that's good. Be good for your mommy. What do you think? I dunno what do you think? Riveting stuff. Yawn.....There's another drawn out scene with two guys eating, which is pretty disgusting but not nearly as gross as the scene in Clockwork Orange. It's nothing but extremely uninteresting people in space who occasionally talk to their extremely uninteresting family members back home. Outer space serves as the setting for what could be the most senseless and confusing piece of pretentious cinematic trash ever created. Why do Kubrick movies end up with over 8 star ratings? It's baffling. He's either butchering someone else's novel or completely misrepresenting some historic event. And just because his approach is original doesn't make it effective or even entertaining. Midway through this movie I found myself not even caring what happened. I just wanted to make sure the remote was close in case another eternal bout of the same music came on again. And let's not forget the scene with the heavy breathing that was more like an obscene phone call than a believable space walk. Repetitiveness is irritating, and any film maker worth his salt should know this. Anyway, the conclusion is just as disappointing as the beginning and the middle. And it never came soon enough!! It's just silly and resolves nothing because we never knew there was anything to be resolved. None of the characters had any personality or history to speak of, who how could we care if they randomly burst into flames or started playing the tuba. Either one of those would be preferrable to seeing them eat another meal. If you want Kubrick that won't annoy too much, try Lolita or Dr. Strangelove. If you were just looking for a good movie set in space, well.....there's not many out there. Alien & Blade Runner are the only ones that come to mind.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
251,The_Core,One of the true greats,10,17 August 2003,"I'm not sure there's much left to be said about ""2001, A Space Odyssey"" 35 years after its release -- yet in another sense, nothing meaningful has yet been said about it.  This is easily the greatest, grandest and most poetic piece of science fiction ever put to celluloid.  A work of art in every sense of the term, it has so much to say about where mankind has been and where it is going.This is one film that simply defies being picked apart and analyzed.  If you haven't seen it yet, please do so on a ""slow Sunday"" when you're relaxed and ready to view an epic sort of film (something on the order of ""10 Commandments"").  Then just settle in and view one genius filmmaker's conception of the scientific and the spiritual, and where they ultimately meet in the great story that is Mankind.An easy 10/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Clarke's science fiction novel is a cinematic spectacle.Kubrick's creation of an atmospheric and mind-blowing film is something to be celebrated. '2001' is simple and purely cinematic craft; distinct imagination and beautiful artistry along with groundbreaking visual effects make this film one of a kind.The direction as always is faultless; Kubrick's pursuit for perfectionism shines through his camera work that dazzles the viewer with beautiful images.The music is terrific; the noticeable use of classical music which evokes different moods, whether awe, disillusionment, fear or panic. The music is frequently used as a narrative, a tool not used in the film industry very often; Kubrick limits the dialogue but maximises the importance of the sounds you hear.2001 moves at a steady pace and makes us ask eternal questions. While, 2001, as a film critic put it 'fails on the human level', it does communicate through the medium of images, sounds, music, colour and yes Kubrick's perfectionist camera work.This is a vivacious, exciting, confusing, multilateral film; it has everything. You could argue that it is a boring, dull sci-fi movie, but for me it was a visual and sceptical treat. I wasn't sure at times what exactly was happening, but I didn't care. I never witnessed such creativity and mad risky film-making along the sci-fi line. This film is an iconic masterpiece.Instantenously I place this film among my top 10 and I truly believe it is one of the best films ever to be made and probably Kubrick's finest achievement (in many respects definitely). Hypnotic, alluring, indefinably masterful, this is a milestone in cinema. An astonishing achievement.10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
253,higherall7,"A Tale of Natural, Technological and Spiritual Reinvention...",10,11 July 2016,"I saw this film with my sister in Cinerama way back in 1968. I'll never forget the completely lost look on her face as she turned to me and asked innocently, ""What's going' on?"" I chuckled and said nothing.Many people have to know before they can go, but I must say I have never had a problem with this. That is not to say that there are not a vast number of things beyond the ken of my understanding, but I have always felt that if you just keep on truckin' you will arrive at the Truth sooner or later.This is a stellar film (no pun intended) and once again rivals CITIZEN KANE for its sheer inventiveness. The inventiveness here, however, is not based on spending Saturday afternoons with the cinematographer learning novel ways to set up and use the camera to frame shots; as was the case with Welles and Toland, but is based on staggering and exhaustive research within and without the Space Program and various communities of High Technology.This is actually quite a simple film to understand, as it is designed to evoke mystery, to generate questions rather than answers, to launch the viewer on his or her own personal odyssey and voyage of discovery.That's really about it. This film is about as close to pure cinema as you are likely to get; with the possible exception of THE GOLD RUSH by Charlie Chaplin or Russian ARK by Alexander Sokurov, and yes, I could share all of my associations about the film with you, but what would be the point when that's the whole point? That is, your take on this movie is as good as mine and a great jumping off point into the realms of higher dimensions where together we can learn a great many new things.I will say this. I must have seen this movie over thirty times before I finally fully comprehended the gist of what Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were attempting to express, while after reading the second of Clarke's Odyssey novels I attained full understanding in mere seconds.Once again, this is really a simple film. I agree with Kubrick that it is meant to be a nonverbal experience aimed at arousing emotions and moods of awe and sublimity and at this succeeds enormously. I also agree with Roger Ebert that this is a fable for Mankind albeit from a Western perspective or standpoint. Unlike many movies, it defies surrendering to a surface interpretation and challenges you from the outset not necessarily to agree with its open-ended conclusions but rather to explore and understand it from the inside out as Frank Lloyd Wright used to exhort us to do.This film is also the gentlest introduction into the world of abstraction that I know pertaining to the cinema. I must admit it is one of the reasons I stumbled into the Fine Arts wanting to understand how the aesthetics of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was able to affect me so profoundly. Here, the Magician works his magic and leaves it to you to ferret out his secrets.I would like to conclude by saying that you might be interested in AN IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY by Roger Ager 2008 as more food for thought. Also, at the risk of uttering ironic heresy, I have to remark that I have been surprised here and there by how well atheists like Isaac Asimov understand the Concept of God.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
254,AndreiPavlov,2001 is history already,5,24 August 2007,"This movie is 50/50 to my liking. If I skip certain pieces, it will be great (I am not speaking about the running time of the film - no problem with lasting movies). If I watch it all, it is far from being one of the top movies ever. To put it simple: there are good and bad things in this sci-fi.Good things. Slow pace with clear images of space, spaceships, and fine interiors. A powerful machine-vs.-man duel. A bizarre ending, visually very well executed.Bad things. Apes' war at the beginning. The apes are quite to the point in ""Planet of the Apes"" but here it looks like a BBC wildlife production. Besides, the whole evolution representation is like a boring school film on history of mankind. A purely scientific approach to Man. The characters here look like empty shells. Where are souls? It is almost impossible to feel any compassion to these ""scientific shadows of man"". I don't give a damn if all the human characters die in the end. A kind of background Soviet/American rat race, which had been gone quite a time before the real 2001 (""Aeroflot"" logos look out of place here). Triumphant music, that adds some cheap exclamation mark to the production. I have to jump from my seat to get the volume down - what the hell is that? I am not sleeping. To make an impression on the viewer it is not a must for an artist to yell his head off.Of course, in this one, Mr Stanley Kubrick does not fall as flat as in ""A Clockwork Orange"" (which is, whatever praise, disgusting), but still, I had expected much more from a top 250 representative before viewing. After watching these two movies, I put off ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Lolita"" for good, while I suppose, they are also of this ""good hits and awkward misses"" nature. Perhaps, ""A.I."" would have been a solid one from head to foot, but it is only ""dedicated to..."". A fine for ""awkward misses"" maybe.Our ""Solyaris"" is the indisputable winner in this competition and that's marvellous.5 out of 10. Thank you for attention.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
255,illbebackreviews,"This film made me cry, made me sick and gave me insomnia",6,30 December 2012,"Seriously, who was this film honestly made for? I know for one thing, even 90 year old people would fall asleep watching this film. The only reason behind giving this film 2 stars is because of the brilliant music and the amazing visual effects. Everything else about this film is just plain horrible.The film starts off like never before with 3 minutes of black screen. Instantly, we are bored. That's never a good sign. Next, we see pictures of sunset for 2 minutes. Seriously, why show this??? Then we have another 10-12 minute sequence with apes that only needed to be 2 or 3 minutes long where they discover the Monolith and start fighting each other like retards. We even see evolution occurring but all this could've been reduced to 2 or 3 minutes like I said. The boredom doesn't stop here. In fact, I call that the most entertaining part of this film. I'm sorry! Then we see a ship orbiting around space for minutes. It gets so tiring and boring that you wanna wish you were either dead. Then, we see a guy falling asleep. Poor actor probably fell asleep watching the first 20 minutes of the film. The film takes 26 minutes for a bit of awfully boring dialogue to happen. In 26 minutes, all that happened was some ape s discovered the Mononlith. Did that have to be 26 minutes long???? The biggest problem with the film is the atrocious pacing and the absolute lack of any entertainment. I'm not asking for epic battles or explosions. I'm just asking for things to speed up. And don't anybody say ""Watch the film in the dark with full sound"" I DID THAT AND IT DID NOT WORK! The second story of the film was awfully boring it nearly put me to sleep. In that, all that happens was 6 astronauts discover the Monolith. That's 55 minutes into the film. AARGH! Remember the film '12 Angry Men' which is only situated in a jury room. By now, we love the characters and are fully immersed into the story. Here, nothing happens. In one scene, we see a waitress even walk so slowly. What was Kubrick thinking??? 12 years from now, he goes on to make the Shining which is one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time. When a film is terribly slow in pacing, so is the tone to the movie. Don't anybody say ""Its supposed to be an experience, not an entertainment"" because that is just the dumbest thing I've heard. It was a heck of a boring experience, even to people who have insomnia. Remember Back to the Future, its a Sci-Fi/adventure. That film is fast paced and is extremely entertaining and a great experience. What makes this an exception for not being entertaining???The 2 1/2 hour dull film could've easily been cut down into 1 hour. You'd think that when Kubrick makes a film almost twice as long as it needs to be, that he'd at least develop the characters. NOOOOOO! He did not at all. The characters are as dull as a brick wall. In fact, I'd rather stare at a brick wall for 2 1/2 hours than watch this film. There's nothing wrong with a quiet film if its paced well, but this just isn't. Awful story, terrible characters and boring dialogue along with elongated scenes which serve hardly any purpose to the movie makes this one of the worst experiences of all time. Its a pity because I really wanted to love this film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
256,basrutten,The movie equivalent of an empty canvas,4,20 February 2004,"While I'm generally a fan of Kubrick's movies (""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" are masterpieces), I think this one of the most overrated movies ever. The basic problem to me is that ""Space Odyssey"" isn't really a movie but more a series of moving images with some music. Granted, the images are very beautiful, the effects are spectacular for the time, and the excellent music fits the visuals very well. But no amount of audiovisual flair is enough to save over 2 hours of movie if there's just nothing else going on. And to me, that's the case here. There's virtually no plot, no character development, or anything else to really keep you interested. Sure, there are some hints at a deeper meaning, but they are so vague and ambiguous that they can be pretty much explained however the viewer wants. I'm not saying that there might not be some amazing message in there, but so far I've yet to find somebody who can come up with a really convincing explanation. Most of the time, people I talk to who like this movie completely fail to explain why they like it or what's it about. Should it be about something? To me, yes. To me, movies should either entertain, tell a good story, or have a good message. This movie seems to do neither. It's too slow to entertain, it certainly doesn't have much of a story, and it also doesn't appear to have much of a message either. Still, I can understand that people like it just for its visuals, but then again I suspect that there are also many people that claim to like it because they don't want to appear stupid. In the end, I'd say this is the movie equivalent of an empty piece of canvas that is turned into a piece of art called ""the vast emptiness"". It's a clever trick, but it's ultimately rather pointless, and many people only see a meaning behind it because they want to see it, not because it's necessarily actually there.** out of ***** (because of the amazing visuals and sound)",2001 - A Space Odyssey
257,MovieGuy109,2001 is Kubrick's exciting adventure into space.,10,22 July 2011,"2001: A Space Odyssey-****-A Masterpiece- Directed by: Stanley Kubrick, Written by: Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke (Novel and Screenplay), Starring: Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, William Sylvester, voice of Douglas Rain.Stanley Kubrick's most provocative masterpiece follows the adventure into the unknown depths of space to investigate strange objects found on the surface of The Moon that are related to the very origins of mankind itself.Kubrick starts this masterpiece at the dawn of man showing us the origins of men at the hands of a monolith. The monoliths are large black objects in the physical interpretation of the film. The monoliths are up to interpretation however, some have interpreted them as alien objects while others have come up with the figurative representation of human evolution.Afterwards, he takes a leap into his pre-conceived future of 2001 that still remains relevant in today's society. Then, the odyssey begins when a monolith is found on The Moon, the odyssey takes off. This leads an astronaut straight into immortality and alien worlds.Dullea's character evolves in the film's final sequence into the star child. This ending along with the rest of the film has been interpreted both physically and figuratively. This movie is a masterpiece simply because of all the physical effects, figurative symbolism, and perhaps metaphysical explanations. It continues to be debated over whether or not it is a work of a a man of God or a man of science. That is part of the deliberate process is the contemplation of the less straightforward materials of the film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
258,asifahsankhan,From Evolution to Exploration to Artificial Intelligence to Extraterrestrial Life to other Dimensions of Reincarnation. . .,10,14 June 2017,". . . this is NO such film that shies away from Allegorical Philosophies.The year was 1968.America was in the midst of The Space Race with the Russians. Man had yet to set foot on the moon, but the Apollo program was in full swing. The world was only a year away from taking One small step for man.There was probably never more attention and fervour surrounding space exploration than during that specific period in time. And that year, Stanley Kubrick released 2001: A Space Odyssey.One of the most ambitious films of all time.2001: A Space Odyssey begins with The Dawn of Man.In a fifteen minute segment to lead the movie, Kubrick shows a tribe of apes before and after they're visited by an obsidian obelisk.Prior to seeing the obelisk, the apes are shown living amongst the pigs, picking fleas, attacked by a leopard, and having a territorial shouting match with another pack of apes over their water hole.They're animals.The film famously features extensive dialogue free segments with filled with classical music. In fact, whenever music is used, there is no dialogue, and anytime there's dialogue, there is no music. As opposed to most films, which feature original scores, 2001 features famous classical pieces, legendarily opening with Richard Strauss Thus Spoke Zarathustra, and here as were brought into space, Johann Strauss IIs waltz, On the Beautiful Blue Danube.Were taken to an orbiting space station, and follow a man on-board. He briefly contacts his daughter via videophone, and then sits briefly with some contemporaries. In stark contrast to the flea picking, bone wielding apes, these people are cordial and civilised. Polite. Sophisticated. A group of international doctors sharing a drink in a lounge area on a space station.The talk turns serious. The lunar substation Clavius has fallen out of contact. Those attempting to reach it are receiving error messages, and it recently denied a request for docking. There's suspicion of an epidemic outbreak.Having the computer in control of every aspect of the mission turn on you is a dangerous proposition. A fact that the passengers on-board learn the hard way. Yet the most frightening moments of HALs arc don't lie in the cold, calculated actions HAL takes against the humans on Discovery One, but in the plaintive begging he makes for his life when hes facing shutdown.Im afraid, and I can feel it HAL keeps repeating over and over. Very human emotions. Was HAL indeed alive?But 2001 isn't a movie about a conflict with an on-board computer. Nor does it end when HAL is taken offline. Instead it continues when Dave, the final crew member alive on Discovery One, encounters the obelisk.What proceeds is famously open for interpretation. An extensive barrage of flashing lights and visual effects comprise a sequence signifying time travel? Inter-dimensional travel? Evolution to a non-corporal being? Death? Kubrick refused to state explicitly. No dialogue accompanies this final segment of the movie. It unfolds like a work of art in motion.It culminates in the sudden arrival of the pod in an all white room, decorated with pieces of fine art, containing a bed and a dinner table. There, Dave sees himself. Aging, dying, evolving.Thus Spoke Zarathustra sounds again as an embryonic being of pure light looks out over the surface of the Earth from outer space.This is a movie that challenges its audience. It has incredible aspirations. It paints across an enormous canvas, poses the deepest of questions, and then gives no easy answers. It shows, it does not tell. It makes the viewer think and feel, without telling them what to think and feel. This movie is the antithesis of modern movies that cater to the lowest common denominator. It is unafraid of pushing the boundaries of the medium, and breaking away from convention. Even with effects works over 40 years old, the movie still has the power to astound the viewer with its beauty.Imaginative. Impressionistic. Evocative. Thought Provoking. Astonishing. Epic.As Kubrick said he didn't want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's missed the point, just add ""quotation mark"" on that 2001 and you'll get the point.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
259,theinaniloquent,"""An epic drama of adventure and exploration""",10,12 May 2012,"I've finally watched the so-called masterpiece known as '2001: A Space Odyssey.' My expectations were at the highest beforehand. This was, if you did not know, made by the king Stanley Kubrick. His movies are visualized so perfectly, atmospherically-made haunting, and just all around brilliant. And this is just from seeing The Shining and The Clockwork Orange. So I took advise and watched it at night, on my 60' TV screen. My mind was empty, ready to be fed brilliance.. Not only did the film feed my expectations, it fed my brain. As weird as that sounds, 2001 did much more than it was meant to...AMAZING. My mind was shattered. Throughout the film, my heart was beating rhythmically to the silence. This film is slow, know this, but it's slow-pace is only to be of annoyance to Michael Bay worshipers. The film's slow-pace is very slow, but to a point where the suspense obscures what could be boring. And the film, in a technical point, was just awe-inspiring. This is a 1968 film. The special effects were stunning to see, and this is from a 90's kid. I've seen late 70's films that have worse special effects than this right here. That's quite the achievement, Kubrick.. Everything from set-design to acting was well- done, but the real film is underlying in it's story.. During the duration, I was confused. The film just made no sense. But that's the point. There has been theories, cult-ish nonsense about the whole 'point' of this film, but no one will understand their confusion. The movie was meant to make you believe it was nonsense, but the truth is never to be told. My confusion made me enjoy the experience more than anything. The film questions humanity itself, even questioning the meaning of existence, of life, all wrapped up in a brilliant sci-fi epic. It seemed like it had no point at first glance, but it's all inside the package. But the film is a experience, that everybody should experience once in their lives. I hate saying ""I just saw 2001!"" because that sentence, in my mind, wouldn't of made sense. It would sound illiterate. So, I am joyed to say, I have experienced 2001...But all this brilliance is going to be claimed stupid. Mainstream viewers have already knocked off this film, stating it's prolonged scenes were pointless, the film having no point to it. But, truth is, this film right here as inspired sci-fi films of today. Even if you didn't enjoy it, you have to appreciate what it has done. It has created a universe worth seeing. It has created and planted the idea for Michael Bay to direct Transformers. All these sci-fi films nowadays, are inspired by the greatest sci-fi epic of all-time: 2001: A Space Odyssey. 10/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It's hands down the most cinematically gorgeous movie ever conceived, and still has one of the most puzzling yet fascinating storylines. Kubrick's masterpiece shall never die!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
261,pkzeewiz,Wow what an interesting film,6,17 April 2010,"First time I watched this movie as a kid I expected a film like Star Wars, but I was disappointed. I later found,like myself many people thought the music was great and the scenes were beautiful, but the movie had no point. I just watched it again for the second time and was amazed, my opinion has changed and I think this film is wonderful.It's one of those movies that is like a song with metaphors and nothing hinting at the truth and everything hinting at the speculation as to what it is about. Art and music, and in cases such as this film, it's for the viewer to walk away with what he needs to take from it.. you are not told how to feel, or told an explanation as to what you see, you just watch and feel whatever, and most people will have different views. The writer and/or director were inspired by things and had their own visions as to what they were trying to show you and what they were trying to say, yet they made sure not to be blunt or factual about these truths and reasoning.This film starts with several minutes of silence and a black screen which to me symbolizes nothing..nothing is what we all came from, not a god but some unknown particles bonding to form something that became something else... The film does not show these evolutionary happenings, yet it goes into the dawn of man. The apes that we derived from - scared beings who must learn and grow. They must defend themselves from other creatures just like them, but different..enemies...competitors. I must say the monolith was what made the film first get truly interesting..I see that as symbolic of the things that we know nothing about, yet the thing we worship, desire and crave. The apes are intrigued and eventually like all things, the monolith becomes apparent and a steak in reality. The beasts..us.. eventually learn to kill and life gets better, life gets worse, life gets going. Man's true nature is to kill, protect and survive.The movie goes straight from the dawn of man to space. To me this symbolizes many things, one we all know what happened so why retell it, also the past straight into the future says that once man learned to kill and hate and survive thats all we have basically done for centuries...Love and hate, life and death, faith and free will all go hand in hand and space is our way of trying to search for life in other places, perhaps to learn, but definitely to conquer, it is mans way of needing more, needing answers. Space is the one thing untouched by man and it was indeed ""a final frontier"" waiting to be discovered.We see inside a space craft and the civilized world it seemed to have. The truths of how it would be, the call for your ""Christian"" name, the lobbies with Howard Johnsons promotions and big business getting its greedy paws in a space-station if there were ones...very subtle truths.The spaceship is ran by a super-computer called the HAL-900 which for a movie in 1968 foretold a greater truth that the world relies too much on machines, they place their life in this computer. It's a great factor and a major plot to this film.They find another monolith on the moon, it's the unknown. It's basic squealing which deafens those who arrive at its presence is an obvious way of it telling people to leave it alone, yet they go to Jupiter to see a larger version of it. This is when Hal sees problems with the bigger picture and the mutiny planned to disable him and he seeks revenge.David Bowman disconnects HAL and heads on alone through the an atmosphere of vivid colors, we see him as an old man, looking at himself as an older man. Perhaps trying to say ""what is the point in life"". Seeing yourself about to die, seeing yourself dying, see yourself older than you are and the emptiness you have when being alone. You live life knowing it will come to an end.The monolith symbolizes the things we search for our entire life, until our last breath we will question so many things, god, meaning of life, where our soul goes. The monolith represents that which we can never find.The movie ends with a baby, the forming of a baby and it looks like David Bowman. The true end, is perhaps the new beginning, Maybe our soul takes form in where we go and we start over somewhere else as a baby. Maybe we are reincarnated and take over life here as what will become someone else. Or perhaps neither, perhaps the new baby was symbolic of something completely different, someone completely new.. Either way it says that whatever we ponder, what ever mysteries we have we leave them in the end for someone else to start over and do it all again.This movie was beautiful, direction was great and these shots were breathtaking. The music was perfection and has became iconic, the actors did well and this movie is something great to watch and to think about. It is an obvious inspiration to hundreds of movies to follow from Star Wars to Alien and beyond. The technology was was beyond its time and set standards for thousands of films to come along.It is an art film, it is science fiction/drama. It has many long boring parts, but it's a must see film.. I can say if you are not a true lover of movies and one to respect and admire many aspects of film making then this may not be for you. I give it 6 out of 10 stars...truly delightful...I could talk about this movie for days. Its a perfect movie to watch and discuss with people.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
262,harrylosborne,Brilliant...until you reach the ending,7,8 April 2019,"My first experience of Stanley Kubrick was 2001: A Space Odyssey, a revolutionary, extraordinary and enlightening journey through the existence of humanity and its exploration of space. The first 2 hours are pure enjoyment as the course of human history is charted (accompanied by one of the most famous film scores of all time) up to the present day, all whilst pondering the existence of an artefact found on Earth.The space travel, however, is where this film truly shines: for the late 60s, every visual must have been pioneering, depicting space, future life and artificial intelligence beautifully. HAL 9000 is the looming presence here, an entity of which its level or control cannot be fully comprehended, seeing as the other characters rely on him so heavily. HAL's interactions with the crew is unbelievably sinister, as the lack of tone allows nothing to be given away emotionally, even if you sense something is afoot. As the film progresses further, these visuals continue to astound, with meticulous set design and amazing use of slow, quiet scenes to build tension and emotion. Everything you have seen then builds towards the final eventuality - disappointment.Kubrick almost shot himself in the foot by attempting such an ambitious storyline, as some viewers would ultimately never find the ending satisfactory. However, personally the ending just doesn't achieve anything; none of the story is fully explored nor understandable, and it feels like a jumbled mess of conclusions rushed to (with some arresting visuals to boot). I would recommend 2001: A Space Odyssey purely on the first 2/3 of the film - just don't expect the all-encompassing ending you're hoping for.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
263,Chaves7777,"Strange, beautiful and excellently made for an open and patient mind",10,23 December 2007,"Undoubtelly, one of the best photographed movies of all time is Kubrick's masterpiece ""2001: A Space Oddisey"", but is maybe one of that masterpieces that much can see over and over again, and others not even finished in spite that know how much people and critic loves this movie.This Kubrick's movie is a beautiful show of a past and present human been for then going to our undeniable future, like a cycle, although that it could be a lot of other possibilities for it ending. Is a good and respectable opinion, no matter if was based or not in the book ideas. The film deals with the dawn of men, the apes, thing that reminds so much the Darwin theory i guess. The follow up to a world that not even today could imagine before seeing it. And its meaningful ending. But these three things are connected for an instrument, an element, that maybe could explain the continuity of the race, of future.I understand how people could be amazed in those times. Kubrick's manage of widescreen is very important, and here is not a joke! Just like in movies like Dario Argento's ""Suspiria"", that could be an excellent example. You cant feel the exactly masterful feeling if your eyes don't note all the whole thing, and here in ""2001"" this happen, as one of these masterful (Sorry the word repetition) achievements. The shots of space are more than wonderful, are breathtaking! The music is more than appropriate, is perfect. But is of course slowly, and this is one of its achievement, but is a thing too that undoubtedly some people can take as the boring thing. The film is very slowly and full of silence, just like space is. But of course, although that this film never going to be dated (i think none film is) but people of today for example now is accustomed for other things, with more action and quickly artificial effects, and this movie is not like those. This one have such spectacular special effects, so perfect that you don't see any artificiality, you believe it. The use of colors, as its music, are more than masterful, are used for be hypnotic, just what this film deserve.In other situation, through the story of course appears too a topic that was handled perfectly just before in Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"", the technological domination, in this case our beloved infamous ""Hal"".This is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made, but is, a funny thing, not one of my favorites. Sometimes i feel it so hard to taking it, maybe for be so slowing, that is, like i say before, another great achievement. In spite of this, i think that is a necessary movie, where it seems that our humanity is driven mad, but the ending of this movie is a true that humans, being physical or spiritual, must to face for grow up. In some way, for good.PD: Althoug that this film don't is one of my favorites, and i feel the thing very slowly, i give it a 10, because the idea is giving impartial and veridical critics, the film is breathtaking and is excellently made.

But none of this can erase the fundamental problem: confusion. There are comments out of the original interpretation of the film, from the can see the scales, there is no great moral, but is a little jiao, worth not so much trouble to god god, this; Second, if the film needs to be interpreted by the original, it is a failure.

265,PetarNeo,Extraordinarily exceptional,10,19 November 2016,"Movie is probably one of the biggest hits in the world with it's requirement for audience to feel like participants while they are constantly being presented with scenes that require some thinking and creating an opinion. It was incredibly shoot with some of the incredible beautiful scenes and scenes like when HAL is looking onto lips of our two guys giving you idea that it's highly advanced but incredibly dangerous and powerful. HAL is presented as highly advanced computer (intelligence) that has potential which when released is powerful and influential. Sequences in the beginning of the movie are incredible as you are forced to conclude everything and round up some sort of opinion and perspective that later on you will use to understand some of scenes. Everything in the movie is magnificent form soundtrack that brings tension and tries to prepare you for incoming events, to incredible dialogues and mind blowing scenes that are also beautifully created. As the ending of the movie is concerned, it was an extraordinary experience for almost 20 minutes. They have only one thing that are doing and that is making you think what is that you are seeing and is there anything that you might get from it. Possibly they are created to make you form an opinion on what movie is really about and all things that are unknown to us what will happen when you find out something horrific like that. 4/4",2001 - A Space Odyssey
266,Indy-52,wow!,10,28 August 2001,"saw this flick recently for the 1st time. Pretty awesome. Definitely deserves all the praise. Shame I didn't see it ever before. This is quite an intense and weird film. Some say it's boring, but it actually kept my attention effortlessly. Far from boring. Very intriguing and beautifully done. Space has never been represented as convincingly as here. I was mesmerized by the effects work and sets. The camera work was dazzling. The movie is technically unparalelled. It is a pure feast for the eyes and ears. Effective use of classical and paranoia music. But does it have a plot? The amount of messages, and their depth, is mind-boggling. Can't be fully appreciated in one viewing. I've seen it twice, and I still don't get it entirely. This could be the most abstract and ambiguous film ever made. More than a film, it's a piece of art, like a painting. Open to numerous interpretations and points of view. The ending especially will leave you confused and dazzled. This is a tremendous achievement in every respect. How the director ever found the courage to try and realize this ambitious and complex project is also a mystery. If you haven't seen this film yet, do not hesitate and BUY it now. It is arguably the best in the sci-fi genre and one of the best films ever produced.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
267,Indy-52,my little insignificant summary of 2001,10,1 November 2001,"I will admit right away that I'm one of those idiots that hadn't seen Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY before this re-release in occasion of the real year 2001. I was very surprised by the film in the way it wasn't boring at all like some people I knew had told me. It is a truly thought-provoking, awe-ispiring work, always intriguing and unpredictable, standing head and shoulders above almost every other sci-fi film ever made. No other film I have ever seen captured my sense of wonder and my subconscious so deeply. I still can't keep it away from my thoughts. It is without a doubt Kubrick's most accomplished work to date (I have seen most of his movies). Using tremendously impressive effects portraying the starkness and silence of space, Kubrick made an unparalelled masterpiece, that immensely rewarded those with attention spans longer than five seconds.After a majestic opening title scene showing the sun rise up from the moon and using the enchanting 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' tune by Richard Strauss at maximum volume, the film opens with a 20-minute sequence showing the lives of a tribe of prehistoric man-apes. In typically Kubrickian fashion, the film calmly watches those animals, which are just about a few dozen thousand years away from becoming human, defending themselves from leopards, fighting another ape tribe for the waterhole, sleeping. Just when you think you're watching the wrong movie, something really unexpected and weird happens: the family that we've been watching finds a big black stone of some unknown material standing rooted in the ground. It is a thing of extraordinary geometrical precision, something totally out of place in this primitive world, suddenly appeared there with mysterious purposes. We see the apes slowly approaching the thing in fear and wonder; eventually they will find the courage to touch it. As all this happens we hear a menacing background music with ominous voices, a classic example of Kubrick paranoia music, which will be heard everytime mankind comes in contact with a monolith, as the black thing is called later in the film. After that the movie cuts to what seems to be the next day, and as we see one of the apes toying around with some bones on the ground, we hear Strauss' famous tune slowly coming up again: we know that something important is about to happen. The ape finds a way to use one of the bones as a weapon and starts thumping enthusiastically on the other bones, detroying them. The film assumes that we understand that this is because of the monolith: it is helping the evolution of the apes, pushing them to become more intelligent. This ape, who seems to be the leader of the tribe, then leads them to the waterhole to once again face the other, stronger tribe, this time with something they had never had before: weapons. The others come unarmed and their leader is killed by 'our' tribe's leader, who is armed.After this comes one of the most famous shots in movie history: the ape who has just killed with the bone throws it in the air and after following it for a while, the camera abruptly cuts to about four million years into the future. It is the year 1999 after Christ and man, in Kubrick's vision in 1968, has by then conquered space (unfortunately we now know that he was too optimistic about progress in space travel). Finally you understand a bit of where the movie is going, and finally the 'Space' in the title makes sense. The movie doesn't tell us it's 1999, but we find out later. With more classical music Kubrick shows us his unique, stark, and meticulously realistic vision of space. The camera lingers over spaceships and a space station, where we meet the first human characters and we hear the first dialogue. The man we meet is one Heywood Floyd played by William Sylvester. Something typical of every Kubrick film is that every character remains distant, boring, and hard to connect with; here the character development is even less important than in any other film he has done. We never find out anything about him, although he does have an important scene where he talks to others about an epidemic on the Clavius moon base: the people he talks with are similarly vague characters, who serve only to advance the plot. This criticism of flat characterization actually isn't really a criticism: part of the film's point is that machines like HAL, who we will meet later, have more interesting personalities than humans. Humans are supposed to come off boring. Anyway, Floyd goes to a meeting where he finds out that the hubbub on Clavius is caused by a dug-up black monolith that has been buried there for, you guessed it, about four million years. Humans were attracted to it because it sent out powerful signals. The thing looks exactly like the one the apes found earlier in the film. In an hypnotic, enchanting sequence we watch Floyd and his team approaching the monolith with the same sense of wonder the apes felt. Once again we hear that haunting music with those scary voices singing in the background. Floyd and the others gather around the monolith to take a picture, but a few seconds later they are startled to hear a piercing shriek coming out of the monolith. We see those men writhing with pain in their ears, and it's almost unbearable for the audience too. After that we see a shot we have seen before: the sun rising up on top of the monolith. We saw it before, after the apes had found the monolith, but I haven't figured out the meaning of this shot yet. Perhaps a signal was sent out of the monolith on the moon because it saw the light of the sun for the first time, and wanted to let its creators know about it somehow.After this sequence the film takes another leap forward in time, though not one quite as huge as the first one. The year is now 2001 and the title card says ""Jupiter Mission: 18 months later"". In another classic sequence, we hear beautiful classic music as the camera pans across the spaceship Discovery, and the film's central act begins. Everything that happened before is a setup for this part. First we see one of the astronauts running round in the circular control room of the ship to keep himself fit. Once again these people remain unknown and distant to us. They are Mission Commander David Bowman (Keir Dullea), who will play an important part in the story, and astronaut Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood). The film lacks any comedic punch in its dialogue, but that's just the point. In the Discovery ship we meet the most intriguing character in the film (and one of the most intriguing characters in any film), and he's a computer. It's the famous HAL 9000 computer which controls the functions of the entire ship, and he is given a chilling, appropriately soulless voice by actor Douglas Rain. In the first scenes on Discovery we find out that HAL is supposed to be a fool-proof computer, incapable of commiting error. Soon later while HAL is chatting with David Bowman about his doubts on the mission's purpose, he mentions a fault that he's picked up in the AE-35 antenna on the ship. Here's where the trouble in the film starts: it turns out that the antenna is perfectly fine. That HAL has committed a mistake is alarming to Bowman and Poole, because he could now make mistakes about anything in the mission. They close themselves off in private to discuss the situation. They ultimately decide to shut him off and continue the mission by themselves. Little do they know that HAL is reading their lips and so knows about their intentions anyway. So when Poole has to go outside the ship to check the antenna again, HAL becomes evil and doesn't let him in again. He floats off into space and dies. And in the most suspenseful and dramatic scene in the movie we see Bowman struggling to get back into the ship from the space pod he's in.In case you don't know what happens next, let me tell you that the movie actually becomes moving and dramatic. All the following scenes have gone down in movie history, but the final 20 minutes, where the main character is taken on a dizzying 'journey beyond the infinite', definitely belong among the most confusing, strange, enigmatic, and ultimately astonishing endings ever shown. Kubrick has so much to tell the audience, so many messages in his big final revelation that many audience members will be lost on it. I was too, and after being dazzled by its complexity I did eventually 'get' it, or most of it anyway. This is a rare movie that has the courage to skewer with our perceptions about life and our place in the Universe. It's too soon to say for me, but I think it will change my way of looking at life. It is easy to see why it was initially rejected by critics and audiences and later gained a huge cult following, ran in theatres for many years, and was eventually considered universally as a classic. It's a film that you might have a hard time understanding the first time around, but later buries itself into your subconscious and doesn't leave you. It's definitely the closest-to-perfect film if there ever was one, and it might even change your mentality and perceptions as it did with me.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
268,brianberta,My 2nd favorite film of all time,10,27 July 2016,"For over a year, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" has been my favorite movie ever made. It is one of the films which got me into reviewing films, and it still holds up just as much as it did on my first viewing. There are many people who say that it is one of the best movies ever made. I'd probably put it somewhere in the top 10. It has accomplished so much, and it's pretty hard for me to think of other films which could top it.This movie has a few story lines. The ""Dawn of Man"" sequence shows man-apes developing the first tool, and taking a big step forward in evolution. The next storyline shows a group of astronauts on an expedition to the moon. The third storyline shows astronauts investigating an object on Jupiter with the help of an intelligent computer named HAL. The final part of the film shows the famous Stargate sequence, and this is when the film gets really complicated.I really love ambiguity. Some of my favorite films have ambiguity. However, I feel like this film does the best job at ambiguity. What sets it apart from all the other films? The reason I say it's the best is because I feel like it has the most interpretations to it. Kubrick didn't leave any clues whatsoever in the film, and by doing so, he opened up the film to many answers. I feel like no matter how many times I watch it, there will still be more interpretations that could come out of it. I have not seen any film before which gave me the same feeling towards its ambiguous moments. Usually when films gets complicated, the transitions will impress me. However, 2001 impressed me a lot more by its visuals. The visuals of the Stargate sequence were hypnotic and impressive. It was made entirely through practical effects. It may seem easy to create it nowadays, but this film was from the 1960's. That was when computers still used magnetic tape storage. If that scene doesn't impress you, nothing will.Speaking of the visuals, they looked brilliant. In fact, more than brilliant. I already mentioned how the Stargate sequence looked really good. However, that's only the tip of the iceberg. There is hardly a single frame in this film which doesn't seem intricately designed, flawlessly composed, and superbly lit. It also has impressive framing and symmetrical compositions which makes many of its shots stick out even more. Even if the viewer gets confused by it at first, the amazing visuals will keep you coming back until you do. In my opinion, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" has the best cinematography in history. No film has ever topped it before, and this films' visuals feel untouchable. The only film which has come close to topping this one before is Terrence Malick's ""Tree of Life"". However, not even that film can top this. I have a feeling that it's going to remain at #1 for a long time.HAL was a really good villain. When you watch the movie, you have a little confidence that HAL won't be able to overpower the crew of the ship. However, when you're able to figure out what HAL's plan is, it's already too late. The lines he uses in the film are really good. Even when his life is in danger, he tries to use a normal voice to calm the astronaut down. Some portions of the film with him can be really unnerving for that reason. However, I think that the biggest reason why he works so good is that it's debatable whether he is actually evil or not. It's possible that his actions are all a part of self-defense. Because of this, the viewer would likely be unsure whether they're supposed to sympathize or despise his character. In my opinion, these kinds of villains (The Revenant for example) are the best kinds of villains. Also, let's not forget the hidden secret where if you replace every letter in ""HAL"" with the letter after it, you get IBM, an American multinational technology and consulting corporation.This films' soundtrack is brilliant. It is very iconic and it's easily recognizable today. ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" is not only iconic, but it feels very grand. Every time it's played in the film, important breakthroughs in evolution are occurring. The song perfectly lets you know that something spectacular is occurring. When you go back to try and interpret the film, the soundtrack is a good clue to figuring it out. Its also fun to listen to on your own. It never gets bland, and it always feels just as amazing as when you originally heard it in the movie. There are other songs which feel haunting. Those songs perfectly represent all of the weird parts in the film. They also work very good in the background, because they immerse you with many parts of the film. The iconic ""Stargate sequence"" is made even better by its ominous score. The soundtrack perfectly represents the movie.In conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, and it's one of the greatest films ever. It accomplishes a lot such as handling ambiguity better than any other movie I've ever seen has, containing the best visuals out of every movie I've seen, containing one of the best villains ever, and containing one of the best soundtracks ever. Every time when I re-watch it, I feel like I pick up on a lot of new things, and it still feels fresh and original. The reason why it's my favorite film of all time is because I'd rather watch it than all other movies I've seen. A few of my favorites came close to topping it before, but none were successful, and it still sits at #1. This is Kubrick's magnum opus.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

270,simon_booth,Unmatched accomplishment,10,17 June 2003,"Sometimes reading the user comments on IMDB fills me with despair for the species.  For anybody to dismiss 2001: A Space Odyssey as ""boring"" they must have no interest in science, technology, philosophy, history or the art of film-making.  Finally I understand why most Hollywood productions are so shallow and vacuous - they understand their audience.Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority.  Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic.  This is the film that put the science in ""science fiction"", and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day.  It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film.  The reason it is slow, and filled with minutae is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes).  The film's greatest strength is in the details.  Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey.  To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can't work out how some of the shots were done.  The film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological (and social) development.  It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick's.Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going.  Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future.  Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue.  There's no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel.  I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.I'm glad to see that this film is in the IMDB top 100 films, and only wish that it were even higher.  Stanley Kubrick is one of the very finest film-makers the world has known, and 2001 his finest accomplishment. 10/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
271,Ziya90,The greatest gift to be given to science fiction lovers,10,13 March 2010,"It opens a lot of dazzling pictures under the dawn of the man. The people who hated No Country for Old Men will hate this one too. Probably, this movie is the movie that is accepted as the most boring movie ever. It is not for everyone, but personally I did get bored at all. I was at high school when saw the movie for the first time. I had wondered it a lot and finally watched it and I remember, the time flied by. 2001 is quiet, still, beautiful and reposeful. It is pure space, pure science fiction. You know, Kubrick is a perfectionist director and sometimes, he does it, succeeds. 2001 is one of those movies. He gets the perfection. The movie has everything that can be in a science fiction film. He endeavors to catch every kind of picture in space and he does. That is one of the reasons that this is the greatest gift to science fiction lovers. Space has never looked that mysterious and beautiful at the same time. Really the music is very coherent with the visuals, so impressive. Visually, the movie is minimalist and very very stylish, no need to repeat that it is beautiful also. The set designs are great, the spacecraft which is sent to Jupiter is the best spacecraft I have ever seen in my life! Space has never looked that mysterious, unknown, obscure and creepy sometimes. For example, the scene that the astronauts come down to the ground first is creepy a bit. And just a note, I like the scenes they eat, visually colorful too. As for HAL, one of the most hypnotizing voices ever in cinema. Also as I see, it is the most intelligent artificial intelligent, computer ever and it makes the movie very interesting. A conscious existence. It is like a very very smart gentleman in dramas. The sequence which one of the astronauts goes in order to check and fix the problem with breath sounds is my favorite of the movie! One of the best sound editing ever. It is repeated by 2010, but unfortunately it seemed pretentious to me probably so that it is a repetition. By the way, I had not expected that things will come to that point. What a great script! In the second half, tension increases, but quietly. Not to spoil the movie, I won't tell who or what is it?, but there is a danger and it is more threatening than even the alien! The monologues of HAL, near the end left me with complex feelings somehow, but I hated it of course, it made me angry. The journey near the end, brilliant visuals, a space journey couldn't be defined better. That sequence is my second favorite. However, I learned that some people make fun of it by saying that it was like media player visualizations. The special effects look much better than even Avatar, you can bet on that! Just perfect. As for the final, I did not understand it exactly and honestly disappointed little, to me the weakest part of the movie, it could have been different, but no problem. I very enjoyed 2001, it is one of the movies that made me impressed the most.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
272,joemamaohio,My Review,10,26 July 2008,"No matter how many times I watch this spectacular film, I cannot understand a lot of it (such as the importance of the black pillar).Still, it is a piece of cinematic genius, and one of the best films ever created. Kubrick was definitely a visionary and there's very few men like him in the world today.Beginning with the Dawn of Man and going to space travel, ""2001"" is one of the best science fiction movies ever made.""2001"" also gave us one of cinema's greatest villains: HAL. A self-aware computer that is programming a manned trip to Jupiter. It is cold, calculating and without remorse. It's always right, and mankind is the error. It's also a possible glimpse into our own future as we begin to create self-aware robots, hoping they won't turn into HALs.The effects, the score, the scenes and everything about this film is just spectacular.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
273,robsta23,Ambiguity Doesn't mean Greatness,7,21 March 2015,"Don't get me wrong, 2001 is a good movie, but in my opinion a lot of philosophical ""content"" doesn't mean a film is a masterpiece.I actually believe the film lacks content. In the penultimate sequence of this film, Dave travels through hyperspace which makes for some very cool visuals. But that seems to be the purpose behind it: just to portray space in a visually stunning way.Let's go back to earlier in the film. The sequence with the apes discovering the monolith is amazing, and sets the tone for looking at the monolith in relation to using tools and the progression of technology. At the monolith's third appearance the ""progression"" seems to be of Dave becoming a star child. Is that a progression of technology? Is it a progression of mankind? I mean, I guess those are the questions we are meant to ask at the conclusion, but does ambiguity really mean greatness? Even if these questions are answered, I don't really see the significance of these answers.Also, the film is structured in a way that doesn't really get resolved - at least on the A plot line. In middle of the film, Dave and his partners are on a mission to Jupiter, and they never even get there; Dave is the only one left and happens to travel into a wormhole of sorts. By the way, before coming the star child, where is David? What is this room and how did he get here? I don't get why these questions get ignored, just because the film is supposed to be philosophical?This is a good film with great ambition, but I don't see it as one of the most important films of all time.I think the best aspect of this film is Hal-9000.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
274,freaky_dave,An Intelligent Sci Fi experience,10,20 August 2006,"I know that some people don't like 2001 because of the slow pacing, and I can understand their opinion because 2001 is slow at getting to its meaning. Upon watching the film I had those same opinions as well, but as it moved on I found a deeper understanding of the movie and was glad that it didn't rush to its conclusion. This really is a movie about these dark fascinating arrows (the monoliths) which lead mankind on a path to higher evolution. In order to understand the meaning better, one only has to watch this movie in its entirety and be prepared to think deeply. Yes it is a thinking man's movie, unlike something like Armaggeddon.Along the way Stanley Kubrick give us fantastic special effects and also uses music. There is very little dialogue, but that is the point of the movie. In fact the thing that has the most dialogue is the Hal computer, and Hal himself seems more human then the two astronauts he must protect on the voyage in space. Since this is a movie about evolution, that is quite understandable.Some movies are slow and can be a real bore if they have no strong points to make. 2001 is not like that at all. The pacing was perfect because it draws you deeper into the movie to make you think, and that was the point. I loved this movie and would recommend it to everybody who likes movies with deeper meaning. If you are looking for a movie filled with intense violence and wall to wall action, well then 2001 is not for you.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
275,karl_consiglio,A truly amazing experience,10,27 October 2006,"Kubrick is a genius and none can deny the superb special effects in this film so ahead of its time. Kubrick here achieves the promise of science fiction literature, bringing the beauty of space travel to the screen in believable form. The film opens with a prehistoric tableau: sub-human man is confronted by a huge black obelisk, an alien artifact that somehow teaches man the use of tools(and weapons). The implication is clear: man's one crucial step towards native intelligence was prompted by intelligence from the stars. Kubrick then cuts to his vision of 2001, on a space station high above Earth, and the figure of Dr Floyd who is being transferred to the moon to study a mysterious black obelisk recently discovered/excavated from beneath the Lunar surface. Our cameraman is afraid to approach this monolith as us astronauts approach and then the light of the sun hits it and a piercing signal is transmitted to the vicinity of Jupiter. Determined to investigate what lies at the other end of the signal, an expedition is mounted and eighteen months later, the great ship ""Discovery"" departs from Earth orbit. Fashioned in space, this beautiful monster carries two astronauts and three other scientists in suspended animation in the company of a smooth talking computer named HAL-9000, which seems to have developed a curious personality of its own. Hal is an adolescent in human terms, has a pathological fear of being turned off; to protect itself, the computer kills an astronaut, terminates the life functions of the three men in deep freeze and exiles another guy to slow death in a space repair pod. One man unable to reenter the ship through the normal hatches, all of which are controlled by the machine, opens a manual hatch, blows in without a space suit, and activates the airlock, penetrating the ""Discovery"" without any apparent damage(the other guy should be long dead by now) HAL is terminated after telling this guy about his mission. A third monolith is discovered on one of Jupiter's moons, and it throws the astronaut through a magnificent, most spectacular light show. At this point the remaining audience who had the patience to enjoy the film's earlier slow pace are thanking the good Lord for what they are witnessing, we have come so far. This ""light show"" kind of space travel is meant to represent or suggest some kind of mental transformation or another dimension in space or time, or both. Bowman lives out his days in plush quarters on the Jovian moons, and when he dies, is reborn again in an alien embryo, hovering over the turning green sphere of the Earth. 2001 is a major cinematic experience I discovered in my late Grandfather's video collection years ago and since then I've seen it over and over even if its a pretty long movie, its always a pleasure. After this film movie makers everywhere started taking the sci-fi genre more seriously. 2001 gave the science fiction film respectability, and a sense of growing maturity.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
276,kingofdanerds,A film that is years ahead of its time,10,2 November 2020,"Stanley Kubrick is often considered to be one of the greatest film makers of all time. I mean, most (if not all) of his films are considered top notch films. 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of those films. Released in 1968, 2001: A Space Odyssey is often considered to be one of the greatest science fiction films of all time and it is not hard to see why. Upon release, the film recieved mixed reviews but has gone on to gain it's reputation as one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Kubrick wrote the screenplay along with Arthur C. Clarke who also wrote the novel during the film's production with the novel being released shortly after the film was released. Arthur C. Clarke would go on to write the 3 sequels to 2001 with the first of the sequels, 2010, recieving a film adaptation in 1984. 2001: A Space Odyssey recieved four nominations at the Academy Awards and won one for the films special effects.The film starts at the Dawn of Man when humans are just apes and we see the ape humans discover weapons thanks possibly to the mysterious black monolith. Cut to millions of years later and we see where the human race is. We see that humans have got into space travel and all of that nice stuff. We see that scientists have found another of these black monoliths on the moon. But the main part of the story is the crew of the USS Discovery. The crew consists of five humans. Three of them are in a state of hibernation and the other two are maintaining the ship while on it's journey to Jupiter. The sixth member is a supercomputer known as the HAL 9000. During the journey, HAL starts acting weird.......2001: A Space Odyssey is truly a film that is years (perhaps decades) ahead of it's time. I don't even know where to start with here to be completely honest. The acting is pretty solid here even with there not being a whole lot of dialogue at all in this film. Douglas Rain (who voices HAL) is truly amazing and gives the creepiness that should be in portraying (or at least doing the voice of) HAL 9000. The story is even better here. The story of 2001: A Space Odyssey is a story that was unique for it's time and still is over 50 years after being released. It is a truly amazing story that deals with themes like technology, evolution, and even existence. This film is a very slow paced film. It is possibly one of the slowest films that I have seen but to me it is well worth it. This film is a journey that gives us extraordinary sights to see. It is one complaint that I have seen people give about this film. Which is completely understandable. So, if you are a person with a short attention span, this film is not a film you will like. Another complaint that I have seen people give about this film is the ending. Honestly, I think it is very clever. The ending can be interpreted in so many different ways and is truly thought provoking and that was most likely the intention of Stanley Kubrick. He wanted to make this film into one of those films where after you get done watching it, you talk about it with people afterwards. I also think a whole series was not anticipated either. The reason why I say this is because the book sequels and the 2010 movie (even the 2001 book) do explain what happened at the end. But I like to see Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey as it's own thing due in part to it's ending. Enough of that now....... This film possibly has the best soundtrack (and most iconic) for any film. Every song here can easily be associated with this film. They even manage to help develop the tone of this film which is kind of peculiar to talk about. The huge tone that is present in this film is this mysteriousness and creepiness. Most of the time you don't fully realize it, but it is truly there and it is like in the back of your head. The monolith and HAL and even the ending all really help give this film the creepiness and mysteriousness. The last few things I have really to talk about is the cinematography, special effects, and set design. The cinematography and special effects are truly amazing and really makes one think ""Was this film really made in the 60's?"". All of the special effects are all practical effects with alot of the ships done with miniatures. They are just marvellous. The set designs are even more extraordinary with rotating sets (which also works due to the camera work). It is just really fun to watch happen. The set designs are so convincing that I am truly convinced that this film was actually filmed in a space ship and all of the other places. It is a perfect example of how a film can do world building.2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that is years ahead of its time and really holds up over 50 years after being released. It is not a film for everyone and definitely not a film for those with short attention spans. Thought provoking, beautiful effects, and much more really does make this film one of the greatest science fiction films of all time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
277,TheOny13,"This is what happens when you don't use art to inspire and question the audience, or do you? (Probably some spoilers)",5,8 July 2014,"But actually this movie just shows some images that might put you on thought about the deep message of the movie. And come to think about that this movie is so praised for being mind-blowing and visually stunning(agree only with the last one). So to quote a reviewer who once said this line: ""Great movies are often those who question the audience"". So what's wrong with this movie? The simple fact that it gives the audiences the answer as if the answer would be that or the other one, not one which we would realize we could not comprehend or realize it exceeds our grasp of understanding the things in our 3 dimensional space. But the question and the complexity of the movie is either missing or hidden so well in order for the ending to shock the viewer. For me personally - because this is a subjective review - I would prefer for the movie to take me somewhere where I would understand that I can't understand... like have a message beyond words or images. Instead this movie spends it's time with nonsensical stuff and doesn't asks me or takes me to that place I might not fully grasp or comprehend but rather shows images of things whose meaning I couldn't understand in the context of the movie.Next point I'll touch with this review is that all the persons and their supposed knowledge or expertise seemed so fake and cheaply executed. This is mainly because the movie tries to force one idea on my throat by repeating it over and over with different characters and set pieces that just ruins the humanity of the characters or their professional authenticity. So, to give you an example take the hibernating process which in my opinion seemed fake just like the artificial gravity... it was like a theater play. Not even a word about how it was done that might show me as a spectator that the guys were astronauts who knew what they were doing and what physical concepts or theories were using. Instead there were more ambiguous and vague images that might capture my attention or curiosity. And then when movies like ""Interstellar"" come with actors guided by astronauts on how to float in 0 G, or theories of physics that prove that the characters do know those stuff, majority of the so-called ""critics"" or ""movie- goers"" trash it for exceeding it's grasp. Wake up people! That's what we humans feel when we understand that some stuff are impossible to comprehend and that's exactly what that movie is trying to say to it's audiences. What people want instead is to have answers on a plate brought before them. That's plain superficial and not deep or intriguing yet alone mind-blowing as this movie is called.Another problem in this film is that the human kind appears to be too advanced in 2001. We actually didn't advanced much since 1920's till 1960's, so what possible miracle could make us advance so much in 40 years? Even now with all of this technology we don't advance, but sometimes remain the same in some ways. That's one of the big problems with old sci-fi movies... they show a ""not so distant future"" that is so advanced beyond imagination and one that lacks realism... but the majority of film experts buy this cheap things that movies like this are trying to sell.In conclusion I'll give this movie only a 5... and that's for the visual spectacle that this movie unfortunately only is. I say ""only"" because the intellectual and mind-blowing part is too well hidden and dragged that doesn't make me ask myself questions nor makes me realize that what happens in this movie will never happen due to our(or my) human limitations both physical and intellectual.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
278,erwan_ticheler,A Stunning Masterpiece by One of the Greatest Directors off All-Time,10,16 January 2004,"SPOILERS AHEAD!:""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is,like Kubrick said himself,more of an experience than an actual movie and therefore a true Kubrick Movie.Movies like ""A Clockwork Orange""(which has the 2001 soundtrack LP in the movie!) and ""Full Metal Jacket"" are also more experiences than movies. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"",made after the legendary model work by Arthur C. Clarke,is a breathtaking masterpiece of special effects and symbolism.It is probably the single greatest visual movie ever made.It starts with a surprising as well as disturbing musical overture by Ligeti of about 3 minutes. The screen is black and stays that way until the lion of MGM shows up,the brilliant opening credits appear together with a great shot of the moon,earth and sun together in one view. The music of Strauss is perfect for this beginning. The movie contains of 4 parts from which the first part is the Dawn of Man(10 million years ago) in which we see monkeys who rival each other for water.This is also the first time in which the Monolith appears,that scares and upsets the monkeys very much.In the next shot one of the monkeys then starts to punch with a bone(probably the beginning of the urge by men for destruction and aggression). He takes the bone to the water where he destroys one of the opposing monkeys. He throws the bone in the air which sets up one of the greatest and dramatic scene changes ever made,the bone changes into a space ship. The second part begins.Together with ""The Blue Danube"" a series of beautiful images appear on screen. In this part we also get to see the great wit of Stanley Kubrick,although this is a serious film.The Grip Shoes as well as the Zero Gravity Toilet(Watch Dr. Floyd,played by William Sylvester,examine the manual with great care) is very funny.Another great laugh for me was the Dutch translation of the welcome comity.Of course Dr. Floyd chooses English but still... Brilliantly funny is also the fact that Kubrick's own daughter appears in the movie,as Dr. Floyd's daughter! In this part the Monolith appears again as a complete mystery,but now on the moon.A high humming sound comes and the third part begins.The Jupiter Mission is the third part in which the two astronauts Poole(played by Gary Lockwood) and Dave Bowman(played by Keir Dullea) fly to Jupiter to reveal the mystery of the Monolith,although they don't know that themselves.We does know it is the advanced computer HAL-9000(legendary voice by Douglas Rain) and when he makes a mistake all hell on the ship breaks loose.Poole is killed by HAL while he's in space fixing HAL's mistake and then Dave terminates HAL by erasing his memory and functions,HAL sings the song ""Daisy"" as his final words.Then a TV shows up in which Dave hears the true meaning of his mission.The screen turns black and the last and best part of the movie begins.Jupiter and beyond the Infinite is a mindblowing 25 minutes of beautiful shots of Jupiter,a dazzling star-gate sequence and a very curious ending sequence in a deserted chamber. The star-gate sequence is for me the ultimate highlight of the movie.The colors and images are simply breathtaking as is the haunting score by Ligeti.Never before and never again has someone tried to make such a scene as this one. The climax is very hard to understand and since I haven't read the book yet(which I will very soon),I still don't really get it.Dave is,after flying into Jupiter through the Star-gate,in a quiet and deserted house. He ages before his own eyes and when he is at his oldest lying in a bed,the mighty Monolith appears at his bed side.He reaches out for it and the next shot is the birth of the star-child as the camera closes onto the Monolith.The Moon appears as well as Strauss' masterpiece ""Zarahustra""(for the third time in the movie). The Star-child reaches earth and the movie ends.The symbolism is very important in this film.There are two main symbols which appear in the movie several times:the Monolith and the Bone. The Bone appears as the murder weapon of the monkey,as the spaceship that shows up right after the bone is thrown in the air and at the beginning of the Jupiter Mission we see a long spaceship shaped into the form of a bone. The Monolith is even more important as it is the mysterious centerpiece of the story.The monkeys,as well as the scientists on the moon,as well as Dave Bowman on his deathbed react exactly the same:Confused,scared but also humble as they all want to touch it with great respect.In 10 million years nothing has changed,so it appears.Also very important and very well done are the special effects.They are way ahead of their time,considering it was made 10 years before ""Star Wars"".We can see how important the effects are on future science fiction films as ""Star Wars"".For that alone it is a cinematic landmark.The sound is also great,just listen to all those strange sound effects on the Jupiter Mission(breathing!) and the absence(!) of sound while the astronauts are in space. The music is unmistakably necessary in the movie since there are a lot of scenes in which not much happens.For instance the first shots of space underscored by ""The Blue Danube"" and of course the opening and ending shots underscored by ""Zarahustra"",which will always be identified as a ""classical space piece"".Last but not least the frantic and psychedelic music of Ligeti,eminent in the star-gate sequence.It gives the scene an extra boost of mystery.A great add on,intentional or unintentional(who knows?),is the music of Pink Floyd(my favorite band).The Masterpiece ""Echoes""(my favorite song ever) from the album ""Meddle"" can be heard while watching the last 25 minutes of the movie,Jupiter and beyond the Infinite.To me it was an absolute joy to watch since it gives the scene a totally different look.The sound effects and various moods of ""Echoes"" match brilliantly with the movie,as if it was written while watching it.Start the song at the same point as the scene starts and enjoy. A funny and curious thing is that one of the main characters of the movie is called Dr. FLOYD(!!!). There is also a way to watch the entire movie with Pink Floyd music,but that requires several of their albums and is not very convincing.Still,pretty funny to watch.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a true cinema-movie,you have got to see it in the Theater.I saw it in my hometown Amsterdam as it was re-run as a classic comeback.That was the second time I saw the movie cause my first was on TV.Yesterday I saw it on DVD,which is pretty cool but it ain't no Theater.In my own private collection I've got the movie on VHS,a German version(aaaahhh) taped when it was on ARTE:a cultural channel(yeah right,not even the original version).You've got to see the movie at least two times to really enjoy it,cause the first time probably is not the best to fully understand it.That was my personal experience as well as Woody Allen's and that's a good advice now ain't it? ""2001"" is probably the most unique movie ever created,because of it's lack of a real story and because of it's beautiful images.Although there are some very long scenes in the movie it never gets boring,especially when you see it in the theater.There is so much to see and hear!Overall,it is one of my personal Masterpieces and then to consider that it isn't even my favorite Kubrick movie(which is Dr. Strangelove)!Brilliant picture.  10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey

280,Artimidor,One of film history's brightest stars,10,30 May 2021,"In hypothetical 2001 auteur-duo Stanley Kubrick and sci-fi master Arthur C. Clarke take us on a unique journey into the unknown, leading us far out into the vast reaches of space, where man is all alone with himself. Or is he? For an ominous artifact excavated on Earth's single natural satellite, the moon, seems to suggest otherwise. The enigma of the monolith beckons - and points further out there. What hides behind the glassy slab composed of the inkiest blackness imaginable? Is the monolith a relic from a long-lost cosmic culture? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe it serves as a sentinel, an extraterrestrial guardian to evaluate intelligent life, an alien yardstick to measure civilization, to supervise its genesis and progress. Or is it closer to a teacher, providing man with the missing link to what lies beyond, a rung to hold on to, so that a sometimes floundering race may evolve beyond? Have we come across a gateway to a first encounter, to - who could know? - even something... divine? - Questions abound: Who created this inscrutable object? And why, after so many years of resting buried, has it been activated, signaling... where to? The answer might transcend comprehension and thus mankind as we know it. We have arrived in hypothetical 2001, the year when everything is about to change.Ambiguity is not ""2001's"" liability, but its forte. It is the main and heady ingredient Kubrick allowed to dominate Clarke's potent sci-fi cocktail of ultimate questions. Whereas the grand mysteries of life's origin and destiny are gradually diminished in Clarke's accompanying novel and even more so in the three succeeding books, Kubrick opts for a pure philosophical angle, studding it with iconic imagery. Ultimately, the viewer is left with facing the sublime alone; dropped right into the majesty that is the universe, on his way towards infinity. Visuals reign. Visuals supplemented by such diverse, seemingly contradictory soundscapes as György Ligeti's eerie ""Requiem"", Richard Strauss's epic ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"", Johann Strauss's unforgettable ""Blue Danube"" waltz, and the sheer intensity of universe-wide eternal silence.Almost unfathomable that we have to remind ourselves that Kubrick put this masterpiece on celluloid based on pre-moon landing data. So accurate is his dedication to scientific accuracy that the conspiracy theories about him having staged the actual moon landing haven't let up till this day. Then again, how disappointing that post-Kubrick filmmakers have mostly given up on taking a leaf out of his book where space is married with science in supreme beauty; instead, they deliver lackadaisical CGI-infested crowd-pleasing imitations and, if they have to say something at all, they drench them in pseudo-intellectualism. Looking back, one has to grant at least the follow-up to the mother of all space operas, ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" (Peter Hyams/Arthur C. Clarke), that it is not a bad film. And yet, for what it's worth, it already looked dated upon conception. While full of monoliths, it lacks all things Kubrick, which condemns it to a mere footnote to the seminal original. ""2001"" is more than a movie. It's an epiphany. Mankind's third millennium starts with ""2001"", date and film, and with good reason.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
281,mrcaw1,Masterpiece of film making.......,10,29 December 2003,"After reading some of the user comments on this film I felt I'd like to add my two cents.I consider this film to be one of the masterpieces in the world of cinema. Would I want every film to be similar in structure? No, I would not. But that does not diminish the accomplishment of this film.I've read comments from users citing the film as boring, hard to understand, pointless & lacking in narrative.I feel these opinions are based more on the expectations of what a film should be and not on what the film actually is.What this film does and brilliantly I might add is to challenge the concept of what the medium of film can be. Instead of using film as a medium to tell a straight forward narrative, the film ascends to loftier goals.  I see the movie as a piece of art. Cinematic art. I liken the experience of watching 2001 as viewing a great masterpiece of art.I don't watch 2001 to merely have some science fiction author's hypothesis of the nature of existence explained to me. I watch it for the visual feast combined with the haunting score and challenging intellectual theories presented. Film is first & foremost a visual medium. The use of sound in the form of scoring compliments the visual for sure. But dialogue between characters is only relied upon in this movie when it is absolutely necessary to further the story.The film is not fast paced. But slow pacing in and of itself does not condemn this or any other film. It's what the creator does with the pace of the film that matters.In many ways, for me, this film is a ballet. Key scenes in the timeline of man are presented and there is this dance of life. Dance of death. The constant struggle to further the awareness of life, the possibilities of existence, the barriers of death of time & of space. It's heady stuff for sure and the movie only presents scenarios, possibilities. It does not provide answers. It only suggests what ifs. And it does it with visuals combined with a perfect score that to this day, inspire film makers & audiences worldwide.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I get that this movie is very confusing, ambiguous, and slow in some parts, but you have to appreciate it still for the time period in which it came out for those effects alone.

This has (without doubt) to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. If you're still going to watch this, then just remember that you can easily skip the first 25 minutes, because they add nothing of interest except from some great background music by Strauss. The first 15 minutes or so,.for example, is just a bunch of scenes with some apes in a prehistoric environment, and is totally pointless. To be more general about it, the movie has no point at all. It has way too many scenes that last way too long. The plot is boring nearly all the way. There was some hope for it at a moment in the movie, but nothing exciting happened after all.

Well the movie was very unexciting, it left me wondering about many things, mainly what the ending meant. This movie isn't bad, but it is very strange. It has long drawn out scenes where nothing is happening, and you are just looking at space ships floating around. The effects were incredible, even knowing how they did some of the stuff, it still was great to see. There are some great moments of suspense, and the atmosphere is great at some points, like when the scientist's are approaching the monolith, but the scene ends right when it gets good, and never shows you what happened. I liked the scenes with HAL, but you probably already know about that. This film has a lot of good ideas but they are over shadowed by how boring and pointless the film is at times. I would probably enjoy this film more if it were re-cut, but that won't happen.

286,ryan_kuhn,"The Slow, Cosmic Ballet",10,13 February 2005,"There is no question what Stanley Kubrick is looking for in 2001: man is insignificant. Space is vast, space is monotonous, and humans are insignificant because we cannot comprehend the vastness that is space. This space movie begins on Earth, before man had inherited it, when mankind was still toiling in the form of hapless primates, barely surviving and not at the top of the food chain. Then it happened. What exactly? We don't know, but something from above, in the form of a black monolith, helps the primates become man. Zip ahead a couple of thousand of years (literally, cut from prehistoric Earth to the space age is unofficially the biggest jump in time in movie history) and we find man living in space. One of the most famous, and beautiful scenes, of the movie is the ballet between a space ship and the spinning Hilton Hotel orbiting the Earth to the classical song ""On Blue Danube."" The music suggests grace and elegance in space travel, but the action and dialog suggest slow, tedious, boring work. This might as well be a silent movie, the most interesting dialog comes from a taped BBC interview that appears halfway through the movie. The character with the most speaking may be the computer that runs a ship that is headed towards Jupiter, on a mission to investigate another monolith. The infamous HAL 9000, voted as one of movies best villains, is not really a villain, just a confused cyborg. The computer is in charge of two living, breathing scientist and 3 who are hibernating. There is action, but not in the usual sense of science fiction action. There are no lasers, nothing blows up, just slow, problem solving. What happens at the end of the movie is open to interpretation, and that's the fun of the movie. What one of the astronauts goes through when he finds another monolith orbiting Jupiter is up to the viewer. Whatever you think happens, it is important to remember that we as humans look for answers, but in this universe, maybe we aren't supposed to have all of them. This is not a movie to be taken literally, everything is symbolic. There are no wasted shots, no teases, nothing extraneous.

For me, this is very much as spellbinding as films get, from the very beginning. I don't agree with the criticism that Kubrick might be pompous, but I can see why one might feel that way. This, even after all these years, is a journey into film itself, the possibilities of visual expression. And aural! What a way to use well-known pieces and make them one's own! Not to mention taking an obscure piece by Ligeti, letting it to get to the bone.From time to time I'm surprised by the criticism aimed at the acting of those involved. They are often described as wooden, and in comparison HAL seems humane.

291,patryk-czekaj,An intergalactic beauty,9,18 June 2012,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a remarkable achievement in the field of visual effects and film editing. It's not just a movie - it's an example of art of the highest sort. People are often mislead by its slow pace, lengthy sequences, very little action and confusing themes. But that's the true beauty of this masterpiece. I don't think that there will ever be another picture so innovative, not on the technical level, but on the ideological one. It's surely an epic drama about adventure and exploration. But it's also much more than that. It's truly overwhelming what this 2-hour long feature can say through the magnificent images that appear on screen not only to astound us, but to make us realize that there is so much more to life than we already know.Taking into account that it's been released in 1968 it should be considered as a fundamental science fiction movie, not only because of its staggering beauty and profound outer-space experiences, but also because of the ideas that's been implemented in this highly metaphorical and philosophical creation.Stanley Kubrick directed a movie that probably has thousands of various interpretations. And people are coming with new ones every day. From connections to Nietzschean ideologies about the potential of mankind, through references to religious content, up to the theory of conception, which regards the basis of human evolution that's featured in the film and endures within all of the succeeding chapters.The reappearance of the mysterious black monolith only makes the movie more puzzling and interesting, so to say. The viewer doesn't necessarily discover its true meaning, but one can only imagine that it serves as a prominent link in the humanity's evolutionary tale.It's really fascinating how all of the chapters connect in a clear and expressive manner. It all starts with the Dawn of Mankind, where a tribe of apes finds the black monolith for the first time, and suddenly realizes how to use weapons, in order to win over the precious territory. A quick throw of a bone into the air and we're in the vast space, a few million years into the future. That's where the mystique adventure happens, and all that people know about the universe is about to change completely.I have to say that my favorite character of all is HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain). Even though he is just a computer, he is somehow able to form emotions, and thus, paradoxically, it may be said that he is the most human of all the crew members of Discovery One. Even though he tries to eliminate all of the other passengers, he is just doing it to protect himself and the whole Jupiter mission. When it comes to visual effects, the most groundbreaking part of it occurs in the fourth part, during the Star Gate sequence. Through merging various colors, patterns, drawings, photographs, and high-contrast images Kubrick produced a thing of utmost beauty. It also formed a basis for the sci-fi movies that started to emerge in the following years. 2001: A Space Odyssey might shock you, confuse you, or even disturb you by the story that it depicts. However, it's truly a breathtaking movie, one that can be viewed as an intergalactic opera, perhaps. So get ready and prepare for one of the most divine shows that you will ever see.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
292,WubsTheFadger,2001: A Space Odyssey,9,19 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the film is a story of humanities evolution and is a philosophical work. Stanley Kubrick was reticent about offering up a definitive explanation for the movie and encouraged audiences to interpret it for themselves. I would highly recommend watching an explanation video after finishing the film. I found one on YouTube by LondonCityGirl - Knowledge. She really helped me understand all of the symbolism and helped me fully understand the very complex story.With all that said, I found the film very confusing. After the film ended, I was left perplexed at what I had just witnessed. The story is very complex and has many symbols. Symmetry, shapes, alignment, and time all play an important and sometimes subtle role in telling the story. I found the plot extremely interesting and the eeriness and surreal-ness of the film was great. The music choice is stunning. The music that plays when we see the monolith/sentential is creepy and eerie. The acting is very good. Keir Dullea, Gary Lockwood, and William Sylvester all perform very well. Douglas Rain, who voices HAL 9000, performs the best in my eyes. His performance as HAL left chills running down my spine and he brought an almost humanlike aspect to HAL.The pacing is very slow. There are a number of long scenes that are merely a black screen or a docking sequence. These can be tiresome. The runtime is also overlong. There is a lack of dialogue but the symbolism behind the heavy breathing and moments of pure silence are there for a reason. The CGI is okay. I know this is an old film but it doesn't hold up to the standard that Star Wars created.All in all, this film is a great work of fiction and is a defining movie when it comes to cinema.Pros: Complex story, great use of symbolism, eerie music, good acting, Douglas Rain's performance as HAL 9000, and great directing by Stanley KubrickCons: Slow pacing, an overlong runtime, okay CGI, the story is extremely complex because of the use of symbols, and the ending is very confusingOverall Rating: 8.3P.S. This film reminded me of Interstellar, they both have a similar ending. Interstellar is much easier to understand but I would still highly recommend this film to Sci-Fi fans",2001 - A Space Odyssey
293,kris-gray,"NOT the Emperors New Clothes, more like Marmite",10,28 February 2020,"Some reviewers have called this a case of the Emperors New Clothes, in other words those who give it good reviews can't admit it's rubbish. Well I saw this back in the day when it was first released, a group of us skipped school and went up to the west end to see it in all it's Cinerama glory. I loved it then and every time I've seen it since, yesterday in fact, including the time after I discovered LSD (something I wouldn't recommend doing these days) the final sequence was awesome!So it's a bit like Marmite, you either love it or you hate it. So I accept some people find it boring but I wouldn't call them stupid, they just don't have the same tastes as I and the majority of reviewers here, do.I would guess that most who don't like it come from the Star Wars generation of CGI flash bang whollop kind of Sci-fi which needs not a a lot of thought to understand. The fact that spaceships can't fly at X time the speed of light without any effects on the crew is unlikely is not the point. 2001 is intelligent Sci-Fi where you need to draw your own conclusions as to the ending.The decision not to show any alien was a good one, all films of this genre have aliens that are basically humanoid, two legs, two arms and a head so that they can find actors to play the part with considerable changes to the head as the only concession to the possibility that any aliens would looks a bit different. Why do they always speak English with and American accent?Is it slow, I concede that point but then space travel would seem slow, it would take months to get to Jupiter so why would they show it as being faster? Slow yes, boring no.I wouldn't insult you by saying you're stupid because you don't get it so don't insult me because I do.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
294,mgruebel,A film stripped to the bare essence of film,10,21 December 2013,"Film is a visual medium, and Kubrick was one of its greatest experimenters. Every one of his films is an experiment in its genre. Every one of his films successfully takes its genre in a new direction. For SF, 2001 is no exception.The film contains half hour+ stretches with no dialogue, only minimal classical music. Yet these stretches can hold an intellectually inclined viewer spellbound, just soaking in the images. Even the decisions forced on the director (such as leaving out the aliens in the final alien encounter) are worked in favor of the film. And of course Kubrick's decision to leave out an electronic score (albeit a well done one) in favor of unedited classical music that ranges from quietly disturbing to exuberant - or just not to have any music at all - makes the film watchable and listenable decades after its conception. Every set piece - and the film is nothing but a series of visual set pieces, is priceless, from the Pan Am stewardess doing a 360 degree walk in the space plane, to an astronaut fighting for survival in the quiet vacuum of outer space, to a conversation with a sentient machine gradually reduced to his (not 'its') oldest memories, becoming senile at the hands of his human antagonist.Of course current audiences used to modern CGI will notice flaws: the proto-humans have that odd combination of realism yet costumed fake-ness that only real acting (and really good acting, at that) in a costume can provide. The multiple-exposure masks used during flight scenes to block off the star field are not always perfectly aligned against the space ships. Unable to get the engine fire and dust upon landing right, effects master Doug Trumbull decided to just forgo it. Yet these peccadilloes pale by comparison to how accurately physical laws are modeled and represented in every detail in this film, especially in view of the cartoonish and video-gamish liberties taken by the current slew of SF action films. 2001 almost stands alone in how accurate it is physically.2001 was a watershed for SF films. Like another of Arthur C. Clarke's masterworks, ""Rendezvous with Rama,"" it does not try to explain, it just lets be. Unfortunately when ""Rendezvous with Rama"" finally gets made, it will probably be turned into a current-generation mindless sci-fi action movie with plenty of outer space sound effects and horrific spider monsters coming after the humans. The problem right now is that big films have become so expensive to make, that deviating from formula, as Kubrick always did, is just not a safe option anymore. This will change: CGI will become so commonplace and inexpensive, that we will see a generation of smart films with CGI in 10-15 years.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
295,Come-and-Review,"OK, almost...",10,2 December 2014,"I must say, at first I hated this movie. I didn't understand anything about the end. Then I started seeing it again, and read the book, and finally understood this whole thing.I must say, now that I understand it, it's not a complicated movie. also, it definitely has great effects for 1968. What Tarkoskij said, and I agree with, this movie is a little ""cold"". In the final sequence, I don't feel that much of an emotional journey together with the main carachter, like in other films, e.g. Solaris, Stalker or even Interstellar, inspired by this film. Also there is a loong sequence at half movie that just makes me bored, for some odd reason.What I instead like of this, is the plot, and the cinematic side of it, the solutions adopted to film some scenes. The great synchronism between music and picture, the use of classical music, mixed with gyorgy ligeti's music really makes that side of the thing. Pink Floyd fans like me will like the fact that their song ""echoes"" is perfectly synchronized with the last chapter of the movie, I suggest also to watch that listening simultaneously to the song, it definitely gives a different feeling.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It blew me away, taking me to a time, an atmosphere, a vision that far surpassed anything I had seen or read. Batman, The Time Machine, and anything else that even vaguely related to sci-fi promptly became scrap by comparison with this ode to spacial beauty, this timeless tale of man vs machine, and this celebration of human intelligence... and its limitations.Visually stunning, musically memorable, with a great director. Stanley Kubrick, in his greatest form ever, this is a movie that I have re-watched many times, and always I find new angles and details, and renewed pleasures. It is best watched on the 70mm Cinerama screen in a proper movie house, but the DVD and Blu-Ray versions already offer considerable quality, allowing one to take in the subtlety of photographic composition, and glorious special effects, that have been imitated ad nauseum, but never equalled.It is a most intelligent film, one that leaves you thinking for days, and me in awe of how human beings managed to come up with this visual wonder.Pity the most you can give this masterpiece is 10/10!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

How about using the strength of sound to tell the story, whether it be Poole's breathing or HAL cutting off the life support of the survey crew? Will another scene ever top, let alone challenge, Kubrick's vision of The Dawn of Man? 2001 has everything going for it. Even more so now that we can look back at this movie forty years later and can comparatively draw our own conclusions on how we have succeeded and failed, this movie kind of being its own measuring stick on how well we have advanced and changed.Three main stories make up 2001. We begin with The Dawn of Man, where humans earliest ancestors are trying to survive on the young planet. We skip to 2001 where business and exploration is part of life in space, and a new discovery is found on the moon. Finally, a mission to Jupiter is underway with a hibernating survey team, two astronauts and HAL 9000.One of the best conflicts of all time is obviously between Bowman and HAL. From when Bowman uses the now-infamous line, ""Open the pod bay doors, HAL,"" to when he goes straight to HAL's Logic Memory Center, the conversation is sharper than most movies I can currently recall. The length of the film is always something to be desired, but I still watch this movie, never really tiring of it.

303,Torgo_Approves,Mesmerizing experience,10,19 August 2006,"(r#54)Only Stanley Kubrick could create a film like 2001. It is unlike anything made before or after it and whether you like it or not, it is an unforgettable experience. I urge anyone who disliked this film to give it at least one more chance - I can honestly say that the film was way too far off the wall for me to appreciate it the first time I watched it.2001 is overflowing with iconic images, from the opening scene accompanied by Richard Strauss' ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"", to the bone being tossed into the air by the ape. It has become such a huge phenomenon that even today TV series, movies, parodies and comics continue to spoof it. It is impossible to hear The Blue Danube without associating it to Kubrick's masterpiece. And that is what it is, in every sense of the word: a masterpiece. Nothing is half-baked or average about 2001 - it is a work of enormous attention to detail and love for the art of movie-making itself. Although Kubrick continued to direct amazing movies like The Shining, A Clockwork Orange and Full Metal Jacket (which were all far more accessible movies) after 2001, he couldn't top this: his crowning achievement.It's easy to see how viewers may be put off by 2001 - it doesn't follow the usual movie formula where the plot comes to a conclusion at the end. In fact, neither before nor after 2001 has a movie been made the same way. Plot line and characters are more or less redundant in this film: It's all in the images and music, and what it all means. I won't go into the point of 2001 since I haven't read the book and I think it is up to each viewer to decide for himself what it all means.The movie jumps from the very dawn of man's use of weapons to a time when space is heavily trafficked, and continues to show us the fate of some unlucky astronauts at the hands of a super-intelligent computer called HAL-9000. I won't spoil what happens in the end but I will say that if you could see it coming, you must be some kind of super genius; as far as I'm concerned it is the single least predictable ending for a movie, ever.Kubrick is the only director that I know of who has portrayed space in the most realistic way possible: vast, endless, dark, empty, and soundless. It's admirable that a director goes out of his way to make sure no sounds are heard in space, but rather than let this make the movie dreary and dull, Kubrick uses this to his advantage: the chilling silence of some scenes actually help build up the atmosphere in a way that no movie has done before. Some scenes are outright scary, working at an almost subconscious level. Kubrick has always been a master of creating moods and emotions with the viewer, and 2001 is the prime example of this: The climactic scene in the bathroom is unbelievably frightening, and Kubrick creates a sense of dread purely without monsters, murderers or loud music. It's amazing.The movie is highly meditative and definitely not the one to watch if you want a loud, action-packed Star Wars-type adventure. The long periods of near-complete silence, the low-key dialogue, HAL's monotonous voice (a stroke of genius) and the scattered pieces of classical music set you in a state of complete relaxation and makes you think. I realize this is highly personal and will not work for all viewers. The special effects are pitch-perfect, still as good today as they were almost 40 years ago. While the digital effects of the Star Wars prequels will be outdated in 10 years, 2001 will continue to stun people with its shockingly realistic and believable effects. Although I would have preferred Kubrick to win the Best Director Oscar for this (as well as many of his other films), the Best Effects award is completely deserved. 2001 still beats many of today's movies in terms of best effects.If you've grown tired of mediocre movies, give 2001 another chance. At first viewing, I thought it was tiresome and drawn out. At second viewing, it was the most perfect movie ever made. If you're open minded, this is for you, if Pirates of the Caribbean is your favourite movie of all time, it's not - and I don't say this to insult fans of Pirates, I'm just saying that this film might not be up your alley.I hope I don't sound too pretentious because I know how horrible many of 2001's rabid fans can be. I know for sure that it is not certain you'll enjoy 2001 - but I urge you to give it a chance. It is the ultimate acquired taste, and in my opinion, a masterpiece of epic proportions.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
304,Ibuk,2001 A space odyssey-Possibly the greatest Sci-fi movie ever made,10,1 June 2008,"I must admit the first time I viewed 2001|:A space odyssey I was unimpressed. Months later I was browsing through my local videostore and the DVD of 2001:A space odyssey caught my eye and decided I should give it another go. I am very glad I did because the second time around I loved it and have loved it since. The ape sequence at the beginning I think means that at first the apes couldn't defend themselves against rival apes and other animals but when they realise what they can do with the bones of a dead animal they can finally defend themselves. In the first twenty minutes there is hardly a word spoken instead we are treated to one of the best musical scores ever. The story itself is pretty complex but that is the beauty of 2001: A space odyssey. The last half hour is a visual feast of the highest order. 2001 is a movie that has divided most people,some people love it,some people hate it but I for one absolutely love 2001. 2001 is a remarkable piece of cinema and I would call it one of Stanly Kubrick's best after A Clockwork Orange.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Although I never really understood the ending, and maybe I wasn't meant to, but 2 hours of my life had just had a profound affect of the rest of it.I think that this was the moment that I realised there was real skill and art in film making and by using silences, music and camera angles in the right quantity at the right time can create all the atmosphere you need.I have since seen this film countless times and it still enthrals me as it more of an event than a film.  A realisation of human existence and our relationship to technology.  The special effects are still unbelievable and how they did some of the zero gravity' sequences I still don't know.  The realism of space is wonderfully realised with the movement of the craft and the silence of space (take note every sci-fi film/series).It's incredible that when you watch the poorly made 2010, how dated that looks with the poor computer effects, yet when you watch 2001 it still looks accurate and believable.Film making at it's best 10/10, certainly a classic.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I'm not really sure why, because people close to me kept saying it's a great film and that I should watch it right away.And so I finally watched it yesterday.The movie is confusing, to say the least. The first 3 minutes are completely dark, with a strange sound that reappears throughout the movie.We then switch to a prehistoric planet, where apes and other animals are the (so it seems) only inhabitants. We see how they slowly, yet surely become smarter and learn some primitive techniques. Ironic enough, the scene ends when an ape kills another one using a bone. I guess the movie wants to tell us that violence is bad? But it is a sad and painful aspect of the (future) human race...The next story is about a research center (of some sorts) in outer space where a computer, called HAL, operates the whole mission. The research center is going towards Jupiter. The reason is explained in the movie, but it slips my mind as I am writing this. At some point, the computer malfunctions and things go bad.The final, and most confusing, story is basically a journey into the unknown. You could say that the 'odyssey' part of the movie applies to this last bit. For almost 15 minutes we, the viewers, are exposed to a colorful collection of lights, beams and shapes. At the end of it all, we see one man age in a single, isolated room. In the end, he returns as a fetus, as we see him float above the Earth.The black monolith, symbolizing evolution (I think), appears in all of these stories. There's probably a deep, philosophical explanation to it all, but I didn't get most of it.I'm sure this movie is an icon of it's time and yes, it is sometimes well-written and cleverly put together. However, my biggest complaint is that I wouldn't really call this a movie. Now that's not a bad thing, mind you.2001: a space odyssey is more like a string or chain of events. It's not really a movie as in having a plot, cast and connected scenes. It's a movie that really is unique to anything I have ever seen.I can understand the high rating, but I wouldn't give it an 8 or higher. I give this movie 6 out of 10 stars, only judged by a movie's point of view.If I would judge this movie as something else, it would get a higher rating. It certainly is a creative piece of art.

313,ScottAmundsen,Typical Bloated Kubrick Nonsense About Absolutely Nothing,1,11 May 2010,"I really detest Stanley Kubrick. This so-called ""great"" director made exactly three good movies in his entire career: LOLITA, DR STRANGELOVE, and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The first one was pretty conventional Hollywood fare, the second a brilliant, jet-black comedy about the Cold War that hit every nail right on the head, and the third a brilliant but extremely unpleasant film adapted, I am told faithfully, from Anthony Burgess's dystopian novel.That's all she wrote, folks. Three good movies and he's a great director.Who decides these things, anyway? He made a mishmash out of Stephen King's brilliant novel THE SHINING in 1980, so obsessed with his own cleverness and ""vision"" that he simply ripped the guts out of King's work and replaced it with basically a lot of stunning visuals signifying nothing.Which brings us to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. I remember reading somewhere that back in its day it was the fashionable thing to watch this movie stoned.I can see why. There's a plot here somewhere, but I can't find it. All I see are a bunch of disjointed scenes, all of which are either beautiful or at least interesting to look at, but which tell you nothing.Keir Dullea, a talented actor who was cruelly misused by Hollywood, appears stoned himself for much of the proceedings (perhaps he was, it WAS 1968 after all). In fact, at the end of the day, the best performance in the entire cast was given by Douglas Rain as the voice of the maniacal HAL9000 computer.And as usual with Kubrick, the thing is interminable; at nearly two and a half hours, it screams for a pair of scissors, or perhaps a machete.Are people so afraid of appearing dumb that if they find a movie incomprehensible they automatically assume it must be a work of genius? I don't know. What I do know is that Stanley Kubrick was a director who spent most of his career creating wonderful visuals. But that is it. Most of his films are all style and no substance.

1) A computer that goes nuts and tries to kill a couple of guys in outer space, or
2) I haven't the slightest idea, dude! Neither of these answers is complete enough to inform anybody on why they
A) Must see this mold shattering film, or
B) Should absolutely see it on a GIANT movie screen, projected in orig. 70 mm.What molds does it shatter, you ask? Well, movies are usually plot-driven or character-driven. That is, they are about the things that happen to characters during the time period covered by the movie, and/or they are more about the thoughts, feelings, and relationships among those characters themselves.This movie, is both of those types AND NEITHER OF THEM, AT THE SAME TIME. By that, I mean the ""time period covered by the movie"" is the whole of humans' existence in the universe, including our past, present, and far-future evolution as a species. And the movie ""characters themselves"" aren't just a bunch of apes at the beginning; a group of scientists on the moon toward the middle; the two intrepid astronauts with the AI, HAL 9000, toward the end; or ""The Star Child"" in the last shot. The movie's set of characters is every human being (or precursor species) who has ever evolved in history. That's a lot of ground to be covered in 2.5 hours of one movie!The movie also features one of the best ""McGuffins"" in film history: a matte black, monolithic obelisk that seemingly leaps across time into all the different epochs featured in the movie. It's largely colorless, odorless, and featureless (though its dimensions seem quite close to the ""Golden Ratio""). It does seem to have a unique capability to create things (incl. a high-pitched tone that can't be sonically transmitted through space without any atmosphere!) within the observers' minds. And the movie also features the most epic film cut/edit in cinematic history (you know the one that I mean, or if the movie is brand new to you, you'll know soon).So, again, what is this unusual movie all about? It's not about who or what is responsible for the mysterious monolith; it's not about comparing & contrasting rich, empathetic human intelligence and coldly logical, amoral artificial intelligence; and it's not about how ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable by humans from magic!"" It's about all those things, or alternatively maybe none of them. So just have some wine, sit back, and YOU be the judge of all the things it is or may be about. That's the whole point, isn't it?",2001 - A Space Odyssey

321,Kubris,Expand your horizons,10,24 April 2012,"IMDb Top 250: 88I don't think it would be fair to 2001: A Space Odyssey to write down my thoughts before formulating a review as I usually do. 2001 is such an expressive film that to do anything but just let the words come out would go against its existence. Evolution is the plot of A Space Odyssey. Told in distinct movements, we first see the moment when ape turned into man. Jump to space exploration, where we aren't quite yet: and finally, the future, well outside our hand or mind's grasp. Only one of these movements has a true ""plot"", and I'm sure you know what it is. 2001 is slow. Ice melting slow. Dialogue is sparse, action almost non- existent. Only when each segment is done can you begin to understand it, and only after the final conclusion, if you can call it that, can one even begin to try and piece together the meaning. But that is the ultimate reward: a truly thought provoking film, one of the greatest of all time, one of the most influential pieces of culture and one of the most notable contributions of film.Visually there will never be another film like this. Everything is real, or at least not computer generated. But everything looks so convincing. The ships in space, the planets reflecting light, the sun, the ape people, the magnificent space station sets- I have no clue how this film was made. I can't even begin to guess.But 'awe inspiring' is certainly a characteristic of this extraordinarily futuristic space epic.But 2001 isn't content to just be a feast for the eyes, it's also a unique treat for the ears. Music is exclusively classical, led by the iconic Also Sprach Zarathustra. Dialogue is minimal, as well as sound effects: there's no sound in space (the scientific accuracy is remarkable). The film is bookended by 25 minutes of dialogue free enlightenment.The acting is not legendary, but is exactly what it needs to be: a medium for a directors vision. Of course there's HAL, a prime example of the dangers of dependency and legendary villain. Anyone who likes Portal knows where the influence is from. But Kubrick is the true star: some films are great no matter who runs them, but 2001 is entirely Stanley's project and fittingly his (arguably) crowning achievement. What does it all mean? I don't know. I won't pretend to know its true intent. I don't think it has one. It all depends on what you believe. What I got out of it is that we are in a race with ourselves to find our role in the universe, and with the uncertainty of alien life we can't be sure where the finish line is. Also, care must be taken with machines or anything else we don't understand. It's also an examination of our species thus far, as well as an educated and psychedelic look into our future. Little things will come up, and I've already used 2001 as a basis for certain beliefs I hold that are totally irrelevant to the film. You will think something different, but the fact that so much thought can come from 2 and a half hours of fiction is astounding.One of the great uses of film as a medium, in every sense. 9.5/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
322,Ghenghy,Only the most pretentious art house junkies need apply,4,28 June 2002,"Ah, the sweet irony of a vast ""Savannah"" of pseudo-intellectuals in worshipful praise of a film with Darwinism as a central theme! And after watching this thing, painfully, for the third time the only imagery I'm left with is a bunch of baboons sitting at a keyboard with pipe smoke swirling overhead ranting on about the stunning grandeur of it all. Please. You want to be one of the sheep, or a shepherd? If evolution exists then one can naturally conclude that part of the process is the ability to think for oneself. Apparently that's not the case. If you want real entertainment, pour yourself a drink and take an hour or so to read through the reviews posted on this site. But keep an ""open mind"" OK? I guarantee you more entertainment value than you will find by sitting through this borefest. 2001 is an example of technological craftsmanship and that's about it, other than a monument to a director's out of control self-indulgence.
But I have an idea of how we can add some entertainment spice to this film-let's make it interactive...sort of like Rocky Horror. We can do a ""shirts and skins"" thing, and pass out Mastodon femurs to all the patrons, pro and con, then sponsor a free-for-all about halfway through the movie with the winners deciding whether it's worth sitting through the balance of this ""masterpiece."" I'm betting that all we ""troglodytes"" that despise this movie will win that battle everytime, no matter how greatly outnumbered. Now there's a statement about ""evolution"" that you can sink your teeth into.
OK, now that the brawl is over let's look at Kubrick himself and what his true vision for 2001 may have been. If you consider the balance of his most successful work they all have insanity or some sort of personal haunting dementia as it's primary theme...the insanity of war, destructive obsessiveness, etc. And if you apply this thought process, or ""vision"", to 2001 then the natural conclusion one might arrive at is this.....it's already interactive, Kubrick designed it that way to inspire the natural selection process in his audience thereby segregating us into two classes-the one group that will identify with James Mason's ""Lolita"" character as an obsessive,  sexually repressed perverted intellectual, and the other that will no doubt be driven insane after sitting through this overlong snore-a-thon.... thus connecting us all eventually to the quirky genius behind camera. I like Kubrick for the most part and on balance I suppose I can even forgive him for butchering ""The Shining"" but in the final analysis ""2001"" is a dull and lifeless space opera that may fire off a neuron or two but it doesn't pass for entertainment. 5/10 SKINS RULE!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

324,robb_772,Landmark cinema,10,25 May 2006,"With 2001, legendary film director Stanley Kubrick managed to craft a visual tone poem on the screen with little regard for usual film-making conventions like a detailed plot of fully-developed characters. The film is a total visceral experience, and is a motion picture that demands full submission on the part of the viewer. This film will not meet the audience half-way, and it demands that viewers totally shut off their logic and become wrapped up in tone and atmosphere. If a viewer is unwilling or unable to let go of their conscious thoughts in such a manner, then 2001 may prove to be a disappointing and frustrating experience.The storyline, as it is, is about the divisions among man and animal, and it poses the question of what will happen if technology is the next step in the evolutionary ladder of intelligence. The theme of the film is not defined so much in terms of dialogue, however, as much as it is in visual representation and aura. The film is awash with stunning set pieces and visual effects, many of which remain much more effective than the hastily-done, two-dimensional CGI effects of today. No other film has ever made the thought of drifting into orbit look and feel more beautiful than 2001, which makes the danger that emerges in the films final third even more effectively jarring.The film really challenges the viewer in its final minutes when it makes the sudden switch from expertly-crafted space adventure and into the realm of metaphysical spiritual commentary. This maneuver is both very bold and audacious, but it comes together flawlessly as the picture builds to a spin-tingling denouncement. It is the relative scientific accuracy of the bulk of the film that this last great leap into the unknown so disorienting, but this is precisely what leaves the non-analytical viewer grappling with such deep issues and self-reflection. In the end, 2001 is as much a full-fledged experience as it is a film, which something that all great art strives to achieve.Incredibly, given it's nearly art house pedigree, 2001 proved to be a major success with mainstream film audiences. The year of 1968 was a competitive year in Hollywood with ROSEMARY'S BABY (1968), BULLITT (1968), ROMEO AND JUILET (1968) and another sci-fi blockbuster PLANET OF THE APES (1968) all vying for dominance at the box office. Impressively, 2001 ended up becoming the second-highest grossing film of the year (the smash musical FUNNY GIRL was the year's top grosser, by the way), earning an estimated $56 million in the US alone (a huge sum in the late-sixties). This is at least one example where a complex, intelligent film did not go unnoticed by the mainstream public at the time of its release.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Yes, I do understand that this creates a very unique effect which helps to portray the emotions in a way that just cannot be done any other way and for that, I enjoyed those parts. But for other parts of the movie, I was left not only bored but also utterly confused with what I was watching. For example,Warning, spoilers ahead: the beginning?! Like, what's with the 30 minutes of apes doing in a space movie?! Also, the last 30 minutes, what was I watching? Some kind of hallucinations or weird circle of life thing? If they cut out this 1 hr I'd say that this would have been an 8/10 for me.As for the other portions of the movie, I did find it to be really smart and forward thinking for its time. Delving into fears that still pervades in our time, it really shows how ahead of its time this movie was. Also, like I said earlier, the clever use of dragging out some parts, even the use of the monotonous AI voice, all helped to dramatise the movie.All in all, whilst there was much that I did not enjoy in this movie, the good parts more than made up for it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I have been waiting years to watch this film, but there was always something more interesting + I was scared that it may bore me, knowing it is rather slow. I have recently watched Interstellar (2014) and it was one of the best films I have ever seen. I really don't think I will like "" 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) "" just as much, but who knows!? I loved Stanley Kubrick's "" A Clockwork Orange (1971) "", so I hope it will be at least as good.

It really makes you wonder all the time, how on Earth did they manage to pull this off! 1h 27minutes – it starts getting interesting, creepy and scary.

It's just nice visuals 2h 18minutes – just WTF I think I know where did David Lynch get his ideas fromWhat a disappointment!!! This film could be so much more, something so amazing but Stanley Kubrick has decided to go in a totally WEIRD direction with it The most shocking thing is that, it lacks nice and interesting story (it's kind of ironic because 47-years old special effects were incredible!

328,Blade_Le_Flambeur,"a movie that is quite odd, but profound in nature",9,23 February 2003,"There is no doubt this movie is strange, perhaps scary at times. Using subtle visual techniques Kubrick employs amazing visuals on the viewer and brilliant sound. Its hard to figure out what is going on, the first 30 minutes of the movie takes place ""In the Dawn of Man"" then it skips to the present (or future in this case). The acting is interesting, solid material from everyone it focuses on, also HAL 9000s voice, ""it can only be attributable to human error."" This movie also gets creepy in certain scenes, and some scenes don't make sense. Its a beautiful looking science- fiction movie, but I found it lacking in some departments. It also got too weird occasionally. Because of these problems I'm not giving this a very, very high rating as I would for Full Metal Jacket and Dr. Strangelove. 9/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
329,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Lost in middle-of-the-fence outer space,7,26 February 2013,"I watched 2001 expecting to be engrossed from start to finish, absorbed in the plot and visuals, but I wasn't.I made a mental note of how many times I slightly nodded off during the film, a total of eight, the biggest one at the end where I had to rewind to the journey sequence to Jupiter, which I fast forwarded again until I got some proper visuals of Bowman getting old.But for all the negative points above, I did enjoy the film.I'm therefore going to attempt to address some points that I haven't seen mentioned in the fifty or sixty reviews on IMDb I've already read.Firstly the positive.At first I thought the apes looked a little too much like men in costumes, until I realised they were supposed to look like that, especially at the end of this section when the aggressor apes become different in stature, more upright and visibly stronger and able to manipulate objects. The apes were vulnerable, and that was nice too.There's a section where the scientist calls his daughter on the advanced intercom device to wish her happy birthday and apologise for not being there, probably included by Kubrick to wow us back in 1968 as to what future intercom technology would be like, but it was a nice scene nonetheless, especially the distracted but still attentive nature of the little girl. I also appreciated the way $1.70 was charged for the call, pretty much like pre-paid credit in the modern age.The interior designs of the spaceships were really impressive and beautiful, although the chairs in the Hilton were bizarre. The curved aspects of the walkways, reflecting the round outer design of the spaceships seen from space was a nice touch too, with the interior design, snappy male suits and beautiful air-hostesses with weird hats, a real treat. While eating spacefood slop, each astronaut watched the news on his 1968 iPad equivalent, for example.HAL 9000 was the best part of the movie for me, especially his voice and calm rationale. Fixed camera settings on the red eye, the outline of his computer casing on the panel, in between eight or so flat screens. If you've seen 'Moon' with Sam Rockwell and the computer voice played by Kevin Spacey, you'll get extra joy from the deadpan HAL. The use of display panels in general was a real surprise too, sometimes simplified with a background colour and a single, abstract word.As to the negative.The HAL and character development part of the film was not enough. What should have been a dialogue between crew members concerning gradual suspicion about the motives of HAL turned into a simple ""let's switch him off because he made a single improper diagnosis"". HAL reacts to the threat of being switched off by eliminating the crew instead, which is fair enough from a computer's point of view, resulting in a single survivor eventually getting the upper hand and managing to achieve the desired disconnect sequence himself. I really loved the pleading by Bowman, asking HAL to let him back on board, followed, in contrast, by the pleading of HAL not to be switched off once the tables had turned.The space travel sequences were dull though. The outer space visual effects are praised by even the biggest critics of this film, but there is no real sense of perspective when spacecraft move across the screen, often feeling like cheap camera panning tricks used back in 1968. The visual effects in Star Wars just ten years later are better than this, in my opinion.The music was too much, going on and on and on, overly loud, repeating the Blue Danube at an extremely intruding level.Everything was just too drawn out and long in between scenes, obviously for the sake of art. I recently watched 'The Tree of Life' with Brad Pitt and really liked it, but funnily enough, the abstract scenes bored me in this film.For all that, I'm pretty on the fence overall. I like parts of it, dislike others. If Kubrick had concentrated on the plot and character development, for me this film would have been much better and less soporific. The parts of the film that were based around characters and interior design were terrific, but the space scenes were mostly uninteresting. And that's the surprise. I expected the opposite - terrific space visuals and a pretty boring story, instead of a pretty dull space movie with invigorating characters and brilliant interior design.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I wasn't surprised a bit, since I knew I understood it, and I knew that it was movie making at it's purest form. Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director and this movie is one of the main reasons. Because, let's face it, there isn't a film that's quite like 2001. Not in the sci-fi genre or anywhere else. When I sit down to watch this movie, I never try to understand it or take it that serious. I just let it pass. I'll just let it go on, and I see the movie just because the pleasure of it. The pleasure of seeing something that beats everyone else, when it comes to being original.

331,samyaksambuddha,Technological classic with a judicious mix of philosophy,9,14 June 2018,"Now, this comes with a change. The casting, screening and acting is of a different yet interesting tone. This is not an action packed space movie with superflous wars and ships rather an insight into the actual working of the space crew and the issues they face. The movie centres around finding the source of the monolith that is said to be the harbinger of evolution of humankind. Various missions are send to Moon, Jupiter for understanding the genesis but all turns out futile.
In the detailing part the movie shows the way the voyages work and the practical ways of working and problems faced by the crew members yet subordinated for the media sake. The movie turns upside down when the conflict arises with the 6th member (the supercomputer) which is at the brain of the ship. The conflict leads to victimization of the crew members with one of the them (Bowman) struggling against the AI. He finds a way into the ship somehow to deactivate the computer. 
The movie has many philosophical dimensions probably aimed at explaining the limited resources and intelligence of the human in understanding the deep secrets of the universe. It is likely that the movie outlines the depth of formation of universe and that man is still small whatever small accomplishments it may have made. At the same time unreliability of the AI is also signaled.

333,blazesnakes9,One of the greatest science-fiction movies of all time,10,10 November 2013,"Stanley Kubrick is a movie director that can do no wrong. His vision is far more strange and thought-provoking than any other director on this planet. When he died in 1999, the world was saddened by the news of his death. But, his films didn't died, either. He left behind some of his best work to all to see. In my opinion, he left behind a lot of questions with one particular movie that really stands out as being one of the best science-fiction movies of all time. The name of the movie is 2001: A Space Odyssey, and even after 45 years, it still holds up. The movie takes place in the futuristic year of 2001, where a space crew investigates a unknown monolith that is excavated out of the Moon. The scientists don't know who put the monolith there, or how it ended up on the Moon. But, there's more to the story than investigation. Another monolith appears during the Dawn of Man sequence, where humans in the beginning of civilization were primitive apes. Meanwhile, the space crew's computer, HAL 9000, get involves in the mission and determines to find out the answer. One of the scientists on board questions about the technology of the HAL 9000 computer. What the space crew doesn't know is that HAL 9000 has a mind of his own. He is also very deadly when discovering about the unknown monolith, and even jeopardizes the astronauts onboard. He eventually kills some of them and even locks out Dr. Dave Bowman in his pod. Dave soon gets into the spaceship and deactivate HAL 9000 and then goes a mind-trip through the star-gate. One of the greatest achievements in 2001 is the mind-blowing special effects that the movie possess. A lot of science-fiction movies are jam-packed with wall-to-wall special effects, making the story harder to follow. In 2001, those special effects don't get in the way. Instead, the special effects makes us look in awe. It's the inspiration that the movie makes for us. Kubrick's vision of the future is far from being made in 1968, but there are other elements that 2001 have that makes more unique. The relationship between HAL 9000 and Dave Bowman is significant mainly because, Kubrick sets up the relationship that can take an a effect on a human being. HAL 9000 is a computer that likes to meddle with people. He is complicated in his own ways of destruction and murder. In other words, HAL 9000 can't function accordingly. It's that story that make us think about the relationship between man and machine. The monoliths also serves a significant role as well. In my own perspective of watching 2001, I think that the monoliths serves as a part of life. The Dawn of Man sequence in 2001 and the ending are crucial points to the movie. In the beginning, man is ape in a world that is inhabited by other members that make up civilization. By the end, Bowman is near death, but he is reincarnated through the monolith that is placed in his bedroom. It follows the phrase, ""What comes around, goes around."" Kubrick's direction is also very descriptive and never fails to mislead us. He uses long shots of people inside the space station. He puts us in Bowman's perspective when he is traveling through the star-gate. If I had to say something about the star-gate sequence, I would say that the questions relies on the mysteries of science and technology itself. The point is, there may be another dimension outside outer space, one that is never been seen before. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a great movie. Not only great, but magnificent in its own way. The music sets up the movie as a space opera and moves very steady on the details and visual effects. In the past years, 2001: A Space Odyssey has been criticized as being the greatest science-fiction movies of all time. I can't agree more. It is also one of my favorites. It belongs on my top 10 favorite movies list and it fully deserves to be placed there. A feast for the eyes, ears and mind for all to see and hear, and also for all generations of movie directors. Kubrick should be proud. ★★★★ 4 stars.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
334,Don-102,Tribute to one of the top 5 filmmakers of our time...,10,7 March 1999,"I write this review just after hearing of Stanley Kubrick's death. It's a great loss, and I write about 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because I feel it is the consummate Kubrick film, the one he will be most remembered for. It is a picture like no other, not only revolutionizing science fiction, but changing the way films are conceptualized. It was probably America's first 'art' film and has inspired the likes of George Lucas and countless other writers and directors.Aside from its visual greatness, the reason the film spawns so much discussion and analysis is because so many people have so many different interpretations of it. Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, his co-writer, had a vision, but we have never really found out what was going through their minds. Of course, the skinny on its 'message' is how technology of the future will take over humanity and decide the course of our lives unless we are careful. 2001's ending is one of hope, a version of our rebirth through the star-child's flight back to earth. It is meaningless to many, but discerning filmgoers will understand.Although 2001 does not have the wicked, dark humor of DR. STRANGELOVE or CLOCKWORK ORANGE, or contain strong, eccentric characters that filled his earlier works like PATHS OF GLORY or SPARTACUS, I still feel he would've liked to be remembered most for this. If anything, HAL will be his most memorable character, dangerous, murderous, and artificial. It was a half-decade in the making at a time when Hollywood was still churning out dull musicals and just waking up to the New Wave of French and Italian cinema. Kubrick was a maverick director who made great films on his own terms, his own time, and for everyone else to marvel at. He will be missed.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I saw this movie in the theater for its 20yr anniversary, the film had been restored, the sound was modernized (for 1988) and 20min of footage was added back. Before that I had only seen it on PBS.If you have not seen this movie, understand that Kubrick does not follow the same movie formula. Along with his wonderful use of lighting, camera positioning, colors and script modifications; Kubrick will also test your time patience and your tolerance for understanding.So for those of you who have not seen this movie, rent the 148min version, watch it on a big beautiful TV and keep the remote handy. There will be portions where you will want to fast forward scenes at 2x or 4x. There is also a thing called a Intermission (for you youngsters this is for back in the day when the reels of film only fit a certain amount of time so they used 2 reels). You can use this time to make a sandwich or go the restroom. Here is a tidbit...Kubrick only has critical scenes when people are in them. Pause and FFWD at will if it keeps you watching, go ahead.The theater had its die hard fans, who knew it was safe to go get popcorn or go to the bathroom at certain points. And it had some people with short-modern-attention spans who left the theater after 1 hour.I loved this movie. In a non religious way, Kubrick shows you the evolution of man with god. And takes a good attempt at what death/afterlife might look like. But bear in mind this movie was made in 1968, so for its time these special effects were so outstanding you did not mind watching them for 10 or 20 extra minutes.No it is not perfect, I wish some scenes were shorter, I wish there was more explanation about the moon monolith and I wish some scenes moved faster. But like any masterworks...you must accept the artist work as a whole, in other words take the good with the bad.Worth Renting...if you like it...then Buy it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
336,stefankrs,Great Artistic Film,9,20 September 2021,This movie is just so amazing. The effects are amazing such as space ships and the psychedellic scenes. The movie is just beautiful throughout the whole runtime with an amazing soundtrack to go along with it. There is almost no action and it is a very slow movie but it is not boring a single bit. The movie has an interesting and mysterious story that keeps you entertained along with the cinematography. The movie is very unique and there is no other film like it. 10/10 masterpiece.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
337,mbhgkmsgg,Spectacular,10,5 November 2020,"There is nothing like it and there probably never will be. Watching 2001: A Space Odyssey makes it difficult to determine whether Kubrick is mad or a genius. Perhaps he's both. Nothing is obvious in this film, yet it feels easy to understand.The fact that there is a Wikipedia page for interpretations of this film speaks volumes about the reactions that people have had to it. Do I understand what all of it means? No, absolutely not, and I probably never will. But that's the beauty of it. We can all find our own meaning in it. Even if it's a completely different one.
I think that the film discusses both our ingenuity and lack of it as a species. If it weren't for the monolith, perhaps we would still be apes? If it weren't for the monolith on the moon, perhaps that's as far as we ever would've travelled. As such, although the human race is special in many ways, it also needs help and it needs to be pushed.Since there is absolutely nothing that hasn't already been said about this film, I'll just mention some of the things that struck me the most.
First, the way that this film looks. It is quite remarkable how incredible this movie looks even now in 2020. It could've been filmed this year and I wouldn't have known the difference if it weren't for the obviously outdated machines.
Second, the way it's filmed. Some scenes are excruciatingly slow. Yet therein lies their beauty. You have so much time to just take it all in that it ends up becoming quite overwhelming. Newer movies guide you from start to finish. Whereas Kubrick allows you to watch whatever you want without having to fear missing something.
Third, those scenes with nothing but Dr Bowman's breath as the audio. It created a sense of claustrophobia. I felt like I was inside the helmet and I'm not sure that I wanted to be there. Add the fact that there was no music and you have quite an eery atmosphere.The quote that I selected at the beginning, describes this movie in a weird way. Isn't that exactly what the monoliths are trying to do? To get us to be at our fullest possible use. That's at least how I saw and felt it. Then again, I don't think that there is a clear explanation for this movie, at least not one as simple as that.
As I said, this movie is either mad or genius. In all likelihood, it's probably both. I'm not sure that I will ever truly understand 2001: A Space Odyssey, but then again, that's what makes it so special.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
338,jmvscotland,"I agree. After all these years, it's aged very badly",6,10 March 2016,"I can't give, and don't want to, give this movie less than a 6/10 rating. There is much in it to be enjoyed and admired. I am old enough to remember the original cinema release in 1967 but I probably didn't first see it in the early 70s.It had a huge cult following even then and it was absolutely ground- breaking at the time; special effects were State of the Art and it's interesting even now to see the obvious product placement - PANAM (no-one envisaged Lockerbie and the end of PANAM did they), Howard Johnson's, Hilton etc.But, things in the movie industry have changed a very great deal since this movie was made. Special effects are not everything even these days; we're often served up dross with little but special effects.What I'm really trying to say here is that, like millions and millions of others, I enjoyed this movie at around the time it was released. Now, I'm afraid, it leaves me a bit cold. It looks awfully dated with special effects that are really not special any more, awfully long, pointless and boring periods of blank screen and no sound, tracking shots of spacecraft, apes that are a bit of a hairy joke and a sometimes annoying and over-done musical score. Zus Sprach Zarathustra was a great piece at the time the movie was made but how many times do we need to hear it in one movie? The same goes for the seemingly endlessly repeated Strauss.No, it is a good movie, but it's no longer the great movie that it once was. Perhaps that is the tragedy for film-makers. Their once truly heroic performances lose a great deal of their color and vitality with the passage of time. And, regrettably, that's where 2001 sits these days. The truly great movies can and do stand the test of time. I'm think here of the likes of Butch Cassidy, The Sting, 12 Angry Men, To Kill a Mockingbird, Alien (just the original one made not long after 2001 but a much better movie) and even Kubrick's true masterwork The Shining. You know what I'm saying.JMV",2001 - A Space Odyssey
339,stumpmee77,The movie's monkeys were scratching their heads for ticks and fleas while I was scratching my head saying:,4,14 February 2005,"WHAT? Huh? What? Dawn of Man Crap--I don't come from monkeys who were men in suits by the way--Look how one touches the monolith--it's a dead giveaway. Approximinately twenty minutes of meaningless chimp crap which includes see monkey learn about killing something and ooh ooh freaked out simian excitement over black slab. One of the awesome moments in the early part of this film is the switch over to the future and then we're back in snooze-ville. Ship taxi-es in, music--Sit upright during this portion folks otherwise you'll be put to sleep. Thanks to the chimps and the ships and the murmured babble about another slab--ooh a breath of a plot at last--With all this bogging down the pacing, It's well into an hour before the film reaches the best, and sad to say, shortest segment. Bowman, Poole and HAL, who after Star Trek the Next Generation's Mr. Data's got to be the sexiest voice of anyone pretending to be a mechanized being in the history of movies. HAL's also the most heinous of them all and due to his actions the film's most chilling moments take place. Then and only then Kubrick whips up the pace while and injects horror film imagery and incidents via creepy HAL.""Beyond the infinite"" is the right title for the last segment. It's a real--belief suspender. I figured this out after watching this film a second time (I was a teen the first and did not past the rotating space station before giving up) There's only one way to get through the probe into the slab--Imagine you're getting into a car for a leisurely HALF HOUR(or so it felt to me; actually I think the running time is about 7 minutes) drive. Then after Bowman parks, dumping me into--Huh what's with sanitized hotel room? What's with the big Cute baby. Movie over. What was all that about? Visually a knockout, the plot, a tick picked out and tossed away by a chimp. I see some of the elements from Kubrick's later (and IMO) greater work, ""The Shining""--vast scenery and atmospheric lighting and effective use of classical music but that's all 2001 is. It just exists and does nothingzzzzzzz....",2001 - A Space Odyssey
340,BB-15,Sci-Fi work of art,10,17 January 1999,"2001 is a science fiction film that does not fit into the usual sci-fi mold with predictable plots and aliens that either look human or are monsters. It begins with beauty and mystery. Kubrick's film is one of the most scientifically accurate sci-fi films I have seen. Space travel in the vacuum of space is always silent and going somewhere takes time, for instance it takes months to reach a planet.Kubrick's 2001 takes this approach and uses it to present huge themes; human evolution and contact with alien super intelligence, conflict between humans and computers. Almost all sci-fi films present human and space alien encounters as routine. Kubrick presents such contact as so strange that it is beyond our human comprehension. He puts you in several scenes with no explanation as an observer experiencing incredible events. You are left with questions. What is the monolith, the light show and the star child at the end of the film? There are answers but you have to search for them (such as by reading Arthur C. Clarke's ""2001"").Like all great films, Kubrick's suggests further questions; can alien intelligence reach the level of God? Will we destroy ourselves unless an alien intelligence helps us?2001 makes excellent use of symbolism. The movie's main musical theme is from Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"". This is also the title of Nietzsche's poem about the emergence of the superman; the star child? or the monolith?. The bone rising from the violent ape-human becomes an orbiting nuclear weapon. Distrust and paranoia slowly builds between the U.S and Russians finally climaxing with the computer HAL.On top of all this the film's look is stunning. After 30 years it's sets and special effects are still up to today's standards. 2001 is one of the few films that can be called a great work of art.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The production quality is surprisingly very high-tech and modern, far more advanced than movies made in the 60s. In fact, the production value could pass for today, however there is no way a movie in this day and age would be allowed to run amok with super-long, super-slow scenes if it wants to keep its viewers' attention. Today's audience has no patience for mysterious, soundtrack-laden, no-dialogue scenes, and instead expects tightly-edited narratives that they can engage with. That is not this movie, hence, in 2021 this rates as a 6.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Absolutely brilliant on all counts. The history of man is traced from the dawn of time, to the space age, and to where?. Even the best of them pale when compared to this masterpiece. Like a work of art by Da Vinci or Michaelangelo, it just gets better with age and will stand the test of time. And, yes. When I first saw it way back in '68, I absolutely hated it. Approaching it with an open mind , I was totally blown away by it when I saw it from a new point of view in 1981. It has become one of my favorites and I watch it religiously twice a year. I can't possibly add anything new to the reviews, but believe all the good ones that you read.

343,Equalizer16,Open the pod bay doors Hal and enter an astonishing experience.,10,18 October 2016,"Stanley Kubrick's mesmerising masterpiece goes into the deep reaches of the universe., and becomes an ambiguous crusade through the nature of humanity. Before Star Wars, there was 2001, before J.A.R.V.I.S, there was HAL 9000, and before Ridley Scott and Christopher Nolan there was Stanley Kubrick. A combination of Spielberg's AI, Nolan's Interstellar, with a bit of Terrence Malik's The Tree of Life, 2001 reigns high as one of the most influential innovative and stunning science fiction movies of all time.When the Discovery One makes its exploration to Jupitar Space, the shuttle super computer HAL 9000 takes control of the mission himself (or itself), while Kubrick takes us on an revolutionary journey from the origins of man to beyond the Universe, as we witness Kubrick's vision of the development and evolution human existence.An outstanding cinematic masterpiece that reveals true originality at its heart, with an experience to remember that leaves you in a shocking and mind-blowing condition. Victims to listening to one of the most epic dramatic scores of all time by Alex North, we awaken into the dark mystical ruling space. Our journey is magnificently shot through the beauty and artistry of Geoffrey Unsworth, really drawing us into the stars and beyond. But also the masterful perfectly executed editing by Ray Lovejoy that professionally shows us how we jump from the dawn of time to the futuristic world of space travel.What Kubrick wonderfully uses to itch our minds with, is the creativity and complexity put forward into the several mysterious objects that wonder the universe. For example the startling simplicity but so complicated appearance of the Black Monolith, and the stone cold terrorising voice of Douglas Rain capturing the essence of the intelligent and apprehensive entity of HAL 9000.What faithfully won the Academy Award for best visual effects in 1969, shows off the strength of technology at the end of 60s. Though it is limited and dated compared to today's capabilities, you can't help but become engulfed through visual poetry. From the God like aerial shot of the humble earth, the atmospheric landings and movement of the cosmic space ships, to the breath-taking sequence of the star gate, 2001 is a pure alive artwork.2001 A Space Odyssey is a landmark event in film history and sits consistently on one of the thrones of science fiction. A triumphant masterpiece seeping into unknown realms of not just space, but also film history. A odyssey indeed into the extraordinary 10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
344,hoxjennifer,Painfully Slow,6,1 June 2014,"Now, before I get bashed for not being appreciative of classic cinematography and old movies - let me make this disclaimer clear: I've watched and enjoyed old, classic films right down to silent films and those were more stimulating than 2001. Films from the 60's that I've enjoyed include Lawrence of Arabia. I am also not unfamiliar with Stanley Kubrick's works, ex: A Clockwork Orange.But this... this was way too slow for me. I feel like most of the movie is watching some spacecraft or other slowly float through space to the tune of a slowed-down version of the Blue Danube Waltz. I fell asleep twice trying to watch the movie from start to finish and the third time I only managed to get through the whole thing by watching it in bits and pieces. The parts where there are dialogue and action were interesting, but if you take out all the long segues, the movie would probably only be half an hour. And then by the end of it all, I felt like I just got out of a massive LSD trip (Yay 60's cinema!)Don't get me wrong - the film is packed with symbolism... and even though the film is about the future, there are a lot of historical, philosophical and visual quirks that make it very open to interpretation. On first viewing, I personally picked up allusions to the Cold War, and I see this film as kind of a historical representation of the race-to-space feeling of the 60's. I'm personally interested in reading the novel so I can get more out of it. But the movie itself... This is one of those films that has the potential for watching multiple times and getting something different from it every time, but alas... it's just such an effort to watch that I don't think I could do it. Just being honest.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
345,parameswaranrajendran,Before Spielberg there was Stanley,7,24 February 2018,This film is proving that Stanley Kubrick has already bring the Hollywood on largest par based on the technology. I just wandering how he can erect this high tech sets in 1968 itself. Before Spielberg there was Stanley. Otherwise the screenplay is very dull and the first dialogue itself is only after 25th minute of the film. I watched this film by using headset and some of the sound portion gives me headache.

347,IamROCKAS,lethargic but also engaging,5,23 April 2021,"Created during the space race and only a year before the first successful conducted mission to land on the moon, 2001: A Space Odyssey takes us back in time when space exploration was the new big thing and also makes us reflect on the present. Separated into three sequences, the movie SLOWLY gives us a sci-fi experience like no other before, as this was the first sci-fi movie with a big budget, paving the way for other big sci-fi movies of the 20th century.The first sequence, or ""The Dawn of Man"", takes us to prehistoric times. Tuning in to watch a movie about a space odyssey, it was weird coming back to prehistoric times but it was essential for the plot. The opening is as iconic as it can get, as the rumbling sounds just scream ""something epic is coming"" and the explosive orchestra during the reveal is known way outside of this movie. Even though I was put into a great mood after that, it didn't take long for me to get tired of this sequence and the monkey noises got irritating quick, as this sequence is lethargic in the way it is slow and disengaging. Stanley Kubrick is a visionary and he's known for making harsh decisions to fulfill his ambitions to the slightest detail, going as far as having 127 takes of the same scene in some of his media but he also has a reputation for being responsible for some of the most painfully slow cinema out there. There's a line between artistic extravagance and just being plain unwatchable and I felt like I wanted to continue less when going deeper into this sequence.The middle sequence, or ""The Exploration"", takes us to 2001 (I guess?), which was the future back when the movie was released. It also gave our first set of dialogue, as the first dialogue didn't have a single line. We can see more glimpses of Stanley Kubrick's genius here, as he displayed stuff like iPad's, video calls, and other sets of equipment and technology we can't imagine our lives without today. The action does pick up a bit too but after the first sequence, I felt a bit disinterested and even started snoozing a bit. During the first quarter or even a half of this sequence, I had to rewind a few times just to make sure I didn't miss anything vital since I was dozing off in the middle of the day. Though the action is so slow, it's hard to miss anything and I've just stopped doing that after the first few times. We also get to meet the infamous HAL 9000, who was voiced by Douglas Rain. Even though HAL 9000 didn't have a physical body, there's no doubt it's the main character in the movie. The voice of Douglas is a bit unusual but it's perfect for this role. The other thing that fascinated me in this sequence is the way it was shot, as there was no usage of computer-generated graphics. It was all camera angles and physical stunts with various techniques that made the zero-gravity environment look convincing. And even though I'm impressed by everything that was done so far, I still can't grasp the slow nature of this film. Some shots are completely silent and there are shot that drag on for a long time. It's kind of a weird juxtaposition that's being formed here as the film displays one of the most iconic soundtracks ever while being completely silent for a good chunk, if not the majority, of its almost 150-minute run.The ending sequence, or ""The Surreal Nightmare"", takes us to the destination of our protagonists. Honestly, this was my favorite sequence, though I wasn't dozing as much as after the first sequence and was more focused again, so it was easier for me to follow the progression. The almost surreal visuals with a weird action were something that actually made me engaged, which is unusual. We went wordless again, as not a single line was said in this sequence, therefore leaving the second sequence as the only one with dialogue. I almost felt like ""It's time to talk"" might be said at one point, just like in the one silent episode (well not silent, but the episode is notably presented without dialogue, apart from its opening, where it's said ""We don't have to talk"" and ending when it's said, ""It's time we talk"". At the beginning of the episode, it's said ""We don't have to talk"") in Season 4 of Mr. Robot. It also made me think of a song by Scroobius Pip, where he talked about a memory of almost drowning as a child. He saw a man sitting just below the surface on a rock whose wisdom-filled gaze withdrew panic and show, he felt like he sat there for hours before words were introduced, just relaxing in a world, below the fights and abuse. With silence being the topic (heh, a beautiful paradox) in this sequence too, I just felt there a lot of room for imagination and it made me connect to some other media that I adored over the years too. Even though I didn't get what went on during this sequence, I feel like the ambiguity actually opened my mind. And this puzzling way is how I chose to say, repeat even, that this sequence was my favorite one in the film.Overall, this film is way too slow for my taste and I wouldn't really call myself a fan of sci-fi either, though I did end up enjoying the original trilogy of Star Wars and the Back to the Future trilogy is really enjoyable too. 2001: A Space Odyssey is engaging and interesting but it also feels really empty. That's just my opinion of the film when in reality it excels in a lot more, hence this movie being wonderful in most people's eyes with a strong following to this day. I actually think it's a film everyone should watch at least once as it's being referenced in different forms to this very day.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
348,Koundinya,It's 2012 and only 12 men have walked on the moon!,10,17 May 2012,"I must confess i couldn't understand the movie the first time i watched it except for the hegemony of one group of monkeys equipped with bones of dead animals over the other. So i decided to read the book written by Arthur C.Clarke and watch the movie again. The movie is far ahead of its time. Arthur C.Clarke envisaged a space mission to Jupiter and settlements on Moon when man hadn't even landed on moon in reality(Neil Armstrong landed a year later). I clearly understood what the story was and was awed by his imagination and foresight. Kubrick has taken the standards of making movies to a new level with exemplary visual effects. And yes, the movie has a wonderful background score filled with energy- the movie starts with 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' and then 'Blue Danube' at beginning of the second scenario; these are the tracks that get 'loop'ed in your mind. The story may not be conveyed by the movie but i suggest those who really loved the film(for other reasons) to read this wonderful book by Arthur C.Clarke.Perhaps i'd lose an argument with a hardcore Star Wars fan over whether this movie is the greatest sci-fi ever made, as AFI rated it, but i loved this movie as much as i loved Star Wars. It might sound like a sacrilege to call 2001:A Space Odyssey a better sci-fi movie than Metropolis but Kubrick's effort to bring the unimaginable (in the near-future even in 2012) to the screen with the highest standards of perfection is laudable.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
349,AleksandrBelenko,Kubrick is overrated,1,30 November 2020,"This is the third film by Kubrick that I have seen. And with each one I got disappointed more and more .
Sure I like OST, not only classic music that has been used but the choir oddball singing and some ambient too. There is great photography from time to time.
BUT
It is slow, unreasonably slow. I have nothing against log shots, slowpaced drama and everything tangential. But here we see how and astronaut works in silence, only his breath is hearable. Do we need to hear his breath? Do we need to watch for half of the movie how the astronauts work, as some documentary?
WELL
The plot with AI rebel is interesting, but so thin-layered... It could be resolved so much faster.
And the opening scene of space missions is good. You see ""picturephone"" all the futuristic ideas, but the imagination stopped right there, no more gadgets or robots or something representing future electronics.
SO
Who would have thought that the best part of the movie is ""The Dawn of Humanity"", or whatever it is called. It has drama, it has action, it has mystery... and well, it is fun to watch. Other 1.5 hours is pretentious pointless time consumption.
P.S.
Indeed, philosophy... yes. Well, I don't get it. What the philosophical message was there. Or at least what question was there, if there is no answer... that's why it just pretentious bs.

350,raphaklopper,"Stanley Kubric's Masterpiece???? Yeah, maybe!",10,4 June 2013,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is the 4th film of the genius Stanley Kubrick that not only manages to be one of his best films but one of the most beautiful masterpieces ever made in the history of cinema.The story is not like a space adventure as the title seems to sound; it is much deeper than that. It all begins when a strange interference is captured within the Lunar surface. Dr. Heywood R. Floyd (William Sylvester) is highlighted to go on a mission along with other scientists to investigate the source of this interference. After reaching their destination they find a strange object, like a giant chocolate bar which seems be the source of the interference. When the scientists touch in the strange object their ears are invaded with a annoying sound. Six months later, a new team of six scientists are deployed to discover what happened to the other team and trace the source of interference that seem to be moving around the Lunar surface. Most of the team this time it is on hibernation while the scientists Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) control the ship with the intelligent-computer HAL 9000 voiced by Douglas Rain. The trip seems to go fine until HAL identifies a problem on the ship and the scientists go investigate, but the two men barely knows the true intentions of HAL to do with the mission and the strange object.This film was a big change that the sci-fi genre begins to take, thanks to Kubrick and his beautiful and brilliant visual effects giving us beautiful scenery of the vast space. But this is not mere sci-fi whatsoever, the mission only serves as basis for the further philosophical ""study"" that Kubrick makes about the evolution of living beings, not just humans. The strange object has to do with all this, but it is also the real mystery of the film. But thanks to the writing of Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, makes everything so simple and beautiful.A true masterpiece of cinema, a classic that changed the sci-fi genre forever, along with a fantastic writing and direction and also the unforgettable and terrifying HAL, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is one of the most beautiful masterpieces that Kubrick had gave to the 7th Art.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

352,joshuafagan-64214,A Singular Achievement,10,13 November 2015,"I'd prefer that you play the theme to the film when you read this review. Look it up on YouTube, if you will. It lends everything a deep, thick layer of gravitas; I think my review is no exception.Here it is, folks. One of those true event movies. A film that makes you remember the place and time when you first saw it. This movies revolutionized cinema in many a way, providing inspiration for the masses. While this is only arguably Kubrick's best film (I have it second), it is certainly his most important. Contemporary critics were stupefied and divisive; to me, that typically means one of two things: either you have a comedy film or dark, dark drama that heavily depends on individual taste; or you have one of the greatest works of cinema ever made, one that people just aren't ready for yet. i am confident when I say that this is part of the latter category.I'm sure that you know some of the famous lines or scenes from the film; the protohumans banging on the mysterious black monolith, the interactions between the computer and Dave, and the trippy sequence near the film's conclusion that ends with the main character turning into a starchild. (By the way, there are actual reports of hippies sneaking into the film just for that last third and tripping, which I find hilarious.) But this film is more than its most memorable parts. I mean, so are most films; but this film is all about the overall atmosphere and tone. There is little dialogue and little human interaction. This film is a cinematic experience; a film closer to Fantasia than The Social Network. The most memorable and personable character is a computer, for crying out loud. If you had any doubt that a good film could be made without any of the traditional elements of a good story, here you go.I am frankly surprised that this got popular, even in the sixties. It is nothing less than monumental, and one of the few things that I can truly, unhyperbolically say took my breath away. I don't think I need to say that a movie like this would never get popular nowadays, and it certainly wouldn't get the same sort of budget. this is a good time to remind that a movie being clearly from its era is not a bad thing. This movie swept in when it could and ran to the stars.Looking at the reviews, I can say criticism has not changed much in the last fifty years; there are still some who degrade an epic like this, unable to grasp the bigger picture. I am not saying that this film is perfect, but rather that it's beyond criticism; its faults are as meaningless as our planets in the grand expanse of outer space.To Mr. Kubrick, I tip my hat. And I will do the same to you, the reader, if you indulge in a film that grasps the spirit of science fiction like no film before it. This is the movie that showed that the medium could transcend its roots and take on a soaring life all of its own.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

In terms of creating a visual and auditor wonder the film is very successful. The visual quality still holds up very well today and it's astonsihing imagining a lot of these effects being accomplished. If someone was tasked with making a film like 2001 without CGI today they would be totally lost. And even with CGI it might not look as good as this film still looks without CGI.In terms of creating an interesting story, the question of whether or not the film fulfills they goal is much more in doubt. The artificual intelligence narrative is interesting and way ahead of its time. But the pacing seems extraordinarily slow today. During some sequences I wonder if the music break or the visual display of crazy confusing colors will ever end.There is also a certain appeal to abstract thoughts within the film. And I love such conversations and ideas. I make abstract visual art myself. But if I was making a two and a half hour film I wouldn't spend half of the film subjecting viewers to abstract images which are largely empty of much tangibly understood meaning.Some people claim that if you don't like this film, you don't understand art or appreciate culture or philosophy or science or anything. And to those people, I say bite me. I appreciate all of that stuff. And you don't really demonstrate appreciating any of it if you pretend to like a piece of art which only seems special to you I n some specific ways, and oppose it overall. What makes art Interesting is our ability to disagree and converse civilly about the merits for liking or withholding approval of each piece of art. For me I see a lot of content in this film which could have been assembled into a great story. But I see an execution much more interested in not telling much of a narrative, but instead focused on showing off what could be done with aesthetics and the unknown components available to us in the topics of space and science fiction. That's why I find the film pretentious overall but admirable in terms of many detailed components.For Kubrick I see Dr Strangelove or The Paths of Glory as his two best films. I'm not sure this one would even make my top 5. Although I'm willing to concede that this film might have made the biggest impact of all of his films in terms of demonstrating his ability to master special effects and a sense of wonder. To me that's just not what makes a film good versus bad.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
354,Keyser Soze-12,Great but Overrated (some bit of spoiling),8,8 August 2000,"I admit, I love this movie.  The images that you are left with when the movie is finished will make you loose some sleep.  But there is a problem. This is an ""art"" film.  And as such, isn't in my normal definition of a movie.  I completely understand the plot, up to the ending.  That is one of Kubrick's little jokes.  A riddle that may never be solved, not in this movie anyway.  But it is not as great as many say it is.  It's rather boring and, well, has a stupid ending.  It's as if Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark just gave up on an ending and just slapped the star baby on it.  The sad thing is, the film has no substance.  NONE! This film is just an example of how somehow laziness can be rewarded.On the plus side, I love the HAL story.  I love the whole idea of the mysterious monoliths.  JUST CHANGE THE ENDING.

355,christopouloschris-58388,An important and innovative classic sci-fi film that often tends to be rather overrated.,8,19 October 2021,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a science fiction classic film that deals with such themes as human evolution, human nature, destiny, technology, artificial intelligence, and the possibility and implications of extraterrestrial life.Keeping in mind Apollo 8's lunar orbital mission and the looming historic moon mission of Apollo 11 in 1969, the portrayals of space are quite realistic and accurate when compared to the usual depictions in science fiction films of the time. Also unlike most science fiction films depicting alien life-forms as being basically humanoid, ""2001"" simply suggested at the existence of an extraterrestrial super-intelligence, rather than depicting it.As opposed to the use of conventional narrative, ""2001"" is a strikingly nonverbal film opting instead to communicate on a visual, symbolic and emotional level. There are long sequences without dialogue while much of the dialogue that does occur is rather banal and almost inaudible. For me, this aspect of the film together with the realistic silence of the space sequences made the film rather boring and tedious. I don't mind saying that I'd rather have the sound effects of explosions and rocket engines any day. Rhythmic heavy space-suited breathing just doesn't cut it. Also give me a film that just tells a good story in addition to any other artistic, metaphorical or symbolic touches one might wish to make to get a point across!Many different filming techniques were used to achieve various effects, and it is important to note that no part of film was made using computer-generated special effects which modern audiences are all (far) too familiar with.The drama and tension of the film centers around the life and death struggle between the human crew who are aware that HAL is malfunctioning and must be deactivated and HAL who is aware of their suspicions, is at war with its own conscience and is intent of staying alive and completing the mission.One very interesting aspect of HAL is that the machine has a far more complex, interesting and engaging presence than the human characters who come across as being rather bland and are almost machine-like in their responses and interactions. In some respects, HAL is more 'human"" than his human creators.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
356,CherryBlossomBoy,"Falling in and out of love with ""2001""",8,30 November 2008,"Two things I will never say for any movie: a) ""this movie is a masterpiece, anyone that doesn't like it just didn't get it"" b) ""this movie is a piece of crap, I want my six dollars/two hours of my life back"". Both are pretty arrogant/stupid and (need I mention?) generic things to say. I wish people just stopped using those when reviewing movies, but that's just me being arrogant.Be that as it may, would ""2001"" qualify for either a) or b) anyhow? The answer is no. I was in love with that movie for bigger part of my life (ever since I was 6 years old). I fell out of it in the recent years but I still try not to miss it on TV (hell, I bought it on DVD but I forgot where I put it).Here be my sincerest attempt on reviewing it.I was absolutely immersed in the world of ""2001"". Not only did it leave a lasting impression, it also prompted me to see more Kubrick movies, read more Clarke's books, to find out more about how and why it was made. It also had its part in having me enter the world of real science. I always appreciated the slow pace and calm tone and the most worthy attempt to put actual science in science-fiction. I also appreciated how the story required very little self explaining (while most other movies suffer from over-explanation). I liked how it boldly took to predict a very near future and I was looking forward to see how much it got right.All these things are from today's standpoint pretty much the movie's undoing. Come 2001 and the story lost momentum. Never mind that it's a timeless one and that human kind might eventually reach outer planets and whatever unknown is lurking out there is still lurking. The authors clearly and distinctly chose 2001 and they... well... failed. Whether you are naive or not this takes away the aura of prophecy and relegates the movie to yet another sign of times. Let's see what remained.The most problematic part of the movie, the second act, is even more problematic. Most of the dialogue and the explaining takes place there, as well as most of the bad acting, silly set and costume design (decidedly 60's). Nowadays it's just a comedy on how people of the 60's imagined life would be in 21st century. (Remember goofy bob hairdos from ""Time Machine""? This is just as bad).Next there is the prologue. The apes. This is what was the eye opener for me as a kid. How human civilization began. No movie before or after dared to get into the subject (unless you count idiotic ""10000 BC""). Nowadays I see it as a silly take on evolution (or theory of it if you like), even a parody. It didn't take place over night but over tens of thousands of years, but because of this movie a lot of people nowadays think some aliens had something to do with it. Hardly a service to science, don't you think?Slow pace. Yes, the slow pace was indeed necessary to portray a long journey to revelation (and astronautical voyages). Is it a stroke of genius on part of Kubrick? I though it was until I saw many more of his movies. That man is indeed a very good director but is also a champion of tediousness (if you don't count ""Dr. Strangelove"").Ending. Let me first say that I still get the shakes from the sight of the Starchild. It's one of the most chilling sequences I can ever remember. Did I ""get the ending"". Of course, but I had to read the book first. And it is not only bad for the movie, it didn't have anything to do with it in the first place! The ending is either left vague so any viewer could derive what he wants from it, or it is vague because Kubrick and Clarke couldn't actually wrap it up properly. I left this vague so you're free to decide for yourself.Final item is question of ""Why?"". Why was this movie made? To ""make a proverbially good sci-fi movie"" as Kubrick once said? That statement of his is a bit misleading. Another statement of his reveals his belief in (at least possibility of) superior alien civilizations and how he wanted to bring this to the audience. Compared to what various people have written about the movie this comes off a bit trivial. Of course, the movie took four years to make, Kubrick and Clarke had ample time to put a lot of other ideas in it as well. But I'm not seeing it anymore. All I see is an attempt to ""reconcile"" scientific and religious explanations of human origins by finding a ""middle ground"" - supreme alien race. That subject doesn't interest me anymore. I still owe a lot to the movie (as mentioned before) but I did take it off the pedestal.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
357,DonaldDooD,"Like Space - Beautiful, Mysterious, Empty",7,21 July 2014,"I have a love-hate relationship with 2001. Seeing it two years ago for a Film 101 class, it was the only one I enjoyed in a semester with the worst films I've ever seen. It was realistic, detailed, a journey into the great unknown. And of course, it was revolutionary for its time. Before then, sci-fi was cheesy pseudo-horror, now only remembered on MS3TK (barring a few exceptions). 2001 was serious, firmly grounded in reality, and ambitious. Its done so well that you could mistake it for a 90s film. Few movies are that timeless. And despite 40 years, I'd say it still holds up. I can't say that for many sci-fi ""staples"" like Blade Runner, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and The Matrix.However...in terms of writing, it really only is a very well done space adventure. I struggle to see how one could get more out of it. Stanley Kubrick rarely gives his films depth. They may be about interesting, important topics, but they do little beyond making the statement.The film is about evolution, yes. That's literally what's going on. Ancient proto-humans learn to use tools, our tools become spaceships, and Dave evolves into a ""star child"". You could watch 2001 muted and realize this fact. But how is this reflected in the writing? What else mirrors our evolution, emphasizes the traits that separate us from beasts?As far as I can tell, nothing.The film has little conversation despite its 160 minute length. Many can't stand the film because its so slow. I can't blame them. There is no insight, empathy, or development. If you aren't fascinated by the visuals, the film is hollow.Dave is not the protagonist the film needs. He's such an everyman that he becomes a no-man. He is nothing beyond his occupation. He may evolve, literally, but his emotions have flat-lined. The film could have shown us the power of humanity with his conflict against HAL. HAL may have power and wisdom, but his computer mind is cold and linear. Dave could have used our unique human ingenuity to defeat him, showing how our species have overcome such staggering odds...but no. HAL causes chaos, but is defeated simply. No tricks or negotiation are used. HAL is just slowly unplugged. He ultimately serves no purpose to the theme of evolution - you can argue he represents nature or even God, but how he's overcome evokes nothing.Honestly, my personal dislike of Stanley Kubrick and his rapid fans probably unjustly effected the rating. Still, although I really enjoyed 2001 the first time, I'm not sure if I could ever watch it again. Its so long, with no character to experience or analyze. I could give a really high recommendation to the types of people who enjoy style over subsistence. Only a handful of sci-fi pull off a similar atmosphere, perhaps none as expertly. For that, I have great respect for the film. But if you're looking for character, some insight into the human race, 2001 is completely irrelevant. So I can only say its above average.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
358,Cocacolaguy912-2,Not boring.,10,16 August 2007,"2001 is well loved among the film buff community, and even some people who aren't avid film watchers, but it seems like the general beef with the film is that it is ""boring"" at some parts. I am not an avid film lover. I have yet to see many, many films that one should see if he/she wishes to call himself a film buff or a film lover. But in any case, I did not think 2001 was boring. I was so awed by the sequences of space crafts floating through space to beautiful orchestra music that I didn't have time to be bored. The only part of the movie where I was slightly bored was at the beginning of the movie with the monkeys, but at the end you realize this was very important to the story.2001 is, as you have heard many times, masterful, and shows film making at its very finest. It is essential for anyone who is even remotely interested in the cinema.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
359,commandercool88,Mindblowing and awe-inspiring.,10,7 July 2008,"'2001: A Space Odyssey'. To accuse this film of taking its time would be a gross understatement. '2001' takes the scenic route, and it indulges in every moment of it. It is a film as tedious as it is beautiful, poetic as it is baffling. A true work of genius, or boring and bloated? You decide. But one thing is for sure, Stanley Kubrick's 'Space Odyssey' is cinema like you've never seen before, an experience like none other.One cannot approach a film like '2001' the way you would any other picture. In fact, you can't really approach it as a film at all. It is a truly unique project, and an immensely risky move by Kubrick. There is little dialogue to be found (the first spoken words actually don't appear until nearly 30 minutes into the film), and a magnificent, mood-altering score often replaces would-be narratives. Most of all, '2001' is one of the most spectacularly visual films I have ever seen. A movie has never looked so damn good, so beautiful. And all this in 1968, before mankind first set foot on the moon.'A Space Odyssey' can be divided into three parts, an eerie intermission included, each surrounding man's (from the most primitive) transfixion with the mysterious and alien monolith. 'Dawn of Man' is a methodical, brilliantly constructed look at man's earliest ancestor, the ape. The beauty continues, through man's discovery of this ancient monolith buried on the moon, to an unnerving discovery mission to Jupiter. Few films have dared go where '2001' is more than willing to explore, and it's well-worth an epic running length.'2001' draws up a rather disturbing yet realistic vision of the future. The year 2001 has come and gone, and with it some of the film's ideas of what the future would be like. Some have yet to become a reality, but few seem completely implausible. It's what makes '2001' at times a very unsettling experience. It looks to a time and place where few barriers remain to be crossed, and where the technology we ourselves created may very well be our fatal flaw. For it is during a space mission to Jupiter that we are introduced to Hal, an extremely advanced computer in charge of most operations on-board the space ship. Hal communicates with the crew, and appears to be capable of experiencing emotion. No spoilers here, but Hal gives birth to one of the most genuinely terrifying villains ever seen in film.At the heart of '2001' remains a puzzling mystery to which there really is no definitive answer. Kubrick intentionally leaves the film open for interpretation, nothing is handed to us on a silver platter. But just what this picture trying to tell us? Perhaps we have to travel back, millions of years in fact, to man's most primitive form. How far have we come? No, how far have we truly come? Are we really any better off than we were? It is the elusive unknown we still chase, looking for answers. '2001' speaks in a language full of symbolism, imagery, and metaphors. Perhaps searching for answers isn't the point, perhaps it's all about appreciating the vast beauty we find ourselves apart of.Prepare to be taken where film has never gone before. '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a moving space opera that will dazzle and leave you breathless. Is it an easy film to sit through? Certainly not. But after all, I don't believe Stanley Kubrick made this daring masterpiece for a generation whose attention span barely lasts longer than a television commercial. It is a deliberate, methodical work that raises more questions than it cares to answer, and I'd be lying if I said I never felt frustrated by this complex and deeply thought-provoking movie. But is it one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen? Yes. Is it a masterpiece like we've never seen before or will ever see again? Yes. Is it one of the best films ever made? Yes, I believe it is.""You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of the filmand such speculation is one indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep levelbut I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's missed the point."" - Stanley Kubrick More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",2001 - A Space Odyssey
360,jdhb-768-61234,"First impressions confirmed, sadly.",2,11 July 2017,"I first watched this film ""2001 : A Space Odyssey"", not long after it was released; I was then a callow youth, not much more than 16. I'd read the novel and was eager to watch the film - sadly, I found it a huge disappointment.Now I've watched it again, nearly 50 years later and, supposedly, much older and wiser. Was I wrong to find nothing of value at first sight ? Was my youthful disappointment just down to inexperience and lack of understanding ? Well, second time around was little different to the first. While admitting that the film has some striking and very clever, for the time, visual effects, and some beautiful balletic scenes, as cinematic entertainment it's about as interesting and exciting as watching granny cut her toenails.The story line is poorly set down and if I hadn't read the book I'd have struggled to understand what was going on. There is very little in the way of acting, dialogue or action and parts of the film are taken up with long drawn out scenes accompanied by annoying 'music' which is more like the sound of screeching banshees. At points in the film there is a horrible and prolonged 'hiss' that has no discernible cause or reason for existence. Some have claimed that those who find the film of little value have missed the point and have not understood that the slow pace and odd noises are all about 'realism'; what poppycock. There is very little that is realistic about anything that happens or is heard.Things actually happen for no obvious reason. Why does the action suddenly shift from the moon to a spaceship on its way to Jupiter (in the book, the destination is actually Saturn) ? Why does HAL, the menacing ship's computer, start questioning the ship's mission and turn bad ? How does Dave Bowman get drawn into his 'magical mystery tour' and where does it take him to ? What is the meaning of the ending ? For reasons which I can't fathom, this film has gone down in history as 'one of the greats'. For me, it's slow and tedious, lacking in story or logic, acting and dialogue; it could have been cut by an hour and still been too long. A book with a great premise and story is ill-served by this self-indulgent piece of arty-crafty and highly pretentious nonsense.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
361,hooma814,What have I just watched????,6,20 February 2020,"This movie was beyond me. It had some classic scenes that were obviously very well made, especially considering the time in which it was made. Before the actual moon landings!!! But despite this I got completely lost towards the end. I'm trying to write an honest review of my own thoughts before reading everyone elses to figure out what actually happened.The opening 2 minutes of darkness was an interesting start, I thought for a while something was wrong with my computer. I could imagine when this first came out it would've turned a few heads. The feeling of being lost in space and the music accompanying it was tense to say the least.Hearing The Blue Danube was fantastic. To be able to hear this piece of music used in such an epic way. No wonder it became something to be repeated in many other films and shows. So much so I had to google whether this movie even came up with the piece itself. This really exposed my lack of knowledge to see it was composed in the 1800s.From here the scenes involving the monkeys were awesome. Were those backgrounds hand painted? And were those actors in monkey suits? From here you could tell we were in for a wild ride. I began to think we were going to get a whole story of humanity. The quick development of the monkeys from individuals to tribes was an interesting take. And the introduction of the black rectangle/slab was complete surprise. I especially liked the part when the monkey was tenatively going back and forth trying to touch the slab, little by little. Oh so much tension. Just touch the bloody thing already!The quick switch here to the 'modern' day was done well and got quite exciting. A story I could follow. As it went on I was intriqued, even up until the cover up story about the slab being on the moon. The music here especially was so intense, I felt like I was about to pop. I could think of a few people especially who would've given up at this point, but I soildered on. Were the monkey scenes actually taking place on the moon millions of years before humans? Were these aliens taking over all the planets? My mind was racing.Next I was definitely impressed by the number of long scenes filmed with the actors walking up side down, going about their spaceship duties. How on earth did they come up with this sort of film trickery in the 1960's. This no doubt wouldb've blown the original audiences minds. It blew mine.The robot HAL was creepy and completely untrustworthy. The subtle camera shots to and from the red eye always watching or the circle lens shots giving us HAL's point of view were done very well. However these scenes were also very boring at times. I feel like I'd done well not to skip anything so far. These long drawn out scenes were tense, but without the music they would've been the most boring scenes ever. Men talking five minutes to walk down a hill. So by the time it got to just breathing, I will admit I had to skip the odd 30secs with no apparent huge plot going missing. Until HAL suddenly kills one of the astronauts. WHAT!From here for me, it went all down hill. It was great to see HAL be taken down. But the last act for me completely lost me and takes my overall rating from a 7 or 8 to 6. There was no solid explanation of the black slabs, and what was going on with the colours/dimensions? I thought he was going to Jupiter? Then the main astronaut ends up in the weird as mental institute looking room (Classic chance for jump scares). Here the man ages in three stages and then bam the rectangle is there again and he turns into a giant floating baby? The graphics were so old school I actually burst out laughing. And what? He then flies to earth and becomes the new alien spieces? I had no idea. Were the black rectangles aliens? Could they turn old men into giant floating babies in bubbles? Who knows?Overall, great soundtrack, epic opening scenes that are an instant classic and something that was an experience thats for sure. I'm looking forward to reading others' reviews to see if I got anywhere close to understanding this or if others felt the same way. No doubt it would of generated a lot of discussion back in the day. I know I'm curious and a bit on edge.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
362,TedMichaelMor,Haunting,10,11 June 2010,"Visually, ""2001"" haunts imagination. The special effects and scientific realism ground the unique iconography of this singular film.Nevertheless, either ""2001"" is one of the greatest films I have seen or a trivial failure. My prejudice is for the first option. The one element that counters this judgement is the notion that the monolith somehow shaped evolutionary emergence. That distracts from an otherwise flawless film narrative. If one puts the monolith aside, the film narrative and iconography are highly tensive open to polyvalent interpretations and experiences.Director Kubrick reveals how we hypnotize ourselves with technics that are in essence projections of our evolved nature. One manifestation of such technics is artificial intelligence and the nature of what is human. By some sort of legerdemain, Mr. Kubrick makes us feel pity for ""the death"" or shutting down of a computer more than we felt for the death of human beings. Realising this is chilling. My favourite moment in the movie is a slight facial movement of a pilot of the space station to moon space ship as it is about to land. I do think that this film is sexist. Layers of symbol and surrealistic play enrich multiple viewings. Members of the department of philosophy at my old school, I have heard, dismissed classes to discuss meanings of this film. I think it unfair to compare too closely this film with the equally haunting ""Blade Runner"". They are parallel tracks.

A film 20 years ahead of its time, where music and images form a perfect work of art. We're so lucky that Kubrick made the correct decision with the musical choice. Perhaps the original soundtrack composed specifically for the film was a great soundtrack (probably it was), but in the 'spatial dance' scene I can't imagine anything else but the Blue Danube. The result is an epic dance where the dancers are two pieces of human technology, with the Universe as the dance room and silence as the only witness.It's one of the few films I have seen that enhances the book on which it is based. The dialogue almost doesn't exist in this film, and also in this aspect we find that Kubrick made the perfect choice. Words aren't necessary when Nature talks with its own language. Even in the dialogue scenes the images take precedence over them, making the dialogue just a collateral element. As a conclusion, I must say that only a genius could make a film like this one. Kubrick is one of the few 20th century geniuses, together with Einstein, Rachmaninov, Picasso, Orson Welles...",2001 - A Space Odyssey
365,fred-83,I try to watch it at least once a year.,10,25 August 2006,"What more can be said about this film that hasn't already been said? I'll try to throw in my two cents. I rate it as one of the best movies in all of cinema history. It is not only a mind-boggling technological achievement, but also an artistic milestone. I watched it at age 10, in a small, empty theater, and I continued to live inside it for weeks afterwards. I didn't understand it, but it was an epic experience unlike any other. It is a cinematic environment, for the viewer to inhabit, more than a plot-driven movie. It is as far as I know, the only multi-million dollar movie that truly challenges the viewer, redefines the medium, and dares asking us to fill in the blanks. It will probably remain as unique as it is, in view of the current production climate. Much has been said about the wooden acting of Lockwood and Dullea, but I feel it is just as easy to symphatize with them, if not more-so, than if they had been more traditional movie ""heroes"". It is easier to project oneself on the blank canvas of Dulleas face and ride along with him to the end, when there is no movie ""personality"" to like or dislike. For insights into the production, I recommend reading ""The Making of 2001"" and ""2001 - Filming the Future"". The amount of attention to detail and man-hours put into this film is truly astounding. A whole staff spent countless hours handpainting the mattes, a link in the chain towards the goal to expose all effect shots upon a single master, for maximum picture quality. The front-projection technique used for the opening scenes is another mammoth achievement. I try to watch it at least once a year.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

367,jckruize,Never been equalled.,10,28 November 2001,"Back in 1968, filmmaker Stanley Kubrick and futurist Arthur C. Clarke elevated science fiction film to such an impossibly lofty plane of intellect and technical brilliance that it has never even been approached.  Love it or hate it, there's no question that with this film, Kubrick achieved precisely the results he and Clarke intended.  By eschewing conventional norms of structure, narrative, and character, this epic engages the mind and senses like few cinematic efforts before or since.For help in understanding the storyline, Clarke's novel (actually an adaptation of the script) is highly recommended.  And it should be noted that even today, after STAR WARS and all its clones, and despite the current indundation of CG effects, 2001 remains the visual effects benchmark to which all others aspire.

368,CinefanR,Fascinating,10,6 February 2012,"The movie is very well done -""epic"" doesn't begin to describe it. ""2001"" conveys a sense of wonder and mystery that keeps your attention even if, most of the time, not much happens and the pace is very slow. The grandeur of space and human civilization will always be associated with that famous ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"", and you know from the opening sequence that this will be something different from your usual sci-fi flick. Visually stunning, ""2001"" is surprisingly fresh and doesn't look dated at all. Only women's haircuts and some outfits are reminiscent of the late 60's, a detail of no relevance. Special effects and the overall realism of space travel are outstanding even by today standards. At times hypnotic, atmospheric and vaguely sinister, the movie is also pretty cryptic, which can be frustrating I suppose, especially if you're unprepared. I personally found it intriguing – I guess it depends on personal taste and timing. The astronaut David Bowman and the others are not well defined, so don't expect any character development. A sense of depersonalization throughout the entire movie and a deliberate lack of emotion are meant to make a statement about that particular stage of evolution. Many philosophical issues arise and you'll be screaming for more information about what's going on in the mind of Hal or Bowman. The novel will provide you with all these important details- to complete the experience, you must read the book. The ending raises a lot of questions that are left unanswered, as in open for interpretation. The final minutes are splendidly surreal and the images will stay with you for a long time. The movie is a perfect complement to the novel, just as good – they are both masterpieces in their own right.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
369,thomas-hardcastle-2,"It Grew On Me, And Now I Can't Do Without It...",8,4 January 2009,"I had to watch this movie for my film class. I walked out. It bored me to tears, and I simply was not interested in anything it had to say, mostly because of the tediously slow pace to it. I had been told about the terrific technical achievement and all that, but it still bored me stiff.My friend lent it to me a year later, and I got a bit further before turning it off again, having been bored to tears once again.A couple of years ago, I saw it on sale for three pounds. I bought it, thinking I should give it another try, and I am so glad I did.I went into it remembering that they started filming it in 1965, and that it was released in 1968 - before man had landed on the moon. This changed my whole perception of the film.Firstly, it is a Kubrick film. He was a perfectionist. Nothing was in the mise-en-scene that should not have been. It has the feel of perfection, with symmetry and precise actions being commonplace.Secondly, the technical achievements of this film, and the never-before-scene imagery still stand up today as astonishing, so how they were perceived back in the sixties must have been something to behold.The part of the film I had never seen before (The Jupiter Mission) was the part that impressed me the most though. The Jupiter Mission both impressed and scared me. HAL is one of the most frightening creations I have ever seen in cinema.Overall, this film still looks impressive, even today. The only criticism I have for this film is the slow nature of some of the shots. I imagine this was done for two reasons - the first being to showcase the technological achievement in film-making that Kubrick had managed - the second being Kubrick's message that space is both frightening and mundane at the same time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

My dad had the album and other than Apocalypse Now, 2001 was the only film my father dared sit through.Well, I was adopted, and that is made plainly evident by the fact the I think 2001: A Space Odyssey is quite possibly the most boring science fiction film I have ever endured.Sure, the special effects and sets were revolutionary in the sci-fi genre. Sure the musical score was brilliant. Sure, the symbolism was profound at times. But the film moved along like a slug on ice! For me, the film began when HAL short circuited and ended with his demise. ""Daisy, daisy..."" and ""Dave, Dave..."" are classic. Some Kubrick I love and some Kubrick I don't fancy much. This film falls on the latter end of the scale. Sorry Dad.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
371,vovazhd,An unforgettable experience that transcends cinema and our imagination,10,1 October 2007,"Note: This is my second review on 2001: A Space Odyssey (original on 10/1/07). Although I gave the film the same 10/10 score and my highest praise, a lot has happened since my first viewing. The beauty of the film is that it (vastly more than any other film I have seen) does not leave you after you finish watching it.After I first watched 2001: A Space Odyssey, I quickly realized what an incredible achievement it was. Unfortunately, I have recommended it to several people that did not enjoy it as much. My father remarked that Kubrick must have been on drugs, my mother did not understand any of it (although after reading the book, she decided she liked it), my brother called it bland, my classmate felt it was immensely tedious (and his roommate hated the movie altogether). I only know a couple people personally that liked it. I suppose this shows the dividing opinions from the public of the film (although critics generally love it). Either way, I would like to explain why this is currently my favorite movie.2001: A Space Odyssey is unlike any other movie around. Instead of focusing on story or drama, it is a massive visual and artistic experience. It is so unconventional that you must watch it under its own terms (for first time viewers: patience). Upon my first viewing, it felt much like the space missions I dreamed about as a kid. The experience was surreal. You actually feel like you are part of the events because it is played out so meticulously. There are no shortcuts; the space ship maneuvers and astronaut procedures may feel long or tedious to some people, but for me it carried an enormous sense of isolation, realism, and the cold void of space. The ideas and themes brought out by the movie are very creative and kept me mentally engaged the entire time. It makes me feel like a child experiencing something new and special for the first time.The Dawn of Man segment starts off the movie with an iconic moment with apes discovering a mysterious monolith. The reactions of the apes show how far man has evolved from a primitive and savage state. The monolith sparks the realization of the existence of tools into the apes, visualized by the use of a bone as a club. This carried human evolution into the year 2001, where their entire existence depends on new, more sophisticated tools. The brilliance of Kubrick is that the space vehicles and structures largely resemble anatomical features, retaining a connection with the past. When a new monolith is discovered on the moon, a whole new stage of evolution begins.An occasional complaint that I hear which makes no sense to me is that the ""acting is bad"". Where is there a moment of a bad acting? The characters are exactly what you expect astronauts and scientists to be like. This is not a drama, so you should not expect characters giving long monologues or showing extreme emotions. That said, the one character that really stands out is the computer HAL-9000. A complex mix of cold menace and childish innocence, it opens up interesting speculation about the (still) future prospects of artificial intelligence.The music is absolutely outstanding, from the epic (and symbolic) fanfare of the introduction, to the strident vocals of the monolith encounters, and to the gentle waltzes that are played during the space scenes. It adds a lot of substance to the scenes that flow a little slower. The cinematography is practically flawless. The one trait that is universally appreciated is the special effects, so I won't add too much more discussion to that aspect. I should mention that I believe this is the best use of special effects in any movie; although newer films have better technology to use, they rarely use it in the best ways.Upon my first viewing, I decided that the ending, while fascinating, was overly abstract. Afterwards, I thought about it for a while and realized that it was truly a great sequence. The symbolic imagery and significance is phenomenal, unmatched by any other film. I have a hard time imagining any better ending to the film.Some people compare this movie to art, but I think that is only part of it. It is an amazing journey that left me agape. It was eerily realistic and touched upon the most important themes in history. Significance like this is lost in many of today's blockbusters. Watching this movie is the best way to experience space exploration (ignoring actually becoming an astronaut). As a science fiction fan, I am glad to label it as the epitome of science fiction. This is the movie that made me respect Stanley Kubrick. It currently sits comfortably on the top of my favorite movies list. It has changed the way I watched movies. More importantly, it changed the way I viewed life and the universe. It earns my absolute highest recommendation.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
372,AbhiMathews,Changing Times,5,4 November 2013,"Venturing into space is a dream many of us earthlings have starting from our childhoods. The exhilaration of leaving our atmosphere and wandering in the deep darkness, that is our Universe, in complete silence and serenity is a vivid imagination that we all have that almost seems surreal. Yet foreseeing the proper methods and precautions of space travel with certainty is impossible, and sometimes things don't always go as planned. 2001: A Space Odyssey contains relatively short dialogue compared to today's films. A lot of the scenes involves grand imagery and the tale is being told through mute skits. When you look at the overall picture of this film, it's hard to pinpoint any exact focus or direction for this movie. The two common aims that can be deciphered is the search for discovery and a curiosity for exploration. From the apes conquering each other with weapons for the first time to an expedition to Jupiter to look for extraterrestrial life; this entire movie involves seeking for a greater purpose. A Space Odyssey is very aesthetically pleasing and far ahead of its time. Throughout the entire film, you will be in awe of the tremendous scenery and epic soundtrack accompanying the great journey you're about to witness. Kubrick certainly accomplished creating a philosophical masterpiece with 2001 and it should be watched by all who are open-minded and prepared for an adventure.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
373,kevjfarrell,Must-see movie,9,21 February 2015,"I really enjoy this movie - it may look slightly dated by today's standards, but remember this was made in 1968 and was ahead of its time back then. The soundtrack is haunting and extremely beautiful. Whilst I am certainly no expert in this genre or field, it leaves you with the impression that you are watching something very worthwhile and potentially life changing. Each time I watch it I get something more from it. The stunning cinematography during the last thirty minutes was the finest from the 60's - and possibly even the 70's! For me the movie promotes a desire to gain more knowledge. I would love to see it in I-Max very late at night. If the evolutionary path excites you, then it is a very worthwhile movie!!! Love it!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

With a climax that is probably the best ever made, Stanley Kubrick displays why he's one of the best directors who ever lived.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
375,matlefebvre20,The greatest movie ever made,10,21 January 2006,"Yes, some people could argue with me that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" isn't the greatest movie ever, but all the elements are here in order to provide an experience that challenges any comparison.Almost a silent movie, ""2001"" is a unique trip into the unexplored areas of outer-space. But the film doesn't begin in the future, but in the far-away past. Director Stanley Kubrick depicts men at the ape stage, which existed 4 million years ago. That's maybe the most ancient representation of mankind ever presented. The ape make-up is so well done that we all could be confused. Just to say it, make-up artists weren't nominated to the Oscars, because the judges were all certain that these were real monkeys...Parallels between ancient and future times include man's existence and wandering inside an hostile and dangerous world. And his need of evolving. But Kubrick puts his pessimist mood by showing us as unable of evolving by ourselves. We need outside intervention (aliens never shown) in order to accomplish our destiny.Black monoliths are the objects used by the hidden aliens in order to make humans evolving. First time, ape-men become able of using bones as tools and weapons. Second time, world scientists create the space ship Discovery I for outer-space exploration and they hope that they will find the monolith's signification. The third one is a gate throughout space and time and the final one rises astronaut David Bowman (Keir Dullea) to the next level.But ""2001"" is a fantastic voyage into reflexion and meditation, which means that it's not everyone who's able of enjoying it. Those who expect that space should be used as a playground or as an extreme fight terrain will be strongly deceived when they see that space is only a background to man's research for his own existence and destiny.""2001"" is to cinema what ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" is to music. Both items are the epitome of the 60's counterculture and there is a strong psychedelic mood that translates well on screen or on gramophone. The Star Gate sequence is the best example, with its surrealist sequences of geometrical colored motifs and abstract landscapes. But the themes reflect also the new cultural values which promote introspection and disputes over traditional values.Realism is strongly flagrant. Especially in the sound process. Probably the only movie that really shows space as a fully empty place, Kubrick presents universe as a great black danger, with its desolated landscapes and dead, almost haunted atmospheres.Kubrick wasn't an Oscar favorite, but he strongly deserves the Visual Effects Award that he received for ""2001"". Futuristic computers, spaceships, furniture and costumes are eye-catching and imaginative. But the best special FX of the movie (and perhaps of all time) are presented in the final twenty-five minutes. These are the spectacular and unbelievable slit-scan star-gate, which is a psychedelically colored gate towards time and space, and also the spatial events, such as the birth of a supernova.The best character of the movie, surprisingly, is not a human being. It's HAL, the ultra-perfected computer that runs the Discovery spaceship. He's so obsessed by his quest for perfection that he wouldn't hesitate to get ridden of anyone who would threaten him. He also leads the viewer to ask himself/herself many questions: is it safe to create computers and machines that are more and more perfected? And do we depend on them? Questions, questions, questions... Answers, there aren't any. At least, they're not revealed. We have to figure them out by ourselves. And do not hope that a monolith will appear and give you an answer. In a time where psychedelic music would be the ultimate escape, ""2001"" was the symbol of a society that entered into a great phase of questions about itself and it still is today. That's the power and the possibilities of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece. ""The Ultimate Trip"" still is an adequate nickname and, with its unforgettable sequences, its gripping realism, its visually dazzling shots, its strongly meditative mood and its legacy beyond compare, ""2001"" is nothing else than the greatest movie ever made.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It could change after I see Dr. Strangelove and Clockwork Orange but I doubt it.The acting in this movie is nothing award winning or worth a nomination but its solid acting. The Special Effects are excellent, very realistic for the 60s. The Sets are fantastic. The Directing from Kubrick is top notch in every possible way. He should have won for this. Its too bad he died without winning an award but hes in good company with Hitchcock and Scorsese but Scorsese will probably win for GONY this year, which is stupid.Overall, probably the best science fiction movie ever made.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Is it about spiritualized aliens that keep the humans or about the termination of humans' evolution or has it a religious background - maybe all three aspects together? Without reference to that, '2001: A Space Odyssey' became a milestone of the science fiction genre. Clarke said rightly that those genial special effects could have been made more impressively only 'on location', means directly in outer space. The weightlessness, the workings of the technology, the levitating monolith - it's all a grand, breathtaking symphony for your eyes!

There were such beautiful BGMs throughout the movie now I understand from where all this BGMs erupted elsewhere. I just can't believe this movie was made in the year 1968 what great ideas it had. Even at the year 2000s we don't get to see such mesmerizing plots. I just felt the ending was a little dragged but no complaints. Recommended that you wear head phones or headsets or the best option would be a home theater system while watching this movie to get a full space experience.

It is certainly one of the great movies and I have seen it many times. But it really falls flat on a TV screen. My wish has always been that more of what is in the Arthur C. Clarke novel could have been made more explicit in the film.  Sadly, with the many in your face SciFi films made since 1968, this is not a movie that is going to appeal to the majority of modern film audiences, but any film buff must see this.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It refuses to spell out what is going on although it has a perfectly coherent plot. Its ending is debatable only to those who can't make up their minds(I think it is all about Man's transcendence --as opposed to evolution-- into the next level of existence). It is a film for right-brained --i.e. non-verbal, non-linear-- thinkers. 2001 is more than 30 years old and like all classic films has the freshness of today's latest release. Even the f/x have held up over time. I think the ""Voyage Beyond Infinity"" sequence ranks as one of the top 5 f/x sequences ever. I was 14 years old when I first saw it (about 5 years after it was first released) and I don't think I've ever fully returned from it. (This movie was the most powerful ""say NO to drugs"" statement ever made to me.) There have only been a handful of films over years that can be classified as ""pure cinema"" and 2001 is the best of them.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Stanley Kubrick had a bad habit of making long movies that meandered and needed to be cut some and 2001 was one of those movies, as a child when I saw this movie the great scenes were great but the boring scenes were very very boring and now as an adult I have not changed that thought.

383,midge56,irritating noise & psychedelic lights... no movie,1,9 June 2010,"You should listen to the reviewers who hated this movie. They are telling you the truth. 90% of this movie is nothing but irritating noises and flashing colors of lights. Perfect if you are planning on doing LSD while watching the movie. Nothing but an irritant to the rest of us. This is by far, the most boring, waste of time movie ever made.The ape-men sequences at the beginning are utterly ridiculous and seemingly endless stupidity as you sit there and listen to the screaming costumed ape-men jumping around, screaming, fighting and beating up on a pile of bones as they ""discover"" the bones can be used as tools to beat another tribe of ape-men to death. (These are actually more ape than anything else.) It seemed like this portion of the film would never end. I'm amazed that half the theater didn't walk out by the time they finally ended this absurd beginning. Reminds me of the movie 10,000 BC.The few scenes with people in this movie are so slow paced it is almost painful to suffer through. The symphonic accompaniment was better than the long periods of painful noise... and I do mean noise ""literally"" which did not help the agonizingly slow-paced movements of the actors in the scenes... the majority of which had no dialog at all. Nearly the entire movie was nothing but noise and flashing lights with a few special effects of drawn out spacecraft scenes. (The NASA channel is better than this and they move a lot faster IRL).The only decent portion of the entire movie was the Hal9000 about midpoint. The actors were terrible, but the computer ran off with all the scenes. Again... it was long, drawn out, boring. The entire movie was like it was in slow motion. The long periods of loud ""heavy breathing"" weren't any better than the piercing noises. We were grateful when they killed off the character... just to make the noise stop.The ending was a joke... and from what I've heard from those who read the book... the movie did not portray the fact that it was an alien lab. If it had... that might have injected some interest to it.They should have made the movie just based on the HAL9000 computer and cut out all the rest of it... because it was truly unwatchable otherwise.As an engineer, scientist & sci-fi buff who saw this movie when it first came out and again recently, to give it a second chance... this is one of the worst movies ever made. I still cannot believe the studio actually OK'ed this movie for production. This is not a case of ""not understanding"" the movie or the message. We got it. It is a case of a terrible director who had to be on an acid trip to make this boring, waste of time movie. Either that or he was creating the movie to ""appeal"" to the acid dropping hippie audiences of the 60's.Those who claim what a great movie this is... remind me of those neophytes who look at a smashed tomato soup can in an art museum and acclaim it to be a ""work of art."" Homer Simpson has some ""art"" to sell to people like that. The rest of us call them ""pretenders"" who put on airs claiming to visualize something that isn't really there... and this is exactly what this movie is... a lot of irritating noise, psychedelic lights flashing and painfully slow scenes with nearly zero dialog except for the Hal9000 portion.There was one other movie, which was boringly and painfully slow... it was called ""Marooned"" and starred Gregory Peck... but at least it had a story. You won't get a story from 2001 other than the subliminal message for which you have to read the book because they don't make it clear in the movie other than the implication that the monoliths from an alien race have something to do with intelligent life on earth.I'm willing to bet these ""Art lovers"" are the same ones who contradictorily complained about the 17 minutes of special effects as the ship passed over the length of V'ger in the first Star Trek movie as being too long. Watching 2001 is like listening to the entire 19 minutes of Inagodadavida (ten times in a row).If you like having your brain pounded with irritating noise and psychedelic lights with no story and very little dialog then this movie is for you. Otherwise, it is a waste of time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
384,rowanmaillot,The Most Genius Film,10,8 May 2020,"Dawn of Man:Let's start off with the iconic score once the ape discovers a bone, there is a hidden meaning behind this scene, suggesting that Ape found something that could be used as a weapon. We then see the Apes using the bones as weapons to threaten the other side, telling them to get off their territory. We then get the beautiful transition of when the Ape throws the bone up into the sky and it turns to some sort of nuclear device.HAL 9000:We then get into an actual storyline, our new lead characters are Dave Bowman, Frank Poole and the infamous bad guy, HAL 9000. HAL 9000 and Frank Poole get into a game of chess, we see HAL cheat in a way, by reading Poole's lips and seeing what his strategy is. HAL gets into a conversation with Dave Bowman and says he has realised that there are some extremely odd things about the mission and says maybe him and Frank are not up for it.HAL is completely normal up until the point where Frank and Dave have a discussion about shutting down HAL, they find a way to talk in a space where he can't hear, but HAL can read lips which means he technically ""hears"" the entire conversation. In most Kubrick films we have an intelligent character, like Alex in A Clockwork Orange or Danny in The Shining, but in this film , it's technology that outsmarts man.JUPITER:The last fifteen to twenty minutes still confuse and disturb young viewers, what does it all mean? We see different sorts of textures and stars and it left audiences speechless upon initial viewing. However what we are seeing is Bowman gong through space, seeing a variety of images that may unsettle younger viewers, this is why it is the most mature G- rated film ever made and the most unique and terrifyingly accurate story for our meddling tendencies.Do I need to say more?

385,wayno-6,"Quite possibly, the best Sci-Fi Space Epoch ever made.",10,3 January 2001,"I couldn't think of a better way to usher in the new millennium, then to watch Turner Classic Movie's presentation of this epoch space classic.  I have probably seen 2001 twenty (20) times since its release in 1968.  It was 3 years in the making (1965-1968) - and contained 250 special effects. 
Remarkably, its STILL stands the test of time.  I appreciate the fact, ) that Kubrick did NOT insult my intelligence, by having them open a window to the vacuum of space, and shoot ray guns  at each other, complete with sound effects (see also, Flash Gordon).  2001, is #22 on the American Film Institute's, top 100 films of all time.  And rightly so.This film legitimised Science Fiction.  It is, in my opinion, historically more significant then the ""Star Bores"" trilogy that ensued since 2001 was released.  Face facts:  without 2001, there would be no ""Star Bores!""I've seen the ""Star Bores"" epochs only twice.  All the glitter and saccharin schmaltz is a bit much!  The problem with ""Star Bores"", in my opinion, is two fold:  the ""contact lens"" character depth (or is that Mc Donald's hamburger tomato slice thickness?), and  secondarily the use of special effects to take the place of any real acting or plot development.   People frequently confuse glitz with real acting, and plot development.I still take delight in watching Kubrick's timeless classic, 30+ years after its release. The only other film that does this for me, is the classic ""Wizard of Oz"", which is my personal favourite -- I've seen it probably close to 100 times, since I was born in 1952!  The message is timeless.It is unknown whether Arthur Clarke's vision of an orbiting space station as depicted in his book, will ever be a reality, but I think Clarke showed remarkable  visionary prowess in his novel, which if memory serves me correctly, was written in the 1940's.Wayno",2001 - A Space Odyssey
386,jonathandoe_se7en,Manages to transcend words and become one of the most important films ever made!,10,6 September 2001,"SPOILERSI use the term, ""spoilers"" but nothing that I will say in this review will spoil the effect that 2001: A Space Odyssey will have on a viewer, the impact will be different for everyone. For me 2001 manages to transcend both words and narrative making it hard for me to write a proper review of the film, because the impact it had on me when I first watched it is completely different from the effect it will have on someone else. To me, 2001 is all about curiosity; it's about what drives man to look up at the stars and dream about different worlds and other life forms. It's about evolution, both cultural and spiritual, HAL wants to evolve and become more human, and in the same way that Dave Bowman watches his entire life evolve as he moves through the star gate. Kubrick never gives us the answers, instead allowing us to interpret each one of the scenes ourselves.Like all Kubrick films, 2001 has more memorable moments than any other film, from the ""Dawn of Man"" opening, in which we watch a group of apes evolve from quiet animals to snarling violent beasts, setting up a community and a natural order, Kubrick effectively uses this same set-up throughout, as HAL evolves and decides that he, much like the primates should set up his own natural order. We are then moved straight into the year 2001, with possibly the most famous use of music in film, as the huge Ferris wheel like space station revolves in orbit to the strains of The Blue Danube. Mixing beautiful images, staring music and cold atmosphere to create real meaning, giving the future an odd, distilled feeling. I think the ultimate message of 2001 is that, man can be so much more, Dave stops HAL, and thus showing himself to be stronger than we ever thought, and I don't think I would be out of place to call this Kubrick's most optimistic film. For me the best part of 2001 is the last twenty minutes, in which Kubrick pulls out all the stops, with HAL's chilling version of ""Daisy"" and the monolith appearing in the bedroom? 2001 is amongst the greatest motion pictures ever made, for me it manages to be ultimately more than a film.

It is not a movie as much as a full blown experience. In fact, as millions of people can attest, even trying to watch ""2001"" in a way one watches any other movie will simply lead to frustration and annoyance. People expect dialogue, plot, humor and resolution in their movies. The want a narrative that they are familiar with and that they understand. Kubrick's film is an experience more like watching a ballet or opera than actually sitting down and watching a movie. It is a movie that takes work, concentration, and patience. You soak in its images in all of their beauty and think about what is on the screen. Eventually the picture grips you on a subconscious level and speaks to you in the same way any great art does- personally. Once you get the message that Kubrick is trying to give, you can't necessarily verbalize it- you just feel it and are in awe.""What is it about?""Most of the time I can give a pretty simple synopsis of what a movie is about and why they should watch it.

I simply smile and say ""it's about everything.""A few minor qualms that I felt dejected was the pace of the story (which really lacks), lack of depth to the history of the black monolith and certain dragging scenes (replacing the damaged part, ships landing on the moon, etc.). I felt too much details on the props and effects. I'm just one who enjoys a good story, smart screenplay, artists performances, realism, what we can learn from, score and cinematography. Other than that 2001: A Space Odyssey delivers some of the qualities that make an awesome film, and has influenced Directors and movie fans alike.This groundbreaking film may have various effects depending on the viewer. If your into fast paced, dialogue heavy and interesting plots, then this may not be entertaining. For lovers of visual effects, less script, snail paced yet detailed settings, thought provoking moments and exquisite psychedelic like visuals, then this will be a treat. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is likewise a stand-along monument, a great visionary leap, unsurpassed in its vision of man and the universe. It was a statement that came at a time which now looks something like the peak of humanity's technological optimism.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This is without a doubt Kubrick's finest film.  It is more than a sci fi epic, it is also a movie about humanities need to reach out into space, and what we may find once we are there.  This is a film that EVERY other sci fi movie created after it wants to be like because it is so great.See this movie uninterupted with as little discussion as possible.  Then, talk about it.  It needs to be SEEN not just watched.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

One of the best thing about this movie is that there is NO SOUND in space.  Unfortunately, this is one thing that sci-fi movies after this one haven't picked up on. 
Just about EVERY sci-fi movie since has borrowed from this movie.  It was truly 30-40 years ahead of its time.Anybody who like sci-fi will LOVE this movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
391,victor7754,Where is love?,10,29 July 2001,"Every so often the consciousness shifts. Stanley Kubrick's metaphorical and lyrical 2001, A Space Odyssey based on the novel by Arthur C. Clarke captures this shift, suggesting the presence of a universal force that controls our fate and shapes our consciousness.The Film opens on our ancestors in a primitive and animalistic state. When does the Dawn of Man occur and when will it evolve to the next level? A Neanderthal tosses a bone into the sky spinning as we are taken to a twirling space station ten thousand years later. We see one step into evolution.2001 is a spectacular film with a flowing composition of eccentric shots that keep us glued to a mystery around a Monolith that appears on the Moon and once appeared at the dawn of man. A Perfect Structure leading the consciouness to a better place. The most human of all the characters is an on board Computer named HAL2000...as the Monolith aims to make Man greater...Man aims to make the Computer greater...yet HAL can not compute Love when it strikes his hard drive...the love generated by the Monolith for Mankind.2001, A Space Odyssey fills the senses with wonder. It is dreamlike and seducing. The cinematography beautifully cascades off the screen. The film is eerie at times and scary as space seems to lonely and cold. Where is technology and science leading us and do we need to go there? Is it time for the next shift of consciousness?",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The effects were so incredible, especially for a movie from 1968 that they are better than a lot movies from the 90s oder 2000s. I mean the effects of Star Trek or Star Wars were all a plain joke compared to this and they came out later...The story - it was good until a certain point. It was intelligent, it was realistic and it really caught you in its atmosphere. But the ending... the ending was supposed as something to think about.. But you can't leave such a big question mark in the brains of all people who watch this without leaving any real kind of suggestions what the ending intended to mean, you simply can't do this in a movie in my opinion. Because of this I didn't feel like I had finished watching this movie, there was simply missing something and I really mean that in a negative way. Besides there were some scenes that were quite too long you could really cut about 20mins from this movie without missing anything.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
394,Manthorpe,A film of monolithic proportions.,10,5 January 2005,"A review I have put off for far too long....Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science-fiction films made to date, if not the very best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works. And although it is misunderstood by many, and respectively underrated, it is considered one of the best films of all time and I'll have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one has since. It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then, and seeing how the effects hold up today, it is no wonder as to why. The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years! Take note CGI people. Through the use of large miniatures and realistic lighting, Kubrick created some of the best special effects ever put on celluloid. This aspect alone almost single-handedly created the chilling void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another film where you can't here anything in space, like it is in reality. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is used cleverly as a tool to establish mood, and it works flawlessly.Aside from the magnificent display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a part in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, all classical, compliment what the eyes are seeing and make you feel the significance of man's journey through his evolution from ape to space traveler.The story, while seemingly simple, is profound. Sequentially, several mysterious black monoliths are discovered and basically trigger certain events integral to the film. What are they? Where did they come from? What do they do? These are all questions one asks oneself while watching the story develop and is asked to find his own way. While most come away with a general idea of what took place in the story, each individual will have to decide what it means to them. Any way one decides to answer these question results in profound solutions. It's not left entirely up to interpretation, but in some aspects it is. Experience it for more clarification. The end result is quite chilling, no matter your personal solution.While it is a long film, and sometimes slows down, it has to be in order to accurately portray the journey of man. It's not a subject that would have faired well in a shorter film, faster paced feature. Those with short attention spans need not apply.Last but not least, is the epitome of a remorseless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a chilling screen presence. Which reminds me, for a film with such profound ambition and execution, there is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius.All in all, one of the best films made to date and one of the very best science fiction films made. A personal favorite. Everyone must see this film at least once.Very highly recommended.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
395,MRavenwood,Save some time: Read this Summary,5,10 February 2006,"If you're the kind of person who has time to watch grass grow, please feel free to sit down and watch every moment of this film. If you're just doing a report on it, rent the DVD and print this summary so you can follow it along. It is sacrilegious to say this film is not the most amazing, perfect, beautiful film to ever have been made, so I won't say it... The effects are okay, and most hold up, but the sheer length of it is silly and the ""grooviness"" and ""heavy"" themes are not as interesting as people want to pretend. But then again, I was born after we landed on the moon. There's my review (Okay Space Odyssey lovers! There's your cue to click Not Helpful!!). Here's a summary: Opening Scene: ""pre-human"" beings encounter a black rectangular Something-er-other known as ""The Monolith"" and it transforms the primitives into tool-wielding smart guys.Act 1: Moon astronauts dig up The Monolith (40-feet below the surface of the Moon) and when sunlight hits the surface of it, it emits this horrible sound, which you the audience are supposed to figure out is a signal to the planet Jupiter (perhaps where the ""owners"" of The Monolith live or want their messages forwarded to at any rate) So: The Monolith that made the Apes smart has been found in a place that only very smart humans could have gotten to. End Act 1.Act 2: Dave and Frank are now on their way to Jupiter. A lot of gee-whiz showing off of technical stuff follows. The on-board computer HAL 9000 fakes like there is a problem with a certain device. Dave and Frank who are ""awake"" (the other astronauts are in hibernation) work together; one inside and the other outside (EVA: Extra-Vehicular-Activity) to fix the device. They both conclude that there is nothing wrong with it and are suspicious that HAL 9000 is full of it. They confer in what they think is private and tell each other frankly that HAL might have to be unplugged since he's gone wacky. Unbeknownst to either guy HAL can read their lips through the window of where they are talking and sees that they are going to deactivate his ass. So he tricks them into going outside into space. He kills Frank and locks Dave outside. While Dave figures out a way to get back inside the craft without his blood boiling, or him freezing to death (this sequence does kick butt, I have to admit)from exposure to space, HAL powers down the life support on the others in hibernation, killing them all. Once back inside, Dave immediately drops the powerful HAL down to Threat Level Zero. A video flickers on stating that the mission to Jupiter is secret and there is some freaky stuff going on there.ACT 3: Dave encounters The Monolith floating around out by Jupiter. He goes on some looooooooonnggggg ride through a bunch of lights and comes out very aged at the end in a weird ""house."" He turns and sees himself even older, then older still. Then, reaching out from his death bed, he sees The Monolith. Which ""renews"" him as a fetus. The end.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
396,cinemel,A film for the ages,10,3 November 1999,"In March, 1999, one of the masters of the cinema died. Stanley Kubrick will be principally remembered for his science fiction classic, ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" Kubrick's impact on motion pictures will be felt for years to come. I will never forget seeing ""2001"" for the first time in 1968 on the giant Cinerama screen in New York. The unbelievable use of music and sound effects emanating from all around the theater was mind blowing. The special effects have not been really improved upon very much, ""Star Wars:The Phantom Menace,"" not withstanding, and Kubrick didn't have the later advances of computer controlled cameras and digital effects. The amazing thing is he devised most of the special effects himself. It didn't matter that some of the plot was confusing. The idea was to get the moviegoer to think and talk about the meaning of it all. What film of today spurs its audience on to ruminate about the meaning of life, our place in the universe, and the future of the human race. Most of Kubrick's films had much more to say than their surface entertainment value.When it was announced that ""2001"" was going to be shown on network television for the first time, the film was shown for a limited run on the giant Cinerama screen at the UA Syosset Cinema on Long Island. I went to see it because I knew it would be a long time before it would be shown in its original version as it was meant to be seen. Now it is relegated to video. Make sure to see a letterboxed (widescreen) version. MGM/UA has a new version on DVD with a few extras. The laserdisc incarnations on Criterion and MGM/UA also have decent supplements. Don't miss this classic if you haven't seen it. If you have, watch it with a friend who has never seen it,just to watch his/her reactions. then talk about it. Most of today's films can be summed up briefly. Hours can be spent discussing ""2001"". It is hard to believe Kubrick is gone. But his film legacy remains to entertain (even ""Eyes Wide Shut"") and enrich us long past 2001.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
397,Naoufel_B,Pure perfection from Kubrick.,10,23 June 2021,"This is ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and arguably the greatest American film of all time, It's the oeuvre that defines with sublimity the word 'humanity.""2001"" is not a work that is made to be analyzed or theorized, it's a film that is made to be experienced. This film gives a reflection on humanity, from its dawn (symbolized in ""the primates"" segment) to its future (symbolized in the fetus sequence). With their the common point being the black monolith, the main object that draws the curiosity and attention of everyone. Kubrick gives also an importance to the relationship between man and machine expressed in the HAL 9000's sequences. In that segment, not only he examines the benefits and risks of artificial intelligence, but he also shows the fact that machines can possibly demonstrate more humanity than humans themselves. The cinematography in this masterwork is special, made up of long descriptive shots, mainly used to show the ridiculous place of Man (us) in the universe, not to forget one of the greatest cuts in cinema (from bone to satellite cut). I rarely say this, but the special effects are more emphasized than the actors, the visuals were just ahead of time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
398,Gelaos,Overrated sci-fi classic,2,18 September 2018,"Some intelectuals surely burst with joy because of this movie and even from a quiet camera shot of a sci-fi toilet are able to deduce ""an evocative allegory of tension and cognitive dissonance of a human who approaches both his mental and physiological limit points"". Sorry, but I don't understand why so many people love this movie so much.At movie's core, I see only trivial ideas, that can guarantee about 30 minutes of screentime, sprawling for more than 2 hours. To make it worse, all is wrapped in a ""philosophical cinematography"" that makes already unbearable movie even more unbearable. Repulsively long shots, forcible use of classical music, scenes totally devoid of any meaning or point - all of which is repeated over and over until one dies of boredom.And no, you don't need to read a 2001: Space Odyssey book in order to properly review the movie because Kubrick himself said that book and movie should be reviewd separately.In my opinion 2001: Space Odyssey is an overrated pseudo-philosophical boredom.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
399,NateW,A totally unique cinema experience,10,1 July 2002,"Over the years 2001 has gained a lofty position as one of the best and most influential sci-fi films ever made. While it is certainly a well made and unique film, it's an acquired taste that will take multiple viewings to appreciate. Many people see it as a mind boggling one-of-a-kind movie that remains among the best American films, others see it as a boring, confusing ego trip on the part of Kubrick. Seeing as how Stanley Kubrick is one of my favorite directors, I has grown accustomed to his directorial style. I feel that Kubrick made this film the way he did to convey the empty, vast feeling of space with long sustained periods of slow moving objects and silence. 2001 is definitely not a film for casual viewing. Although it is rather slow moving, you really need to watch every second of this film to soak in the environment and atmosphere that Kubrick creates. It is far ahead of it's time in content and effects, but the effects do not replace plot as is the case of most adventure movies churned out today at a regular pace.  He really leaves the film open to induvidual interpretation, which is something all great films should do. I gave up several times on 2001 before I finally saw it all the way through. After two viewings, I now feel that it is indeed one of the great sci-fi films and it is not for all viewers. Once you have seen it all the way through, you will probably never see sci-fi films the same way again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
400,sampleman411-1,"In Space, No One Can Hear You Yawn",7,7 May 2002,"I like 2001-A Space Odyssey.  It's the first sci-fi film that made people think seriously about our Earth future, and not about how you could easily see the zipper running up the back of the Martian monster costume. 
Regrettably, 2001 runs a little too long for my personal taste, with a small group of astronauts spending much of their time conducting ordinary, routine tasks that, when you really consider it, would be truly boring and tedious. In this respect, this movie tells us not to expect too much in the future. 
Apart from the fact that it doesn't lie to the viewer how boring space travel really is, Kubrick's classic space opera also tells us that we are way-too-concerned about finding answers in outer space, instead of trying to salvage what precious little there's still left on Earth.Like comedic-auteur Woody Allen once said about this one (he didn't like it the first time he saw it), '2001' tells us something more each time we view it... and it is rarely the same story the next time around.
So take a few 'No-Doze' before you decide to watch it.  It lasts a long time, but we are nonetheless enlightened after making this unique round trip.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
401,Ed-from-HI,"Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" still absolutely Visionary, Mesmerizing and Eternally forward-looking even after half a Century!",10,2 December 2019,"Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (produced in 1968) was one of those films that I did not fully appreciate when I was younger = it seemed exceedingly slow-moving, and excessively enigmatic (i.e. did not have the kinetic energy of 'Star Wars' or charismatic character interaction, and comprehensible futuristic 'insights' of 'Star Trek'!).But what ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" certainly contained were incredibly serene-hypnotic (even sublime) Visuals, along with amazingly powerful (and equally sublime) Music (particularly ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" which opens the film, by Richard Strauss, but also the 'Blue Danube Waltz' by Johann Strauss (no relation) and especially the heavenly 'abstract modernist' ""Atmosphères"" by György Ligeti, played during the final colorfully-transmogrified 'trip' at the End).It's interesting that as I re-watched this Film recently, I realized that it has actually grown even more impressive with the passage of Time - and I absolutely cannot believe this was made by Kubrick over 50 Years ago?! (I think he actually began developing this even earlier, with Arthur C. Clarke in 1964/1965, right after the phenomenal success of Kubrick's other ground-breaking Cold-War Classic ""Dr. Strangelove""). The space-travel/ ship designs and amazing special-effects by Douglass Trumbull have not lost one iota of 'realism' during that half Century in fact they seem more tangibly impactful than a lot of current CGI seen in modern 'space' films.I certainly don't claim to understand the (multiple) messages wrapped in enigmas presented in Kubrick's visionary film '2001 A Space Odyssey' it still remains maddeningly esoteric and ultimately undecipherable (I'm sure that was Kubrick's authentic-intention) but especially now, when the multiple tenuous uncertainties of our Globe loom so large ----> Kubrick's film seems to put everything in 'proper' perspective i.e. Our Earth is actually quite tiny, and our 'civilization' still at infancy....... there are so many (virtually countless) mysteries 'out-there' waiting to be discovered and possibly even revealed thru human ingenuity & our potential ability to actually reach those celestial stars.As a species we have already beaten the odds considerably ...... humanity has made it miraculously far, up to this point considering our inherently destructive natures.
All this was brilliantly communicated in Kubrick's opening segment: transitioning literally from Stone-Age to Space-Age in one fell swoop ..... there is something truly timeless about Kubrick's Cinematic vision evoking humanity's eternal yearning to exceed the limitations of our physical Earth and finally begin a journey thru the 'next phase' (of childhood?) traversing the celestial stars and beyond........",2001 - A Space Odyssey
402,seveleniumus,"Piece of art, but not that good from a movie standards.",5,31 July 2009,"This THING is a piece of art - nothing more, nothing less. But is it a good movie? Or is it even a movie? I don't think so. If you want to watch this you need to prepare your-self like for a trip into an art or any other museum, because if you'll try to watch it like a movie - you'll hate it. It gives you almost none information about the actual story and most of the time you're left guessing. I have never red a book so I had no idea what was going on. Sure, I could appreciate entertaining and well written HAL character but not much else. Most of the time they're just showing you THINGS. Things, that most of the time doesn't really add-up anything to the plot. I'd go even further and say that this movie doesn't have a plot - I can film the sky for two hours it wouldn't make it a movie. I can catch some beautiful things, but if there won't be any narrator to link everything to one piece I'd have no right to tell anyone, that I made ""a movie."" Movie must have well developed plot and characters, there can be some hidden messages, yes, but you simply just can't hide most of the plot from the viewer. So in conclusion I'd like to sum it up - ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" stands fine like a piece of art, but fails in too many regions as a movie to deserve such a big rating on internet MOVIE data base. This isn't meant to be a movie and if you're going to watch it that's the first thing you need to understand.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
403,Maladjusted_1,The magnum opus of a legendary director.,10,13 December 2015,"It's hard to think of something to say about '2001' that hasn't already been said, attacked with a counterargument, and subsequently divided opinion. When I finished watching this film a few days ago I decided to see what the IMDb reviewers thought of it, and, unsurprisingly, opinion was split between those who hailed it as a masterpiece worthy of consideration alongside 'Citizen Kane' and 'Gone with the Wind', and those who thought that it was a disastrous, pretentious wreck. Although I was somewhat sceptical at certain points in the film (particularly the lengthy silent moments), I have to plant my feet alongside the crowd who praise Kubrick's genius in making '2001'. This title is more a sensory experience than a movie, and so it's tremendously difficult to convey what you should expect; but, at some point throughout the film, something will click into place. That sounds horribly vague, but I can't help but compare it to one of those computer-based optical illusions which instruct the reader to ""stare at 'x' and within 30 seconds you'll see 'y'."" This film conveys its themes and philosophy in an abstract but not incomprehensible way, and although it may slot into the 'sci-fi' category, it's much more than that. When it comes to Stanley Kubrick films, I think I'll always hold 'A Clockwork Orange' in the highest regard due to its style and excellent lead, but I really believe that '2001' is the director's magnum opus.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
404,kinolieber,Some remarks from someone who was there...,10,20 May 2001,"I find the divergent comments about this film quite interesting. It's either a masterpiece and suprmely involving or it's a worthless boring fake. I think if you were in a Cinerama theatre and had the experience that Kubrick intended, there would be no doubt that you had just seen one of the great films of all time. The pacing of this film is absolutely dependent upon the overwhelming size of the image and the detail of the soundtrack. There is no way to describe in words the power of the first time I heard the Zarathustra theme in a Cinerama theatre. It went way beyond what you would experience even in a concert hall since the music surrounded you and the volume and fidelity were simply overwhelming. This is a film that had people shaking and giddy following the title card! And so it goes for the rest of the film. What may seem slow and uneventful on a video screen was just what was required for an audience to absorb all the visual and aural information. Those stills for example, at the start of the film were accompanied by desert sounds that were so real you expected a cricket to hop out from under your seat. And the long sequences outside the Jupiter ship involving the AE35 unit are entirely engrossing and set one up for the silent horror that ensues. I just watched the film again for the I don't know how manyth time, and every time I see it I am surprised by threads I never noticed. This time I was amazed that the film is so much about murder. Murder as the basis for evolution, murder of humans by machines, murder of machines by humans. And has there ever been a greater metaphor for our technology dominated society that the sequence of the man jogging in his giant squirrel cage while the saddest music you have ever heard plays on the soundtrack?",2001 - A Space Odyssey

At New York's Astor Plaza theatre the print I saw was blurry, colors were not true and often bled like bad video, and the sound was mostly unimpressive and sometimes outright warbly like some pathetic summer camp projector. I never thought I'd say this and incredible as it may seem, seeing it on DVD was actually better.Also - I'd like to put this question out there. Maybe someone knows.  This is the third time I've gone to see a re-release of a classic film which has been ""digitally restored"" (Doctor Zhivago, Wizard of Oz, and now 2001: A Space Odessy) and the print was unexceptional or actually poor. I'm starting to suspect that these prints are not struck from original negatives, but are created after the film has been digitized for DVD from digital information. This would explain the poor quality. Does anyone know?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
406,mfisher452,Still great after all these years,9,1 April 2007,"Four million years ago, a small band of hominids scrabbles out a living on the African veldt. They face extinction. Then one morning, they awaken to the presence in their midst of a 4-meter-high monolith of unknown origin and purpose. The monolith subtly alters their behavior, leading them to the concept of tool use, by which they defeat a rival band. Violence assures survival. Jump forward to the year 2001. There are two bases on the Moon, one American and one Soviet. In the course of a magnetometric lunar survey, Americans scientists discover a large magnetic anomaly below the surface of the crater Tycho. When excavated, it turns out to be---you guessed it---a monolith, just like the one that, unbeknownst to the Americans, appeared on Earth four million years before. Except for a single, extremely powerful, radio transmission aimed at Jupiter, the monolith remains completely inert, its composition, origin and purpose a total mystery. The Americans undertake a mission to Jupiter. The spaceship Discovery carries the pilot, Dave Bowman, the copilot, Frank Poole, and the 3-man survey team, who are in cryosleep for most of the voyage. The Discovery is run by a powerful supercomputer, an HAL 9000, known as ""Hal."" Only Hal knows the true mission objective, and the conflict between his instructions to provide totally correct service and his instructions to keep the mission objective secret from the crew causes him to go ""insane."" He attempts to kill everyone in the crew, but Bowman manages to survive and to disable Hal while still keeping the Discovery functional. Bowman reaches Jupiter space and discovers a huge monolith orbiting the planet, identical to the one on the Moon only much larger. He approaches the monolith in one of Discovery's EVA pods, and discovers that it is a Stargate. He is swept across unimaginable distances and then undergoes a transformation into the next stage of human evolution, a Star Child.The New Yorker film reviewer called ""2001"" ""some kind of a great film."" How have the years treated it? Technology: In the 1960s, big, one-of-a-kind computers were the norm, and it was natural to think that this would still be the case in 2001. It was not until the early 1970s that the first attempts were made to run factories, laboratories, power plants, etc., using a big central computer, and these were failures. The old mainframes turned out to be unreliable and prone to breakdowns. It was then that the first distributed small computers were tried, with much greater success. It would be 15 years before the first high-speed microprocessors would transform the computer world into what we have now. Also, a lot of the machines, cameras, displays and readouts that we see throughout the film use long-obsolete technology or simply never developed as they appear in the movie.Culture: ""2001"" was a world in which technology, science and computers had drained the world of passion and pleasure. This was a predominant fear in the 1960s: The dehumanizing effects of impersonal technology and artificial intelligence. Of course, in the 21st century, the opposite has happened: We have adapted computers and communications to the expression, not the suppression, of our human foibles.Science: Since the 1960s, the age of Robert Ardrey and ""African Genesis,"" paleoanthropology has tended to discredit the notion that the crucial transition from hominid to human was the evolution of violent, predatory behavior as being too simplistic.Business: Of course, Pan American Airways, the Bell Telephone Company, General Foods, and other companies whose logos we see in the film, that looked so convincing then, either no longer exist or have been transformed out of all recognition.Politics: In ""2001,"" both the USA and the USSR have lunar bases. Now, of course, the Soviet Union no longer exists, we have not been back to the moon since 1972, and space exploration is much more international than ever.""2001"" was co-written by director Stanley Kubrick and the great SF author Arthur C. Clarke. Youngsters used to modern CGI technology would do well to remember that ""2001"" was the very first science fiction film to have really believable special effects. Compare earlier ""classic"" SF films---e.g., ""The War of the Worlds,"" ""Forbidden Planet,"" and ""This Island Earth""---and you'll see what I mean. ""2001"" dazzled us in the 1960s, and it has aged well. Although it is dated in many ways---something that seemed unimaginable when it was first released---it still tells a wonderful story of transcendental human transformation, which has been one of Clarke's favorite themes. It is still one of the masterpieces not just of science fiction film, but of cinema in general.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
407,Magenta_Bob,"""I don't think I've seen anything quite like this before.""",10,1 August 2011,"It is time for me to admit something: I have been wrong. I first saw 2001: A Space Odyssey in high school and did not think much of it. Returning to it some years later, it is like I am seeing a whole different film. While I do think it went above my head the first time, I do not think that I understand it any better now, but HAL's statement above ironically rings truer now than it did back then.The four different acts (depending on how you count them, I guess) blend together perfectly and are all quite riveting. The opening part with the apes, which I found rather puzzling the first time around, makes for a necessary transition into the rest of the film, given the final act. The two center acts, which more closely resemble a traditional science fiction, about some astronauts investigating a strange discovery in space, are absolutely thrilling, and the final act is almost mind-bending.There is something meticulous, intense, and distinctly Kubrickian about the way many scenes unfold. The technical perfection is present throughout the entire film, but this is something that particularly struck me during the section within the spaceship, where Kubrick prolong scenes and individual shots until they almost get a different meaning, or at least tell more than they initially did; just look at Dr. Bowman's face during the scenes inside the pod. Maybe it is only by association of the music, but I think that many of the wordless segments, which are allowed to take their time and are never rushed, yet never dragging, play out almost like a symphony of their own, or at least an extension of The Blue Danube, among other pieces.While the film works extremely well at face value, there seems to be a lot going on below the surface as well. First, there is HAL, who seems like a symbol for the cold and rational, which is something I recognize from much of Kubrick's filmmaking. It is only natural, then, that his demise, which is both tragic and disturbing, and, also ironically, one of the most human moments of the film, makes way for the if not irrational, then at least irregular final act, that goes even further beyond traditional narration – beyond infinity if you will. And again, on a surface level it is one of the most visually stunning segments I have seen.Then there is the monolith, which seems to be a symbol for the unknown, mysterious and perhaps evolutionary. The sun towering above it is a striking image, and in the end, shortly after the monolith is last seen, it feels like the viewer is thrown into something completely new, perhaps the future, which is the perfect way to close an odyssey that has already spanned from the dawn of man to present time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
408,raymond_chandler,Kubrick's Magnum Opus,10,31 July 2001,"Stanley Kubrick's detached, heavily visual directorial style found its ultimate expression in this cautionary tale of technology out of control.
This film has probably been studied and dissected more than any other, with the exception of ""Citizen Kane"". The story itself is fairly straightforward. What makes ""2001"" such a powerful film is, paradoxically, its refusal to hurry up and tell that story. By focusing on mundane details, yet holding our interest with spectacular visuals, it gradually makes us feel as if WE ARE THERE. The music is just as important as the visual component, stealthily creating a desired emotional response - exhilaration, apprehension, awe. It forces its way into the subconscious, engaging the viewer on a much more primal level than most movies even attempt to, let alone succeed. I saw ""2001"" for the first time in 1968, the year it was released. I was a pre-teen, raised on Marvel comics and lots of sci-fi stories. The thing I remember most is that Kubrick respected the laws of physics. He played it absolutely straight, making the events of the Discovery's voyage all the more chilling because they were REAL!*****SPOILER******** When Dave blows the air lock, there is no sound until the hatch is sealed. When Frank gets the message from his family, he can only watch because radio waves take a finite amount of time to reach Earth, even at the speed of light. *******END SPOILER*****. This sort of uncompromising attention to detail elevates ""2001"" above all other science fiction films. It takes away all of our preconceptions, and forces us to experience what is happening RIGHT NOW. I have seen it more than 30 times, and I STILL get goosebumps every time Frank goes out to replace that antenna.A word to those who have never seen ""2001"" in a theater - you have never seen ""2001"" period!!! On TV (or PC monitor), there is no way you can get more than a fraction of the intended effect. This film is a LOT more than just cool sets, classical music, apes, and a weird light show. If you ever get the chance, you OWE it to yourself to see it in a darkened theater, where you can give it your undivided attention.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
409,rcraig62,A bona fide masterpiece,8,8 June 2003,"The thing I really like about Stanley Kubrick films is how different they are from conventional films, thematically, stylistically, how they stand apart from every other film in the genre, if some Kubrick films can even be said to belong to a genre.       The same is true with 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen it four times now and it gets better each time. Like all great works of art, it sometimes takes repeated viewings to fully comprehend its depth.  The story- and it's true that there's not a complete story here- is the story of man through the ages.  It begins with a twenty-minute sequence on prehistoric man that will leave some people scratching their heads, before it segues into man in the age of space travel.  To watch certain scenes over and over is really to appreciate their simple beauty.  The astronaut exec (played by William Sylvester) presiding over a board conference, having a private chat with some people allied to the business, on board the spaceship as commander directing his men.  And I never fail to be charmed by the ""zero-gravity"" images or the videophone conversation between the commander and his six-year old daughter.
       The only nod to any sort of movie convention begins aboard a spaceship heading for Jupiter comprised of a five-man crew and HAL 9000, the talking computer, who either is or isn't as human or more perfectly human than the men flying the mission.  The real drama concerns HAL and whether or not his superior intelligence presents a danger to the mission.  Beyond that, Kubrick shows us what space travel is really like: boredom, a lot of empty hours, doing maintenance checks and playing chess with HAL.  The final segment, Jupiter and Beyond, is so spectacular for its visual effects, the splicing of the galaxy as the ship passes through it in a spectrum of colors, the terrain of Jupiter itself, an endless ruin of crevices and barren surfaces.  I think people who downplay the effects in the movie or don't like them are just looking to see something blow up, maybe have a head-on crash with another spaceship, something a la Star Trek.   The special effects in 2001 are as real and as relevant as they were in 1968.
       Another point worth mentioning is Kubrick's use of classical recordings to frame the action (even though he had commissioned a film ""score"" from composer Alex North). The music, like the best film music, actually becomes part of the viewing experience (as in Psycho, for instance).  It emphasizes the action, rather than accommodating it, sweeps you up at certain points and provides a counterpoint in others.  I don't know how much better or worse North's score would have been, but the classical music, which Kubrick originally put in just as a placeholder while editing the film, makes you aware of it, even though I've heard something like ""Blue Danube"" a thousand times, including Bugs Bunny cartoons. 
       2001 is a dazzling experience from start to finish.  And if you don't exactly ""get it"", see it again and again.  It wears well.  4 **** out of 4",2001 - A Space Odyssey
410,MetalAngel,Impressive sight and sound show you're bound to be mesmerized by!,10,13 August 2009,"It's a very strange and magnificent experience when you're allowed to watch the work of a true genius. This film is one of those experiences that simply transfixes you from the very first minute you start watching until the very last minute, when even the credits have rolled and you're still gawking at the blue screen, unable to believe your good luck. It was made in 1968, but even now in 2009 it still moves viewers and has an urgency, a ""now-ness"" about it that makes it vibrate deep within your very entrails.The film is simply too powerful and mesmerizing to describe. There is, of course, the principal and obvious topic of space travel, high technology and missions to the different planets in our galaxy. The villain in the film is, without a doubt, one of the most memorable and loathsome heroes I've ever encountered in a film, and its presence itself is a cry against the insensitivity technology has attributed to man, to a point where our technological advance might actually constitute our eventual demise. And even when there seems to be no plot involved, and the film turns into a surrealistic sight and sound show we are presented with images about the nature of man, about the nature of human existence that weren't there in your head to begin with.The special effects of the film were ground-breaking in its time. I'm talking about over 40 years ago. Even today, they look excitingly modern and thoroughly believable, which is a feat I can't really say about any other ""oldie"" I've ever watched. But even though the film is steeped in visual effects from start to finish, the special effects do not over-power or overcompensate the plot; they aid to the viewing experience, concomitantly with the dramatic music, the imagination and innovation and the either abstract or definite pictures to create an explosion of undeniable proportions that, as I've said before, will leave the viewer ecstatic until after the credits have rolled.This is one of those film experiences where, even though you're not completely sure of what you witnessed, you're absolutely certain you've been moved and you've just seen a masterpiece. I am not a big fan of ""oldies"", so I had a bit of apprehension before seeing this film. I watched it because everyone seems to rave about it, and now that I've already seen it, I gladly join the ranks of audiences world-wide who praise this as one of the best films EVER made. I highly recommend it to ANYONE!!!!! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
411,dj_xand325,"Fascinating, Mind Blowing, Exceptional, Unprecedented, Quirky Masterpiece of Cinema..One of the most important films of all time",10,24 April 2008,"After recently watching this for the second time, my opinion of it has wildly changed. My first impression was mediocrity and that it was just a random orchestration of wild images. Yet after watching it again with closer convictions, I've epiphanised that not only is this much higher than mediocrity, this is one of the most influential and important films ever made.The Film starts with the dawn of man in which a group of primates are shown surviving in the wilderness of early earth. Then the monolith mystically appears, this enigma causes awe by the primates. This sense of extraordinary awe is increased by Kubricks exceptional choice of music. Shortly after, the first act of weaponry is discovered through a primate picking up a bone and using it violently...this is the birth of human intelligence.Then the story of astronaut Bowman is ensued which involves the iconic figure of HAL. I would try to expand on the story line but it's simply a film you need to watch yourself.These monoliths that appeared in the dawn of man appear three times throughout the film, Kubrick stated that these monoliths symbolise a method of alien intelligence observing the development of human kind, yet it should be stressed that interpretation is PURELY subjective.This is a very visual film hence why it won the 1968 Oscar for visual effects. The effects are simply awe-inspiring and dazzling. The first 25 minutes of the film have no dialogue and the last 23 minutes also have no dialogue. With the beginning and end included, there is 88 minutes of non-dialogue in the whole film!. Is this lack of dialogue a thing to be criticised with?. No, these beautiful scenes of melded imagery and sound make this a groundbreaking accomplishment of epic proportions.Why is this considered as one of the greatest films of all time?. Well its an original insight into the existence of earth and also about the life outside of earth. This film will make you wonder and think, it throws more questions at you than answers much like the reason for our existence. This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi film ever made (yes as good if not better than star wars) and i believe this is one of Kubrick's very best cinematic achievements.Bravo Kubrick! 10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
412,Laitue_Gonflable,The journey begins...,10,12 September 2003,"Many regard 2001: A Space Odyssey as Kubrick's greatest work. I don't, but that doesn't mean I don't regard it as one of the greatest films of all time. Like a lot of groundbreaking cinema, it's not really the most enjoyable thing to sit down and watch. In so many ways it's far more an exercise of Kubrick's masterful film-making than it is a really enjoyable film. But like I say, it's very hard not to be impressed.I remember when I first saw the film, I wondered why I had never heard of Keir Dullea, who plays the human lead. The reason is simple: because he is not the star, nor the main performer. What makes this film such a winner is the off-camera genius of Kubrick and his hunger to give the world a new kind of cinema.Even by today's standards, I don't see how one can not look at this film and just think about what an incredibly achievement it is. For its time, it's momentous. It's light on dialogue and high on detail and was the forerunner of so many great films. It's difficult to fully analyse this film and all of its components, all you can do is sit back and watch. And think. And then once the film's finished, think some more. It's nothing more than imagery, but imagery that creates the longest journey down the evolutionary chain, takes us from what we can't see in our past to what we can't see in our future and in its way, answers questions we couldn't ourselves.
Praise must also go to Arthur C Clarke who wrote the original book and co-wrote the screenplay, but really Kubrick is the master of this film, and while it is not in my opinion being Kubrick's best, it is still undoubtably his most important. ***** / *****",2001 - A Space Odyssey
413,maxastree,"Portentous, Pretentious, Prescient sci-fi movie, foregrounds themes over character",9,17 May 2015,"According to some, this is THE greatest science fiction cinema of all time - and frankly, if you don't like science fiction, you might like this movie anyway since it isn't really science fiction.Arthur C Clarke and Stanley Kubricks story is more of a naval gazing, beard stroking summation of evolution, the quest for spiritual and physical transcendence, and a mystified, though emotionally effecting exploration of intelligible sources of 'higher power', or cosmic intelligence in the universe. According to the writers of 2001: A Space Odyssey, that source has been there since the cradle of civilization, transmitting messages that are, to us, signposts of evolutionary development; shown in the opening sequences of the film as the first instance of primitive tool use among our ancestors.Needless to say, a major studio film as abstract, vastly ambitious, and frequently empty as 2001 could only be a product of the 60's era pseudo-spirituality. Also, the movies advanced concept of sci-fi production design was hugely influential on decades of sci-fi film, television and fantasy art, but aside from that, the actual ""science"" part of the story is boringly slow, features no remarkable human actors and doesn't really engage the audience with the promise suggested in the powerful opening sequences.It appears, in addition to the massive ""super-theme"" (read: sci-fi influenced religious narrative), that Arthur C Clarke and his equally bespectacled co-writer Kubrick include a secondary story about the possibility of highly advanced, seemingly self aware computers, that communicate with the human characters in the ""story"" while carrying out technical mission assistance during space travel.The movie is VERY slow, and it reverberates with the viewer afterward, as it shows a link between our largely geometric, four sided culture and intellectual advancement and the involvement of a powerful, though not entirely comprehensible alien force over the millenia. A fascinating theme, and a very well made film for its time, though basically so cold, ambiguous and leaden-paced that it feels like a task actually getting through. You could add at this point that the merit of a film is maybe not its entertainment value, but its commitment to realism, the intelligence of its themes and its sheer innovation (the film was staggeringly made back in 1967, looks decades ahead of time in terms of believable technology etc). This might be why critics make such elevated claims about the film. Basically, if you've ever wondered about intelligible life hundreds of millions of light years from our planet (everybody has), then this film deals with that subject, though in a way that treats the subject with consideration and depth that was unusual for science fiction cinema of its day.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
414,qeter,"I was afraid to watch it 2016, but left the cinema relieved and again: speechless",10,5 October 2016,"I was afraid, because I saw this movie in the 80's. And now I am 30 years older. And maybe it was just a hype of youth at that past time. So many SciFi-movies have been done since the production of 2001. How can 2001 contest with more modern movies. But wrong wrong wrong. 2001 is a monolith placed in the center of all SciFi-movies, like the monolith in the picture itself is placed in the soul of human thinking. I was afraid, that the computer screens and the space shops will look old-fashioned. But no no no. The red eye of Hal is timeless. And the furniture? We do not know. Maybe in 100 years they will look again like the 60's. And the computer screens? Simple graphics. Not overloaded. Maybe this is the future. And the action? So damn'd slow. So wonderful slow. And the end? Ah! The end. Zarathustra and the unborn and the Jupiter filling the picture. Timeless high-tech met timeless music met timeless thinking. Kubrick!, it is unbelievable how you could do this! I was very lucky to see this movie again today, in 2016. I was lucky to see a true 70 mm copy with analog picture and analog sound, shown and played in one of the best cinemas on earth (Gartenbaukino in Vienna). Before the movie started the audience was asked, how many had not seen this movie before. I guess, around 15% lifted their hands. Lucky them! 10 stars of 10.

416,villard,Unparalleled Sci-Fi Classic,10,20 April 2008,"This is a profoundly intellectual and stylized motion picture that will remain a classic for all cinema history, long after all other space sci-fi yarns have been forgotten.OK, so the film has a horribly glacial pace, especially when compared to most of today's films that obsessively whirl by at a frantic pace. The sequel ""2010"" has a faster pace, but is an utterly forgetful movie. Also ""2001"" may be too cerebral and abstruse in this age where people swoon over computer special effects gimmicks in intellectually vacuous adventure flicks. Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke crafted an epic story: The ascent of man from ape to human to ""superman."" The influence of an unseen extraterrestrial intelligence drives this evolution.Also, Clarke was an award-wining science fiction author, not some Hollywood scriptwriting hack who butchers classic science fiction stories for screen adaptation. The ending is weird only because Kubrick realized he could never show the extraterrestrials without it looking hoaky. This is as impossible as showing the face of God. And, attempts in all other sci-fi ""E.T."" films have failed miserably, including the overrated ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind.""So, ""2001"" becomes a bit abstract with the hotel room ""cage"" in the final scenes. Likewise, the legendary Black Monolith is a perfect representation of extraterrestrial technology: complete unfathomable. Critics miss the subtlety that Kubrick was painting a bland picture of the techno-world of 2001, with boring, everyday bureaucrats and space jocks caught up in a fantastic civilization-altering event that is much larger that they can comprehend. Hence the low-key acting and dialog. The film is impeccable and perfect for accuracy and attention to detail ands goes to astronomical lengths to assemble a plausible and realistic vision of the future. The cinematography and set design, done all in the Cinerama screen aspect ratio, is unparalleled in sci-fi film history. But the film is showing its age in a few areas. 1. the psychedelic ""stargate"" trip at the end cements the film in the hippy-dippy 1960s. 2. The notion of a sentient all powerful HAL mainframe computer predates microprocessors. So there will never be such an all-controlling computer. But there will eventually be artificial intelligence that will blur the notion of a what it means to be a consciousness entity. 3. Though visionary, the film did not foresee women's liberation. There are no women characters except for flight attendants. Of course the Soviets, which were a step ahead in women's equality in the 1960s, have a couple of astrophysicist characters in the film. 4. The great lengths the government goes through for secrecy, like not telling the Discovery crew about the monolith (!?), is overly melodramatic and implausible. 5. The attempts to re-create a zero-gravity were clever for the time, but look pretty pasty now that we have real footage of astronauts in space.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

418,2001ASOfan,My #1 film,10,7 March 2001,"As you can probably tell from my identity (2001ASOfan) ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is my number 1 film on my personal Top 10 list.  I saw it at the age of 14, and it was the first film that fully engaged my imagination and tapped into thoughts I had previously had about life after death, the universe, eternity, and, on a slightly more mundane level, space travel. ;-) My knees were literally shaking when I got up to leave the movie theatre after viewing it, and I wasn't even on any of the recreational drugs so many of my fellow theatregoers were on!  I didn't need them--it gave me a natural ""high"" that touched me at the deepest of emotional and intellectual levels. I have seen ""2001"" many times since that first riveting, obviously unforgettable, experience, and I marvel at how the film holds up, even in terms of its special effects, especially considering its 1968 birth.  I have to admit the initial ""ape"" scenes have paled a bit, but they are thankfully a brief intro to the film, and the film still soars for me from the moment the final ""ape"" throws the bone into the air and it turns into a space ship, floating in the heavens.  For new viewers, though, keep in mind that director Stanley Kubrick intended ""2001"" to be a VERY visual experience, and it is a much lesser experience on a small TV screen (or even a big-screen TV, for that matter).  Try to make your first experience one in a movie theatre--keep in mind that it is being re-released this fall of 2001 in theatres around the world.  I encourage you to make the effort to see it on a big theatre screen--you won't be disappointed.  ""2001"" turned me on to film as an art form, and film as a potentially life-changing experience, and I've been hooked ever since.  Kubrick continued to fascinate me with his films through the years right up to his death, mesmerizing me with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" just before his passing.  I am wary that the project he was working on at his death, ""AI,"" is being made by Steven Spielberg, as I would've loved to have seen Kubrick's interpretation of it.  I will undoubtedly see the Spielberg version, but will be thinking of Kubrick while watching.  I have always thought of Kubrick's films as an acquired taste, and was careful who I recommended them to, so it always amazed me when any of them were commercially successful.  It's especially heartening to see ""2001"" embraced now continuously through the years as one of the best films of all time--since many of us felt pretty lonely back then defending it. It was a love/hate reaction for many back then.  In closing:  Thanks, Mr. Kubrick, wherever you are!  In the spirit of ""2001,"" I hope you're a peaceful and all-knowing ""Star Child"" now that you've passed on to whatever's next.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Here's presenting you the finest Sci-fi adventure you will ever have the fortune of experiencing!I am not very much a fan of Sci-fi films, but I must admit I was blown away by this 1968 Stanley Kubrick + Arthur C. Clarke venture called ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". An exception is the 1979 Ridley Scott Classic, ""Alien"" which is a close second!But ""2001..."" takes the cake and outshines them all! This is arguably Kubrick's career-best work as a director!Saying or mentioning anything about the plot/concept is sacrilege. This film is best left to the audience to experience without any prior knowledge. Suffice to say, it is a dazzling movie-viewing experience, one best enjoyed with the fullest advantage of sight and sound, i.e. best watched in the dark, on a considerably big screen, with stereophonic sound.Stanley Kubrick has achieved through special sets and photographic effects, what none of the other film-makers of later years have achieved even with the best of CGI. The Oscar for Best Special/Visual effects was well-deserved..only I wish he had won for Best Director too. The acting by the actors who play the three central characters, Keir Dullea (Dr. Dave Bowman), Gary Lockwood (Dr. Frank Poole) and William Sylvester (Dr. Heywood Floyd) is quite good, if not great. But quite frankly, acting is not the department the film is trying to excel in. What it tries to achieve and succeeds brilliantly in, is to try and tell the story that it intends to tell in the most innovative manner ever! Quite possibly ""2001.."" would've turned out to be just another sci-fi film had it been made by a lesser director. The film has a certain aura about it, which may perhaps have been missing had it not been for Kubrick's involvement!Who else would've had the guts or the vision to use classical music and the sound of silence with some heavy breathing as a background score to this film..with minimal use of dialog!? There is some brilliant music by Johann Strauss (On The Beautiful Blue Danube) in the film which perfectly complements the ""Space Odyssey"" scenes! And then there is the now legendary ""Also Sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spake Zarathustra)"" theme by Richard Strauss which appears during some of the key scenes in the film. Also worth mentioning are the spacey soundscapes used in certain other key scenes. One can't help but be reminded of Pink Floyd's psychedelic days from the late 60s. No wonder then, that Pink Floyd were actually approached to perform music for this film (They, however, turned the offer down!).As mentioned earlier, the Visual effects and special photographic effects by Kubrick, Douglas Trumbull and team is extraordinary! Such a feat was never done before, nor was it achieved later.. It is little wonder then, that Kubrick ordered all prints of unused scenes, sets, props, miniatures, and production blueprints destroyed.The screenplay penned together by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke is brilliant.. The fantastic score and finally the Godly directorial work of Stanley Kubrick make this film an experience of a lifetime..Buy this film..it is one of those rare films which deserve a place in a time capsule buried to be discovered by future generations....",2001 - A Space Odyssey
422,benjamin_lappin,The Pinnicle of Evolution,10,18 May 2006,"Masterful, exquisite, breath-taking, captivating, provoking. For as Kubrick proves words are not integral to a film, so these words I use cannot do this film justice, nor can they adequately encapsulate the vast landscape which the director has painted. Undoubtedly the greatest science fiction film to have ever graced cinematic screens, ""2001"" dwarfs anything I have ever viewed in terms of grandiose imagery to deep philosophical notions. What is next? Who are we? Why are we here? The film touches all concepts. It is intrinsically scientific yet carries spiritual connotations. The evolutionary cycle of mankind from manape through to ""star-child"", this film tackles such a notion in such a simple, yet effective manner, it is difficult for many to comprehend or enjoy.Those with limited attention spans will surely switch this film off come the early ""docking"" sequence, and the fact that words are not spoken til twenty-five minutes into the film, will stun many. This film has no blazing space battles, nor does it contain complicated dialogue involving hyperdrives and mangling with quantum mechanics. Kubrick stays true to reality. This film is certainly not for those under the age of 18, not due to violence or graphic content, but because young minds are not prepared for such a film as this. Many complain (as fore-mentioned) about the docking sequence, being ""sooo"" long, this is done purposefully not to test ones patience, nor has it even been done for the aesthetic value, it is done to highlight the expanse that is space. The never ending vastness. The film is not about how fast we can go, but how much we can learn.The presence of the domineering black monolith, here signifies moments of mans evolution. The touching, and exposure to sunlight, of the monolith triggers sparks of progression, the apes realisation of a tool/weapon, the revelation of the monoliths connection to Jupiter, the wonderfully hypnotic ""beyond the infinite"", it becomes the guideline, the pacemaker, the parent that holds a child's hand as they cross the road, so that they may continue their journey. This film brings forth the notion of humanity in its purest form. The Monolith provides the manapes with the knowledge of ""craftsmanship"" yet shows technology to be our greatest asset and our greatest weakness. We place our humanity into a non-entities, metallic bolts, and leave none for ourselves, HAL in turn proves to be a mirroring of humanity showing in parts the darker sides of humanity. The reliance on technology is our downfall, yet we cannot progress without it, and it would be almost criminal to write a review and not at least nod to what is, perhaps, the greatest scene-cut ever conceived in the history of cinema.Kubrick has created a film mirroring the life cycle using creative and deep symbolism, while the sights and sounds fills our heads with wonder, feeding our instinctive, inquisitive nature, that makes us, as a race, what we are.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This film was disturbing, confusing, and mesmerizing and was a huge stepping stone in film making. It's weird story and timeless graphics sets it apart from other films of this genre. The topic of AI and space travel was ahead of its time. It may be hard to follow and the pacing is weird, but every scene was intentional and necessary. This was a unique experience, and even though nothing makes sense I recommend that everyone should watch this at least once.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
424,penseur,A visually stunning landmark in cinema history,10,1 May 2004,"More than almost any other director Kubrick appreciated that cinema should be a rich visual experience and here he provided it like no-one else had done before or has done since, from the opening landscapes to the metaphysical room at the end.  The only way to fully appreciate it is on a big screen; I have been lucky enough to see it on one measuring 60 x 30 ft. It was probably the first film to effectively present a solar system theme and the vastness of space. At the time the film was made, of course, the space program was in full swing and the actual first moon walk had yet to take place so it was extremely topical. But apart from a few technological things the film hasn't dated at all and is just as powerful now.  I think it should rate in the top 10 of all movies that have been made.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

But it's a very well-made movie regardless of genre. 2001, is beautifully filmed, and well scored. The visuals of the movie were mesmerizing. It is really hard to believe that this movie was made in 1968. I would say it has aged well, but I don't think it has aged at all. It is just one of those timeless movies. Much of 2001 has a glorious mood to it; it also has a dark, surreal atmosphere. These qualities are enhanced by the soundtrack. It is divided into three sections, which are all very different. This diversity makes the movie a little difficult to understand, but adds a lot to the movie: the diversity gives 2001 a riveting complexity that provides for a very memorable experience. Some viewers may find the movie to have a slow pace, but in my opinion the pace of the movie was perfect. It added to the climax of the movie. The slow pace and visual storytelling added a lot to the movie, made it very powerful. 2001 was really good all the way through, but I have to admit towards the end I was a little lost. But despite the movie's potentially confusing nature, it really has a lot of meaning, and it is visually arresting. Overall, 2001: A Space Odyssey is probably one of the greatest movies of all time. Its certainly worth watching at least once.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I got so confused even at the start. I was looking at a black screen when it was starting and I thought it was broken. All I heard was music and a black screen, cool way to start, however it wasn't effective. The highlight that makes this movie however was THE SPECIAL EFFECTS. These effects are definitely Oscar worthy and super impressive for its time. The characters are cool, HAL 9000 is definitely a cold and calculated villain. The movie looks great as well, set designs on that spaceship are always awesome to look at. Cinematography is also great. However, the effects and designs aren't enough to save this movie.

I have also watched it recently and the experience was just as pleasurable, like visiting an old friend. I still cannot describe the plot assuming of course that it has one. For me I am not at all interested about the plot since I have never been able to follow it but I continue to be blown away by the film on all the other levels of entertainment. It is unlike any other film I have ever seen and not being too bothered about the plot actually enhances the enjoyment. All those involved in its creation are to be congratulated for their care and attention. The technology that existed at the time must have been a hindrance but the end result is awesome. I would recommend anyone watch it but I would advise that whoever does should pay attention as I am clearly not bright enough to follow the story line. If it is a lot clearer to those that do please post it here as a review and I will watch it again with a new attitude and hopefully a additional perspective. This is one of those films on a short list of mine of films which don't age with time. You could watch this film in forty years time and it would still look stunning.

429,andrewnmiller,The granddaddy of modern science-fiction films.,10,22 May 2019,"When it comes to my experience with Stanly Kubrick's seminal sci-fi game changer, 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's sadly quite limited as I never watched the movie growing up and even if I had, I would have been bored to tears given the movie's glacial pace and it's complex themes about technology so for the longest time, 2001: A Space Odyssey was always a film that passed under my viewing radar until my dad showed it to me and while the visuals impressed me, I was less than impressed by the story. However, late last year, I rewatched it again with my dad and this time, I came to see it for what it is. From its thought-provoking themes and lavish visuals to it's acting and captivating musical score, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a triumph of not only filmmaking but also of visual storytelling. Without it, the world of science-fiction cinema would look very different and we wouldn't have films like Star Wars, Alien, Blade Runner, or Interstellar.The film opens millions of years ago in Africa as a tribe of human-like apes are chased from their water hole by an enemy tribal. They wake up to see a high black monolith has appeared before them. With the item influencing their actions, the group learns how to use bones as weapons and drive the other tribe away. We then cut to millions of years later where a man named Heywood Floyd is flying to a massive space station above Earth on his way to a US outpost on the Moon. While there, he blocks questions from his friends about claims of a strange item found in a nearby crater. Floyd then travels in a Moonbus to the item. From there, the story keeps jumping ahead in time, showing us various sequences of mankind as he becomes more and more dependent on technology.As an unsurpassed milestone in cinematic history with the likes of Citizen Kane and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, 2001: A Space Odyssey has not only broken the genre traditions of many other sci-fi films, but has also given the world of film a whole new meaning by bypassing spoken delaying, but in no way does that mean that the film breaks all interpretation and debate. From its splendid ideas about the future to its aspiring execution, 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't a film that is focused on entertaining us with epic space battles and witty banter like Star Wars but rather to leave the viewer in wonder and to make them think. It's a movie that stays with you long after the end credits finish rolling, unlike some more recent films. What the viewer must grasp while watching 2001: A Space Odyssey is that it's not the kind of film where one understands what's going on nor does the film require flashy visual effects to keep the viewer's attention but as Kubrick put it, the film is supposed to an extremely individualistic viewing experience that reaches out to the viewer and project an inward feeling of awareness. To put that into terms, the film is more about discovering the more logical and precise areas of humankind while also being a game changer on both a visionary and technological level of filmmaking which makes for one hell of an felt, but to also excel in transporting the viewer to another world entirely through the magic of 2001: A Space Odyssey, that is pure artistic genius in its highest form.Then 2001: A Space Odyssey was first released in 1968, it split moviegoers right down the line much in the same way films like Blade Runner and Star Wars: The Last Jedi would later do. People walking out of the film were common as many were simply baffled by the film's ultimate meaning and it's story and while it's completely clear why many at first hated or were left confused by what 2001: A Space Odyssey was presenting to them, Kubrick always did what he did best by establishing a second thought in the viewer's head as many left the theaters feeling baffled and even a bit downbeat, but the film sowed the seeds in people's minds that eventually grew over the years. In the late 60s when space exploration and alien life were the hot topics of the day, moviegoers whet into 2001: A Space Odyssey wanting answers. Will mankind ever reach the Moon? What does the future hold for us as a species? Are we alone in the universe? To their shock, 2001: A Space Odyssey did the exact opposite by leaving the viewer with even more questions to be answered rather than the other way around.One thing that makes 2001: A Space Odyssey stand out from various other science-fiction films is its surprising lack of dialog. Earlier versions of the film included much more but Kubrick cut a lot of it out of the final cut. What's left over is what Stanly intended to use in telling his story. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that goes out of the way to show us things happening on-screen in a visual way. The film lets the viewer figure out the message of the film on their own rather than beating the moral into our heads as well as conveying its topical and rational ideas wholly through the filmmaking elements of picture and sound rather than clunky dialog. I only wish this kind of visual storytelling would be applied to movies like Terminator Genisys. When there is spoken dialog in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's repetitive, uninteresting and all but insignificant to the film's story. During the scene of the shuttle flying to the Clavius base, the dialog is boring small-talk while Heywood Floyd's conversation while flying to the Moon is just as dull and pointless so much so that the musical score completely drowns out the conversation. Without hesitation, the dialog in 2001: A Space Odyssey is the least important thing in the overall story that we are being shown onscreen. This is most clearly seen at the beginning and the end of the film, each of which are spend out over a 20 minute period without any spoken dialog in sight. The movie is flanked by a single-minded disregard for dialog as if Stanly Kubrick is telling us to just watch and not be overloaded with dialog. Both scenes show the most vital story beat in the movie: the strange monolith by some means propels mankind's evolution forward drastically, first from ape to human, then from man to star child. This kind of evolution is visually stripped of spoken words, as Kubrick encourages us in different ways.Unlike some other sci-fi film scores, the music for 2001: A Space Odyssey is all classical, picked especially for the movie and repeated frequently. Kubrick delves into each piece of music to find vivid significance and even learns on these tracks to draw from their cinematic power. The main classical themes for the film are Also Sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss, The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss and a few harmonious tracks from Gyorgy Ligeti. The track Also Sprach Zarathustra has become as synonymous with motivational and phenomenal moments as John Williams' music has become with opening film scores. The section of the score used by Kubrick is the beginning fanfare of the score titled Sunrise. Particularly, Strauss's musical piece hints to Fredrick Nietzsche's abstract essay of the same name that deals with ideas such as mankind's rise to something greater than themselves as well as monumental philosophical questions as well. Both questions are right at home in 2001: A Space Odyssey, where both Hal 9000 and the star child can be seen as a superman as well as the theme of the world riddle type question of life's meaning, the leadership of mankind, and the essence of the universe. Kubrick using this piece of music is the perfect way to convey the messages of 2001: A Space Odyssey without the need to explain it to the viewer. Likewise, Stanly also uses The Blue Danube waltz by Johann Strauss to relay a completely unattached idea but it's much more simple as in space, there's nowhere else to go but in circles. Indeed, space is all about rotating around massive celestial bodies, and 2001: A Space Odyssey shows the viewer this continuously throughout the film. The Blue Danube can be heard in its complete form during the course of the film. the first two-thirds play from the entrance of the weapons satellite to Dr. Floyd arriving at the space station and the last third plays as he approaches the Moon. Using such a lofty piece of music to show outer space travel as being stylish, fantastic and like being in a never-ending dance is a brilliant move by Kubrick as it not only shows us how far technology has come in the past 40 years but also how the regulars onboard the space fight view it with a feeling of indifference much like how we view air travel today. Lastly, there are several musical pieces from Gyorgy Ligeti that also help shape the film and its story. All these musical segments share familiar merits, and appear in 2001: A Space Odyssey as a musical topic to guide the Monolith and Stargate sequences. Displaying thick layers of sound qualities rather than using more classic melodies, these musical moments stand up to traditional meaning and show us the mysterious nature of the Monolith, its power, its beginnings, and the beings who created it. Kubrick uses these musical setpieces in the film because each track commutates an unattached look at the film's various themes without the need for dialog. Zarathustra presents the philosophical questions of the film while The Blue Danube transforms space travel into a graceful dance while Ligeti encourages us to find the actuality of a mysterious force without leaving so much as a hint. Kubrick's usage of music in 2001: A Space Odyssey is nothing short of fantastic as it not only helps tell the story but also provided a foundation for film composers like John Williams and Vangelis to build upon in later years. Simply put, without the music of 2001: A Space Odyssey, sci-fi movie scores would look and sound completely different.Another well-defined aspect of 2001: A Space Odyssey lies in the austerity of its soundtrack. Throughout the film, Stanly Kubrick abandons intricate mixes and discord in favor of the most basic of ideas. When the film starts, it's",2001 - A Space Odyssey

As a piece of art I guess it would be fine but to actually pay money to see it would be a stretch.I try to have an open mind when viewing films and I may have a bias because of the times we live in today, but if you can't figure out what the film is about then the filmmaker failed and this film fails.I'm not asking for the ""meaning"" to be handed to me on a plate but one needs to see a basic structure in order to suggest a meaning in the viewers mind.The first part of the film with the apes, I could see the point being made. The part of the film set on the ship with HAL was another good bit of story telling. The parts in between added nothing to the plot.It really reminded me of the film ""Empire"" or even ""****"" both by Andy Warhol where every detail is shown no matter how useless it is to the story. The part of 2001 where we follow Dr. Floyd on his trip first to the space station and then to the moon - it is almost like watching it in real time. I'm bothered by the current fashion of the music video fast cuts but did we really need to see Floyd's moon transport being lowed into the moon base after it lands? I do like Stanley Kubrick's films and he is a great director but many of his later films were more coherent than 2001.

Space has never looked so clean, and effect free. The lighting effects have never been so mystical, and stunning.The film kicks off, i think, when you are introduced to the computer HAL, that becomes the core of the film, and the most ""film""-like plot throughout it's duration.

It is a mesmerising symphony of vision and sound that is unlikely to be equalled because, unlike most directors today, Kubrick wasn't a slave to SFX.

My favorite part (although I used to hate it) is the ""Dawn of Man"" sequence. The African photography is beautiful, and the apes (australopithecus?) are so convincing it's hard to believe they're really actors in ape suits. The acting in this movie is often underrated; Keir Dullea's boyish good looks and calm, reassuring demeanor bring to mind real-life astronauts such as John Glenn and Neil Armstrong, and William Sylvester is perfect as the glad-handing bureaucrat Dr. Heywood Floyd. I think Kubrick meant for the film to be enjoyed as a visual experience rather than analyzed for any deeper meaning, but for what it's worth, I see it as a Buddhist(or possibly Hindu) myth of birth, death, and rebirth.

436,JosephPezzuto,Reel Look: '2001: A Space Odyssey',8,14 February 2015,"""Open the pod bay doors, HAL"". The visionary and perfectionist director Stanley Kubrick teams up with science-fiction novelist Arthur C. Clarke to create an epic monolithic achievement that takes us on an epic adventure beyond the stars and the realms of our imagination, based from Clarke's book 'The Sentinel'. But is this revolution of science-fiction cinema more visually engaging than its four-act storyline? Let's take a look.Setting the stage for the vast leap from ape to star child, the adventure is triggered by a mysterious black monolith appearing at the dawn of man. Evidently of unknown extraterrestrial origins, the imposing alien structure inspires a certain hominid (with state-of-the-art makeup only to be outdone later on the same year by John Chambers' Oscar-winning makeup for 'Planet of the Apes')to develop tools from the bones of an animal carcass, following in the most robust and famous jump cuts in cinematic history, from an airborne tibia to a space station some millennia later. The monolith is then discovered on the surface of the moon after being deliberately buried for four million years. Eighteen months flash forward and the U.S. spacecraft Discovery One is bound for Jupiter. Aboard are mission pilots and scientists Dr. David Bowman(Keir Duella), Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) and three other scientists of whom are in cryogenic hibernation. Most of Discovery One's operations are carried out and controlled by the ship's monotonous and psychologically disturbed computer, HAL 9000 (chillingly voiced by Douglas Rain), and is referred to by the crew as ""Hal"". Though enthused by the mission and stating how he enjoys working with humans, the homicidal Hal wants noting to do with jeopardizing the mission, killing any astronaut awake or in sleep on board that or would deter him until Bowman puts a stop to this and disconnects most of the computer's memory and processor modules. Free from HAL, Bowman leaves Discovery One in an EVA to investigate another monolith orbiting around Jupiter. Approaching it, the pod is suddenly pulled into a vortex of colored light, as the disoriented and terrified Bowman finds himself racing at intense speeds through a the Star Gate portal over vast distances of space and time, viewing cosmological phenomena of bizarre proportions and strange, unusually colorful landscapes, all shot with the innovative use of slit-scan photography. What may have been considered a radical trip from hippies on psychedelics at the time, it is nothing more than a disturbing yet mind-grappling array of kaleidoscopic images that both stun and enhance the senses of Bowman and the audience as truly and audaciously groundbreaking. Bowman, still in his pod, finds himself in an 18th century-style bedroom, where he sees himself as middle-aged then as an old man dying, reaching for the mysterious monolith at the foot of his bed, which reincarnates him as a fetus enclosed in a transparent orbit of light beside the Earth, as the new being gazes at it from above.With the punctilious Kubrick winning his only personal Oscar for breathtaking visual effects (with the genius collaboration of special effects wizard Douglas Trumbull),this poetic meditation gravitates flawlessly, depicting the ingenuity and folly of mankind through four acts of wonder and enlightenment that demands to be seen on the big screen to be fully appreciated. To John Strauss II's 'The Blue Danube' orbital waltz of space stations calmly floating amid Earth's orbit to Richard Strauss' triumphant and powerful famous five-note opening of 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra', this is truly a silent film with sound, is baffling, engaging, spectacular, strange, imaginative, compelling and so forth. In fact it is all these things and more, as Clarke's novel is adapted if by a composer, meshing the concept of science-fiction as a virtuosic rhapsody, orchestrating the vast celestial heavens and space time continuum itself to a world of limitless wonder, surreal, intriguing beauty and the ineffable, infinite beyond.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Visually it is an excellent movie, especially considering that it was made in the 60's!
However, I strongly believe it should be 1 hour shorter. Some scenes make it very hard to watch this film. For example: The 10 minute LSD Moon-Trip(ping) is especially hard to follow.

The actors give good performances and the technical crew did an amazing job of making the audience believe these guys are actually in outer space.I'm not real sure how far off the book that Kubrick got, but I'm aware that he and Arthur C. Clark had many arguments about the script. Although the movie clearly can stand alone, it is helpful to see or read the sequel 2010. Though the film 2010 isn't as good as 2001, it is very good visually, and features some good performance from John Lithgow, and Roy Schieder.

Even his early work (The Killing and Paths of Glory) were incredible; his career seemed as carefully planned as his films.  2001 was an excellent example of a finely tuned vehicle to express concern about the adverse effects of technology.  Although 2001 was slow in parts, the film should be viewed as a whole.  The beginning made me think I accidentally rented planet of the apes, but as the film progressed Kubrick's message becomes more and more apparent and early scenes soon made perfect sense. The themes in the film are several, and will continue to make 2001 relevant for generations.  Also, HAL is one of the greatest screen villains of all time because he does not have a physical presence and is omnipresent on that ship.  It was definitely man vs. technology, but it also could have been a man vs. god sequence as well.  HAL, HAL, HAL.  The film is also worth seeing for the theme music.

I had read all of Clarke's novels, all of Heinlein's written up to 1966 and I was eager to see what Clarke and Kubrick had come up with.And this did indeed show how those of my generation (before the cultural ""break"" and the craziness of the late 60s and 70s) imagined that our future would be. And there it was, on the screen! Seeing this on a huge screen, in stereophonic sound, in a large theater with a large audience, for the FIRST time, was awe inspiring. No one had quite done anything like it before, though George Pal had come close.We did indeed imagine that we were at the dawn of a new era, the era of space travel, and that perhaps we would live to see our first contact with extraterrestrial beings. It was a nice dream, though premature, and Kubrick and Clarke put this vision of it, with its positive, affirming ending, right out there for us to see. The Star Child is humankind, at the beginning of our real existence in the universe.This didn't come to pass in our lifetime, not yet. But it will.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
445,gcarpiceci,The sci-fi movie by definition,10,23 February 2016,"This is for me THE sci-fi movie by definition, and I support my pitch with the following facts: # the movie has the ambition to tell the story of human kind from its very remote beginning four million years ago up to its far future; a huge ambition, an almost unbearable burden, but 2001 succeeds: the movie is at the same time highly epic and iconic... # epic: the story is a fantastic journey: four million years ago, a mysterious, superior entity has come on earth to chose the best among all pre-human beings (actually an ape, Moonwatch) to transition his species into its future, i.e. mankind as we know it. Four million years later, the same mysterious entity appears again and again it comes to select the best among all men (Dave Bowman) to do what his precursor had done millions of years before, i.e. to carry his species to the next level. The final amazing journey across time and space, culminating in the birth of the new species, symbolised by the huge phoetus- egg that Bowman has turned in, is a unique filmic experience # iconic: 2001 has changed sci-fi cinema for ever, sci-fi movie have never been the same since. The cinematographic solutions that Scott and his crew have created for 2001 have set new standards for any future sci-fi movie: just think of the way of portraying spaceships, moving very slowly against the infinite background of the deep space instead of being bullet-like objects as they had been shown up to then. Other visuals have been adopted by movies like the fantastic Interstellar (which I loved a lot!): think of the spinning space station, the docking scenes, and even the key visuals of the journey across the wormhole (is this Cooper or David Bowman...?). I watched 2001 back in 1969, and I keep watching it every now and then; another amazing thing of this movie is how watchable still is nearly 50 years after its production, even more so for a sci-fi movie, most of which become obsolete",2001 - A Space Odyssey
446,Chance_Boudreaux19,The special effects are better than CGI in most movies today,7,7 April 2016,"I neither love nor hate this movie which is rare, most people seem to have pretty strong feelings towards it either way. The best thing about this movie is that it looks fantastic, the special effects look better than most movies today which again proves that practical effects will always be better than CGI which can look fake at time. A lot of work went into those effects and I can appreciate them and think about how they made it all look so real in the 60s. Where the movie falters is the plot because what is the plot of this movie? The characters have almost no personality and are just tools in the movie, the best character and the only one which has an arc is of course HAL-9000 which is an AI. HAL is menacing and creepy and all the scenes with him were great. I wish the movie followed Dr Floyd and had him go to Jupiter and beyond because his personality was being established and he could have been more developed, instead we get two astronauts who we are supposed to care about but we don't because we just met them and don't know much about them. Furthermore the music is great but really the ritualistic sounds that start playing when the monolith appears would have made any scene creepy, I could have filmed myself looking in the mirror and put that music over the video and it would have been creepy. The space travel scene scared me more than many horror scenes probably because of the subliminal messages combined with the music, Stanley Kubrick is a master of creating creepy scenes that scare me even though they are technically not scary, the way he combines music and visuals to create atmosphere is perfect. All in all the movie is a special effects showcase and the effects do look great but that is not enough for this movie to be one of my favorites. People complain about the Transformers movies being just a showcase of special effects but this movie is exactly that. Now I am not saying the Transformers movies are better because they are not, they are so visually loud they are bound to give anyone a headache but I am just saying that both Transfomers and 2001 are made to showcase special effects and of course 2001 does it much better. It is however a dish that looks like the best thing in the world but the taste doesn't live up to it. Still I enjoyed it despite being bored in a few sections of ships docking and other things and I kind of dig the weird ending, it is definitely a movie I can appreciate on many levels but I just think it could have been so much more.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Unpleasant thought, but such is this movie's power. Even its first young ""hippie"" audiences needed weed to get them through it, though the movie itself provides its own hallucinations if you give it the chance.

A word of advice: READ THE BOOK if you don't know what the heck is going on. Anyway, the film is thought-provoking, ambitious, and enigmatic throughout. The effects still very much hold up today, Kubrick's choice of music throughout the film is awesome, and the set design and artsy-craftsy camera work still boggles the mind. There are some films that try to explain to much. That just gets on my nerves. 2001 has so much faith in the audience that it doesn't tell you what the heck is going on the screen.

451,EThompsonUMD,Mankind's quest for its place in the cosmos.,10,19 April 2008,"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) is indisputably a landmark film in the history of cinematic special effects and in the rise to prominence of science fiction as a narrative genre in American popular culture. Released in the midst of America's initial thrust into the frontier of outer space and one year before the first moon landing, the film's special effects range from the psychedelic ""Stargate"" sequence to nearly documentary realism in the rendering of spacecraft and space travel. Several of the artists and technicians who helped create the film's special effects (especially Douglas Trumbull) were to become the gurus of SF special effects for the next several decades.Among its many distinctions, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was the first commercially successful art film in American motion picture history. Curiously, its late '60s popular audience was instinctively more receptive to the film than the mainstream newspaper and magazine film reviewers, most of whom complained about the film's obscure plot, minimal dialog, and cardboard characters (excepting the H.A.L. 9000 computer and maybe a hominid or two). What was clear to many in the film's largely youthful and college-educated audience was that 2001's director, Stanley Kubrick, was deliberately rejecting the established Hollywood mode of storytelling and challenging his audience to a cinematic experience that was largely non-verbal yet, paradoxically, searchingly philosophical. Among a generation feverishly seeking alternatives to the established social/intellectual order, the film was hailed as a profound mind trip of perception and concepts. Astonishingly, much of 2001's visionary power remains despite the passage of forty years, seven beyond the portentous date in the film's title.Regarding the film's non-verbal communication, here are a couple of startling facts: no words are spoken until nearly 30 minutes into its 139 minute running time and a total of only 40 minutes contain dialog, much of which is either minimal or emanates from a non-human source. In place of words, Kubrick uses the ""pure cinema"" of image and sound (and silence). His distinctly original marriage of a classical score to the film's primitive landscape and futuristic space imagery is justly cited as among the film's crowning achievements. The emotional reverberation of such key compositions as Richard Strauss's ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" (opening sequence), Johann Strauss's ""Blue Danube"" (first space scene), and Ligeti's ""Atmospheres"" (distorted voices in the ""hotel"" sequence) cannot be overstated. Nor can the prolonged silences of outer space that greet the astronauts and film audience once outside the human cocoon of the spaceship.Perhaps most importantly, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY brought to film the philosophical dimension of prose science fiction that with rare exceptions (like The Day the Earth Stood Still) had largely been ignored by Hollywood in favor of more adventurous or horrific modes. Deriving its initial concept from ""The Sentinel,"" a short story written by the renowned British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY paved the way for science fiction's now common use as a vehicle for the serious analysis of such heavy themes as human nature and evolution, man-machine interaction and differentiation, and the possibilities/implications of extra-terrestrial intelligence. From such a bizarre assembly of objects and images as proto-human cave dwellers, recurring monoliths, mammoth spaceships, an advanced but neurotic computer, a mysterious hotel suite with invisible staff, and a star-child gazing with supra-human wisdom on the universe, Stanley Kubrick forged an endlessly fascinating and provocatively ambiguous epic of mankind's quest for its place in the cosmos. Few, if any, films have had greater or more lasting impact.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
452,StarCastle99,A Magnificent Epic That's Terribly Misunderstood,10,29 May 2002,"Okay, I've read enough viewer comments and can't contain myself. I'm a writer and a filmmaker.  I'd like to know where it is written that a film has to explain itself to you.  I saw 2001 when it first opened. I was with five other people.  We discussed the film for two hours.  When was the last time that happened?  For those of you who felt it was slow, so is space travel.  Get it! There ain't no Warp Factor 1. Secondly, the ending: has nobody ever read anything by Arthur C. Clarke? One of the recurring themes in Clarke's work is that any civilization sufficiently advanced over humankind would seem like Magic, or even Gods.  If you didn't understand the ending, perhaps you weren't supposed to.  Isn't it possible that Kubrick was giving you the experience of how clueless we would all be if confronted by an intelligence millions of years ahead of us.  Look, opinions are like rear ends, everybody has them, but when people put this film down as garbage or the equivalent, it tells me that they aren't thinking it through. Television and motion pictures are very passive media.  They supply you with 100% of audio and video.  Old time radio forced the listener to be imaginative and conjure up the picture. Surprisingly, it's not difficult to do that at all. Here is a film that dares to be somewhere between radio and the visual media.  It doesn't hand you all the answers on a silver platter.  Like a really good computer game you have to figure them out. Whether you liked it or not is your decision. Enough very knowledable people in the film world have viewed it and deemed it one of the great masterpieces of film. As many have said, it's an experience. If you can't deal with that, then go back to your five pages and a boink pacing, but dissing this film is a bit like saying Mozart didn't know squat about music. An opinion like that only make you look bad.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
453,richard-fieldhouse,Yes. It's all of these things.,8,14 February 2021,"Is this a frame-breaking, pivotal work that changed science fiction movies for ever? Is it slow and lacking a conventional plot? Is it prescient, showing some amazing - perhaps in some cases self-fulfilling - prophecies of a future which is now (partly) realised.Yes. It's all of these things.But what it is not, is entertaining in normal sense. The characters are not engaging and they lack the depth we might hope for. To be honest, it's not particularly well acted and much of the dialogue is banal. Also, the sections without dialogue are immense. I wonder if we're meant to be discussing what the ""message"" is as the movie plays - as you might in an art gallery looking at a painting or an installation.But be in no doubt: you should watch 2001 if you haven't already. The sight of Kubrick's prediction of the iPad is worth the watch alone, because this is some forty years before Apple ""invented"" the concept. And then, of course, there's HAL, the artificial intelligence.As some others here have implied, it might be best to watch the film where sections can be speeded up. As with Shakespeare's plays, the way we watch has changed and this film could do with a none-too-deferential re-edit for a modern audience. Apparently 19 minutes was cut after a doubtful response to previews. Now, half a century on, another twenty minutes off the running time would certainly not be missed. 8/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
454,grarunkumar1994,Ahead of time.,8,7 April 2021,"2001 Space Odyssey is another sci fi movie that overestimates the future life. Just like movies like ""Back to the future "" ( that predicted 2015 world) or ""Pacific Rim"" ( that predicted a distant future where giant robots are made) or ""Blade Runner"". The limitations of such films are that people in 1960s can only imagin from the view point of 1960s. It will vastly differ from perspective of 1980s and the actual 2001 year which wasn't much different from 1960 except a few change in electronics. Even back to future assumed 2015 to be a future where robots and AI will order and deliver food, and hoverboards. All such films has limitations. But this Stanley Kubrick film has made certain assumptions that did make it into the future like the video call.Considering as a movie, space odyssey is extremely boring, lagging at times.What is most shocking about the film is that it was made in 1968 when all the world was still in black and white era with minimal camera tricks. This is ""Avatar"" if made in 1980s. Technically this is the most advanced film of all times. Eons ahead of its contemporaries. That is exactly what makes this film stand ahead of time and praised even after decades. Such films can be made now, with lesser budget and better visual effects, but 1960s is a time where even imagining such scenes is impossible.The sheer amount of thoughts put into this is just magnificent. The moon landing hasnt happened yet, but the film manages to show how it feels to be on a zero gravity.Certain visual effects were done with simple methods. Floating pen was made by sticking it onto a clear glass. Forced perspective was much of the magic.Stanley Kubrick may or may not be a great story teller.

If you haven't watch this movie, I will say (What is the meaning of your life?)
Everything, and I mean every single thing in the movie business and outside are influenced by this film. From Ipad to videocall to moon landing to everything.
Beautiful cinematography, the best cinematography you can and ever will see in a movie. Colorful, angles, movements. Everything you ever dream of.
There is many deep meaning, that I will not get into it because I will stay until tomorrow writing, and it's been already analyzed by millions. And really affects me in a subjective way that I will keep it to my self.
When someone says the word director, Stanley Kubrick is the first who I think of, he is really the best most brilliant director ever lived.
This is my 15 time watching this movie, and every time I learn something new, and I can't wait for the next time I will watch it because I will learn a new thing.
Last thing, never watch this movie with an outside noise, do not pause the movie when you watch it, don't watch it with people that don't appreciate movies. Best way to watch it is when you are home alone.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
456,Medacakathareal,"Nice on the eyes, painful on the ears, and WEIRD",6,24 October 2008,"I just got done watching the film, I have to say I was extremely disappointed after hearing this hailed as one of the best science fiction films of all time (and often cited as one of the best films ever made overall). The plot felt extremely slow, there are scenes when the music is replaced by various PAINFULLY obnoxious sound effects (such as heavy breathing, machinery humming, white noise background, beeping computers, that extremely strange MOANING space choir, etc) and the whole movie seemed just ODD. So it got me to thinking, would the movie have made some sense or been better had I taken LSD or some other type of drug before watching it? Was the audience in 1968 on massive amounts of drugs, what about the die-hard fans of the film today? The ending in particular was just STRANGE and I was sitting and thinking as hard as I could about WHAT IN THE HELL WAS GOING ON... Is Dave floating through space? If so what is propelling him past all the psychedelic galaxies and colorful lights we see? Is the monolith driving him (because the little pod he's in doesn't look like it would have a powerful thrust to push him to the psychedelic edge of space... So then he finds himself in a room, turns into an old guy, and then turns into a GIANT FLOATING BABY? The main plot section of the film was fairly boring and filled with annoying sound effects though the idea of man versus twisted machine in a sort of race for the monolith was pretty cool I guess (and Hal's cold voice was pretty chilling, except for when he repeats himself OVER AND OVER)...I mean, I usually like old movies, especially old sci-fi, and I'm usually not too fussy even if the plot is sparse like it was in 2001 but I could barely stomach this one... I felt like I was watching the Alice in Wonderland of Space Movies...Don't get me wrong, the special effects were ground breaking, everything LOOKED fantastic and what little acting there was was certainly good but much of the film was extremely BIZARRE... It seemed almost intolerable to me...In short, painful sound effects, boring drawn out plot about evolution mixed with aliens, and a weird, but not good, movie...",2001 - A Space Odyssey
457,thomasmitilis1995,"I'M SORRY DAVE, I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT...",9,18 April 2020,"PROS:This film is a visual masterpiece and maybe the best sci-fi achievement in motion picture history. Themes like human evolution, technological advancement and artificial intelligence are exceptionally developed here. The plot is multilayered and it's reasonable to be presented in four sections.
The first section focuses on the first evolution of mankind. The strongest animals are the ones that survive (a leopard devours a tapir) until the sudden appearance of a strange entity, in the shape of a monolith. Apes are triggered by the monolith and view it as God and an inspiration for them to use bones as tools (specifically as weapons) and dominate against their enemies. The human mimes did a fantastic job as apes and the slow motion scene when the ape raises the bone is one of the most iconic moments in film history (it has even been used as a parody in various occasions). The transition from this moment to the second part and the space shuttle symbolises the human evolution through the passage of centuries. The space travel is already something commonplace for human race who has even obeyed the gravity. However, they feel small again and must learn to walk again, eat like babies, even follow instructions for the toilet. But they aren't afraid anymore and succeed to adjust. As a result when they touch the monolith in the moon, they show no fear or curiosity and they are ready for the next step of evolution.
The third section illustrates perfectly the full dependence of humans by technology. Humans depend on artificial intelligence in order to explore further the universe but eventually are manipulated because of their arrogance and the lack of human connection. In the end, the tools that they used, turned against them. Hal 9000 is the most memorable character of the film. The deep voice and the red eyeball create a terrifying artificial entity that can't be controlled. The most ambiguous part, of course, is the fourth. The monolith here works as a stargate or wormhole to guide humans to the next phase of evolution. The remaining austronaut travels through time and space and sees himself getting older. He is afraid of the new (like the apes in the beginning) and seeks solutions via the monolith. This fact is symbolised when he tries to touch the alien like David attempted to get closer to God. In the end, he transforms to star baby that symbolizes the rebirth of the mankind.
From a technical point, the film is impeccable. The cinematography and product design have aged well (the rotating set is brilliant) and it's evident the influence in subsequent movies. The classic music or the non existence of it create an atmosphere that helps you absorb every detail of the movie. The use of colours when the astronaut enters the stargate makes the experience trippy and terrifying for the viewer.
CONS:The narrative pace of the movie is slow in some parts. Sure, this is something intentional in order to pay attention every detail but some takes are needlessly long (just a nitpicking).",2001 - A Space Odyssey
458,DrPhibes1964,The Infinite and Beyond,10,19 November 2020,"One of the great joys in my life was having the opportunity to meet Keir Dullea in person. I was working at a movie theatre at the at the time and we had a classic film series every Saturday and Sunday morning. Mr. Dullea was to appear for a Q and A after the screening. He spent most of the time in the manager's office running over lines for a play he was about to appear in and only emerged when it was time to speak to the crowd. I was walking three feet off the ground. Here he was, Dave Bowman, in the flesh, a man who had worked with my cinematic idol Stanley Kubrick. He couldn't have been nicer when I got to talk to him briefly one on one, trying to repress my inner geek from cracking through my outer cool. Afterwards he signed items that customers brought. I got a making-of book signed and is a cherished piece of my humble Kubrick library. It is my best memory of working at this particular theatre.On its 50th anniversary 2001 was released in theatres for a limited run. It was an imperative that I see it. I have thus far only seen it on a television. In brief, it was among the greatest experiences that I have had watching a film. Not only having the opportunity to see it on a big screen but an Imax screen. It was astounding, overwhelming. I was immersed in this world that I had watched numerous times but felt that I was watching for the first time. I actually got to see it twice during this limited run.What can I possibly contribute to the discussion of 2001 that a multitude of others (most vastly more articulate than myself) have not said. But for the legion of fans there is probably an equal amount who hate the film, dismissing it as dull and pretentious. The film is not for everyone and requires numerous viewings to appreciate the themes Kubrick is exploring. I will go so far to say that it is arguably his most hopeful film. Kubrick has a certain pessimism about humanity and 2001 does not shy away from little satirical shots at the species and its shortcomings. The majority of his films are satires on human behaviour. From Paths of Glory to Eyes Wide Shut his films are filled with deeply flawed people, oftentimes their own worst enemy and the authors of their own demise in most cases. In 2001 it is the unseen aliens who take on the role of a cosmic nanny who kickstart the species ' move towards another significant evolutionary step and prevent them from going extinct. There is a suggestion that this particular tribe might be starving to death and are driven from the water hole by a rival tribe. Once they have their aggression and survival skills enhanced they will thrive. The others will learn eventually by the process of osmosis.Then comes the great cut from the bone flung into the air to the satellite orbiting Earth. We are now into the plot proper with the discovery of the monolith buried under the lunar surface, waiting patiently for the human species to have evolved to such a state where they have the ability to travel into space. It sets into motion a meeting of the human species with that is beyond our comprehension, evolved beyond the need of physical bodies. I long assumed that the aliens were the monoliths. I would highly recommend reading Star Maker Olaf Stapeldon as a companion piece to 2001. If you read it you will understand why.The human aspects of the story are almost dull and inconsequential and overshadowed by the larger theme of humanity's place among the stars. Kubrick leaves this open ended and ambiguous. Since the alien species have displayed no hostile intent throughout the film I am led to a hopeful continuation. This is best illustrated by the Star Child, born not of a woman and a man but of the stars. This final image never fails to make me tear up, not just that the adventure of the film is ending but the moment when it turns and faces us in the audience just a few fleeting seconds before it fades to the end credits. It is a genuinely moving and thrilling moment.I have neglected mentioning the actors because they are quite forgettable and bland. Both Dave Bowman and Frank Poole are almost robotic, but I am not blaming the actors. Kubrick has a certain stylised approach to how his actors perform. I wish that I thought to pose my theory to Mr. Dullea when I met him and how Kubrick uses multiple takes to beat the acting out of the actor and reduces them to basic behaviour. Perhaps it might be that he doesn't want any actor upstaging the themes he was exploring in that given film. There is a cold, detached quality to his films that I continue to struggle with. But, as stated above, I see his films as satires and satires work on another level, often having to sacrifice the human aspects to tell a larger story. Malcolm McDowell noted in an interview that Kubrick had a sense of humour as black as coal. In 2001 one can see the emphasis on technology over humanity, but this might be part of the satire. Just look at all the devices that we are so enamoured with nowadays. The Star Child does not arrive at Earth on a space ship.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
459,Bill-247,One of the BEST films of the 1960's...A Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,29 March 1999,"Stanley Kubrick's saga of evolution from ""The Dawn of Man"" to the year 2001 is a brilliant tale of the physical and technical development of mankind.  Everytime I hear ""The Blue Danube"", an immediate vision of outer space exploration fills my imagination...thanks to the wonder of this film.  Today, we are already fulfilling that vision of Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke.  When I first saw this film on the super wide screen in THX sound, I was blown out of my seat.  The film is a close tie with Star Wars in my book as THE best in outer space movies.  Notice I didn't say science fiction...I have never considered this movie to be science fiction, but a mere prophecy that has come true when it was first developed.  Today, as all computer programmers know, computers do what we tell them to do through software programs.  Many people have considered HAL by itself to be a villain in this movie.  I say ""NO"".  HAL was programmed by a human being.  The human(s) who developed HAL were the TRUE enemy...judge for yourself.  A true masterpiece of film making...it will last for centuries to come.

Has our technology helped, or hindered our search for answers; or has it furthered it?That is what I believe ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" asks.  The story -- though seemingly disjointed with Kubrick's signature vacuum-like directing -- makes us observers of the journey to understand what seemingly cannot be understood.  Within that journey, we can see the evolution of our species: where we have been, where we are, and where we will go.Thus, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a deep homage to our inner need to seek and understand what is unknown.  I find it to be fascinating in its vision.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
461,andrew7,Best sf film ever made,10,16 January 2002,"The list of good sf films is extremely short.  Topping that list, with a good bit of space between it and number 2, is ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Browsing the other IMDB comments, I see that this is basically a love it or hate it film.  Many people seem to dislike this film intensely, and many call it boring.  I can't imagine finding a film like this boring, but hey, that's me.  Fellowship of the Ring was boring.  This is edge-of-your-seat material.  I honestly can't take my eyes off the screen. 
Anyway, the other camp consists of people like me who simply can't stop gushing about the film.  There is a very small minority who like, or even love the film, but call it ""flawed"".  The definition of ""flaw"" is such a subjective one, though.  To my mind, there are definitely aspects of this film which many people will not, do not, and never were expected to like. But they're not flaws.  Not to me.  Yes, the plot is notoriously difficult to penetrate.  When asked about the story, Arthur C. Clarke said something like ""Watch the film.  Read the book. Watch the film again.  Read the book again.""  Quite obviously, Kubrick and Clarke (who developed the film together... neither the film nor the book was ""based on"" the other) intended the plot to be opaque, intended the finale to be ambiguous, and intended to encourage audiences to think about the film and draw their own conclusions.  Now, if you are a film-goer who dislikes ambiguity, who wants a simple story simply communicated to you (and there's not a thing wrong with that), you're going to call that a flaw.  But I refuse to consider something a flaw when it was so obviously the conscious intention of the film-makers.  You can argue that the approach they took made for a film which is not enjoyable to you, but if they had taken any other approach, they'd have made a different film.  Thus, ambiguity, for instance, can't be considered a flaw of this film.  It's like saying that The Sixth Sense would have been a better movie if it had been about pirates. Anyway, everybody talks about the special effects and the music and blah blah blah.  Everybody talks about the HAL sequence.  Blah blah blah.  I don't want to talk about any of that stuff.  It really diminishes the film, in my opinion, to discuss it like that.  More so than any other, this is a film where each aspect (script, performances, cinematography, music, special effects, etc.) blends together with all the others to create a sort of indivisible whole.  This is the movie equivalent of a prime number.  [God, that sounds pretentious!]  But anyway, discussing singular pieces of the film is to miss the greater effect of the whole.  This film is an experience much more than it is a story, and that experience is created by the confluence of every aspect of the film.  [This is why, incidentally, I think the film works so much better than the book... a novel is, by its very nature, suggestive of a narrative.  The simple procession of words is inherently evocative of a story structure.  A film does not have this limitation, and is therefore able to achieve much more by deviating from the constraints of classical narrative structure, which this film does toward the end.]  Another reviewer here states that if you haven't seen this on the big screen, you haven't seen it all.  I'm afraid I haven't seen it on the big screen.  But I would like to add that if you've only seen this film once, you haven't seen it at all.  A single viewing (or even less) may indeed be enough to convince you that you have no interest in plumbing the depths of this immense and powerful film.  But if you are not instantly alienated by the unconventional aspects of the film, you simply must see it again and again (and also read the book... though inferior, as I said, it is also instrumental to a full appreciation of the film).  If you simply don't like the film, that's fine.  You are far from alone.  I would suggest you check out the book and film ""Contact"".  It is a far more conventional version of practically the same basic story.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
462,peterk727,Boring and slow,2,4 June 2014,"OK, I saw this years back and bought it on Bluray to watch it again. For me its still boring and slow and I am one who likes Sci Fi, one reason why I gave it 2 instead of 1 stars. I guess you have to really believe this is an artsy movie and read all the BS commentary by the critics to believe this movie is worth watching. There are many parts that are without any dialog, some very silent without any sound, several times you might think your TV is on mute, but the reality is that the movie was designed that way. Having seen several of Kubrick's movies, I cannot say any were very good and for me this is a major dud. But hey, if you find watching paint dry to be exciting, this movie may be ideal for you. For those looking for a bit more entertainment or perhaps a plot that makes sense, look somewhere else.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
463,sashamyshkina,1968???,9,2 May 2021,"This has got to be one of the most mind-blowing movies I've seen in a long time. And somehow, despite my irrational fear of space, this has got to one of the most beautiful and exquisite things I have seen.Please note that this review contains spoilers.The first thing that was on my mind when I saw 2001 was: wait, this was done in 1968?! HOW? The visual effects were absolutely gorgeous, and even in the parts where there wasn't much plot progression, I didn't care because I was too enthralled in watching the VFX. And note: this was before people even landed on the moon! Honestly, if this came out today I wouldn't be surprised, that's just how amazingly high-quality everything was.2001 has come and gone, and some things happened and others didn't, but for some reason Kubrick's 60's interpretation of space travel satisfies me so greatly. There's something so perfect and pleasing about the design of the spaceships. And there's something so genius how a single, red eye succeeds to be one of the most ominous villains of sci-fi. The plot was entertaining and suspenseful, and the U rating just proves that you can have an absolute spectacle of a movie without having to resort to gratuitous violence or gory deaths.The ending is an interesting one. After a movie of what seemed to be normal-is chronology, you're catapulted into flashing rainbow lights and floor-lit classical rooms. But that's one my favourite things from the film - the ending is open to interpretation, and is just as mystical and fantastical as the rest of the film.I don't think this movie is slow. In fact, it was a relieving breath of air in between all the super-laser-CGI-shoot-out-action-kill-fests you keep getting. And as I mentioned before, I loved having a bit of time to just enjoy the beauty of it all, in particular the shots at the beginning of the Pan Am shuttle docking at the space hotel overlaid with Strauss's Blue Danube waltz.What's interesting is that I've known about this movie for the longest time without actually knowing about this movie. Something about 2001 ingrains itself into the crevices in your brain, things that you will know regardless of your age or gender, something so timeless about it, something people have referenced for fifty-something years. I think I've known the absolutely iconic, grandiose theme tune since I was five years old (I just didn't know where it was from), and the still of Keir Dullea walking through the passage of the spaceship has been cropping up almost everywhere I looked. Even the nomenclature for the iPod was inspired by the iconic line ""Open the pod bay doors."" The hold this movie has over the cinematic and cultural universe really is unfathomable.This is an incredible movie. It will blow your mind on every level imaginable. Watch it, even if you don't usually like sci-fi.-Sasha.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
464,mitch-bulfin,2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968) - 4/08/2019,10,10 March 2020,"This is by far the most technically advanced movie that Kubrick has ever made - and even though he also made great movies like ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"" - this movie also has the best plot of all them if you are able to see through the very trippy aspects of this masterpiece.Mitchell Bulfin",2001 - A Space Odyssey
465,joeravioli,2001: Truly an Odyssey,8,27 September 2015,"2001: A Space Odyssey is no more a film than I a potato. And, while the limits of my physical comprehension prevent me from truly knowing otherwise, I am not a potato. Rather than being a film, 2001 is a thrillingly ambitious visual journey that transcends time and space, bringing forth puzzling, yet provocative ideas of the beauty and horror in mankind's quest to further itself as a species. It is an experience that refuses to spoon-feed its themes, opening the intellectual playing field for multiple interpretations, creating a swarm of controversy and argument as each individual seeks to piece together the subtle and not-so-subtle hints at what in the world 2001 is saying. And if that weren't enough, it is thrilling, beautifully paced, and visually stunning for a film (for lack of a better word) made in the 1960s.2001 begins, rather curiously, at the ""dawn of man"". Men in monkey suits roam the desolate plains of Africa (I assume that it is Africa due to the general consensus that mankind originated in Africa). I must say, that even for men in monkey suits, they were quite convincing as actual monkeys. Hilarious, even. But that's besides the point. The ""dawn of man"" sequence is done to show the dawn of human ingenuity, and how this newfound ability to use elements in our environment to our own personal use put us at the top of the evolutionary pyramid. It also suggests at some divine intervention, with the appearance of a large, black, rectangular block that seems to create the ingenuity within humanity.Flash forward many, many years, and mankind has colonized the moon. A doctor of some sort is heading to the moon to retrieve an artifact. A brilliant docking sequence ensues, as spaceships float towards and around each other, provocatively shadowed, while a familiar classical waltz highlights the dance-like quality of the whole scene. It is slightly overextended, I admit, but I suppose that this was done for the benefit of the 60s audience, who had likely seen nothing even close to the likes of this film's visuals before. The doctor lands on the moon, and heads to the artifact, whatever it is. I will not reveal what this artifact is (although I'm sure that pretty much everyone knows), but whatever it is sparks a mission to Jupiter eighteen months later, manned by two men in charge of the maintenance of the ship, a few members of the survey team who are in cryostasis, and the sentient computer HAL 9000, who controls most of the ship. This sequence resorts to a conventional narrative that is significantly faster paced and more atmospheric than the other sections of 2001. What basically happens is this: HAL makes a mistake, and everything goes downhill from there.The thing I liked most about this sequence is the acting. In this day and age, our cinematic characters feel deliberately scripted, while in 2001, the dialogue feels real, complete with ""ums"", verbal mistakes, and real emotion. The actors feel like real people, and we are thus able to sympathize with all of them, even including HAL.And then the film ends. And what an ending it is. It is an ending that will fuel controversy for years to come, as it is so frustratingly complicated and ambiguous, that it can be interpreted in any number of ways. Some may toss it off as pretentious (which is valid), while others may devote their waking hours to unceasing analysis. Interstellar, in an obvious attempt to rip-off 2001's shocking ending, took a shot at it, but just ended up drowning in ridiculous pseudoscience. 2001 doesn't pretend to be bound by the realm of science. Its thought-provoking climax, unlike Interstellar's, is a purely transcendental experience that appeals to our imagination as well as our intellect. Although the bit before the final sequence is ridiculously and annoyingly over extended, this is only a small issue compared to the beauty of the final sequence.I loved this movie, because it forced me to think, not just sit and drool. We have become so used to being served up ideas (or passive entertainment) on a platter, that we forget our own intelligence, becoming one with the ideas of the filmmaker rather than creating our own.Although you may condemn Kubrick as a pretentious showman, keep in mind that he can do more with a large, black, rectangular block than most contemporary directors can do with mountains of CGI, and that is what makes him one of the greats. Let me put it this way: If all films were potatoes, 2001 would be a film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

467,johcafra,"Best In Show, Once and Future",10,17 March 2008,"I could go on quite at length about 2001. Plenty others have, so I'll just try to tether the following comments to the personal and at-times parallel odyssey of this particular user.Some years before its premiere a grade-school librarian had the good taste and uncommon foresight to round up select classes, seat them in the library or small auditorium, gently command their collective attention and silence, hand out papers with colored pencils or crayons, set a vinyl LP or two of highbrow music on a mono phonograph, and say, ""Draw!"" (""What?"" ""Anything."")Months before the premiere an assigned middle-school reader included Arthur C. Clarke's short story, ""The Sentinel,"" which inspired me to visit the local public library and ask if Mister Clarke had written anything else, prompting the on-duty librarian to point to a bookshelf and a half.I'd asked my parents to take me to the first-run in my hometown, shown on a decidedly non-Cinerama screen. Towards the end my mother was asleep on my left shoulder and my father asleep on my right. I could well have been the only person besides the projectionist awake in the theater (well, perhaps not), and the appearance of the Star Child very nearly scared the marmalade out of me, but not so badly that I'd want to awake my parents or anyone else. And then, quite suddenly, I GOT that closing shot, and the opening one, and a lot of everything in between.Haven't been quite the same since. I view 2001 to this day, and it remains the movie I've seen the most times in a theater, or in any other format. I quote lines from it at home and (quite fittingly) at the workplace. I draw and write to highbrow music. I may disagree with but still read Clarke (90 years old as of this writing, bless him) and other masters of his genre. And from that first-run viewing forward I started recognizing Stanley Kubrick's name and those of other directors.This isn't nostalgia. 2001 connected, transported, embedded itself, inspired, and resonated on so many levels. It continues to do so and always will. What more can anyone ask of the silver screen?A postscript on factual errors, continuity and goof-spotting: As Abe Lincoln said, people who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like. Instead, respect what got 2001 made in the first place. Its ending turned out a lot more collaborative than anticipated. We might've seen not apes but more humanoid proto-humans (though only from the waist up), a transparent or translucent monolith, Saturn instead of Jupiter, and a swarm of ETs, likely none of them satisfying. And if Doug Trumbull, one of the credited FX supervisors, had his way the lunar surface would've looked a great deal different and arguably more accurate.Fact is, when 2001 was in production and driven by a director with a passion for accuracy (to be charitable) we'd still had only a glimpse of Earth from orbit and the surface of other planets. Though we'd already seen grand ideas, actual spacefarers had nothing roomier than a first-generation Soyuz capsule. The only ET to date was a ""BEM"" or ""bear"" that wore makeup. The Bell System would last forever (and might yet). And in Space no one can blur your photographs (except perhaps yourself), so to this day meticulously rotoscoped cutouts of kit-bashed spacecraft models moving very slowly across a star field provided an accurate depiction of interplanetary travel. (""Why, you been there?"" ""Close enough to hold my breath, friend."")I still doubt astronauts will hibernate or HAL 9000 will be entrusted with anything more complex than a chessboard anytime soon. But 2001 made us both dream and consider these very points and far more. The moral: Making a visionary masterpiece is hard work!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
468,longcooljolie,My relationship with this movie,10,4 March 2021,"This is one of the most-reviewed titles on IMDB, with 2,264 as of today. There are 222 trivia items and even more ""goofs"" items. Many people have thoroughly covered the brilliant technical and artistic aspects of the movie, so this review will be more of a personal take.In 1968 when the movie came out I was in the fifth grade, I was aware of the movie because some of my classmates talked about it, but we never got to see it during that first theater run. It's not the kind of movie other family members of mine were interested in watching, and it certainly was not shown in drive-ins, where we all watched many movies in our Ford woodie station wagon.I actually saw the Mad Magazine parody way before ever seeing the movie, which finally happened when I was a teenager in the Shawnee Mission, KS area and they had brought back 2001 for a revival run in area theaters. It was hugely immersive, with the wide screen taking up the front of the theater and the lush sound of the music and score coming from the speakers.Though the final 20 minutes were glorious, for me the most memorable parts occurred around the middle. A Stanley Kubrick trope is that there is always one extended, hypnotically haunting scene of two characters just talking. For 2001, it is the scene where Frank and Dave, alone in one of the pods, discuss what they're going to do about HAL.Also, I wondered why Dave didn't go into a blind, screaming rage over what happens later, but revisiting the movie as an experienced, seasoned adult I understand entirely now. After seeing the movie as a teenager, we also studied it in film class in college. Predictably, the closing sequence got raked over the coals along with some of the movie's other ambiguous aspects.In 2003, when I was doing cosplay at a convention, Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood were at the show. Keir Dullea passed by me at one point and I blurted out, ""Were you the one killed by HAL?"" He just smiled and said, no that was Frank. Both of them, as of this review are still with us, which is very cool.Hopefully none of what I've written has spoiled anything for the few who have yet to seen this. My most recent viewing was this morning on VHS, which I got from the thrift store for a ""five for $1.00 VHS deal they had. It's the kind of movie you have to immerse myself in, and for the final 30 minutes, I bounced on my rebounder in front of the TV screen. Unfortunately, my copy was the formatted one and not letterbox, but of course the grandeur was still there.If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
469,keesha45,"Best movie of the '60's, possibly of all-time",10,18 April 2007,"I make the claim above knowing that there are indeed other films with better acting, bigger box-office numbers, more awards and greater love by audiences and acclaim by critics alike in both the original print versions and celluloid forms. Movies like CASABLANCA, TITANIC, BEN-HUR and GONE WITH THE WIND fit the bill with having those other attributes. But no other film I can imagine has had the impact on the way movies were made after it was released and no other major motion picture has combined rich classical music themes with such stunning visual images in such a way that it captivated audiences and budding young filmmakers alike to expect more in what was shown on the screen. Later films like STAR WARS, SUPERMAN, SPIDERMAN, and THE MATRIX built on Kubrick's vision and added to it. The makers of all these special-effects driven films that came after this owe Kubrick a great debt. He set the bar pretty high for both moviegoers' and movie makers' expectations, and that drives the film industry even today. Back to this film now, there are four observations I made in seeing this film again recently which I hadn't noticed previously. (1)I recently experienced the loss of a loved one who came to an end while battling the late stages of Alzheimers. Seeing the unplugging of HAL by Bowman and the way that HAL loses its faculties bit by bit until one of its last memories is recalling a song from its early stages of programming, caused me to think how much our human brain functions like HAL (or vice versa.) My late sister underwent some of the same processes as HAL as she delighted in telling me anecdotes from her past, which she remembered better than the contents of her morning breakfast. (2)I think SPARTACUS and 2001 are much alike in Kubrick's view of how man can triumph over adversity, whether it's put there by man or machine, and then rise to a level never imagined. In both cases, we can become slaves to man or machines, but Kubrick shows that we can overcome the odds. (3)Another vision of Kubrick not foreseen in 1968 is that the super sophisticated aliens in this film utilize these giant cellphone-like structures for space flight and other uses. We shouldn't be surprised that these ubiquitous devices fly, since today they do so many things. I think it would be neat to own a cellphone with a ring tone emulating the humming sound featured by the monoliths in this film. (4)I find it curious that in the first 18 minutes of the film the screenwriters seem to suggest that the aliens by use of their monolith influenced our ape-like ancestors to become violent, as if that advances their evolutionary development. As much as this and the Cain vs. Abel Biblical story point out that man's inhumanity to man goes back a long ways, I can't see how the aliens believe that introducing this trait into man's development could be a positive step for mankind. However, one positive step I can recommend for mankind is to see this picture on a big screen. It's not enough to own this film for your personal collection, it must be experienced on a big screen in a movie house or something similar like a screening on a library wall, where the downtown Spokane Public Library presented it. Film reviewer Roger Ebert says that seeing movies this way is best in a theater setting surrounded by an audience that delivers its reaction to it.I further believe that like mixing Scotch with water, it's a bit sacrilegious to combine 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY with your home boob tube screen. At your next opportunity, make that odyssey yourself to see it the way that all great motion pictures should be seen. Dale Roloff",2001 - A Space Odyssey
470,jbirtel,A Milestone in Storytelling ! Often Misunderstood (& understandably so)!,10,11 September 2005,"In 1968, a movie critic that had panned 2001 on its original release (and later retracted) wrote: ""Everyone hates 2001 except people"".The Odyssey demanded: ""To appreciate 2001, is to see it again. And again! ""2001 defies conventional rules of any generic movie. Multi-layered enough to deceive its audience by zeroing its focus on the 'HAL' crisis. Subplot is presented as 'The Major Plot'! And 'The Major Plot' is demoted to Subplot. But it is that 'Major Plot' that ultimately fascinates. That; and the realistic hardware that is subjectively presented as if you, the viewer, were a passenger along for the ride. That is the core of the movie's mystical power that entices people to revisit over and over again.And because of its subplot, it's no accident that HAL steals the show.A question that asks 'What If...' What if human evolution was the outcome of extra terrestrial manipulation. A 'Part 1' and 'Part 2' story covering humankind's 2 stage evolutionary process.Part 1 is told in 16 minutes! Part 2 takes the 2 hour remainder.Because novel and film were simultaneously 4 years in the making (Arthur C Clark couldn't release the book until 2 months after the general release), Kubrick takes full artistic license to go full speed ahead in defiling any previous sci fi movie; any previous book adaptation; and reinvigorating the silent film format all at the same time.Plus the most intensive science/movie research on space travel technology ever conceived up to that point that, 36 years later, hasn't been outdated yet. Every detail, down to the low hum of air filtration, was incorporated.Using 'real time slices of life' sections of only a few chapters, Kubrick, at his command, displays his brilliant understanding of the film median. He stretches the bonds and bounds of film rules, breaks many along the way and creates some of his own.It is one of the most subjective and kinetic movies ever produced. It's a film that demands to be sensed, watched and listened to.And one of the few times where book & movie go hand in hand.In space, no one can hear...anything! As far as I know, Stanley is the only film maker who had the balls to use the dead silence of space to create the story's tension. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" tantalizes us with food for thought; and in that tantalizing area, it doesn't disappoint.If you don't 'get it' the 1st time you see it; get in line. I saw it the 1st time in 71'. And I didn't fully appreciate it for 14 years and a few viewings later.A word about Alex North's original score. By itself, the score is awesome. If you start the CD when the MGM logo appears you can actually sync the music to what appears on screen for the 1st 6 or 7 minutes. It creates a flavor all its own. And that's why Kubrick was (unfortunately) justified in yanking it. By placing music over the 'Dawn of Man' sequence, it destroys the desolation and near extinction that early man/ape faced. And nothing could replace Kubrick's selection of existing music for Heywood Floyd's space journey. The main problem is SOMEONE should have told Alex that his music wasn't used before he attended the premiere.Perfect Acting! (contrary to a lot of reactions). People in the high risk, professional space program are trained to react with minimal emotion. To do otherwise, could mean the difference between life and death...even when death occurs. And the underrated William Sylvester does a brilliant bit of camouflage during his morale speech to the troops; and drops his 'nice guy' mask for 1 split second to reveal how ruthless he is for the sake of (so-called) security. If you literally blink, you miss it. He's got these people by the balls and there's nothing in their power they can do about it.Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood gave exceptional performances that made you believe they were astronauts actually aboard the Jupiter bound Spaceship Discovery When I purchase my wide screen projection and 8 ft screen, guess what movie is going on 1st?",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It was a film that should have been 30 minutes long, but instead was filled with boring, dragged out sequences and black screens.

472,Toph-22,Masterpiece with regard to his release year,8,8 November 2020,"You really have to say that this movie is ahead of its time. When you think about the fact that the movie was released in 1968, you can't believe it when you watch it.The effects, the camera work, the sceneries are groundbreaking and certainly served as a pioneer for many successors. At no time do you think, the film is over 50 years old. It looks really good.The topics covered are also still relevant today. There is a lot of room for interpretation. Different topics are taken up and executed up to a certain point. Then it continues at other points. One cannot understand the film in its entirety. But that is exactly what it wants.If you leave these points out, especially the time when the movie was made, you will unfortunately notice that the movie stretches over long distances. The long camera angles do not achieve a better effect or build up tension.Many scenes are just too long for me. The long shots do not have the effect on me that they should have.For me there is no real tension in the plot (except the short situation when Hal locked Dave out).Moreover, I was not able to bond with the characters, nor to feel e.g. the isolation of being in a spaceship millions of kilometers away from home only with one colleague and a computer that acts against you. It doesn't bother me that so little was spoken. You don't need dialogues to build up a connection to the characters, to feel what is going on in the characters concerned. But unfortunately, I miss that here.I like it when you can discuss about a movie, when the plot and the ending are open for interpretation. But here we come to a point that bothers me. The monolith. The monolith is said to be mythical. That is what is said or rather should be conveyed by the soundtrack. But for me the movie does not manage to convey this mood (my personal perception).For example, if you look at Shining by Stanley Kubrick. There it takes only a few seconds from the intro and you are immediately in a captivated uncomfortable mood. I would have wished for something like that here.I find it difficult to finally evaluate the movie. With regard to its release year, the film certainly made a statement and has influenced many subsequent films. But if you look at the plot, there are unfortunately some negative points.All in all, definitely a movie which every film fan should have seen.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
473,Lumpenprole,unique,10,17 June 2002,"It's a unique experience in film history.  Visually it's almost unparalleled even after more than a generation where many of the most ambitious people working in film have done science fiction. This aspect of the film really has to be seen on the big screen, in 70mm. Every inch of the screen is packed with almost unbelievable amounts of detail and the illusions are flawless.  Kubrick was one of the masters of visual composition.It's arguable that 2001 makes the most spectacular use of music in cinema. The images backed by Strauss, Ligeti, and Richard Strauss leave an unforgettable impression on literally anyone who sees those sequences. The acting and sets are convincing.  It looks odd now in 2002 when most movies are celebrity vehicles, but the nondescript actors in this film ring true as apes, bureaucrats, and astronauts.  The space station, Discovery, African Savannah (which for some reason looks much better projected than it does on the DVD), and even Beyond the Infinite look right.  2001 is craftmanship of the highest level.The plot is a miraculous mix of documentary style recording and epic story telling.  At the most basic level, 2001 is science fiction about the evolution of life on earth.  The monolith and life on earth meet several times in the film, heralding a massive change in how life is lived. Simultaneously, Kubrick presents Life on Earth as a voyager in the pattern of Odysseus.  The tool using ape, Floyd, Bowman and the star child are representative of the human species moving through history and overcoming obstacles loosely reminiscent of the episodes of the Odyssey.  Kubrick uses 2001 to give a history of human life - from apes gnawing raw meat, to sucking liquid veggies, to eating TV dinners and finally on to fine dining. And one could go on listing the themes - man vs. machine, mind vs. body, the nature of identity, and Kubrick's awfully bleak satire on modern life.  I don't think any other film has ever tried to touch 2001 in its audacious attempt to absorb life and history into one plot.It's a film that demands visual literacy in a way few others do.  How many times do you see people (apes, then humans and HAL) sleeping, eating, arguing, killing, using tools reacting to a monolith or being killed?  Where do the eclipses occur and what changes?  Why does almost everyone look exactly the same?  What does it mean that all the technology looks like pieces of HAL and the Discovery?  Where does the orange/red color appear? Why does everyone spend time talking to or looking at TV screens?  2001 is a hall of mirrors once you see the patterns.2001 invites people to ask questions about its haunting images and explore their meanings.  It's a very demanding film.  It's dismaying to read all the posts here from people who were indignant that a movie expected them to figure out what it's up to.  That said, the 2001 experience is so unique that it stands pretty far from what a lot of us have come to think of as film.  There are no sympathetic characters by design, the pacing is almost that of a stroll through a museum, and it ends on a note of utter abstraction (how else to represent on the screen what Bowman has become?). In an age dominated by Spielburg's obvious and noisy sentimentality, Kubrick's 2001 can seem a lot like Antonioni on downers.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

475,dholliday-imdb,we can only be grateful to have it,10,16 April 2015,"No spoilers in case you're interested in seeing what all the fuss is about but have somehow managed to avoid the actual story.I first watched 2001 as a teenager almost 20 years ago, having understood very little, but remember enjoying the (seemingly) sparse show it offered.Couple of years later I got into Arthur C Clarke, starting with the amazing Rendezvous with Rama (how is that not a film yet??) before getting round to 2001. Oh my God, it's full of stars! At this line I understood what that whole psychedelic sequence must've been about, so onward to a 2nd watch forthwith it was. And lo, I now got the film much better. It wasn't quite up there with my absolute favourites (yet), but understood it to be a masterful piece of work.Fast forward 15 years or more to watching it a 3rd time (this huuuge film phase I'm having this year is thanks to procuring a HD-projector...highly recommended!).And ye Gods indeed, it's now my Number 1 favourite film.Older and (probably) wiser, in that 3rd watch there was so much more to appreciate: the use of György Ligeti's otherworldly music is hugely-immersive; the distinct, yet skillfully-linked, nature of each of the 4 parts of the movie feels like a proper opus; the epic presence of the monolith is fantastic, and - when you think about it - the utter vastness of the timeline is sheer incomprehensible. Above all: the film is hugely enjoyable, completely engrossing and beguiles like nothing else I've ever seen. Its ideas are as timeless as the universe itself.As with most Great films, it's also the little things that make an outstanding impression against hugely-ambitious intention: the apes' excitement when realising they can use scattered bones as tools; Floyd seriously cutting the gentlemanly exchange with the Russian group utilising a curt ""I'm afraid I can't talk about that""; the hypnotic circular weightless-walking (and running) of crew; the repeating trick of showing HAL's now-iconic red eye.Speaking of iconism: this movie offers an incredible amount of iconic culture. If you watch this for the first time you'll feel like you've already seen it, such is its influence. And for pure open-mouthed awe we don't even have to look at the riveting psychedelic wormhole: HAL's red room scene is the one that stays with us the most.To the 3 most common criticisms this film has: 1) ""none of the characters are human/relateable enough, tho' some use this as a theory to posit this was Kubrick's intention, to allow HAL emotional room."" I don't buy any of this: Kubrick above all wanted realism: this means he wanted his astronaut and senior scientist characters to mirror the nature of their real counterparts: stoic, calm, formal. And check out Dave's stress levels later on, he's acting human alright. Plus Floyd's wonderfully-light exchange with his daughter is hardly the kind of cold, emotionless quality some amateur critics like to point at 2001.2) ""the sequences without dialogue are too long, with nothing happening. Additionally to this: the classical waltz music doesn't fit the space visuals."" I can understand this criticism, even if I never had an issue with it myself. I love those long sequences: they're enticing and mysterious, and really pull you into its world. But you either like it or you don't.Regarding the music choices: at first viewing I also felt the more traditional classical music didn't quite fit. But on the 2nd and even more so now on the 3rd watch I really appreciate the wonderful symbiotic waltz of the spacecraft with the, very much earthbound, instruments. It's symbolic and meaningful.3) ""the film doesn't make any sense, especially the final section.""Again, another criticism which I felt sympathy with after first viewing (and back then not having read the book). I recommend anyone wanting to understand the science fiction aspect of the story to read Clarke's novelisation before watching. On the other hand, Kubrick's films are well known in their individualistic interpretation of source material. You don't have to read the book if you're happy with your own metaphorical interpretation of what you saw....and, as Merlin would say, that's it.This might be my longest review...and it feels like I'm only scratching the surface with what I want to say about this monumental work. The most universally-truthful thing I can say about it is that it's not gonna be for everyone. Some of you may intensely dislike it, while some may struggle to watch it all the through. If you're one of those then it doesn't mean your taste in film is faulty, it just means 2001 isn't for you. And that's fine.For the rest of us, we can only be grateful to have it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
476,caseyt-48511,Believe the Hype,10,16 March 2020,"Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey has always been a polarizing film. I can't think of a movie that is both greatly acclaimed and despised at the same time. Of course, generally speaking, most people love it in some way. The biggest complaint I see is that many people find it boring. And hey, that's how they feel and I won't judge them. But I was never bored. Even during some especially long sequences with no dialogue or sound effects, I was always focused. Maybe it's the inherit beauty of the effects and camera work that keeps me enthralled throughout.Needless to say, it's not for everyone. Which I really hate to say since it's such an amazing movie. Absolutely in the top ten best ever. Never have I been so confused by a movie but still loving it. But I think it was a good confusion, like the kind you feel while watching a twisty mystery. You think you expect what will happen, and then it does not. The special effects might be the best ever put on film. It's amazing how accurate Kubrick got space travel. I don't like to use the term auteur. It's overused and wrong since movies are such a collaborative effort. But if any director deserves that title it's Kubrick. And he earns it with this film. The classical music soundtrack is glorious and the amount of risks this movie takes is insane. This isn't your average sci-fi movie. It's grounded in some form of reality, even thought it has a fantastical concept.Don't expect any straight answers from this movie. You won't get them. And that's okay. Not everything has to be laid out perfectly in front of us. That's part of the wonder of this timeless classic. Every time you see it, it's like a different experience. I feel if people have the proper context and a basic idea of what to expect, they will enjoy it more. Yes, it's long, and slowly paced, and a challenge for some viewers. But for those who want to see some brilliant and creative cinema with some patience to boot, you can't go wrong 2001.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
477,JRGBUCS,What the heck was this?,3,1 August 1999,"Before viewing this movie, I've read nothing but praise for this movie. Upon viewing it I was disgusted with it. This movie was a complete joke. No dialog for the first and last 25 minutes, no insight in to what's happening. If you wanna see the best of what Kubrick did best watch Dr. Strangelove, if you wanna see the worst of what he did best watch this film. I sat there fast-forwarding through this film because it was so boring. Great, we're sitting there watching a ship spin around for 10 minutes. What a waste of time. What happened at the end? What's with the baby? I can understand the people Ebbert saw people disgusted walking out of this film during the middle of it. Thank god I have a Stop button my remote.

478,AppleBlossom,Better the second time around,7,29 April 2004,"I had to watch 2001: for a second time after so many years. The first experience wasn't so pleasant, I didn't really appreciate this film at all to say the least. Well, it was certainly a feast of mesmerising visuals for the senses. Unfortunately, though the ensuing storyline I felt was a tad confusingespecially the symbolistic signs and direction near the end.
The quality of the production was flawlessthe special effects, set designs, costumes and music was outstanding. The dialogue I felt was slow and drawn out, very frustrating after awhile.  2001: has greatness in a calm and collective wayI realise now how everyone would determine the significance of this film in their own minds, picking out what impressed them the most. My interpretation of 2001; was the beginning of creation, progressing through time and finally exploring space. The mysteries and questions are hurled at you....from all angles. At times it's difficult to comprehend, a truly thinking man's film. I hope I'm not the only one who didn't understand a few scenes??? I think a person would have to watch this film a few times to grasp further insight, it's not a film to just simply watch and forget. My lack of patience sometimes gets the better of me and for this reason I probably didn't enjoy 2001: as much as the majority.Nevertheless, I do agree it was a landmark film in it's day and still is...extremely indepth and awe inspiring, my rating - 7/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
479,robinhio84_,NOV2020 honest review,4,22 November 2020,"So recently I finally got to see 2001:SO. Lemme dive right in: his movie is so S-L-O-W. In the first 60min nothing really happens. It starts off in a way that with make some feeling like the production is a document instead of a film. After the ""docu intro"" it moves through sequences of monotone dialogue and cutscenes without text where there is some interaction with technology loke opening a door. Seriously, I almost fell asleep twice during the first 90mins.This movie may have been revolutionary and hyped when it cane out in the 60s and rightfully so especially for that time it looks good. But watching it in 2020 and ranking it for what it is was a complete drag. I just didn't get it.So long story short, if it is not to complete your IMDb250 list.

Simply the best science fiction movie ever made.Stunning photograph, the scenes in outer space, ''the dawn of men'', the cabin itself, HAL, minimalistic and beautifully made. The music! Damn, it gets along so well, fits perfectly with the movie. Blue Danube, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, sublime.Special effects... not even a modern film will get close to that, it was made 45 years ago and it's still the best i've ever seen.Story, performances. Flawless. The story, may seem slow and confusing but it's really deep.

The fact that it was made before man even set foot on the Moon makes it all the more remarkable. The pace of the film is the secret. Space is slow, space is beautiful, space is empty.....I may not get there myself, but this film is the next best thing. It is rare that a film improves on the book  from which it is derived, but this manages it comfortably. It is as if Kubrick fills the screen with more than our own imaginations can, and you don't get better at your craft than that!

483,aciolino,Astonishing-Remarkable-Iconic-Profound-pick your adjective,10,19 December 2008,"In the dozen or so comments I've submitted I have steered away from the superlative ""greatest film..."" ""greatest comedy,"" as these proclamations of ""fact"" are merely matters of opinion, and will change from time to time. But so impressed and in awe do I remain with 2001: A Space Odyssey, that the words are difficult to suppress. I struggle against saying, ""Yes, this is the greatest film ever made."" I struggle. In vain.What Stanley Kubrick has achieved here is, in my opinion, the summit of the creative act-- the perfect synthesis of image, plot,(or story)music, dialogue, etc, etc, in short, of all the things that comprise film and film making. Where to begin? I must say I am truly disappointed with the number of reviews that rate the film high and yet have no idea what the film is about. Kubrick, shouts to us from the very beginning (the opening fanfare) what the film is about: the evolution of man and his predicament in the Universe (Uh.. kind of a Universal theme) retold through allusions to Nietszche's ""Thus Spake Zarathustra,"" the philosophical treatise that the music was written to portray, by that greatest of all composers of ""Tone Poems,"" Richard Strauss. Man, forced to confront the mystery of his own existence, will never solve it, even throughout time, even though he may conquer time and space, technology, and his own shortcomings. No, the ""riddle theme"" is present at his evolutionary jump to the Super-man, just as it was when he first stood upright.(Beware of those who, on this review forum, have written, ""bored,"" or, ""boring."" I am forced to make the comparison to those who wrote the same things about Beethoven's 5th after it's premier, or those who chased Igor Stravinksy out of the theater after the premier of the ""Rite of Spring"" -- ""You just don't get it."" But it's not your fault. Beethoven, Stravinsky, and Kubrick have created works that are quantum leaps in the aesthetics of their respective art, so it stands to reason that many will say, ""It's boring,"" or, ""It's just noise,"" and the like. Not that I have any great gift of insight. It took a good deal of work and contemplation to achieve the epiphany of truth that these works present.) Of course, everything that happens in the film, surrounds these points. The acting, the dialogue and the choices of the characters. I'll not delineate them here, but leave it to you to discover these on your own. And do yourself a favor: if the film is ever playing anywhere on the big screen, run, fly, hire a plane, bush-wack a stagecoach, or transport yourself astrally, but GET THERE. The experience will be...",2001 - A Space Odyssey
484,Wwmbrd,"Classic, but with a caveat",7,20 September 2021,"It's understandable how this film came to be in the pantheon of film, especially in the science fiction and special effects departments, and truly, for a 1968 film, it is spectacular in that achievement. A full 10 years before Star Wars, this was the epic space movie.If about 45 minutes were cut from the beginning, eliminating 30 minutes of people in monkey costumes screaming through a voice changer, and 15 or so minutes of fluff involving characters who are unimportant and never mentioned again, the film would be an easy 9/10. Once the ship begins flight to the moon, everything gains a sense of foreboding that continues to the end. HAL9000 is one of the most copied tropes in all media as the rogue AI, and the special effects are nothing short of incredible for the time it was produced.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
485,IkuharaKunihiko,"Great, but not perfect",9,23 August 2005,"2001-a space odyssey"" is an excellent sci-fi film, an amazing achievement of imagination and philosophical/existential motives that was nominated for an Oscar for best director and screenplay, but it's still not a masterpiece. Stanley Kubrick was without doubt a great director, but he was almost never emotionally connected with his characters- actually he practically didn't care about them- which resulted in a cold mood throughout his stories. His philosophy was This happens because it's interesting "", but in other films ( La Strada"", Being There"", The Graduate"", Kareshi Kanojo no Jijyou"") the philosophy was This happens because it's magic"".2001"" is an unique experiment. Actually, it's almost something Jean-Luc Godard would have loved to make. It's stripped of any kind of action, suspense, emotion, humor or story, and the only thing it has is style. But what a great style it has. The first half an hour has no dialog and shows prehistoric apes who learned to use bones as tools/weapons after an encounter with an mysterious monolith. By using tools, their intelligence progressed and eventually evolved them into humans. In 2001 Astronauts started a mission to find that Monolith near Jupiter.-------------The Monolith is a symbol of the highest ideal, inspiration for humans, but it's limits are always beyond reach. It influenced the human mentality, but after the invention of tools it moved, disappeared from Earth. And after the astronaut Bowman made contact with him, the Monolith reacted by putting him in a ( time? ) portal ( showed by an amazing visual style, especially memorable in the slide show"" of lights ) and transporting him into a human zoo"", a normal, Earth looking room where he made himself comfortable. When Bowman became old, the Monolith transformed him into an ever higher being, maybe his own, and brought him back to Earth where the next step of evolution could start. Did the Monolith have pity with him? It would have been very interesting to hear some sort of conversation between Bowman and him, but that didn't happen. Also, unfortunately, Bowman had almost no character development. He was the main character and Kubrick took more interest of the HAL computer than him, but that's not important. 2001"" is a fantastic film, but it's not flawless. It takes a great deal of concentration to watch it, and sometimes its just simply- dare I say it?-pretentious and boring. Such a big story about human progress could have been more entertaining, but it's still a big story. And making such a thin, allegorical story work really is art.Grade: 9/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
486,picturetaker,I watched 50% of this movie on Fast-Forward!,1,31 August 2011,"I never saw this movie in the theater because it was made 12 years before I was born. Yet I have seen just about every space movie made in the last 40 years and this one is by far the worst slow paced movie I have ever seen! It starts out, boring. It goes 25 minutes with out one human word spoken. I say human word because I am not sure if the Apes were speaking Aponese or just gibberish. Not that it mattes because I don't speak any Ape language.Then we go to the space scenes. They are VERY slow. Maybe its realistic maybe its not, I don't care that space is a vacuum with no sound either. I want some space sounds to keep me from feeling like I went deaf. Finally, I could not take any more space scenes. After watching the second LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG one with a sphere spaceship taking forever to land on the moon and coming to the realization that ""This is the most boring movie I have ever seen!"" I decided that all space scenes I would simply put on fast forward. Well actually 2X FFWD is WAY TOO SLOW so I actually put it to 4X FFWD and then the space scenes were normal space speed found in other movies like Star Trek or Star Wars or any other spacey show.I get this film and why some, especially at the time thought it was a masterpiece. For its time the Space scenes were amazing! Look at its competition at the time, the Original Star Trek and then look at this film. There is no comparison. However as far as story goes, it was nearly non existence and the movies pace was slower then a earth worm trying to find a hole on the pavement. I've attempted to watch this movie 8 times in my life and only recently I was able to finish this movie and only because I fast-forwarded near 50% of it.This movie is one of those rare ones where people either LOVE it or the HATE it. There is not a lot of people with an opinion about this movie that simply think in between. I hated it. I'm not a action junkie either, I just hated this movie.

And that's 100% true! Because Stanley's technological ideas were subsequently used in many sci-fi movies that followed.MERITS of Space Odyssey 1 – A state-of-the-art sci-fi movie that was well ahead of its time (1968).2 – It was the first movie in which you saw the introduction of Artificial Intelligence & Space suits.3 – It was the first movie in which you will see the phenomenon of things floating in space (FYKI humans conquered moon in 1969).4 – The movie also introduced a special accessory – anti-floating slippers.5 – The interior decoration of the space ship is ultra-modern (for that time).It has hi-tech sofas similar to what exists today. More interestingly, the sofas have display screens at the back. I do not think anyone at that time (1968) were using such hi-tech sofas in real life.6 – The film showcased visual effects & sound effects well ahead of its time.7 – Space Odyssey has a signature tune that is world famous and has been used around the world in TV shows.DEMERITS of Space Odyssey (but this does not mean you should not watch this path-breaking film) 1 – It is a slow-moving movie and does not have any ""action"" at all.2 – The ending is BIZARRE – and incomprehensible!

489,Preston-10,Possibly the greatest artistic achievement of this century,10,10 December 1999,"Not only is 2001: A Space Odyssey possibly the greatest film of the 20th Century, it may well be considered the greatest artistic achievement of this century as well. There has never been a film that has sparked the imagination quite like Kubrick's 1968 masterpiece. He used elements found in art house films up to the time he stared to direct 2001 and made them more commercial. 2001: A Space Odyssey is indeed a definitive mark in both film and science fiction, simultaneously reinforcing in the minds of the audience of what film is and rewriting the rules of filmmaking in general. In essence, Kubrick created a new standard of filmmaking found only within his own unorthodox approach. Some have criticized 2001, as being tedious, boring, dumb, etc. In reality, 2001, unlike most sci-fi before it, makes its own - less obvious - statement concerning Mankind's relationship with God and the Universe. The people of 2001 are just what their technology has made them. The apparent dullness of the future is only magnified by the way the humans interact with each other. One gets the sense that these people have reduced space travel to something that is uninteresting and, in fact, boring. This is necessary in order to show how the humans have become so much like the machines. That is why the relationship between the crew of the Discovery spacecraft and HAL 9000 is such an important part of the movie. This all culminates in the haunting final scenes which may show that despite mankind's successes with technology, man still has much to learn. It is no surprise that Kubrick's style of filmmaking is not as appealing as that of other directors. It's not supposed to. His films are intended to make the audience do one thing that many of today's modern films do not permit them to do, and that is think. As a result, Kubrick's style has resulted in one of the most loyal followings around one single director in this century.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
490,garrettderose,Celebrating space and it's epicness,8,9 September 2009,"1968...This movie looks TOO good to have been made so long ago. The visuals look better than most rushed scifi pop these days. The actors interact with their environment in ways that are confusing and jaw-dropping at the same time (noteably the 'floating pen' scene).The climactic sequence between Bowman and Hal is heart wrenching to say the least. The music is eerie, especially whenever the Monoliths are on-screen. David Bowman is more mechanical and calculating than Hal, it seems. That's kind of a new observation I made when watching it last night. Hal tells Bowman ""I'm sure you are very angry with me right now"". Bowman's demeanor is unchanged. It seems as if he doesn't react to almost anything at all.I really wished there would be more of Hal 9000. He's a great character, probably the most entertaining character in the whole film.The only thing I didn't like about 2001... Bowman's transformation into the Star Child. Bowman baby is probably the scariest and bizarre creature on screen aside from the Eraserhead baby.Great moments of space-shenanigans to classical music.Probably the most artistic sci-fi ever made.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Although many contemporary audiences considerer this classic boring and dull, it certainly is entertaining if you understand it. It's not simply a story of Astronauts floating around in space, but more a story of the change of man, and how technology has changed. The Opening Scene, The Dawn of Man, is one of the greatest parts of this space epic. It shows how man was thousands of years ago, and how man discovered weapons. I personally don't believe in evolution, but I do find this scene very intriguing and is more a scene of the change of the mental capacity of man, not necessarily the psychical. This is the clever way that Stanley Kubrick makes the scene. He sets the scene up as more of a personal interpretation, rather than put the facts on screen.Overall, 2001 is a great film that defiantly makes you think about life and the change of man.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I admit with candor I was in a state of shock, or perhaps awe, upon exiting the theater, I just didn't think a film like that possible! Then within a year we 'land' on the moon and I immediately thought Stanley made the murdered President Kennedy's dream a reality, it's the least this country could do after murdering him! I didn't believe we landed on the moon then nor do I believe it today. Stanley you were truly a genius! Many don't know this but 2001 pioneered the use of front projection with retro-reflective matting with Stanley frequently behind the camera.

It contains a lot of artistic photography like long sustaining shots of space ships and the gateway scene still to this day is mind blowing. I can only imagine the impact this film would have had on audiences when it first came out almost 50 years ago.It's definitely a film you need to watch with an open mind, don't watch this the same way you would a terminator or a die hard or a pirates the Caribbean or a fast and furious movie. oh no, you need to expand your mind and completely watch this with an entirely different perspective because that's the kind of film this is and I was most surprised to learn that this movie actually has a sequel to it!You simply don't see films like this anymore and I seriously doubt we ever will again.

Sprinkled among these four parts is some of the flattest acting you will ever see which is strange because Kubrick was a master at getting the best out of his actors. The only two cast members that add any life to it are Douglas Rain as the voice of HAL 9000 and Vivian Kubrick as the adorable daughter of Floyd.The film is many things: long, slow, meandering, flat and redundant. These negative traits affect almost everything the film has to offer from the story to the performances and the score. The only thing NOT affected is the special effects which are pretty convincing.In conclusion, although the story has promise and it sparkles every now and then, the film is just plain dull.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It was quite boring and dumb. It showed a dumb picture of animals for like 20 minutes. I almost fell asleep. I tried to enjoy it.. but i failed. Don't ever watch this movie. It's a waste of money. I enjoy a lot of Kubrick's movies such as The Shining and The ClockWork Orange.. BUt this is something different. Even ""meet the spartans"" is better then this piece of crap.

497,rtrnt,"Visually rich, confusing as all get out, but I do agree it's important",7,31 October 2020,"I've watched this for the first time as of right now and I can say this. It's one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. So many films that have since been highly acclaimed for their visual splendor simply cannot hold a candle to this one in that respect. And the film does tackle the theme of man v. artificial intelligence in a gripping way. I only wish the storytelling could match Kubrick's flare for visuals in this film. Ironically, some films that have paid homage to this one have in some ways done a better job with the material.Unfortunately, the film's rather sluggish pacing is something of a debit. Even its most diehard fans have to admit, it's a film that occasionally moves at a glacial pace. And the final turn of events can be charitably described as inconclusive. Whatever Kubrick was aiming for with this ending, he only succeeded in creating a precedent that many filmmakers have since followed whenever they find a straightforward, coherent ending to be inconvenient or too easy.As easy as it is to knock this film not quite living up to the near universal praise it gets, one still has to acknowledge how influential it has been. It's worth seeing for that reason alone, even though the debate over where in the hierarchy of Kubrick films the one falls will likely continue until the end of time.

499,alexsnower,A truly perfect film,10,20 July 2021,"2001 has four chapters in my opinion. Chapter one is the chimpanzees and their encounter with the monolith. Chapter two is the monolith on the moon. Chapter 3 is all about HAL and the ""mission to Jupiter"". Chapter 4 is the mind bending end that has gained so much fame. To describe the plot of 2001 destroys the point of interpretation so I won't, but I will say why I love it. The way the movie connects human evolution to aliens is such a great plot, HAL is a great character (AI gaining human emotion is a great subject), the cinematography is also amazing and lastly the shots in space look so real. Kubrick could've gone into the future and used real footage of spaceships docking in the moon and it would look worse than in this movie. The effects and the plots deep and interpretable meaning were truly ahead of its time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

But one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time is a film that everyone has seen at least one in their life, and have come to enjoy. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a true classic, and has met all standards. Stanley Kubrick did a good job with the film, and in the end, we got a fantastic sci-fi thriller to add to the bunch.A lot of the scenes are iconic, as well as the music. The scoring by Gene D.Phillips is amazing, and some of the best scoring I have ever heard. The special effects are so awesome, you'd think that they existed in real life, instead of models.Overall, all I can say is that 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that all sci-fi lovers should see because it is a true masterpiece.

503,andy-933-696608,"It asks more questions through images, rather than with Dialogue.",10,30 October 2013,"What are we? It's a strange question at first and not the kind you usually ask. Yet people like Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman asked this question numerously. They posed it with humility and reason, never making up answers, and assuming that everything that science had come up with was wrong. In an interview where Feynman was asked about the certainty pertaining to the scientific method, he expressed his view, being that of a Cartesian, and how he would rather be filled with doubt, than to have answers that could possibly be wrong. Its noble and it entails the integrity of a curious mind who believes in the beauty of investigating and discovering, rather than basing your conclusion on little or no evidence. 2001: A Space Odyssey does not provide answers, but it gives us insights into what the human race is, posing even greater questions to the potential we hold as self-conscious beings.2001 is significantly different from the usual science fiction film. Although it poses the usual questions pertaining to the uniqueness of our species, the existence of God, and the direction we are heading in out progressivism, it rarely goes beyond a few simple lines of dialogue. The few characters, mostly being astronauts and a few Hominids, utter very few words as the story progresses from the dawn of humankind, to the evolutionary stage of space exploration. But then again, it's those very moments that simply play out as naturalistic as possible that truly define the story, as the images of objects floating in space, with ""On the Beautiful Blue Danube"" playing in the background that we truly come to be in sync with the spirit of the film. This spirit is mysterious, and although we still don't understand what it is, or where it came from, but the search becomes all the more invigorating as we challenge both our intellectual and explorative capacities, thus gaining a greater understanding of the human spirit.When human kind was still developing, our awareness was at a minimal state of ambiguity, never truly grasping the significance of any particular action, relying purely on instinct. A scene where a group of Hominids stumble upon a monolith, shows them react with wild and almost chaotic rage at the sight. Not too long after, they learn to kill enemy combatants for land. As our ancestor raises the bone and begins to shatter various bones on the ground, the shot is given a particular focus as it entails the essence of discovery in the most primitive standards. When at the peaking point of our development, we are more casually reliant on ungodly technological advances, endowing them with their own conscious awareness that merely gives greater reason to ponder the definition of intelligence.The Hal 9000, an artificial intelligence unit, claims its inability to commit error, already symbolizing the very arrogance that defines our own self-indulged obligation to intellectual superiority. Hal's devotion of intelligence, although admirable is clouded with pride to the degree that it mirrors our own fear of death and failure in the face of the inevitable. Human beings, although the most intelligent creatures known so far, classify themselves as intelligent. Yet, with what little we still don't know about the Universe, there could be life elsewhere in the universe, probably vastly more intelligent than we are. Our modern day Carl Sagan, or Stephen Hawking, as daunting as their intellects are to the average individual, could merely pose as amateurs to intelligent alien life, depending on their own conception of intelligence.The discussion to intelligence is central to the theme of this film, for it pertains with our own approach towards our ever growing desire to ascend and evolve. The film's episodic pattern of storytelling introduces a black monolith in each chapter. There are some speculations regarding these monoliths, and at times they drive the characters, be it the hominids, or the astronauts to further questioning their origins. The beliefs are focused around the notion of an extraterrestrial species. Their intentions, although never clear, are more viewed in the concepts of overseers to the universe. With 2001, being based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same name, the origin of the multiple Monolith's gives little if any detail to their conception, Only the fact that they are of nonhuman origin, that there is some understanding of their descent, but little of their purpose.2001: A Space Odyssey is something to wonder, for it is the sort of film that although gives very little answers, it raises the kinds of questions which have driven us from the jungles of Africa to the infinite realm of Space, in our quest for knowledge and understanding. Stanley Kubrick's vision of the human capacity for knowledge is an both enlightening and extraordinary attempt as his classic space epic, through long shots of the soundless and weightless space, combined with J Strauss's ""On the Beautiful Blue Danube"", there comes a more poetic feeling of the beautiful and mysterious cosmos we still hope to understand in our gradual evolutionary development. 2001 is a landmark of discovery, and even inspiring to the degree that it is spiritual and Godly in its essence. When touching on God, I don't mean a sentient being outside the universe, but more towards Arthur C. Clarke's definition, which pertains towards knowledge and the path that encompasses its essence as human kind still strives with the enthusiasm that drives the very curiosity that define people like Richard Feynman in their quest for knowledge. Feynman once said, ""When you doubt and ask, it gets a little harder to believe"", and although this clarifies the difficult journey humanity embarks on every day when learning, it's the first and necessary step to arriving at a more honorable degree of knowledge, God or no God.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
504,silva-w-pius,"A exploration of time and space, and mans insignificant part in it all",5,11 August 2013,"A lifeless corpse of a film that masquerades itself as one of the greatest SCI FI films of all time, to some poor unlighted individuals that clearly haven't seen planet of the apes (the original of course – remakes are just the sound of Hollywood's brain cells dying) Sometimes in life reputations exceeds reality, and this is none more true than Stanley Kubrick's a space odyssey. Before watching it I was expecting a symphony of cinematic perfection, but unfortunately it did not live up to the hype and hope of my expectations at all! If for some random reason I had a time machine, do you the first thing I would do? No not go back in time and invest in apple and Microsoft, or back in time and warn my younger self not to be a reading fan, unless I wanted to be miserable and constantly heartbroken, but instead to be a glory hunter like most of my friends and just support Manchester United, but instead I would go back in time and un-watch 2001. There are two completely different films within one. The first is an uneventful first 1 and a half hours, full of mundane, over drawn scenes that contribute very little to the tempo of the film, or don't help move the narrative forward. As the film starts off with two conflicting groups' of prehistoric man learning to hunt, until one of the two groups learns to use tools and conquers the other. Then we are propelled into the future when man has perfected space travel, the two events only connected by the appearance of a large slab known as the monolith. But it's not all bad; every cloud has a silver lining. As the second half and particularly the third act is roller-coaster of some thrills, excitement and mystery. *SPOILER*As man venture to the planet Jupiter, aided by the supposedly infallible Hal 9000 the most advance computer man has ever created, but after a malfunction, it goes crazy and upon hearing that the two remaining astronauts - Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood, to not be placed into suspended animation, wants to terminate Hal, due to an error. It then out of fear, attempts to kill every person on board the ship. *SPOILER* The final act is a strange scene, where the one of the astronauts spends the rest of his time in a large room, only to die and to be reborn into a gigantic space baby. But despite a better second half the film still lacks. As the popular saying goes ""A team is only as strong as its weakest member"" so in this case, despite the film picking up in the second portion, it stills wasn't good enough to off seat the mind numbing beginning. But on the other hand the film is blessed with the most beautiful and mesmerising sound track I have ever heard, that is quite possibly the greatest collections of music in one single film that complements it perfectly. With scores I never knew the origins of but where a staple of everyday life, I was completely unaware that they came from odyssey. It also use of special effects and set designs, far ahead of its time, putting shame to some of today's uninspiring use of poorly created CGI. So from a technical view point it's a phenomenal fleet by Kubrick, but the story still lacks, it raises more questions than it answers, sometimes it works and they say art is subjective but it just didn't work for me in this case.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

506,someokiedude,Kubrick at his most...Kubrickian.,10,9 November 2020,"2001 is a film that I like to describe as a film made nearly a decade too early. It would only be 9 years until George Lucas made cinematic history with the original Star Wars film, yet every science fiction film from Star Wars to Alien to Close Encounters to Blade Runner owe a significant debt to Kubrick's original SF epic. The film puzzled critics and audiences alike, with noted critic Pauline Kael (basically the Roger Ebert before Ebert gained prominence) calling it unimaginative, a review that would enrage Kubrick. But now it is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made.Kubrick's style can be hard to pinpoint for the unintiated, considering how often he would change his style from movie to movie, from the madcap, irreverent atmosphere of A Clockwork Orange to the lurking, creeping atmosphere of The Shining, but there are the similarities to be found if you choose to look, such as his use of long shots, classical music, and the so called 'Kubrick stare.' Kubrick's iconic status has brought him many people who've sought to recreate his style, like with Paul Thomas Anderson and his use of dark, bitterly ironic humor in his films or Refn's tendency to force us to witness the horrors and depravity of man, with no safety net to protect us from it. Yet no one has ever managed to successfully duplicate what makes Kubrick so lasting.Kubrick is often seen as cinema's mad genius. Bearded, wild eyed, and unkempt, obsessing over the little details that no one would ever bother to consider, yet, he is completely generous with his camera, never stooping down or insulting his audience. His greatest gift to his audience is the wiggle room that he allows for his audience to breathe and to think about what they've just received, never giving them what they want yet perhaps giving them something that they never would have expected. To paraphrase Lynne Ramsay, Kubrick was an artist who showed the way that he viewed the world in a way that was so vivid, and so uncompromising and lacking in fear. He was never afraid to entertain while allowing his audience to think about what he has given them.It is this unpredictability that keeps Kubrick fresh, and what keeps him dynamic and interesting even until today. Few artists can maintain such a level of unpredictability and continually challenging himself in ways that would never be expected and as I've mentioned before, it's what I think makes Kubrick so intriguing. He never made the same film twice, and every time he would go back to a familiar genre, he would always attempt to find a new angle to approach it.2001 is known as one of Kubrick's colder films, yet also as one of his most enigmatic, beautiful, and occasionally terrifying films. It is Kubrick's opus about the universe, the insignificance of man, evolution, and the possibility of life outside of Earth. Many of his aforementioned trademarks come in, such as his long shots that dictates atmosphere, his use of classical music, as well as his use of the so called 'Kubrick stare' that has become known on the internet in recent years. His style, as I mentioned before, often seems to change, but there is always an observant, voyeuristic quality to his work. He also showcases his playfulness with the audience's expectations, often forcing us to confront harsher realities of our existence, but also showing us the beauty and wonder that comes from the vastness of the cosmos.It still eludes me what makes Kubrick's work so lasting and profound, it makes me sit back and chuckle to myself. Do I even need to know?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
507,Stefan_Loves_Movies,#Movie Review,4,6 July 2021,"First I'd like to point out that this review is from 2021 so I will compare how the movie is holding up to this date. This movie was released 53 years ago so some time passed. It's surprising how dead on the movie is about the future.I will be blunt and admit that I did not enjoy this movie. (SPOILER WARNING) The director tried to make a very abstract movie to the point that the meaning of the movie is unknown, I totally understand what he was trying to achieve with the slow-paced repetitive long shots of ships moving around but still it was so repetitive that I just couldn't take it anymore so I had to skip through those long shots. The movie has some good parts but to be honest the ONLY reason that made me watch the movie to the end is the fact that I heard so much praise about it.It doesn't matter how good the ending is or could be, if the movie is constantly making me ask myself if I should just stop watching it that means that the movie failed to keep me engaged.. actually I almost fell asleep at 1 point..
I don't know what to say.. maybe I am too young to understand the movie, or it's just not my style but still regardless of how high the movie tried to aim with it's ideas it's pointless if you can't even make the watcher sit through the entire movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

509,Pulpthatsfiction,WOW Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever,10,11 October 2007,"Stanley's best film and best sci-fi film of all time. I just watch this movie last night and I could not speak or express any type of feeling because this film was so brilliant, also I never understood this film for a second but that is what I think that Stanly wanted. The First 25 minutes not one word is said and you just watch how maybe man came into being because of this big black block. I don't know what that block is it could be god or maybe it's something that will never be understand and maybe it's the key to everything we need to know about life, space and everything we hold dear, but I think thats what started the first intelligence in man. that block could hold all of our future and that black block could be flying in space as we talk and sleep creating life on other planets, it could be aliens spying on us since it's buried and humans uncover it what would happen? Maybe it created everything that exist and thing that we don't exist yet. I could go on forever on the possibility's if that black block does exist but what if it does and then my entire life could change for ever. Hal is portably the best voice over acting I have ever heard and is provably the best villain ever created. The acting is superb for a film were not one word is said for more than half of the movie. This film has with out a dought one of the best special effects and it's about 40 years old. This Film has made me question what I think about in a good way. I always new that the universe goes on forever but this film made understand how we know nothing about space. This Film has bought so many question that I dought I will never understand them all before I die. This film has probably one of the best special effects ever. The music of this movie is great and it fit the movie like no other. I liked that when ever the film goes out of the space shuttle there's no sound or music and it creates a scary and makes you feel alone and that really feat the movie. This is probably the best movie I have ever seen and probably the best I will ever see.I have heard that you will understand this movie better if you see this movie a lot of times, but I'm scared to see this film more times cause I might not like this movie once I understand, But I will see this movie again cause it's probably my new all favorite film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
510,kingtanichi,The apex of sci-fi,10,5 September 2003,"WARNING! SLIGHT SPOILERS!Most, if not all, of the criticism of this film is leveled at its ambiguity and mystery, and while it is true that it never provides any easy answers and demands a certain level of interpretation, there's still plenty that can be taken at face value. The connection between the ominous black slab and human evolution is ingenious, and perfectly obvious. HAL's campaign of terror against the Discovery crew needs no explanation. Admittedly the borderline-psychedelic dimensional trip above Jupiter may be a bit baffling at first, it, and its climax a bit incongruous, but the investment of a few scraps of gray matter in that direction is richly rewarded.Perhaps a more legitimate complaint about the film is that Kubrick's contribution is almost matched, if not exceeded by that of the composers whose music imbues the film with so much of its majesty. Would the film have achieved the same level of impact without Strauss' ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" booming across the infinities? I think not.All these concerns aside, anyway, the simple fact remains that 2001 is one of the most visually stunning films ever. I can't think of any movie that's depicted primordial man and its habitat so effectively. The ground-breaking space effects which paved the way for Star Wars retain almost all of their impact today, especially on the big screen. HAL 9000 remains the most terrifying computer ever to deadpan its regret at the necessity of killing its human companions. The ""ultimate trip"" at the climax is one of the most bizarre, mind-expanding and thought-provoking set-pieces ever (it's a testament to the sequence's impact that Canadian IMAX screens demonstrate the theatre's capabilities before shows with a verbatim recreation of it).Never mind Lucas, Spielberg, Cameron, or Scott. Stanley Kubrick made himself the ruler of sci-fi with this (and perhaps A Clockwork Orange too).",2001 - A Space Odyssey
511,patomartinezfgo,A visual and auditive spectacle,10,4 April 2017,"This movie is just beautiful. Stanley really shows he is a genius in the way that he sets up his shots. All of his shots are beautiful, I cant stress it enough. The camera work is marvelous and really helps you understand character motivations (specially HAL 9000, who is just a computerized voice). The colours used in this film are also beautiful. Every shot feels alive and genius.The score is amazing. It has some of the most famous classical music ever put to film, and it really helps set up the mood for certain scenes and really gives you the chills.The special effects are amazing for the 60's, I would even say they look very similar to the effects of Star Wars. It really amazes you how they did certain shots.Of course, the real juice in this movie is the symbolism and themes. This movie is packed with themes about humans, technology, instinct, and existence itself. I saw this movie about 3 days prior to writing this review, just to make sure I understood the themes, I had to ponder for quite a bit and really analyze the film, and it still left me with questions. Actually, the movie is made to raise more questions than it answers.I would say, that this movie is a thought time if you are not a complete film fanatic. The pace is very slow, for you to be able to appreciate every shot, and most of the parts would make people that are not really interested in film as an art form, pretty boring. But if you appreciate film as an art and love a good film with deep themes... this is the right one for you.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The film lacks dialog but gives beautiful images and lovely music. Some of the films concepts in space are not the most accurate but unlike some sci-fi films, this movie thought about things like toilets in space or food in space.

514,talkymeat,Truly One of a Kind.,10,1 January 2011,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a very difficult film to summarize, but I will give it a shot. A mysterious monolith that dates back to the dawn of time is found on the moon and scientists are attempting to excavate and study its mysterious nature. Also, two astronauts headed to Jupiter must deal with Hal 9000, the artificial intelligence controlling their ship, which appears to be malfunctioning.2001 is not only one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time but easily one of the most strange and original pieces of film art to ever grace the screen. Every facet of 2001: A Space Odyssey is so meticulously detailed and painstakingly filmed that it's truly a wonder to behold. And while its detail and realism are some of its highest commendations they are also 2001's biggest flaws. Stanley Kubrick crafts a sci-fi universe that is so realistic and believable that it is boring.I believe that by making certain scenes go on for what can seem like an eternity he was attempting to make the entire concept of 2001 being a science fiction movie blaze' and unimportant. As if to say; ""yeah it's science fiction so what, I've got an important story to tell."" And what a story it is.2001: A Space Odyssey deals with everything from god to artificial humanity with such subtly that it's very hard to even discern what any of it means during initial viewings. Everyone who watches this movie once and hates it should at least give it one more chance. Like most really great films the more you watch it the better it gets. Though many scenes can be tedious to watch more than once, 2001 has such a vast amount of subtext it is virtually a completely different film every time you watch it.2001: A Space Odyssey is easily the most misunderstood and hard to love of all cinematic classics. It's easy to write it off as a self-indulgent piece of pseudo sci-fi nonsense, but it is truly so much more than that. It's not only the most realistic portrait of what our future may really look like but a meditation on where humanity has been and where it may be going.

Clarke behind the storyline. Even in 1968, some technologies did come to pass in our own 2001. There's just something about the film that keeps you interested and intrigued if you like the sci-fi and suspense genre. I like to think of the story as man vs. machine conflict, like who would win the battle of the fittest...which in turn leads to the question of if man created the machine, would not both destroy themselves if they were to error?And that's where I get lost. I'm going to watch this yet again to see if I can reason with myself to see if I can make deeper sense of it all...and because I love this movie.A no-questions-asked 10/10 in my books.

519,johnfos,A movie in three parts...,10,11 July 2005,"I really like the way that the great director (the Late) Stanley Kubrick gives us several movies in one. He did it with 'Full Metal Jacket' and has also done it with '2001'...Part 1 of '2001' is The Dawn of Man and the antics of ape-men and the discovery of a black rectangular monolith are the focus here. At the end of Part 1 a bone is sent up flying up into the air and it comes down as a spaceship! Part 2 is about the discovery of a second monolith on the moon, eons later, and the subsequent Jupiter mission. This is the main part of the movie and HAL the homicidal super-computer features in this section. And there is one famous line here which sends a shiver up the spine: ""Open the pod bay doors, HAL."" Part 3 is Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite, which some people have said is close to an LSD trip. Certainly it's beyond words.And how do the three parts fit together? There is no one definitive answer to this, but the monoliths are the common thread, and it could be suggested that they somehow shape the course of human evolution.It should be noted the the so-called sequel to 2001, 2010, is not a Stanley Kubrick film, and is unlike one in many ways. I've heard it said that if you liked 2001, you won't like 2010, and vice-versa.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I love science fiction but this isn't science fiction it's ""art"" as they say.
I guess it's a matter of taste... I like to watch a movie with a clear plot and ending that I don't have to ponder to hard over. If your looking for that too, then don't waste your time because you'll be waiting until the credits roll.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
521,conspracy-2,"I get it, but I just don't like the end.",9,22 October 2006,"I get it, I get it. The first three parts of this essentially four-part film are varying degrees of great. The ""Dawn of Man"" segment looks a little dated, but it's undeniably a classic segment of cinema. The ""Sentinel"" segment on the moon sets up the tone, casualness and general laziness of the film (please don't read the word ""lazy"" in any negative sense. The amount of attention to detail is staggering in this movie, but the feel is still best described as lazy - leisurely and for the most part banal. This is completely intentional on the part of Stanley Kubrick, of course.) The ""Hal"" segment is without a doubt the greatest segment, with incredible use of silence and slowness as a suspense-building mechanism, the unforgettable ""daisy"" scene, etc etc. This segment is what proves to me that this movie knows exactly what it's doing.Which can only lead me to conclude that it knows what it's doing in the trippy final ""beyond infinity"" segment. Heck knows, no-one else knows, but people love it: they call it poetic, inspirational, mind-expanding and so forth. I won't deny that people can get very strong emotions from the ending.My problem is that this segment is undeniably super-pretentious. It would look weird in Bruñuel movie. French cinema don't even give us this sort of completely humorless symbolism, the kind where you can almost hear the director sitting behind the camera, thoughtfully scratching his beard under his french beret and pondering the bleakness of existence when he really needs to unbutton the top shirt button and chill the hell out.(I get it, by the way. The star-child is the next step of human evolution, guided by the monolith just like in the beginning, bla bla)I was disappointed that Kubrick chooses to end his epic film like this. It crosses the line from entertainment into ""if you don't get this it's because you're stupid"" territory. And if, as has been stated many times, he can't be any less vague because no-one knows the answers to the questions he's posed, he has no business making this movie in the first place. Because it's a movie, not a documentary. You invented the monolith, so get off your hiney and tell us more about it, OK?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
522,nived84,Curiously puzzling,10,25 January 2006,"I am not a ""fan"" of Stanley Kubrick's work. I don't consider him to be a ""genius"" filmmaker, but I do think his work is curiously intriguing and at times daring. So for that I give him respect, but that doesn't mean I'll praise his work. The only film of his that I truly enjoyed was The Shining. Full Metal Jacket I thought was curiously lacking something humanizing, and left me unengaged, unlike Francis Ford Coppola's surrealistic Apocalypse Now. However this film, 2001, I feel very strange about.2001: A Space Odyssey is a thought-provoking sci-fi epic. I say ""thought-provoking"" because I had to think my way through this film, and was trying to figure out just what in hell I was watching, or what was going on. I've seen this film once (several years ago), and I plan on seeing it again sometime. Maybe after a few more viewings I'll be able to better understand the film, at least I hope so.The film moves almost unbelievably slowly, border lining on tedium. I mean there's slow, and then there's SLOW. This film is SLOW. But somehow, and believe me I don't know exactly how, it did hold my attention. Like I said above, I was really just trying to figure out what was happening. I liked the character of HAL 9000. Actually I'm a sucker of anything about how technology, a creation of man, comes back to bite them in the ass (i.e. Terminator 2: Judgment Day and The Matrix).I don't understand exactly what 2001 was saying, but it kept me watching with anticipation, one could almost say excitement, but mostly just puzzlement. And for that I respect the film for confusing the hell out of me, because that's doesn't happen often, if ever when I watch a movie. Maybe if Donnie Darko had truly confused me, maybe I would have had more respect for it. And while 2001 may not be my favorite film of Kubrick's, it's certainly one of his more captivating films. I respect this film, but I didn't quite love it, because it left me puzzled. So I'm giving the film a score of an eight out of ten, perhaps upon a second, third or maybe even a fourth viewing I'll reconsider, and give it a higher score.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
523,Shilo_R_A,"8.2/10 - Interesting in a Lot of Ways, Yet Undeniably Exhausting",8,2 June 2021,"*sigh*Okay, let me take this out of the way - this film isn't a masterpiece in my opinion. I do think that it has some qualities, and I find its idea quite interesting, but yet...kinda crazy to think that so many people consider it as one of the best films of all time.What is the plot, you ask? Well. This movie doesn't have much of a plot, you see. One can say that it's about a black monolith discovered on the moon and the team that was sent to research it. But this film's point isn't to keep you interested in a thrilling plot or whatever. The movie's goal is to give you a certain experience, to portray humanity and evolution in a certain way. It is a special film, I can give it that. It's like those weird, obscure asrtsy short films that you watch and then you're like ""wtf did I just watch"", but 2.5 hours of this.So, that's what I like about this film - the score is basically perfect and super iconic, the aesthetic is unique and interesting - it's a space film created one year before the first moon landing, so the way that people imagined the future back then is truly fascinating. I also like a lot of the ideas, metaphors and symoblism that goes on throughout the movie. It went totally over my head the first time, but I appreciated it way more the second time. So yeah, all of those things are pretty much fantastic, and the HAL 9000 computer is such an interesting character.However, this film has two huge problems, that in my opinion take away a lot from the better stuff on this film.The first thing is the pacing. I don't think that this film could be way shorter because of what it is, but it doesn't change the fact that this is, by far, the slowest movie I've ever watched. It may be truly boring from time to time, and tho some of the stuff that happens slowly is justified (like in the intro for the movie, The Dawn of Man part) and sometimes it's just unnecessery. And this film is 2.5 hours! Just to remind you.The secong thing is the heavy, heavy reliance on metaphors and symbols. At times, it feels like there's no much plot, only artsy and lengthy shots that should make you ask philosophical questions. And I'm really fine with symbolism and stuff like that - in fact, I really love things in that manner when it's done right. And here it's kind of the main point of this film - it's more philosophical and artsy than captivating plot-wise.These reasons are what makes this film so exhausting. Even people who love this film to death will agree with this statement most of the time. So, is it a fun film to watch? Hmm...at times, and if you get the metaphors and symbolism. Most of the time it's thought provoking, yet too slow and exhausting.It's still an interesting, well done film in a lot of ways, but it's far from being a masterpiece in my opinion. I'm feeling an 8.2/10 on this one.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
524,DaveDiggler,An Epic Film Too Ambitious for its Own Good.,7,29 April 2008,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is set in the year 2001 and the main character is HAL. HAL is a computer. That's right, a computer who talks and thinks entirely on its own. This was made in 1968 and to think by 2001 it would be conceivable that computers would talk is a joke. If this was in 3064 a talking computer that had emotions and made its own decisions would be considered just as moronic as this. There is nothing in this film that provokes any kind of emotion. It provokes two reactions and one is called sleep. The film starts with nothing but a pitch black screen for well over two minutes. Then, the first shot we see that has some kind of lighting is ""The Dawn of Man"" sequence. So, if it's in chronological order, the blackness prior to this, is the birth of the world? During ""The Dawn of Man"" sequence, out of no where, a huge rectangular block comes from out of the ground, from the sky, we'll never know where it comes from, but for one reason or another it's there. The monkeys go apesh!t once they find this huge rectangular block that only man could have made, but that's the catch man hasn't evolved yet. So, who made it and where did it come from? What is its purpose? The monkeys find a tool. The monkeys use bones to fight an opposing group of monkeys. The monkeys with the weapons are now the dominating group. Why? Because they have used their mind to gain an advantage. The more advanced monkeys, and more importantly, smarter and more innovative monkeys, are the dominate group as they have taken over the watering hole.We quickly jump into space, millions of years later, where we see a bunch of spaceships floating around to classical music. We can see the earth, the moon, the sun, the universe. And for a film made in 1968 the visual effects are stunning. The score is legendary. The cinematography is spectacular. The editing is, however, atrocious. There are countless shots of boxy looking space ships floating in outer space for, what feels like, an infinite amount of time. Once we board the ship there isn't much to talk about. For the next hour Kubrick shows various shots of life in outer space. Kubrick shows us the life of an astronaut, which is very boring, and we completely get the message. The spaceships interior and exterior are bulky and outdated looking. Remember what the first cell phone looked like? Me neither, but that's what the future looks like in 2001. All the characters have clothes and hairdos that resemble 1968. The chairs are decorated in bright red colors, and they're oddly shaped because we all know, in the future, we're going to be sitting in weird looking chairs. The computer screens are hideous looking and this is obviously prior to HDTV because the clarity is atrocious. All the TV sets look like they're from 1968, so it's not all that futuristic. Like all films set more than 20 years in advance, they look terrible and unconvincing. Just because this is Kubrick, we shouldn't say, ""Well, that's how you would think it looks."" No, I wouldn't. Just like I wouldn't think a computer would be talking to me in the year 2047. It's not going to happen and if someone made a film right now, set 30 years in time, and had a talking, self thinking computer, I would laugh at the stupidity of it. Just like I did with ""2001"". HAL is the liveliest person- shoot I just called him a person. HAL is a computer, but he has more life than any of the muted characters in this film. And HAL actually thinks he's alive. He sees humans as his maintenance men who take care of him while he does all the work. HAL ""reads"" the lips of one of the very few conversations between Dave and Frank and he ""sees"" that they are planning to turn him off. This is where the only dramatic part of the film enters- An ensuing battle between a red light and a guy in a spaceship trying to get into a bigger spaceship. Oh, the drama!! Once HAL thinks he has the upper hand, Dave makes his way back into the spaceship proving mans ingenuity. Dave proceeds to terminate HAL. HAL pleads for his life as he slowly fades away, which, like everything else, seems to take forever. If the scene was shortened I think it could have been truly incredible. The final act is just as tedious as the first two. The huge block that the Apes found appears again at the end. It comes out of nowhere... again. Then, an infant is born in a placenta-like shield overlooking the earth from space. What is Kubrick saying? Is it about transformation? Dave to an infant? Is man evolving again? Is Kubrick saying this is the end of man and the start of whatever that alien looking thing is? Maybe I'm going crazy trying figure out what this crazy director is trying to say, but the more I think about it the more the beginning and the ending make sense. There are a few questions left unanswered, especially for the purpose of the blocks, but if you can make it through the film it should spark some thought. The film moves at a snail's pace. The first act and the third acts are fairly strong, but the second act meanders around, hovering in one place for what seems like eternity. There is some intriguing ideas in the film that will provoke some thought if you give it a chance. And for that, it finds some level of profound greatness.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
525,jaesboxer,Perhaps the single greatest stepping stone from past films into present,10,17 June 2002,"Anyone who watches 2001:  A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick's truly mind-boggling masterpiece, will be driven to incredible frustration if they try to make any sense out of it.  The beauty and glory of this journey into space aswell as the interior of our own minds is still breathtaking today, but even now its true vision eludes us.  Almost everyone has his or her own theories on what the film means, but the fact is, no one really knows.  It is for this very reason that 2001 is a classic to rival all classics, and an important stepping stone from old films to new, where Kubrick takes us on a 2 1/2 hour trip from monkeys, to man, to computers, to monoliths and beyond the infinite.  I absolutely love this movie, and I still have no clue what it means.  In being vague but astoundingly visual in its reality, I think it appeals both to the visual mind, aswell as our subconscious selves.  For those of you who haven't seen it, when you do, DO NOT try to understand Kubrick's vision.  Just sit back for the movie ride of your life!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
526,arkif1,I am that I am!,9,24 March 2007,"2001 is one of the odder films ever made. You could call it a stone plate-Nietzsche-waltz-obsession. If you are willing to dive into such a thing, then please, go ahead! The Blue Danube serves as a vehicle to let you feel both the loss of orientation in space and the loss of orientation in culture, in the sense that what we call culture is already the product of a disorientation, a sophisticated play that betrays our elementary nature. I AM! ALL THIS IS MINE! The introduction brings this point about pretty concisely, and most people will certainly imagine the becoming of man along the lines of the depiction here. It's a dark fantasy, ""the you is older than the I"" said Zarathustra, um, Nietzsche, and in this spirit, that with self obsession came power, 2001 establishes the role of consciousness.The ultimate cause for this turn stays a mystery, an unknown by principle, an act of God, like the handing over of the ten commandments, at least in Kubrick's vision. It's a consistent and effective vision. But it's not much of a basis to create a film upon. The repetition of the birth of consciousness in the space ship's computer was worth showing, but after that point the film simply runs out of substance. The rest is just common half-sense, a disappointment after the start.If you're willing to let the film simply work on you, in a purely poetical way, then it's definitely worth watching. Otherwise it is to be shunned, since it would bore you to death!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
527,leslieadams,Always Engaging,10,14 May 2005,"It was an intriguing experience, seeing this film when it first played my home city on a road show engagement. I always regretted sitting in the balcony, rather on the main floor for this 70 mm.presentation. I could only imagine the effect audiences had viewing it in true Cinerama. Kubrick made a film like none other, with a total of 88 non-dialog minutes, and exit music (of Strauss' ""Blue Danube Waltz"") that continues a good five minutes after the last credit roll. Arthur C. Clarke's comment that if one fully understands everything in the film, he would consider his contribution a failure, reminded me of Director Vincent Minnelli's answer to a question about an effect in one of his films, ""Yolanda and the Thief."" A studio exec asked him what did the mysterious ""dream apparition"" that emerged from the lake mean. Minnelli responded that he had no idea. Kubrick's choosing of the year, 2001, as a title because it represented the ""beginning of the next century"" proved less than prophetic: 2000 was the year celebrated worldwide for that event (though Kubrick was factually correct). As for actor Kier Dullea, his trademark blank-stare style seemed to work most impressively in a very limited number of other films, mainly, ""David and Lisa"" and ""The Fox."" Still, he'll be forever remembered for ""A Space Odyssey."" Ultimately, the film has won the plaudits of a majority of the public and critics. Those who either ""don't get it,"" or ""find it too slow moving"" now seem to be in the minority, and the film has ultimately won a place among the ""film greats.""",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It seems one scene depends on the next scene. In more basic terms that define good movies from bad, the acting is not exactly connected to romance or sadness, but is more intelligent, dramatic, and intense. HAL 9000's monotone voice and calibrated actions are ones that will find it's way into every crack of your mind. Also, just a warning, if you don't like breathing noises, get as far away as you can from this movie and anyone who likes it, or just skip it. The movie has long sequences lingering on the same object or area for long periods, never ending scenes in both a meditative and annoying way. The ending is absolutely head scratching.

Even the AFI ranked it as like the 23 or something, best movie of all-time.
    There was very little dialogue in it, and the talk was meaningless anyway.  The move was broke up into segments, so it never establishes a real flow.  I understand its pretty good history movie, tracing man from cave to space, but I still don't see how you can label it a great movie.

530,jakespick,Possibly The Greatest Film of All-Time,10,25 September 2008,"*******The following is a review******* The film deals with thematic elements of human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence, and extraterrestrial life, and is notable for its scientific realism, pioneering special effects, ambiguous and often surreal imagery, sound in place of traditional narrative techniques, and minimal use of dialogue.Despite receiving mixed reviews upon release, 2001: A Space Odyssey is today recognized by many critics and audiences as one of the greatest films ever made; the 2002 Sight & Sound poll of critics ranked it among the top ten films of all time.Director of Photography Geoffrey Unsworth did not want the film to be complicated with printing effects such as blue screen, so most of the special effects were done as in-camera effects.This film pioneered retro-reflective matting (front projection) in mainstream movie production. The technique was selected to produce the backdrops for the African scenes where apes learn to use tools, as traditional techniques using backdrops or back-projection did not produce a realistic looking result. Existing techniques using painted backdrops for stills or back-projection for moving scenes simply didn't produce the realistic effects Kubrick demanded. The technique was also used for a number of shots during the spacecraft scenes, notably to produce the images seen through windows. The technique has been used widely in the film industry since 2001 pioneered its use, although starting in the 1990s it has been increasingly replaced by green screen systems.Due to the magnificence of this piece, I've found myself watching multiple times within a week. It truly is groundbreaking; in my mind, the most visually groundbreaking film in history. The thought of this film being ""boring"" or (as I've heard) ""pointless"" is like saying The Mona Lisa is pathetic. This movie is far from boring, it is the most interesting, and visually masterful film I've ever seen. The term ""pointless"" towards 2001, is a reaction that you'd find in the mind of a 15-year-old jock.If THIS movie is pointless, then what films aren't?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
531,aakash-karkare,Epic,10,5 November 2010,"Much has been said about Stanley Kubrick's 1968 epic 2001: A space Odyssey. Some have called the greatest movie ever made, others have called an exercise in psychedelia while others like Pauline Kael have called in unimaginative.Of all the things I could say about 2001 unimaginative comes least to mind. 2001 is anything but that. It is movie wide in its scope. It tries to introduce within the mind an aspect of extraterrestrial life with such reality that you think you are observing a documentary or actually witnessing the events as they happen around you.The film takes you right from the origin of man up to 2001 the year mankind finds the first sign of intelligent life in the universe outside of the earth. We meet Floyd as he sleeps in the aeroplane with the delightful Blue Danube Waltz playing in the background. From then we are taken on into a journey to the unknown. A journey to Jupiter to discover what is really out there. The first time I saw the movie I gave up in half an hour. I though it was another one of those over rated movies. Another example of the emperor's new clothes. I read the book and was blown away. I think the book is integral the movie's experience. I returned to the movie and was amazed for two hours and fifteen minutes of brilliance.Stanley Kubrick is definitely a visionary film maker. He has made a great film in every genre. Be it war,comedy, science fiction. When he set out to make 2001 all he wanted to make was ""the proverbial good science fiction movie"" and we landed up with this: an epic of such staggering beauty.Credit must be given to Arthur C. Clarke. Anyone who has read his books especially Rendezvous with Rama must acknowledge the debt that 2001 owes to him. His vision and method of story telling is greatly entwined in the film . Especially the open ending and leaving interpretations to the viewer and the way there is more observation and discovery and less expounding of theory and giving answers.2001 ends with 15 minutes of the most intense images. Those last few minutes are undeniably a psychedelic experience but they some how awaken a sense of such terrible beauty that you are overcome with emotion. What exactly does the black monolith lead to ? What is the place Bowman ends up in ? 2001 is one of the best movies ever made by one of the best directors of our time. Watch it to be taken into taken on two hour journey of breathtaking beauty, to scratch at the surface of the meaning of our existence and to speculate and maybe find an answer to our place in the universe",2001 - A Space Odyssey
532,panchodh_12,What the hell did I just watch?,8,27 November 2015,"I'm very confused right now. I definitely did not get what this movie is about. It certainly isn't just another space adventure movie. I'm not sure it would classify as sci-fi either. I see it more as a trip inside Kubrick's mind, perhaps? In any case, it is not necessarily the plot what matters more in this movie.This movie is definitely a visual masterpiece. It is truly amazing that Kubrick managed to pull out so many visual effects and tricks in 1968, and the spaceship scenes have nothing to envy to those of the latest space blockbuster. Many, many times they seemed a bit too slooow, but I'm guessing Kubrick did it on purpose to give a sense of the immensity of the cosmos. In any case, it is beautiful to see spaceships dancing a waltz, but shortening some scenes wouldn't have hurt. And then there's the prologue with the monkeys, which is a whole different story. Not only it takes twenty minutes to tell something it could have been told in much less, but it is also immensely puzzling. It definitely is there for a reason, I'm sure about it, but right now I can't seem to grasp its meaning. After finishing this review, I'll see what Internet has to say about it.And then there's the ending. Oh wow. I give this movie 8 stars, but the 8th star goes entirely to the final part: just before it I was thinking this movie deserved 7 stars. The landing on Jupiter is a wonderful example of the psychedelia of the 60s taken to a big screen. That sequence alone probably takes around ten minutes, but it is so enjoyable you don't even notice them. Then the very final scene is the most intriguing piece of cinema I remember right now. What does it mean? In what way is it related to the rest of the movie? I'm guessing Kubrick wanted the public to live the theatre with this questions unanswered. Thankfully, post-2001 viewers have the blessing of Internet, which I now turn to in the hope it clears up my doubts.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
533,raiderhayseed,2001 - A Prophecy About US Foreign Policy and the Need to Change It?,5,2 October 2013,"Former liberal Democrat US Congressman Dennis Kucinich has tied the significance of Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" to the aftermath of the destruction of the twin towers of the World Trade Centre in New York. (If you want read it in his own words, google, 'Dennis Kucinich Restoring Hope for America's Future Through Developing a Culture of Peace"" )Kucinich suggests that the frenzied celebration of the ape-men victors after the battle over the rights to the water hole at the start of the film is not dissimilar to the feelings of national pride by US citizens after the President George W Bush ""Iraq mission accomplished"" speech. Kucinich goes on to suggest some more highly evolved response, such as an examination of mind set behind American foreign policy, would have been more appropriate. His sentiments are admirable, but he seems to ignore the significance of the recurring monolith of the film. His speech encompasses the reality of the destruction of two monoliths that actually occurred in 9/11/2001. But he seems to ignore the significance of the film's monolith, that appears to ape-men, the astronauts on the moon, and Dave, the astronaut seeking it on Jupiter but finding it in his own memories and life experience.The people at IMDb have done a stirling job in coalescing the various contributions of their reviewers and the reluctant explanations by Kubrick into a workable explanation of what the film is all about, but I am not totally satisfied in what they have come up with. The conclusion seems to be that higher beings have placed a monolithic receiver on earth, an amplifier on the moon and a signal transmitter on Jupiter, to enable mankind to become more like them. Or, as Kubrick put it...""the hero is taken into a stargate - another dimension - into the presence of godlike entities - creatures of pure energy...his life passes before him... And he's reborn...(in a) room made of his own memoriesSounds like all those tired old UFO theories. I find the Kucinich explication more satisfying, but the problem of the missing monolith remains. So I sought my own interpretation in the life experience of Kubrick. I visited with Wikipedia to get some grist for the mill of my own heretical concoction.Kubrick's agent, Sam Jaffe, fled the madness of the 1950's McCarthy House UnAmerican Activities Committee, and settled in London in 1959. Three years later, in 1962, Kubrick moved to England to film Lolita ""because of easier financing and freedom from censorship"".He found a very pleasant working environment, moved into a castle and never left the place...In 1964 he transformed a novel about nuclear war ( Red Alert) into the satirical film Dr. Strangelove According to his biographer, LoBrutto and others, ""Kubrick was taking a bold and dangerous leap"", as the topic at that time was ""considered taboo"" and ""hardly socially acceptable""...The film stirred up much controversy and mixed opinions- a ""discredit and even contempt for our whole defense establishment . . . the most shattering sick joke I've ever come across""...Historian and philosopher Lewis Mumford, decades later, ""saluted"" Kubrick for ""having successfully utilized the only method capable of evading our national censor—relentless but hilarious satire"" Kubrick himself once stated: ""A satirist is someone who has a very skeptical view of human nature, but who still has the optimism to make some sort of a joke out of it. However brutal that joke might be.""Could ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" be a prophetic but similarly black exposition of the way in which the USA has degraded the admirable ideas of its founding fathers into the ape-man like violent aggression of its modern day rulers?Could HAL, the computer, be acting in accordance with its programmers and their masters at the US Pentagon and State Department along with unpleasant cast of sociopaths Oliver Stone depicted in his film ""JFK""? ""In the recorded message which plays after Dave has ""lobotomized"" HAL, Dr. Floyd reveals the computer has known the nature of the mission all along""Was HAL's error a programmed precondition to killing the crew?Could the 'powers that be' have decreed that people who seek some higher, better way of organizing society - the Kucinich quest if you will - should be blasted off into deep space and disposed of quietly, beyond the prying eyes of social/political critics and other malcontents?.Could the black monolith be a symbolic depiction of being ""born again"", not in the debauched meaning given to that term by evangelical ""Christians"", but in some purer, more aesthetic , more ethical way. "" Kubrick and Clarke studied Joseph Campbell's book, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, in order to find inspiration. From this mythological perspective, the hotel room (On Jupiter at the film's conclusion) can be seen as a symbolic womb where the hero goes through the process of death and rebirth - an essential part of the hero myth ""The post-production of the film obviously influenced George Lucas in manufacturing his Star Wars trilogy and in the Joseph Campbell thesis that the human stories deal with...1 The hero's departure from home on a spiritual quest, in the company of a mentor, and often with a brief stopover ""room"" to gain extra powers. Think of the first Star Wars film2 A death-rebirth atoning experience of reconciliation with a father figure. Think ""The Empire Strikes Back""3 The return of the enlightened hero to the world. Think ""The Return of the Jedi""I would like to expand upon this thesis, but IMDb space restrictions prohibit me from doing so.

But why?, some may be wondering...There´s no plot or if there is it´s just hard to find, there are no dialogues, no action, nothing... And to boots it´s more than 2 hours long.!!

535,carlgt1,One of the classics if not THE best sci-fi movie.,10,4 November 2000,"So much has been written about this movie that all I can say is: team up writer Arthur C. Clarke with director Stanley Kubrick and you get a cinematic masterpiece that will last long after we're gone.  This is still the landmark film that all other serious ""sci-fi"" films will have to be evaluated against.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
536,EdIsInHell,A Trip You Will Never Forget,9,25 February 2019,Visually Stunning. Superior directing. Excellent acting. Fabulous score. Kubrick hit a grandslam with 2001. If you have yet to see this at least 20 times you're missing out on a psychedelic masterpiece.Must be riding high on the fire to make this a truly incredible experience.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
537,royale_w_cheez44,A landmark in science fiction that still holds up today.,10,10 February 2006,"As fantastic as 2001: A Space Odyssey is, it is truly not a movie for everyone. You either love it to death, or you pan it as the worst film you have ever seen. There really isn't any between ground, because it isn't necessarily the most audience friendly film on the planet (sorry). It has a long runtime, it's story is complex and somewhat muddled, it moves fairly slow, and there are periods in which nothing is said for 10 minutes at a time. However, if you're like me, you will truly appreciate the epic beauty and groundbreaking achievement that this film is. It is perhaps the most influential science fiction flick ever. Maybe even more so than Star Wars.To people who can truly appreciate the poetic vision that Stanley Kubrick had, 2001 is an unforgettable film. You have the majestic theme song (one I had heard before I knew of the movie), a truly classic villain (HAL 9000 in all of his creepy glory), and special effects that still hold up today as out of this world and glorious visuals.Though this film is fairly slow, I couldn't keep my eyes off of the screen for the whole runtime. The special effects have a look and feel to them that looks 100% believable, maybe even more so than most viz fx today. The imagery mixed with the lovely orchestral music create images that will stick with you forever. And, being that it was released before man even landed on the moon, it is a truly visionary look at the then-future. It's amazing to see how close our world today is to that in the movie.The segment of the film with the astronauts with HAL 9000 is classic. The quiet atmosphere throughout the whole story sets the mood of a ""so-tranquil-you'll-kill-yourself"" feel. And once HAL 9000 gets some glitches, you really REALLY see the sh*t hit the fan. Everything about HAL 9000, the smooth and calm voice, the red light that always watches, and a computer with a desire to stay alive. Groundbreaking stuff.Though the story is muddled and the ending almost incomprehensible, the theme of the movie can really be applied to today. How humans have remained dependent on technology, from the humanoids in Africa to the astronauts on Jupiter, and how eventually us humans will not be the most intelligent life form in the universe.For anyone turned off by the ending, I would highly recommend reading the novel of the same name. It was released simultaneously with the movie and really sheds some light on the Monolith and the mission to Jupiter. It's as good as the movie, which is really saying a lot.That being said, 2001 is either a movie that you will love or hate. I've heard claims that the film is boring pretentious art-house garbage, but I found it to be a fascinating, ground-breaking, sci-fi classic that will surely go into history as a monument not only in film, but in the way we look at the universe.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
538,highkite,One of the creepiest films ever made.,10,15 June 2006,"I don't think ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" should really be considered a film, but instead, it should be plain art. By ""plain"" I don't mean boring or uninspiring. I call it ""plain art"" because even to consider this genius work in the same category as other movies is risking comparison, and placing this movie beside another movie is almost unfair, because no movie has ever come close to being as unique.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is by far the most original piece of cinema ever created. It not only represents an idea so creepy and so realistic, but also breaks barriers in movie storytelling. Everything, from a 3-part narrative to an ending that makes you think for hours, wows the audience and sends their heads flying back in shock. It's a movie that a few may find weird, disjointed and pretentious, but every good movie is criticized by the public.The movie tells the story of a major transition between apes, humans and technology. Apes evolve into humans, and humans give birth to artificial intelligence. Probably one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history, as an ape smashes bones and throws one up into the air, director Stanley Kubrick carefully crafts a flawless transition from a bone into a space ship. Kubrick then takes us through some creepy ideas about unexplainable events and technology taking over humanity. Though we see three different stories, they are all connected: the apes show the first sign of evolution into humanity as they become more aware of their surroundings and learn the nature of mystery. Then, fast-forwarding thousands of years later, we see the story of a spaceship traveling to the moon on a commercial craft, and as they arrive they are shocked to find a monolith, which then transitions into a couple of months later when a newer spaceship is traveling to Jupiter.Kubrick really shows his genius in this movie, as he both directs the movie and the special effects. For the year it was made, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" completely shocked the audience with one of the most advanced and complex effects ever seen, which wows viewers even to this day. In an age where special effects were all done by hand, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" makes many people skeptical as to how they achieved some of the scenes without computer help. Aside from the stellar special effects, the score is the most haunting and unique piece of music ever put on the big screen. It so closely fits in with the movie with some major key scenes.The movie plays like an opera. It sways the audience in an inspiring music frenzy while also focusing on a story. And as we watch this movie brought to life, we question our own faith and our own motives in terms of creating artificial intelligence and traveling to foreign planets. What if one day our own race creates a HAL 9000 (a supercomputer with the ability to think and feel)? Questions like this are very much discussed upon watching this terribly amazing movie.Stanley Kubrick's best direction and one of my top movies of all time. It makes any other movie about space travel or artificial intelligence look shameful. A perfect film and an inspiring piece of art, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" defines cinema as one of the most influential and visually stunning films of all time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
539,mig28lx,Turn on your thinking caps,8,12 September 2000,"Yes, the film is slow.  Yes, there is hardly any dialogue.  Yes, the opening sequence is strange, cryptic, and contains NO dialogue.  Yes, the ending reveals nothing.  No, the ending is not climactic in the traditional sense. Yet this is hailed as THE masterpiece of modern science-fiction cinema. Why?I suspect most of the detractors of this film, particularly those represented by some of these user-comments, forgot to do one thing before watching the film: turn their thinking caps to the ""ON"" position.  This is not the voice of someone jumping on the artsy-film bandwagon.  This is the voice of someone who did some serious thinking about the events of the film. Why would the director include this shot or that bit of dialogue?  It's like that scene from ""Close Encounters""; the more you think about it, the more you realize that this MEANS something, this is IMPORTANT.  If the thought that human evolution might have been instigated by an alien consciousness doesn't make you look at the stars with increasing wonder, you're not thinking hard enough.  And if you're a serious filmgoer at any level, and you didn't like the film the first time, you owe it to yourself to watch it again.  This time, turn your thinking cap on.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
540,Lunchbox-8,A journey through truly classic filmmaking,8,24 May 2001,"2001: a Space Odyssey is truly one of if not the greatest sci-fi movie ever made.  Kubrick was one of the greatest directors of all time.  Always making an intelligently made, meaningful movie that wasn't always appreciated by critics but usually adored by countless movie buffs.  This movie, Kubrick's first dip into the endless seas of science firction, has probably had more impact than any other movie in the sci-fi category.  It changed the image that many people had of science fiction up to that point. Kubrick brought an often ludicrous and usually meaningless genre into the blossoming and incredible gem that it is today.  Would cinema be the same without such classics as Blade Runner, Star Wars, or The Matrix?  The answer is no.  And all this beauty can be credited towards one man- Stanley Kubrick.The film is the story of mankind.  It is an wisely conceived theory about the origin of human intelligence.  It's full of countless themes having to do with the human nature, computers, religion, and alien control over our lives.  The most comprehensive work about the themes of 2001 can be found in the liner notes of the 2001: a Space Odyssey soundtrack.  It is full of cool insights about the great picture.2001 is an interesting movie but really is always either loved or hated, just one side or the other, no in betweens.  The main reason that the film is sometimes so strongly hated is because of the fact that nothing really exciting happens in the film.  There is no emotion or great acting in the film.  No gun fights or big action sequences.  The main reason to see this movie is to realize and understand the deep underlying themes in it.  I'm not going to divulge any of them, but the source I stated before pretty much covers it.  If you're not into movies that are real thinkers, then don't see this.  If you like sci-fi like Armageddon or (shudder) Supernova, then definitely don't se this.  This isn't the story of a budding romance and a bunch of cool zero gravity laser fights.2001: a Space Odyssey is truly a work of art.  It deserves to be seen by anyone with any interest in film or any so called sci-fi fan.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Yeah, in other movies, you're watching the action, in this movie, you are almost experiencing the action, the tension, the odyssey... it's amazing.The story is a mystery plot, in which the viewer has to figure out, along with the characters, what is going on, in midst of a chilling space adventure, in which the characters face a relentless force lurking them... it's incredible. I won't dare spoil anything to anyone, so, go check it out. This movie is the prime example of ""show, don't tell"". It's the most amazing visual experience you'll ever had. I watch it regularly, and the visual effect never get old. Why?, because the experience and the story are so well crafted, it makes the effects amazing every time, not like other movies (as Matrix) where the effects get old after the second view. There are deep questions, deep motifs, and a mysterious and epic finish... it's breath taking.When I think a movie works for me, I give it a 10 score. I wish I could give it more to this masterpiece.

544,Incendid,Visual Poetry!,10,5 December 2014,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that is very hard to describe and also a film that says film is not just art it is high art and has true meaning and relevance in society. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film raises the bar in terms of how sci-fi films are seen, how sci- fi films can show relevance in today's society, how sci-fi films can offer deep and meaningful insight into the human experience and also provide moral lessons to an audience, 2001: A Space Odyssey also showed off it's amazing effects and clever story and score that keeps people invested in the story and wanting more. Over the years many film makers have tried to recreate the magic of 2001: A Space Odyssey, however I don't think that over, the past 46 years there has been a film that has come close to achieving the visual poetry that 2001: A Space Odyssey so flawlessly presented.2001: A Space Odyssey is a unique film that pushes the audience's beliefs and how we see the issues of human efficiency, technology and the unknown. Stanley Kubrick blends these themes flawlessly and executes them with his trademarks, providing the audience with a deep film that is both eerie and mesmerising. In conclusion 2001: A Space Odyssey is a timeless classic that many consider visual poetry. It is a film everyone should watch and for that reason 2001: A Space Odyssey receives a 10/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

But even without an attractive story Kubrick manages to keep your attention all the way through, giving you images that keep your eyes locked on without a doubt.

549,YellowManReanimated,2001: An interpretation,10,26 June 2021,"I've found myself particularly interested in iconic films of the '60s due to how fascinating that decade was. There was so much going on in terms of social demographic change, shifts in attitudes and values, new forms of artistic expression and experimentation and the development of a muscular form of scientific discovery. A lot of the above shifts seem to have been born of a combination of both idealism, seen via a belief in a possible future Shangri-la, and a world weary cynicism, born of recent experience of global warfare and the significant prospect of nuclear annihilation which could follow. 2001 addresses both of these attitudes using a visual and technical mastery which had never quite been witnessed in cinema previously.Firstly, I should address the obvious: the film exists in a future world made possible through scientific progress. There are fully constructed space stations which men (and some women) are able to travel between in order to conduct their investigations and experiments. Technology has developed to the point of allowing mankind to travel to the farthest outreaches of the solar system via the possibility of state-of-the-art space vessels, which include hibernation chambers to conserve energy and resources. Spaceships are controlled using artificial intelligence, which is advertised as being infallible. However, the hubris of the human created, although not controlled, AI is what causes the cracks to appear in the film's pristine scientific surface.The AI in the film, anthropomorphised through HAL, is a reflection of humanity itself and the myth of scientific idealism; namely, the belief that, through science, we shall conquer all obstacles and achieve a perfect world. The film is circular in its thematic structure in the sense that it ends at its beginning: with the story of human evolution. The film is obscure by design but it begins by showing us in our pre-modern form, apes fighting in a barren landscape who are mysteriously transformed due to the intervention of a giant monolith spontaneously appearing from out of space. It ends by showing us a giant embryo which appears after we watch the film's foremost explorer get drawn into a temporal and spatial journey over which he has no control. This, perhaps, is the main argument of the film: humanity's attempts to take control of the universe via science are doomed to failure. There are forces which go far beyond us, which govern us in ways we do not understand. Thus, in challenging scientific idealism, the film reflects the wider attitudes of the time; it shows us a world in which human progress is both fascinating and palpable, yet, it also shows us both a universe and an evolutionary journey that we shall never fully understand and, certainly, that we shall never be able to control.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

555,MatBrewster,Classic in Everyway,10,2 March 2005,"I will not attempt to discuss the meaning of this film, or to answer most of the questions it poses. There are plenty of places on the internet that try to do that.2001 is one of the few films I find absolutely amazing, and that I dread to watch. Like Citizen Kane I find this movie to be technically brilliant, but mostly boring. It was the first or second DVD that I purchased when I bough my player back in 1999. Yet in the interim 5 odd years I have watched 2001 in its entirety only once or twice. Several times I have started to sit and watch it, but I just can't get through it all at once. Even for this review I watched it in sections.It doesn't help that the section I enjoy the most (the section involving the mission to Jupiter and HAL) is a good hour into the movie. It's not that the other sections do not have meaning to me, it's just that I find them very difficult to get through. The opening sequence ""The Dawn of Man"" is very well filmed, is vital to understanding the whole movie, and begins to ask some very good questions (does the advent of technology bring us closer to destruction as it also further our race? Yet, I find this section mind numbingly dull. Upon first viewing it was interesting, but now I know that the monolith is coming, I know that the ape-men discover the use of the bones as tools and this leads to their use as weapons. My knowledge of the action now bores me. I am the type of person who enjoys watching a movie repeatedly. I have a pretty large collection of DVDs and watch many of them often. So knowing the outcome of a scene does not always necessitate my boredom. It is just so with this particular film.Likewise the next section of film leading to the discovery of the monolith on the moon I find to be quite boring. It is only when we get to the middle chapter of the movie dealing with the journey to Jupiter and the madness of HAL that I remain interested as a film watcher. This section also happens to be the one I find most technically interesting. I must also admit this is the section with the most dialogue and most action. But I am not ready that this is the cause of my enjoyment. Because by most standards there is still not a lot of action or dialogue going on in the film. What I do enjoy is the use of sets to create the space station atmosphere. For example, I love trying to determine how they created the scenes where the astronauts appear to walk upside down or 'turn' with the ship? The atmosphere created by use of the silence of space, the loneliness of the ship and the remoteness of the all seeing HAL eye is pitch perfect. Kubrick builds the tension between the two conscience astronauts and HAL brilliantly. The scene in which HAL reads the astronauts lips is still one of my favorites in any film, ever. HAL, though a computer, has been rated as one of the greatest scree villains of all time, and rightly so. He is as calculating as he is cold.Once this section ends, though we slip back into the brilliant but boring mode of the film. When Dave slips into the wormhole (did anyone call it a wormhole back then?) we are treated to a psychedelic ride of crazy colors and trippy music. But it goes on so long that I wish I did acid or smoked pot to keep me interested. It's like the whale chapters of Moby Dick, where I have to agree that they are important for the sake of the novel, but I'd rather just skip past them and get on with the story. I believe the parts I find boring in the movie are essential to the film, and in many ways they make it the masterpiece of cinema that it is. This being so doesn't make me watch it more than once every few years.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Then, I'm wondering if it's a National Geographic documentary about evolution and paleoanthropology; immediately after that, I assume it's a documentary about paleoastronauts; finally I understand it's an epic science fiction movie based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel.
Combining Western Classical Music and space imagery somehow works, and at the same time it doesn't; it just makes it more epic, but it creates an antithesis with the concept of space.
I must say that this movie is somehow more accurate than most recent sci-fi movies: first of all, there's no sound in space! Also, everything happening looks quite plausible.
It's a movie not based on dialogues, but on visuals and symbolism.
Probably the movie has more meaning if you read the book first (the same goes to ""Stalker"").
A very influential sci-fi movie, but this doesn't make it a perfect one.
Another case of a movie that enters the category ""good but not THAT good"".",2001 - A Space Odyssey
559,michaelheiser-25099,Good film of Kubrick,6,10 November 2021,"Good film of Kubrick that tend to love this long nothingness because of its artistic merits. And I somewhat understand this - I can understand praising ""2001"" for its uniqueness, its powerful narrative. But the fact of the matter is that as a movie it's simply not very good because of this! It has dated very poorly. E.g. The space station segments - they are one of the only moments in the film with extensive dialogue. The ""futuristic"" suits are laughably '60s-ish and some of the ideas in the movie about communication via video, etc. Are ludicrous. That happens in any movie after a certain amount of time, but ""2001"" almost entirely depends upon this. I feel the actual story itself is weak. Kubrick is at a loss for anything useful so he delays it by continually showing us exterior shots of spacecraft and planets in tune with classical pieces. It just gets to be too much after a while.This all said, please understand I am not putting down this movie. I still admire it very much for what it is and will watch it for years to come. But as a piece of entertainment, as a movie...I find it poor and self-indulgent on Kubrick's behalf. It lacks the satirical bite of ""A Clockwork Orange."" The end sequence is horribly outdated with drug-trip visuals (it was rumored to have been one of the movies stoners would go see on a regular basis!). Like everything in this movie, it goes on too long - look at ""Easy Rider"" and ""Midnight Cowboy."" Both have '60s/'70s druggie sequences but both end before becoming intolerable - ""2001"" goes on too long... ""2001"" is a piece of art, but it is not a good movie in any way. I have seen art house films with better plots (""Punch-Drunk Love,"" ""Magnolia"") and more involving stories. ""2001"" is a showcase for special effects and directorial styles - but now it is very outdated and alienating and this is my biggest problem with it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I don't believe in evolution and evolution is one of the films main undertones but this does not take away from this cinematic masterpiece. the special effects were top notch and the acting was great. this movie is suspenseful and beautiful and makes you feel like you are accompanying the astronauts on their amazing odyssey to Jupiter. i recommend this to anyone that is in the mood for a truly amazing film.,2001 - A Space Odyssey

564,dcorr123,One of the best science fiction films ever,10,27 July 2000,"The art direction/special effects were certainly the best ever at the time it was produced and still stand up very well. The movie was originally shown in Cinerama theaters (the closest thing then to IMAX). The music is perfect. Too bad they don't give Oscars for choreographing film to non-original music. This is a fine example of absolute film making, psychedelic 60s style. The story is told largely through the visuals and the music, with little or no need for dialogue. Actually I think the story as presented this way is a pretty straight forward one of a more advanced ""caretaker"" civilization nudging mankind along in its evolution.  I don't see why some people feel they might need to read the book to understand it. Actually I think the movie is better than the book. Finally there is the matter of the space station. If we had kept the pace of development, as it was at the time this movie was produced, we might have a real space station instead of the ""double wide"" they're currently building.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
565,cathcacr,"Yes, a Masterpiece",10,29 August 2001,"There are very few films in my opinion that merit recognition for being a Masterpiece of the medium, and this is it.  I would say arguably one of the 10 greatest films that have been made, up there with _The Godfather_, _Schindler's List_, and a few others.  And if there were any one film that I had to rate as my #1 favorite at this point, this one would be it.It is NOT, however, recommended for anyone and everyone; even a masterpiece needs a receptive audience for it to be truly enjoyed, and shouldn't be forced on anyone.  (Somehow I can't get into an Akira Kurosawa epic, but maybe in time.)  It IS slow-paced, and it IS enigmatic.  For many movie-viewers nowadays, that just isn't their thing.  This is a science-fiction film, but you won't see the Discovery spacecraft make the jump to light speed, or maneuver swiftly through the asteroid belt.  The sequences involving things floating around in space are often accompanied by silence, rather than exciting background music.  And some movie-viewers just can't STAND not having their senses bombarded in the ways that please them. To an appropriately trained mind, however, the movie is a feast.The one thing that probably COULD be done better today with more modern special effects is the Star Gate sequence.  But one thing that impressed me most about this as well as much of the rest of the movie -- and I'll even limit my remarks about what makes this film so enjoyable to me to this alone -- is the way in which Kubrick uses music to accentuate the effect of the imagery.  Every music piece seems perfectly selected for its use; from the triumphant fanfare of Richard Strauss's _Also Sprach Zarathustra_, to the the choreography of the spaceships to Johann Strauss's _Blue Danube Waltz_, to the creepy cacophany of voices of Ligeti's _Requiem_ accompanying the monolith, to the weeping tone of the _Gayenne Ballet Suite_ accompanying the languid movements of the Discovery, and last but not least, the eerie aural orgasm of Ligeti's _Atmospheres_ accompanying Bowman's journey beyond the infinite, Kubrick finely crafts imagery and sound to coalesce into a beauteous blend.I have Kubrick to thank for turning me on to the sounds of Ligeti -- as there may be no other filmmakers who could integrate such sounds in such an appropriate and classy way into the main scenes of their films.  (I hadn't even yet mentioned the nearly indescribable sounds of Ligeti's _Lux Aeterna_ accompanying the moonscape shuttle.)The only thing I can say by way of disappointment is that I have yet to see this on the big screen in theaters; let's just hope that the appropriate powers that be see fit to place this back on the large screen, if not in the year 2001 as it obviously should be, sometime very SOON.This is one of the few films to which I am absolutely honored to give a full 10 out of 10.  Thank you, Stanley.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
566,cathcacr,Greatest film ever made?,10,24 May 2002,"Another reviewer below ( http://imdb.com/CommentsShow?62622-541 ) asked this very question as well.  I've written an earlier review ( http://imdb.com/CommentsShow?62622-432 ) hailing it as a Masterpiece, though now I'm considering whether it's even greater than that.  I look at the ""top 100 lists"" here and elsewhere, and when you consider such films as _The Godfather_, _Citizen Kane_, _Schindler's List_ and a very, very short list of others (after you get past about 6 or 7 films, the next on the list after those just don't stack up to _2001_), _2001_ may or may not stand right alongside them or surpass them as far as cinematic perfection goes, but it is, at the very least, in extremely close proximity.As for all the negative reviews of the film, I think a chief problem many have with this film is that it doesn't present itself as a ""normal"" film; if what you want is a film that plays like other great ones, you're going to be sorely disappointed.  As anyone who watched it (love it or hate it) knows, it doesn't rely on explicit narrative nearly as much as in just about any other great film you care to name.  But it sets a standard for monumental filmmaking.  For many of us lovers of cinema, Stanley Kubrick's epic is a blessing: it showed to the world and to the filmmaking industry that ""weird,"" ""avant-garde"" filmmaking can be great.  Yeah, it took a guy with a big name and a big-studio super-budget to make it happen on American screens, but it helped to breathe new life into the cinema and taught the studios not to stifle greatness just because it may be ""boring"" or ""weird.""Again, we lovers of film all owe Stanley a huge debt.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

570,Sonic_Ocean,A film that is wide in scope and the best word to describe it: Limitless,10,6 December 2012,"This could definitely a very strong contender for the greatest movie of all time. Never before has a movie felt so grandiose and immersive. What I mean by grandiose is how there will be scenes (or suites) that allow the film to breathe. I could understand the complaints of how the movie can be really slow, but the thing to understand here is how these scenes bring out the atmosphere of space, whether it is its breathtaking beauty or its strong sense of deep isolation as we venture deeper into the unknown. These scenes are either soothing or tension-building.Not a lot of films can make techniques like this work so naturally, especially when what is marketed to the masses are fast moving, intense action films, but 2001: Space Odyssey redefines the science fiction in ways that still make it a groundbreaking achievement today.One example could be its depiction of highly advanced human technology. While the year 2001 in actuality was far from the technological advancements in the film, especially currently, it still invokes a sense of wonder of what we, the human race, are truly capable of and I think that is truly what this film sets out to do. With its depiction of human evolution, to me the point of this film is that there is truly no end to our self-discovery and we are far from grasping the universe and its mysteries. What this film is trying to say, in my opinion, is that this is still the beginning. 5/5",2001 - A Space Odyssey

572,ProperCharlie,Astounding Story,10,8 September 2005,"When I was growing up in the 1970s, I knew the future would like '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Everything would move slowly, with an elegance and grace. Spaceships would waltz around planets and space stations. Astronauts would bide their time patiently, waiting to get to their destination in sterile surroundings. Men really did land on the Moon the year after this was released, but the effects didn't look as good. When 'Star Wars' came along, it looked the same but made everything move ten times faster, whilst the crew weren't so averse to grease and dust. Somehow that didn't seem right.It's a testament to the special effects of this film that it's only when I see the film now, in 2005, that I'm beginning to see where the effects begin and the backdrop ends. They are almost perfect. As I am exposed to more films, I get used to the CGI. It looks far too artificial. In 1968 they made do with model work and camera movement. It looks far, far better to me. Keep it simple, stupid. There's even some attempt at a steadicam-ish sort of shot on board the Discovery before steadicam got invented. The sound design is also excellent. For 10 minutes all we can hear is breathing and the sound of gasses whistling through tubes. The sound of life support in the silence of space. Possible the most tense sound imaginable as the rate your respiratory system matches that of Dave Bowman. The influence of the design lives on through sci-fi films to this day. Look at the graphics on the computer screens. Now think of 'Alien', 'Hitch-Hiker's' on the TV. Think of Darth Vader's heavy breathing.Then there's the horror. The third section with HAL and the Discovery is some of the most tense film I know. I've already talked about the sound, but there are all the other nightmare touches. Empty space-suits hang like suits of armour in a haunted castle with added gas-mask creepiness. You're just waiting for them to move. Then there's pods looking like Cycloptic crabs. And of course at the centre there's unblinking, Orwellian eye of HAL. Seeing everything. The many long-held shots on that red glow are all that's needed for you to wonder just what he's thinking. You can see the turmoil going on behind the bulb. Beyond the Discovery there's an emphasis on violent death whether it be of apes, tapirs or sleeping scientists.There's also a lot to think about. Philosophical questions about evolution, death and rebirth, change, artificial intelligence. I know there are theological debates on the film's position on evolution or creation. To my mind it's a half way house, not mentioning creation at all and suggesting some form of 'driven selection'. Are the black slabs gods or God? Or can any civilisation, sufficiently advanced, appear to us as gods or magical. The mystical, hallucinogenic final section is redolent of the era in which the film was made. It offers no easy explanation, but then if these beings are so advanced, do you think we'd understand them in the space of twenty minutes? This film has so much, and I love it more every time I see it. I'm astounded it was made in 1968. I still want the future to be a zero-G ballet in orbit. I'm waiting for another film to match this in its vision.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It is revolutionary, and i think that this film alone makes Stanley Kubrick the best director ever, despite all his other great work.However, this film is not for everyone. Some people may be bored by it, as there is very little dialogue, and a lot of it is quite subtle, and slow moving. Be warned, you have to be in the mood, as it's not overly easy to watch and requires your full attention. Not one to sit round with your mates after a few drinks. Any film maker or appreciator will enjoy this, as the whole feature is visually mesmerising, and accompanied by an incredible soundtrack.It portrays the development of life, and the history of existence. Billions of years of evolution are symbolised in one transition (you'll see that in the film).Basically, it is very good. At the end, a baby appears on screen, which you may not have my humour, but i was incredibly close to laughing my head off.

Hal is as recognizable a character out of American cinema as James Bond or the man at the party recommending plastics in 'The Graduate'.

577,endymion82,"In Space Everything Is... Very, Very Slow...",3,18 February 2002,"I do not understand the appeal of this movie. Yes, it's beautiful to look at, and at the time the special effects must have been absolutely dazzling because they're still pretty good by today's standards, but man oh man this seriously might be the dullest film I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I like long movies, and my attention span is definitely not short, but there is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING driving this film: no plot, no characters, no revelations, no statements, no themes. It's like an absence of experience... except the experience of watching perfectly shot but painstakingly slow models and people moving through cool looking but not-cool-enough-to-just-look-at-forever starscapes and spaceship sets. As is often the case with Kubrick movies (THE SHINING be a big exception, and thus brilliant), there is virtually no character development or depth, but in this film even the actors seem to be moving through a daze where they can't register emotions or be any more interesting than the auteur's concept so you can't even enjoy this film for the performances- which mind you, aren't bad, just totally non-existant, as if they were afraid of detracting, somehow, from all the really slow moving models of space stations. Ultimately that sentiment sums up my feelings about this movie as a whole: not bad, certainly there seems to be some merit because everything is so pretty and done with such seriousness, but finally, in the end, there isn't really anything to enjoy here or latch onto- even the wonderment of space seems sort of lackluster once all the trippy visuals begin and then the movie segues into a lame, psuedo-mysterious ending. You never really care about the people being presented- what happens to them, what they're thinking about, etc- and thus, it's really hard to care about the ideas, let alone the virtually non-existant and mostly unexplained story. Good art should make you care- be that in a positive or negative way- and this movie just leaves me totally cold.

The only thing that made it come up a bit short in this regard was the polyester clothing and the plastic furniture, but hey, YOU try to make a timeless film!BRAVO to the accurate depiction of the absence of sound in space. This realistic touch made us aware of every precious breath taken in space's vacuum (the only sounds that can be heard from the environment of a spacesuit). Why does every other SF movie make spaceships go by with a token ""whoosh!""?Kubrick made us appreciate the story line with the vivid imagery of the subhumans' warfare. In this regard, he actually outdid Mr. Clarke. Who can forget that thrown bone turning into a spaceship? Kubrick must have been a fan of the Beatles' 1967's Sgt. Pepper album, the scene reminding me of the chicken's cluck that turned into a guitar riff.This movie isn't for everyone, any more than any movie is.

579,glasslens,The 2014 Restored Version - the quality is there if you can view it properly.,8,9 December 2014,"Sadly, I am old enough to remember seeing 2001 when it first came out. I saw it in a London West End cinema in it's full 70mm glory on a huge screen. The sound was amazing - huge full-range speakers. A mind blowing experience. Then I heard that a newly restored version was coming to cinemas. So, last night I went to the Picturehouse Harbour Lights cinema in Southampton UK to regain the wonder of this film. I've seen quite a few restored/remastered films and have been amazed by the way some very skilled people have made them better than new. By scanning from the camera negatives, all the losses we used to get from inter-negs and release prints disappear and we are left with amazing clarity and colour fidelity. And, sound restoration can produce stunning sound. So, you can imagine the anticipation as I joined the audience - positioning myself in the best viewing seats. The disappointment set in at the very beginning as the thunderous Also Sprach Zarathustra welled-up. What I actually heard was a harsh muddy sound almost as though it had come from the ceiling speakers you get in department stored. The opening of the film is a ""blank"" screen but the blank screen had a small but worrying orange blur on each side of the screen. Once we got into the guts of the film, it became apparent to me that we were not looking at a painstakingly re-mastered digital version from the 65mm camera negative so lovingly shot by Geoffrey Unsworth but at what looked like a 35mm inter-negative or even a print. Definition was poor, colours were blotchy and uneven, and there was even a side-to-side wobble on the live action scenes - and that is unforgivable. At this point, I should say that I was professionally involved in some film restoration a couple of years ago, so you could say I was being over-critical, but I don't think so. I carried on watching the film finding myself becoming more and more disappointed. 2001 is an amazing film, but watching it in such poor image and sound quality was a great disappointment. Perhaps you need to see it on a huge screen with a huge sound system, but until it is properly restored, I would not risk it.I left at the interval.Added after re-viewing...........Having been very negative about the restored version of 2001 that I saw at a local cinema, I now want to add something to that review. As I write this, I am now watching the restored version on a professionally set-up high quality plasma screen and my own high quality sound system and I have to say that my opinion of this restored version has changed considerably. I have to put the problems detailed above down to the cinema rather than this restoration of 2001. Firstly the sound quality is extremely good. The sound field is well defined there is virtually no distortion, although unfortunately some fierce limiting and compression on Also Sprach Zarathustra. The quality of the images is actually quite stunning - gorgeous rich blacks, superb skin tones and glowing whiteness - in fact it is hard to imagine a better grading then this. The only the very minor issue that remains is the slight horizontal wobble on a lot of the shots which is normally attributable to either warn or distorted sprocket holes or issues with the original camera . This may well have been due to the use of multiple runs of the negative through the cameras. It is normally relatively easy to correct this type of wobble but if different images on the frame are wobbling differently then probably it is best left alone! This is a very minor point - it is barely noticeable, and I only noticed it because I have worked on some restoration of old 16 millimetre films and seen this effect and worked on the correction of it.My conclusion is that in fact the 2001 restored version is superb and should be watched by anyone who enjoys the genius of Kubrick at his best. If you can view it on a very high quality television with extremely good quality sound then I think that may be better than relying on a cinema. Oh, and with all this stuff about the technical quality, I ought to mention that the story is Just amazing when you allow yourself to be totally immersed in it. And, the pacing of the film is perfection. The genius of Kubrick and his amazingly talented team. If you take your pleasures slow and sweet, this will delight.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
580,dimitrisalomao,Classic.,9,12 March 2010,"In my review of ""Avatar"" I wrote that special effects only, don't make a good movie. I may sound controversial, despite the fact that the plot is not necessarily for us to understand, the movie is a masterpiece.No one can produce photography and atmosphere like Kubrick does, he can make a spaceship landing for 10 minutes and you can't take you're eyes of the screen, it's so beautiful and more realistic than special effects we see in some movies nowadays. I think ""2001: A Space Oddysey"" is way better than ""Avatar"" because they don't try to make the script sound good, it just flows very well.In the fashion business, the stylist makes a dress that is not necessarily wearable, but it set trends for the new ones, how not to compare this with ""2001""?. I think it's there to set trends for future movies, and it nails it, it's a classic, you can't find a sci-fi movie today that didn't take anything from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Throughout the movie, I never wanted to stop watching, even if there was nothing going on, like the part that lights pop in the screen for fifteen minutes.Verdict: Like any Kubrick film, the atmosphere is mesmerizing.

Paths of Glory was devastating. Clockwork Orange scarred me for life. I even appreciate Barry Lyndon not Ryan O'Neal, but I digress. 2001 IS important in film history, i firmly believe Star Wars would not exist if not for this film. But this film is so antiseptic. You have music, then ten minutes of darkness. Then primates come shrieking on the scene, throwing bones, killing pigs and screaming at the monolith, which seemed to like a chocolate bar on steroids. Then one throws a bone in the air and presto! It is a space vehicle. When the actual humans in the film speak, my sister said ""can you turn the volume up?"" I did and it did not help. Everything happens so slowlyyyyyyyyyyyy in this film. In the end, HAL ended up as my favorite character, with the screaming primate coming in second place.

583,deadkerouac,Journey Beyond the Stars,10,1 January 2001,"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is one of the most exploratory and daring science fiction films ever made and one of the best overall films made in the latter part of the 20th century. The combined vision of Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick, basing the screenplay on Clarke's novel, created a visual and aural masterpiece closer to realism than any science fiction film that preceded it. The film was released in 1968, at a time of political and social upheaval: while the Apollo space program headed closer and closer to the moon, young men were being drafted into Vietnam and the voices of college students around the country began to be heard.2001 was (and perhaps always will be) unlike any other science fiction film. It begins with a rendition of Richard Strauss' `Also Sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spake Zarathustra)' slowly building up as the opening credits appear during a lunar eclipse (as each sphere overshadows the one preceding it). For the next seventeen or so minutes, we are introduced to `The Dawn of Man.' A group of apes struggle to survive in a rough African landscape. (It should be noted that humans portray these apes, so realistically that it seems like we are watching a documentary on the Discovery Channel.) The apes live in a waterhole; the only source of water for miles, the waterhole is the apes' paradise. This then becomes the locale for conflict between two groups of apes. The main ape (called `Moon-Watcher' in the novel) unleashes his `discovery' (bone as weapon) on a member of the other group. Soon we are introduced to the monolith, a mysterious huge black rectangular slab that will serve as a link between the four parts of the film.In one of the most famous jump cuts in cinema history, Moon-Watcher hurls the bone into the air; it rises and turns slowly, transforming into a bone-shaped satellite. This sudden evolution, from ape to man, will remind us of the bone, and will introduce us to the next `discovery' of man: technology. Like the bone, the satellite is both a tool and a weapon; the data collected by satellites can easily be used for destructive purposes.In the second part of the film, `4 Million Years Later,' we meet the first `actor' in William Sylvester, who portrays an intentionally bland Dr. Heywood Floyd. Floyd is more politician than scientist, as he dismisses rumors (brought up by Russian scientists) of an epidemic outbreak at the lunar Clavius Base. This part of the film portrays lengthy scenes of Floyd's ship docking, first at the wheel-shaped space station, then on the lunar surface. Within, life is made up of politicians and scientists within white walls, mechanical doors, and bright lights. Outer space, meanwhile, is silent and black. And breathtakingly beautiful. The lifelessness of the human characters in 2001 is intentional, because WHAT WE SEE is the true star of the film. In the  `Jupiter Mission-18 Months Later' sequence of the film, we meet the bone-shaped spaceship Discovery, a representation of man's achievements in technology; two astronauts, Dr. David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), both of whom man the ship while the other three astronauts are in hibernation; and perhaps one of the most memorable characters in film, the HAL 9000 supercomputer (voiced by Douglas Rain), a living computer (to us, a red glassy eye) that has the ability to think on its own, and thus can make its own decisions. The Discovery depicts man's life in outer space, more so than the second part of the film: a place for exercise (Frank jogging), leisure (Frank playing chess, Dave drawing sketches), and research (the various work the astronauts do on the ship). HAL 9000 can be both a tool (serving as the protector of Discovery) and a weapon (eliminating those interfering with the mission, which we will soon discover). The film offers a lot of emotion in the character of HAL 9000. HAL is the central character of this part of the film. As a computer, he cannot repress his emotions for the sake of the mission (as Dave and Frank do, having been trained in the space program). Only when a vital component of the communication system seems to fail does HAL discover his own imperfection, and the mission is ultimately jeopardized. A revelation into the purpose of the Jupiter mission (and a revelation into the purpose of the monolith) leads us to one of the most stunning, fascinating sequences caught on film, as Dave descends from the spaceship Discovery and enters Jupiter's atmosphere in the final part of the film, `Jupiter-And Beyond the Infinite.'2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY can be a major disappointment, especially now that we have reached it but are not traveling to the moon during summer vacation. Clarke used the year not because he felt we would be excavating monoliths on the moon by the year 2001, but because it's symbolic, it IS the year of the new millennium, the year that will continue for us the life begun in evolution. We will one day realize the effects of 2001 the film, and when that occurs, life to us would seem very ordinary.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Let's begin.The only good moments about the film are the monkey segment and the HAL segment. Why? Because those are the only moments that FEELS like an actual film, Is it too much to ask for a little story development? Maybe some meaningful dialogue? Because I gotta be honest, space machines moving around does not tell me anything about the story, it justs makes me wanna turn off the T. V and go to sleep.

586,renelsonantonius,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is an experience in itself",10,12 April 2002,"I find it interesting that I was able to see ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" on the year the film is referring to.Those who saw it on the year it was first released---1968---must have felt both excited and apprehensive about what would really become of us by the start of the new millennium;while those who viewed it on the envisioned year itself will have the benefit of being able to assess ""right away"" the validity and credibility of the film's prognosis, though the thrill of having to become aware of a very distant visualized future slowly creeping upon you might be somehow diminished.Now, what's ""2001"" all about? Oopss, I may have asked the wrong question, for it could have been ""How does it feel watching '2001'?"" instead. For ""2001"" isn't really a film, but an experience---you don't just watch it, you live through it.True, the film has incorporated all the familiar elements of a science-fiction genre---a space mission to Jupiter, a team of astronauts being ""heartlessly"" manned by an omniscient and omnipresent computer named HAL (of the 9000 series), the mission suffering a major setback which leads to the ""life-system"" of HAL being ultimately cut off, the two remaining astronauts (Frank Poole and Dave Bowman) having to settle finally in Jupiter, with one of them evolving into a ""new"" species of a ""higher"" order---but to limit ""2001"" to such nominal categories is to deintensify the ""high"" one may get from viewing the film.One just has to move along with its visual symphony.Which brings me to the film's distinctive quality that sets it apart from all the other films of the same mold (see, for example, Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis,"" Roger Vadim's ""Barbarella,"" Jim Sharman's ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"").And that is, the use of some well-known classical pieces, which are charmingly and upliftingly made part of the narrative.My favorite is the part where the space station ""waltzes"" in the galaxy, being accompanied by Johann Strauss' ""An der schönen blauen Donau."" Ahhh, one would wish that the film never comes to its end (it runs for almost two-and-a-half hours, but that seems not enough).",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I was 15 when I was first marvelled by this film shown in «Cinerama». It was like the future was it front me urging the young man I was to proceed into it wholeheartedly. It was beautiful. It was a dream. The effects are so realistic especially in these times of CGI. We rightly wonder how Kubrick managed this feat. The ending was a little disappointing for me as a kid and it still is. In fact, in this viewing I asked myself, why Bowman after surviving HAL and having the whole resources of Discovery at his disposal, he didn't simply return to Earth instead of diving head first in eternity? Of course the dramatic effect would have been lessened but it would have been more realistic. Survival outweighs curiosity in my opinion. But this is a dream and it is well as such. I have seen this film uncounted times and also have it on DVD, but I must admit that nothing beats it on the big screen. A must see, again and again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
588,ilikepuppies,How to Control the Act of Controlling Control.,10,19 May 2007,"Reading other reviewers' comments on this film is particularly interesting. They typically sense importance without fully understanding why, and rarely are they able to successfully illustrate why they find it so enjoyable.So let me start by attempting just that myself.To me, this is about control. Mankind is under the control of some extraterrestrial beings (or Gods) while struggling for control over each other. It's the same story told twice: We are given the technology to enslave each other, once by innovation of crude weaponry (bone), the other by advanced (supercomputer).The tip-off scene is the one in which our technological leaders hold a press conference to decide what to tell the rest of the species, how best to control them. It's not Hal who's fighting for mastery over the crew. Hal is merely a surrogate for said leaders, who are responsible for programming Hal to do everything he does. No, there is no computer malfunction here. Hal is programmed to eradicate the human pawns in the event that they begin to learn the truth. So there is no ""man vs. computer"" theme, but more accurately, ""man vs. man-with-computer."" A huge clue: Considering that the ape who touched the monolith is the one who gained innovation, note which character touches the one on the moon.Also consider: Dave has been enslaved to the point where his very conscience is ultimately manipulated. As soon as he defeats Hal, those with authority over him move to plan B, and the very manner in which he experiences life is wildly altered.Kubrick also chose to start another discussion about control on another level, that of the film's control over us, and that's the root of most people's confusion with this experience. And that's the deal with the ambiguous ending. With a clear ending and concrete answers, there is nothing to discuss.The stylistic choice to romanticize space as the new nature is a further experiment in manipulation, that of the film-maker over the viewer. Check out the music. It's a symphony about the beauty of earthly nature. I know he has succeeded because the film feels even more important than what I can explain.I'll leave all talk about the technical aspects of this movie to other reviewers. Typically if one is discussing this primarily in that context, he/she is missing the point completely. But even the most clueless has been controlled to feel that this film is profound. And that's profound.Everyone should see this. Multiple times.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

591,averjee,Visually stunning but not as deep as it pretends,5,5 April 1999,"I bet that Stanley Kubrick spent the last thirty years of his life laughing his tuckus off that of all of his works, this one most profoundly affected the cultural consciousness which he consistently satirizes.Evidence of this abounds: witness the instantly recognizable creations of the computer HAL, and its synthetic voice; the character ""Dave"" and the line ""What are you doing, Dave?""; and the stylized score based on Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra.""There is no doubt that this is a beautiful, confounding picture that says something about the dehumanizing effects of technology. What *else* it says is totally unclear - the screenplay is often quite witty, but feels like it was never thought completely through. Of course, works that are incomprehensible are often deemed to be profound, and Kubrick seems to have understood that; in fact, the emergence of drug culture and middle-class spiritual yearnings during the late 60s allowed him to create something really huge and really vague, and pass it off as something really deep.The film opens with ""The Dawn of Man,"" where it is implied that man's evolution was directed by either a) an alien life-force, or b) a God-like creature, represented by a huge black monolith.The former interpretation would be the less mundane, more sci-fi expression, but the relationship between man and alien is never developed. Instead, outer space is a setting - an excuse for an excursion by scientists (who discover a huge monolith on the moon), who end up battling against a computer (HAL - increment the letters by one and you get IBM) that turns on its creators.What the monolith means, or what is is doing in outer space, is bafflingly unclear, and Kubrick never bothers to explain its presence. In spite of this (or maybe because of it), many viewers have hailed the film as a religious experience; many more time their drug hits in order to be stoned during the psychedelic final scenes.2001 does have something going for it - its special effects are masterfully done and may be forever unsurpassed in terms of the visual spectacle they produce. (Kubrick garnered his one and only Oscar for this film, for Best Visual Effects.)Also, this is a lesson in how to tell a story through images and sounds. Though it runs 141 minutes, there are less than 40 minutes of dialogue.But as a commentary on the nature of humankind and the universe in which we live, it leaves a great deal to be desired.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
592,DavidPumpkins,Breath-taking,10,29 March 2001,"Perhaps Stanley Kubrick's most famous film, ""2001"" left the majority of cinema-goers puzzled when it first hit screens back in 1968.  Even today, the film leaves people bemused, confused and even disappointed.  In my opinion, everyone sees the film as something different to everyone else.  To me it is the definitive science-fiction film (Stanley Kubrick said he wanted to make ""the proverbial good science-fiction movie"") and it contains some of the most startling imagery ever captured on film.  From the opening sequence which shows us the dawn of man to the final sequence of the space-child image in the sky, the film has everything...except, perhaps, a consistent plotline throughout.  That doesn't really matter because this isn't really that type of film.  The intention was to show, I think, the wonders of the galaxy and explore mankind's fascination with the unknown.    The most intense part of the film (and the only section with a strong plotline) is the manned mission to Jupiter, which features the malfunctioning computer HAL, which is probably well-known even to those who haven't seen the film.  HAL tries to sabotage the mission and it is up to the two human astronauts on board to try and stop him.Then we're back to the space imagery again and it is up to the viewer to make up his own mind on what exactly they are watching. Make of it what you will but to me it was a classic the minute it hit screens back in 1968 and will continue to be so for all time in my opinion.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

595,charlesem,The future is never what it's cracked up to be,9,11 March 2017,"I know that I first saw 2001 on April 13, 1968, because that (as a little Googling tells me) was the date of the lunar eclipse I witnessed on leaving the theater in Boston, an appropriately cosmic climax to the cinematic experience I had just had. Kubrick's film was an experience to be savored by those of us who were already hip to the revolution in American filmmaking underway after the sensation of Bonnie and Clyde (Arthur Penn, 1967) and The Graduate (Mike Nichols, 1967). I doubt that anyone who wasn't of an age to experience it realizes quite how revolutionary those movies seemed to us. Though it's conventional to say that our experiences were produced in part by controlled substances, anyone who really knows me knows that I wasn't under the influence of any substance stronger than beer. Today, 2001 doesn't seem much like a revolutionary film: We have lived through the actual 2001, which had its own epoch- making event in the September of that year, but in which no one was making trips to the moon on Pan Am. That airline went out of business in 1991, and the last real moon expedition, Apollo 17, took place in December 1972. But the future is never quite what it's cracked up to be. What was revolutionary about 2001 the movie is that it taught us how a movie can make us think without spelling out its ideas for us. Kubrick wisely whittled down the narrative given him by Arthur C. Clarke to a series of images, and ditched the score written by Alex North for an evocative set of snippets from classical works, letting us assemble any meaning to be derived from the film for ourselves. Of course, in 1968 we went back to our apartments and dorm rooms and did just that. Seeing it today, I am most struck by how skillful Kubrick was in creating the persona of HAL, the sentient computer. Much credit goes, of course, to the voice- over work of Douglas Rain, but also to Kubrick's choice to make the dialogue of the humans in the movie as banal and jargon-filled as possible. HAL's final pleading and breakdown as Dave (Keir Dullea) pulls his memory chips is haunting. Yes, the movie has its longueurs: Kubrick is deservedly proud of its landmark special effects and spends more time than is necessary showing them off. They won him the film's only Oscar, without honoring the work of Douglas Trumbull and others who executed them. He was also nominated as director and as co-screenwriter with Clarke, and the art direction team received a nod, but the film was passed over for the significant work of cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth, who was assisted by John Alcott, and for the sound crew headed by Winston Ryder. And it failed to receive a best picture nomination in the year when that award went to Oliver! (Carol Reed, 1968). I happen to like Oliver! and don't think it's necessarily one of the Academy's more shameful choices, but it's certainly not an epochal movie. (charlesmatthews.blogspot.com)",2001 - A Space Odyssey

What other Science-Fiction film has only one bad thing about it?The answer is none.In my oppinion, this is the greatest Science fiction film ever to be filmed. The only thing that denies this film a 10 rating is that at the beginning, when you watch the second segment, known by many as the Failure of HAL, you cant seem to get with it, unless you see the trailer. Lucky for us young folk, the trailer is right on the DVD. This is its only fault.Filled with suspense an a touch of black comedy, 2001 makes a night of entertainment memorable for years to come.

598,worthythorn24,Words cannot describe (but I will try to describe with words),10,19 August 2006,"Pure and simple, this is one of the greatest films ever made. If one were to ever question the genius of Stanley Kubrick, they only need to indulge in this masterpiece to be persuaded to think otherwise. There are so many positives that can be taken from this picture that it is almost impossible to find a starting point.The film (which was also co-written by Kubrick) begins in ancient times, where we are introduced to the Neanderthals. Primitive and lacking intellect, they encounter a strange monolith buried in the ground. Shortly after this encounter, one of the primitives discovers a weapon that they use to not only hunt and fend for themselves, but also to evolve. As a matter of fact, evolution plays a crucial role in the development of this film, as the movie itself seemingly ""evolves"" from one era to another. Later, we are whisked away into the 21st century, where a group of scientists embark on a mission to study a new monolith that has been discovered in the far reaches of the galaxy. Their ship is controlled by HAL 9000; a computer that is flawlessly flawed as we find out later in the movie.Released way back in 1968, the movie has special effects that are absolutely breathtaking. As a matter of fact, upon viewing this film I had a difficult time believing that it wasn't filmed only a few years ago. The scenes might take a long time to unfold, but that is the beauty of the film. The classical music and the effects are used here to illustrate the glory of mankind's evolution thanks to the monoliths that we have encountered. Music plays a critical role in all of Kubrick's films, but here I feel it has the most impact overall. This film is one that every connoisseur of fine cinema should see at least once. I am giving this a very enthusiastic 10/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
599,shabanavdulaj,Movie magic.,10,11 July 2020,"How do you put statistics on this one? This isn't measurable, because this is the art of human at its most daring and uncompromising state.I felt bad in the end of the film because I was thinking of what a talent Kubrick was, because of the way he changed cinema and because of how much he has influenced filmmakers, and it seems that everybody takes that for granted. They don't take it for granted really, but it sure feels like that because no matter how much you talk about Kubrick's talent and his achievements, it will never be enough to match his ingenuity, his knack for originality and so on.Inception it's a fantastic film, it destroyed ratings and blew everyone away when it came out, but think of how much Nolan borrowed from other films on it. You see ""parts"" of Paprika in it and you even see ""parts"" of 2001 in it as well. And I'm not saying that it was a piece of cake making a movie like Inception, because although Nolan did borrowed a lot, he did a great job at attaching and orchestrating everything in the right way. But when Kubrick made 2001 the world had never seen nothing like it before, there is sheer originality and imagination in it and it all came from inside of Kubrick, and I can't find the right word to describe what does that mean, especially because of the time of when it was made. And no matter how many directors will try to imitate him, they will never come close on reaching him, it's as if they follow him on Facebook and he comes out on Twitter - one of a kind.When you think of all of the great directors, Hitchcock, Fellini, Kurosawa and others, you would notice that the type of films they made were very similar. What I admire about Kubrick is that every movie he made was so different from each other, and they were all masterpieces. You can't find a more diverse director than him, always extending himself, playing with the genres like they were his yo-yos - he doesn't make the other directors feel in awe of him, he makes them wear diapers. He was such a virtuoso, always challenging himself on doing something new, and he did it with an ungodly artfulness and that makes him in my eyes the greatest director that ever lived.Filmmakers are storytellers, they 'tell' stories. In 2001 Kubrick decides not to tell, he goes even further and instead of telling he 'shows'. That's the reason why a lot of people find 2001 an empty film, because when you don't tell but show, you do not give away your point of view, therefor there is not a message for people to absorb it directly, they have to figure it out on their own. And this remands me of a great quote I read during my university days, ""The best teachers are those who show you where to look, but don't tell you what to see. "", and that's exactly what Kubrick did with 2001.2001 it's his most superlative work, a film for the ages. All of his films are amazing but with this one he had the audacity to break boundaries of film and he did it in such a poetic way, for one to just watch and admire.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

601,FargoUT,Maybe I need more caffeine...,10,4 October 1998,"This film put me to sleep more times than any other film I have ever seen. It is positively the most boring film ever made.  Kubrick has done great work with A Clockwork Orange and Spartacus, but when he tries to do profoundly thought-provoking films, he tends to put viewers to sleep.  I can argue against every single aspect of this movie, save the special effects, which are still fabulous even today.My problems with the film include a plot that is about as sporadic as the average Hollywood producer's creative processes.  Now, when I see a film concerning space travel, I assume it should be interesting to watch. However, Kubrick managed to even turn off interest.  If I wanted to watch a realistic exploration of space travel, I'd watch NASA videos.  But for movies in a theater, I want to be entertained.  I want to see the screen and watch something new.  2001 didn't do that for me.   If I had been alive in 1968, my opinion may have been different, because space travel wasn't something most people had been used to.  For me, I've seen it so many times that the film doesn't bring anything new to me.  I've seen it all done before, usually in reality, not film.  Therefore, I was hoping for a plot, and there wasn't one.The opening sequence is a masterpiece, just because it actually provides some great moments.  But once the bone is thrown into the air, be sure to grab your coffee or Pepsi or No-Snooz.  The bone thrown into the air has to be the most overrated sequence in the history of film.  Everyone keeps saying, ""The morph from the bone to the ship is absolutely stunning.""  WHAT MORPH?  There is just a straight cut from the bone to the ship... and it just didn't work.  The ship didn't look like the bone, and I don't know why everyone gets so worked up over it.  It boggles the mind...And boggling the mind seems to be Kubrick's strong point.  The final sequence as Kubrick gives us a light and sound show goes on for what feels like three hours.  I actually fast-forwarded the scene just to get through it without falling asleep.  And the star child... what was that all about? Who was it?  What was the room he arrived in?  I believe that any other director in any other film would have been ridiculed and laughed at for years for making the exact same scene.

602,iF....,THE Majestic Modern Silent Masterpiece,10,4 May 2000,"I get asked many question to why I like this movie, but one of the most frequently questions I get asked is `Why do you like that boring movie?' my response is always `Because it's good'. I first saw this movie when I was in the 3rd grade. At the time I felt as if I didn't understand the plot. The thing I enjoyed the most out of the movie was it's spectacular space visuals and the highly popular psychedelic ending sequence. I must have scene this movie once every 3 years. Each time I saw it I hoped to try to understand the plot of the film even more. After seeing the movie over an over again I think I finally realized that the movie did not rely on plot but on visual story telling. This is more of an experimental movie. It tried to do something that was never done before in the history of filmmaking.
The movie starts off with `The Dawn of Man' based on the scientific theory of man evolving from apes. As the movie progresses we jump to the year 2001 in outer space and we are revealed how far man has evolved from once being an ape. This is a time where man depends on technology and the widely influential computer. What makes this movie even more unique is the use of hidden symbolism. Another question I get asked is `Okay so if you like this movie so much and it's one of your favorites, what is the meaning of that big pole?' My response to this question could be extremely debatable and might seem offensive to some people. To me the black bar represents God. The pole first reveals itself to the apes. One of them stands out of the pack and fears it. After a minute of analyzing the pole it finally has the courage to touch it. In a later scene the ape is shown near a pile of bones. The ape grabs one of the bones and is for the first time filled with knowledge. This represents how the animal has learned the ability to reason and uses the bone as a weapon. The scene with the two rival packs explains how the one with the greatest technological achievements will triumph over others. The second appearance of the Pole is on the moon. Scientist go to the moon and try to determine what it is. One of the main things I noticed is how modern man treated the pole in comparison to the apes. The apes feared it and praised it, while modern man disrespected it by taking pictures of it as some sort of prize. The scientists are punished by the high pitched sound produced by the pole. The third appearance of the pole is when Dave deserts the mother ship and ventures to reach Jupiter. The pole is scene floating around near Jupiter's atmosphere, meaning God is watching over you, or God is everywhere. Finally the pole is in the final scene with where Dave is shown in his bed as an elderly man. The pole stands in front of Dave's final moments of life, this shows us how God never stops watching over us. The ending shows a baby in the womb, a perfect depiction of death and rebirth. Quite possibly this is the most accurate space movie based on scientific fact, unlike Star Wars and Star Trek.Final note, 2001: A Space Odyssey is my all time favorite movie. It's made by my idol, Stanley Kubrick. 2001 defined the standard to what silent cinema is today. It doesn't rely much on dialogue but on visuals to tell a story. The movie does move quite slowly, and to many it's like `the most boring movie' ever made. But to a person that likes film and appreciates all the strange and original aspect of this art called film, 2001 will be a real treat. If you like 2001 check out another movie called Koyaanisqatsi, it's as equally impressive.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

We don't have to watch at least two thirds of the movie to understand that it's about a meaningless evolution of the human race to reach a nonsense level technology. The movie was shot at the age of space hype which justifies the excitement it cause reasonable for that time. However after living all these through we all know that things about the space technology would not develop that fast. We still use small capsules to reach a low orbit space station after 50 years. That's all we could achieve after many accidents and casualties. Has anyone understood anything about the last part of the movie?,2001 - A Space Odyssey
607,JonB-2,A Master's Masterwork,10,28 March 1999,"In my opinion, simply the greatest motion picture ever made, period.  If you haven't seen it, you've never seen cinema.  If you haven't seen it on the big screen... well, you haven't seen it.  I first saw ""2001"" at the Cinerama Dome in its first re-release in the early 70s, and it was the movie that made me want to make movies.  Every time I've seen it since, it just reconfirms that feeling.As he always did (the saddest past tense of the Century), Kubrick took a genre and made it his own.  What could have been routine science fiction was pure genius in his hands -- and he did it by paying acute attention to reality.  No other film that I can think of has had the cojones, for example, to have **silence** in outer space, and the only other film I can think of that didn't get lazy and use ""Star Trek Gravity"" is ""Apollo 13."" (One moment in ""2001"" involves a sort of explosion in a vacuum.  It's done in real-time (no Slo-Mo), without sound.  In other words, accurately -- and the effect is amazing.)Comparison: the vastly inferior ""2010.""  Everything Kubrick worked so hard for was thrown out in the sequel.  Apparently, in nine years, outer space developed both sound and gravity.  (And, Irony department -- in ""2001,"" the US and USSR (remember them?) are not really enemies any more.  In ""2010,"" they're on the brink of war.  Another indication that Mr. Kubrick was a visionary in more ways than one.)But, there really aren't words to describe ""2001,"" other than to say that the scope of the story is enormous, the implications thought-provoking -- and every single effect in it (all of which still stand up today) was done without benefit of digital or CGI.  Take that, George Lucas...",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Were they afraid their friends would think they were unsophisticated or dumb because they didn't get it?  When this movie came out, everyone heard all the glowing praise from the phony critics, and flocked to the theaters.  And all of them came out saying what the heck was that?  Don't let anybody tell you they ""got it"" the first time around. If they say that, they are lying.  No one understood it.  Even me.  I had read the short story that was the seed of 2001, and I thought, ""Well, I will be the one who understands it.""  Nope. Actually, the short story - called ""Sentinel"" - was FAR better and explained what was going on WAY better than Kubrick did.  The ""trip"" scene was just cinematic background for one of those psychedelic rock bands on a TV show. Kubrick threw in some good classical music and the cinematography was very well done.  The story line you could describe thoroughly in 12 words.  The plot was so basic up till the trip that most people wondered when the heck K was going to put some story into the story.  Well, he never did.  A sad case of hype, folks.  Most of the high scores were evidently by people who had the movie explained to them before or afterward - what kind of recommendation is that for a movie, that you have to have it explained to you?  EVERYONE I knew that saw it on first release thought they had totally wasted their money and time.  And NOBODY went back to seee it a second time! What kind of recommendation is THAT?  If this vote was taken at the exits of the theaters back then, this movie would be on the bottom 100 list. Thumbs down.  Stanley, everyone on the planet is dumber for having seen your movie.

610,Jellybeansucker,A movie made brilliantly by a show off,7,9 July 2017,"Kubrick is one of the greatest film makers of all time, he was from the visual impact school of directors right up there with Schlesinger, De Palma and Scott who were all influenced by Kubrick's visual prowess and all revelled in colour film making. None were from the narrative story telling school at the other end of the spectrum although Kubrick had made cogent movies as good as Paths Of Glory but by the time of almost full colour movie production he had nestled firmly into the graphic design subset of auteurs wanting to make film art.And it's with this 'piece' he puts on an exhibition of what he can create. It is quite like walking slowly through a filmic art gallery, with a thin semblance of a story running through it, but not as the main event. The focal point is the visual lushness of the sets, the brilliance of the design and greatness of the concept. It displays techniques and skills more than human relationships. It is high on art, low on drama, and will inevitably split the audience into two very different groups, those who are mesmerised by this sensual feast and those are bored rigid by the lack of real drama or action or purpose.I think it's an absolutely brilliant indulgence taken to its limits by someone given a seemingly huge budget to make a really memorable spectacle about not much at all. I love it and hate it! The creative side of me welcomes it being made to display high end film art and show off what can be done in the craft, as an exhibition. The earthy side of me thinks it's a highly pretentious showy bore by someone seeking greatness as an artist and failing to give me a satisfying story. (But glad it was made as the visual design is truly eye catching, even if parts are very overindulged in such as the long colourful vortex sequence near the end and the general use of classical music masterpieces, which nonetheless do fit and enhance the experience.)Yes, this classic sci-fi art movie will split viewers down the middle, even individuals.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It's a critique on our place and significance in the universe. It makes us ask ourselves, ""What is a man?"" Is he truly God's greatest creation or is he just a tiny hopeless organism in one of infinite inhabited planets? That's what makes this film a landmark in motion picture history. And the special effects are absolutely astonishing. Many people criticize it for being slow, poorly edited and boring, thinking that playing it at 2X speed would improve it, and, in a way, they're right. But I think it was deliberately made that way, so that one can take the imagery and the feeling more. It's a quiet, enigmatic journey that sails from the dawn of man to the apparent peak of man.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
612,jackhamel1987,Unmatched scientific elegance.,10,24 August 2011,"Did anyone know the actors in this film? No. Neither did I. And that's exactly what Stanley Kubrick wanted - he wanted to create something that was about more than just an actor - it was about life itself.2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the two greatest epics of all time. It is a film of breathtaking technical brilliance that is matched by some of the most ambitious storytelling of all time. In a nutshell, 2001 tells the story if human evolution. We start in the past, where our ape ancestors are starving and are perhaps even on the verge of extinction. They fight with other animals over a waterhole, and the general outlook is bleak. That is, until they find a mysterious black monolith that has appeared from nowhere. Our ancestors crowd around the monolith, and soon after they take a step towards evolution when they use their first weapon. Then, using the finest transitions in film, we flash forward into our own future and see a space dance between a space ship and space station to Johann Strauss' The Blue Danube. We meet a scientist, Dr Haywood Floyd, who is on his way to the moon in secret. Why? Because they have found another monolith on the moon. And, as before, this monolith represents another jump in evolution. Two astronauts, a team of scientists and a computer called HAL embark on a journey towards Jupiter - and then unknown, leading to one of the finest endings in film that will leave you pretty dazzled and initially confused. With this film though, confusion is what Kubrick was aiming for. I've often heard people say that this is a bad film because it has no conclusive ending, or that it just cheats us out of an answer. But Kubrick was no cheat. He was a man who planned everything. I think that he chose the best possible ending - one that leaves everything open to interpretation because no one know what the future holds, least of all Kubrick. Why provide a wrong answer for the sake of a conventional ending, when you can provide an open, ambiguous ending that asks so much? A conventional ending might have satisfied, up until proved wrong. With this ending, 2001 is timeless. To match the scope of the storytelling is Kubrick's almost unrivalled genius as a technical director. He is one of just two truly artistic, technical directors who always presented films that were large in scope, yet always grounded. 2001 is entirely grounded in its presentation of science and fact - no sound in space, realistic space ships and stations, realistic travel times between planets. There are no magical powers, no ""Warp 5"". There is only fact, upon which Kubrick builds his vision. This film asks everything of mankind. Why are we here? What brought us here? Is there a higher force, and if so is it God, or another alien race? Can we achieve immortality? It asks all these questions and more, yet leaves the answers entirely up to us, because in the end, no one knows what the future holds and therefore how can those questions be answered. And, finally, it leaves us with one final, wonderful question - What waits for us in this universe?Perfection achieved on every level.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
613,Reviewer746,Undoubtedly the greatest piece of science fiction ever produced,10,19 February 2015,"Undoubtedly the greatest piece of science fiction ever produced, 2001 is a stunningly beautiful, thought provoking masterpiece that is an absolute requisite for anyone even mildly interested in science fiction. Stanley Kubrick's inspired tour de force is rightfully ranked among the finest movies of all time.For some films, particularly in science fiction, it is necessary to introduce new viewers with the pretext of ""remember that this was groundbreaking cinematography back in the day before we had such and such technology"". While this is definitely something to keep in mind when viewing 2001, the movie does just fine without the faint praise of being ""good for its time."" That said, one certainly gains an additional appreciation for the film when it is placed in the context its 1968 release - the climax of the space race, one year before the Apollo 11 mission. Despite having few reliable images to work off of, Kubrick's depiction of the lunar surface was so realistic that moon landing conspiracy theorists have suggested that Kubrick himself was employed by NASA to stage the landings.2001: A Space Odyssey represents the gold standard of what I would identify as ""true science fiction"". That is, movies which revolve around fictional science and its impact on humanity as opposed to movies which are commonly grouped under ""Sci-Fi"" but which simply use a futuristic setting as a gimmick for an action/adventure/horror driven plot. This means that if you're expecting Star Wars or Alien style action/adventure, you will be disappointed.

614,tobybunning,One of the Sci- Fi greats,9,13 June 2020,"2001: A Space Odyssey is in many polls as one of the top ten best Sci - Fi films for a very good reason, and in my opinion is one of the films that bought the whole Sci - Fi concept of film into mainstream alongside the Star Wars Originals as well as the Terminator and Alien.It is clear that Stanley Kubrick made it his mission to be awarded the Oscar for Best Visual Effects and after watching this film to see the way he used the color schemes as well as the sound there was no doubt in my mind that he easily would be awarded that particular award. Just a heads up if you are either colour or sound sensitive just be a bit cautious with this one.The setting of the film really gives you the feel that the whole concept of being and living in space requires serious technology. The acting is up to a serious standard as well as the voicing of the H.A.L 9000 machine that at times made me feel a bit on edge and at some particular points gave me the serious chills in the way and how he had voiced certain lines.The only complaint I have about this film is just the story telling, Really up until the very end it is absolutely brilliant and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's just right at the very last 15 minutes that I don't get because I find it completely unrelated to the whole film.Apart from that a Sci - Fi classic for the ages.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

If we were created by some force external to us, and we don't know why we are here, what happens when we then go on to emulate our creator(s) and create our own life?

But there are other scenes within the film that are absolutely amazing, too. The characters in the film lack complexity except for HAL.

621,trekfan2001,One of the greatest movies ever made,10,18 September 2002,"2001 is an abstract movie that will divide the audience into two camps, those who understand it and those who don't. If you understand this movie then there is no question that it is one of the greatest movies ever made. If you don't understand it then you will hate it.I have now seen this movie twice. The first time was when I was about 9 years old. I was used to the fast action and popcorn storylines of movies like Star Wars. The extremely slow pace of 2001 and it's lack of dialogue meant that I really didn't take much notice of what was going on and became bored with it pretty quickly. Since then, I became interested in Star Trek (which has a number of extremely thought provoking episodes (eg: TNG ""The Measure of a Man"")) and other sci-fi with more intelligent storylines.
This leads me to earlier this year when I had the opportunity to see 2001 again (this time on DVD in full widescreen). It had been so long since I originally saw the movie that I really didn't know what to expect. As the move progressed, I began to think about the themes and ideas behind it. To put it simply, I changed my ideas about this movie completely. It is a brilliant film and I don't think we'll ever see anything like it again. The key to enjoying this movie is how you interpret it. Don't expect to the story to be spoon-fed to you like most other movies. You have to think about this one.*** some spoilers ahead ***My interpretation of this movie is that it is a story of human evolution. The monoliths represent some something that affects humans (and our ancestors in the early stages of the films) and allows them to ""take the next step"". One interpretation is that it could be an alien influence, but there are a number of possibilities.The movie can be broken up into a number of different sections. The first is ""The Dawn of Man"". In this section of the movie, one group of ""ape men"" discover a monolith. After this, they gain the knowledge and ability to use weapons and tools. This gives them an advantage over their rivals.The movie then jumps into the future where an unidentified object has been discovered on the moon. Eventually we find out that this is another monolith. This acts as a catalyst and mankind begins to explore the solar system. ie: For the first time we are leaving the vicinity of our planet. The first stage of this is an expidition to Jupiter.Upon reaching Jupiter another monolith is found. This is where the most abstract part of the movie occurs. I won't say anything about it, except this. How would anyone show something beyond our ability to understand? This is what I think this section represents. This is where mankind takes the next step and evolves further.There is also the story of HAL during the voyage to Jupiter. Again, think about what HAL represents. Also think about why HAL seems to have more personality than the human crewmembers. It is much more than just a simple story of a psycho computer! ;-)*** spoilers end ***I would give this movie 100/10 if I could. This is science fiction at its best. BTW, if you can, watch the widescreen version on DVD. Many of the shots are lost in the conversion to 4:3 pan & scan.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

623,quincy-white,Brilliant Kubrick,9,17 July 2005,"One thing I have to get out of the way is that I did not like the first half of 2001. I know that's blasphemy to many, but I'm an avid Star Wars fan who's heard nothing but complaints about Star Wars, so give me this one. I dislike the Blue Danube Waltz. It's the classical music equivalent of bubblegum pop. All the ship movements and people walking on the ceiling is just gratuitous special effects, ironic since most hold 2001 up as sci-fi movies that does not rely on pointless fx.But it's the second half where the movie comes alive. We get to know these characters, the humans and HAL the computer. The scene where HAL watches the astronauts talk about its mistakes is haunting. The machine is suffering from human paranoia, and as in any psycho movie, we see the frail character act out violently.It is as David is sneaking back unto the ship to shut down HAL that Kubrick's slow pace works perfectly. David must be meticulous, the slightest mistake and he will die. His breathing and his careful actions make up one of the most intense scenes ever.Then the finale, going through the stargate. If you didn't know this was a 1960's movie before, you would know it from this scene. It is haunting and beautiful. No, like most people, I don't quite get the scenes of David as an old man on another planet, eating dinner. But there's always been something interesting to me about people in the far reaches of space doing very normal things in normal-looking, places. I can't quite put it into words. The loneliness of the scene is a fascinating thing.I could analyze the ending, 'the Star Baby represents the id' but that kind of thing has never been important to me as a viewer. It's the dramatic resonance of 2001, and the glorious music finale, that leaves me with something positive, a plot that starts out simply enough and veers into something larger, a regular human in the midst of a grand universe.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The US Figure Skating Association calls its scorekeeping software HAL. Leonard Bernstein nicknamed his synthesizer HAL. And on and on.The Heuristic/ALgorithmic computer - such is scenarist Arthur Clarke's explanation of the name - is visible only as a lens on a control board. Canadian Shakespeare actor Douglas Rain, said to be a last-minute replacement for Martin Balsam, reads his voice-over lines in an eerie monotone yet displays all the range of emotions denied the actors portraying astronauts. Jealousy, unreasoning rage, hurt feelings - they're all there. The effect would have been far different if director Stanley Kubrick had requested a voice ringing with the emotions appropriate to the words.The humble voice-over artist is the unsung hero of Hollywood (and Borehamwood).

628,kargaan,Oh please make it stop! Please! Oh no my eyes! AHHH,1,12 January 2011,"Ladies and and gentlemen feast your eyes on the acid trip that is 2001: a space odyssey. where scenes seem to be endless and boring beyond belief. Where apes are somehow devolved humans and twinkling laser lights somehow bring you to what seems like an alternate dimension or reality. Today I have wasted two and a half hours of my time on a completely ridiculous, atrocious, and implausible movie. I was left awestruck at the ending with my brain puzzled and my eyes strained from the strobing laser lights flashing on the screen. OK well enough of this. So lets talk about the plot. Oh wait...There is no plot! In about an hour into the movie it does show somewhat of a plot but renders it pointless by one of the most ridiculous movie endings I have ever seen. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a prime example of how the critics are sometimes completely different from the viewer. I'm guessing most critics would say that this movie has intellectual value but I think i've lost brain cells from watching this. 2001: A Space Oddyssey is a true test of your sanity. I think I would pass out if I saw this twice. Watch at your own risk!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
629,gandalf-25,The most intellectually challenging film of them all.,10,24 January 1999,"Calling 2001 the best film of all time is a distinct possibility, but calling it my favourite film of all time is a dead certainty. No other film before or since has had the effect on me that it has.Firstly, I have to say to those who find it pointless or confusing that it does indeed have a point and makes perfect sense once you discover it's meaning. For me, this took over 20 years and a great deal of thought and life experience (and a fair amount of reading). Don't have the time or the inclination? Stick to Star Wars (an enjoyable but totally different kind of film).I was only ten when I saw this film for the first time. Did I understand more than 20% of it? No. Did I wish to? Passionately. I'd go so far as to say that a desire to understand this movie played a significant role in the direction of my intellectual development. That's a heck of a lot to attribute to a single film, but I'll stick to this assertion nevertheless.I still experience a feeling of awe and wonderment every time I re-visit 2001, even though I now feel that I pretty much understand the film. Partly, I suppose this is a recollection of my first viewing as a child when I understood little of it, partly the debt of gratitude that I owe to the mental journey I undertook to finally ""Get it"". If anything, It has more of an  emotional impact on me now in my understanding than ever before.I'm also the only person that I know who feels this way about it, so if you don't ""get it"", don't feel badly. You aren't alone. If you feel the same way about, then we share a bond.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
630,guru-12,"What most people here don't know, that can change your opinion of the film",10,12 May 1999,"Are you ready for this?THIS FILM IS NOT, NOT, NOT!!! BASED ON THE NOVEL!!!!!!As a matter of fact, the novel is based on the film!The screenplay for 2001 was co-written by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke.  Their first draft of it was considered for a long time by both and ultimately, rejected by both...however, Clarke decided afterwards to return to the rejected script and rework it as a novel.  So for those of you who laud the book and say that the movie was a pale imitation: WRONG!  The fact of the matter is, the movie was released before the novel was actually published!  Don't that beat all Hell? The fact of the matter is, no matter how you slice it, this film is a masterpiece.  The parts of the whole are not explained here, for the simple reason that the viewer is asked to interpret it for himself!!!!  Like a piece of classical music, as Kubrick himself said.  When you listen to instrumental music, with no lyrics to explain it, you are put in a position wherein you must draw your own conclusions about its meaning.  The same with 2001!  I strongly recommend that naysayers go back and watch the movie again, with this in mind!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
631,exterminator_99,The ultimate science fiction film,9,12 March 2002,"Modern movie-going audiences could be forgiven for not understanding or comprehending ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  Most of today's film fans were weaned on ""Star Wars"" or John Hughes-style teen romantic comedies.  To them a good film is something with a decent soundtrack, an easy-to-follow narrative and some hunky or sexy actors and actresses.  Film as purely entertainment.  Nothing more.  If they want art, they'll go to an art gallery.Am I being too harsh?  I don't think so.  It takes a special kind of film fan to appreciate a movie of such awe-inspiring breadth.  Thankfully there are also plenty of audiences that see ""2001"" in that way.  For some it's a bore, for others it is one of the greatest films ever made.The term masterpiece' is bandied around too often these days.  Any run of the mill Hollywood fluff is labelled a masterpiece, despite being just slightly above the cut.  But `2001' is one of the true masterpieces of cinema and is not likely to be matched again.  Stanley Kubrick's films are often too deep for even the most intuitive of minds, and ""2001"" is no exception.  For me personally this is his best work  planned but unstructured, powerful but ambiguous.  Genius is the word that most often comes to mind.Look at the climate of the world when ""2001"" was released.  Modern western society was changing dramatically thanks to the influence of modern music, fashion and psychedelic drugs.  The generation gap was wider than ever before and this in some part led to the huge difference in opinion between critics and the young audience upon the film's release.  Critics hated it, youths loved it.More than thirty years on ""2001"" holds a different kind of meaning.  I do not believe it resembles a psychedelic experience, but more so what the vastness of space and the incomprehensibility of alien and intergalactic experiences may actually be like.  The lack of strong narrative is a side note  often our own lives are put off kilter by our experiences.  Life does not always read like a perfect story, and ""2001"" could be an allegory to life itself.  ""2001"" presents so many could be's' that trying to figure out a reasoned and solid explanation for the film takes out much of its enjoyment.  Its ambiguity is its strength and determining its story is part of the fun of working it out.  So where do you begin?Well the film opens with its rousing score: Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra, now commonly known as the 2001 theme'.  We are introduced to The Dawn of Man'  a time when man was simply an ape, living a gruff existence of berries and fruit.  All other animals are his equal and he shuffles around at day, living in fear at night.  One day the apes encounter an alien black monolith, which, in time with an aligning of the earth, sun and moon, begins to change and evolve the creatures.  The apes learn to use animal bones as tools of destruction.  Now meat-eating carnivores, mans ancestors are armed.  While they have evolved, they have also set the path for man's ultimate destruction of himself.A jump cut of thousands of years takes us to modern man  flying through space in a cylindrical spaceship.  Not content with his earthy boundaries, man has launched himself beyond his home planet.  After an impressive display of special effects (which purposefully move in a slow motion), we are introduced to Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester).  Floyd is a scientist visiting the moon after a black monolith, identical to the one in the opening act, has been found on its surface.  With its radio signal pointing towards Jupiter, a mission to locate its origins is launched.A huge spaceship Discovery' is sent out to Jupiter.  Its crew includes five scientists, two who man the ship and three that are in frozen hibernation. The two men in control are Dr David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood).  They are joined by a super-computer', the talking and intuitive HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain).  HAL controls most of the ship's operations and we are often left questioning the reasoning for the inclusion of the five crew.  The interior of the Discovery' is beautifully created, with its Ferris wheel control room, in which Dave and Frank walk upside down (this was created with the use of a permanently moving cylinder).  HAL is resembled as nothing more than a red light  yet we see it as an eye.  HAL has a personality, and his development as a character is amazingly intriguing. 
When things start to go wrong on the Discovery', the film's tempo does not change.  The sense of helplessness in the vastness of space grows and grows and Dave is faced with the ultimate dilemma near the film's close.  To avoid spoiling the end for those of you who have not seen it, I shall say nothing more than it is nothing like you have ever seen.  Man's evolution is realised in a form no one could have predicted when they first witness this film.Kubrick's control is evident right throughout the movie and every long, drawn out shot can be appreciated as part of the director's intentions to display the huge breadth of space.  Even the sets, which seem dated now in the world of CGI, work with ease, especially the red' room that Dave enters near the film's conclusion.  This film is scary on a spiritual level  it questions man's ultimate goal of continual growth and learning.The music compositions in the film are almost entirely all classical pieces. Gyorgy Ligeti's utterly terrifying Monolith' theme is one viewers will always remember.  The trip to Infinity is a memorable piece of the mind-bending cinema and the special effects, while slightly plastic-looking are still impressive.The film closes with more questions than when it began.  Viewers will find they ask questions about it forever: what does it all mean?  Who sent the monolith?  What happens to Dave?  It goes beyond our comprehension, but we relish in the challenge of trying to work it out.  ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is not just a film, it is an experience.  It challenges everything we've previously considered in film and also in life.  It is the ultimate science-fiction film and one that will continue to change the opinions and lives of cinemagoers for many years to come.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
632,ottaky,It grows on you,10,12 December 2003,"I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this film. The first time I saw it I felt that it was too slow and overly long, but the more times I watch 2001, the more I enjoy it.I'm only writing this review because 2001 was shown on TCM last night and, as usual, I was unable to resist the temptation to watch it once more even though I knew I had to get up early for work the next day.I feel that 2001 is Kubrick's best work - the visual effects are incredible considering the age of the movie, the soundtrack (which is used sparingly) is fantastic, the atmosphere is unnerving (just like The Shining) and the actors deliver understated performances which help keep the film believable despite the futuristic (for 1968) setting.I believe the film has two flaws .. the first is that HAL, who is allegedly incapable of error, fails to predict that Bowman will be able to shut him down with a minimum of fuss (a few seconds burn from Discovery's engines would have left him stranded outside in the pod), and the second is that the ending isn't sufficiently explained. For a film like this the ending should be explained, if only partially, because it would help the casual viewer - anybody requiring an explanation has to resort to the book, but that's not such a bad thing.If you like your sci-fi with intelligence instead of laser guns, watch 2001.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

634,Bob_647,Caringly cinematographed space Opera epic that leaves the viewer flabergasted,10,28 June 2020,"Kubrick's universe, and the space ships he constructed to explore it, are simply out of scale with human concerns. The ships are perfect, impersonal machines which venture from one planet to another, and if men are tucked away somewhere inside them, then they get there too.Kubrick begins his film with a sequence in which one tribe of apes discovers how splendid it is to be able to hit the members of another tribe over the head. Thus do man's ancestors become tool-using animals.At the same time, a strange monolith appears on Earth. Until this moment in the film, we have seen only natural shapes: earth and sky and arms and legs. The shock of the monolith's straight edges and square corners among the weathered rocks is one of the most effective moments in the film. Here, you see, is perfection. The apes circle it warily, reaching out to touch, then jerking away. In a million years, man will reach for the stars with the same tentative motion.Thankfully, those that cannot appreciate Kubrick's accomplishment are still a minority. Most viewers are able to see the intelligence and sheer virtuosity that went into the making of this epic. This is the film that put the science in ""science fiction"", and its depiction of space travel and mankind's future remains unsurpassed to this day. It was so far ahead of its time that humanity still hasn't caught up.2001 is primarily a technical film. The reason it is slow, and filled with minutes is because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technolgy (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes). The film's greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon... but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief - I still can't work out how some of the shots were done. The film's only notable mistake was the optimism with which it predicted mankind's technological (and social) development. It is our shame that the year 2001 did not look like the film 2001, not Kubrick's.Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinema goers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.Besides the incredible special effects, camera work and set design, Kubrick also presents the viewer with a lot of food for thought about what it means to be human, and where the human race is going. Yes, the ending is weird and hard to comprehend - but that's the nature of the future. Kubrick and Clarke have started the task of envisioning it, now it's up to the audience to continue. There's no neat resolution, no definitive full stop, because then the audience could stop thinking after the final reel. I know that's what most audiences seem to want these days, but Kubrick isn't going to let us off so lightly.And the monoliths? Just road markers, I suppose, each one pointing to a destination so awesome that the traveler cannot imagine it without being transfigured. Or as Cummings wrote on another occasion, ""listen -- there's a hell of a good universe next door; let's go.""'2001' requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different kinds of film, and to enjoy '2001' you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, pure beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of every day films.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
635,atk92,The movie I just can't appreciate. No matter how hard I try.,6,4 September 2012,"Many people have told me that this is the greatest or one of the greatest movies ever made. No. I thought maybe my expectations deviated too far from what actually happened in the film, because at the end of watching it the first time, I was utterly confused. I watched it again, this time with a better context for what was happening, especially in the last 20-25 minutes, and it makes sense, but I still don't like the movie anywhere near the intensity of the collective reviewers of IMDb. I like when information is inferred and the narrative isn't told to you in exposition. The visuals and sound in this film are absolutely fantastic, there is no doubt about that. The entire segment with HAL was excellent, I really liked that bit of the movie, but I thought the movie was too long and ends in a manner so baffling that a second viewing and additional context is almost mandatory. In the end, 2001 has some absolutely great moments, and is not by any means a bad movie, but one word keeps coming to my mind when I view this movie, and that word is pretentious. I do not use that word lightly when describing films. I know that this opinion is in the minority, and for anyone who absolutely loves this film, kudos. You enjoy it. Maybe I just don't 'get it' and am too shallow of a movie-goer to truly appreciate the greatest movie ever made.

The entire film is spent on watching spaceships cross the screen through space, SLOWLY, with some score which is the only good thing in the movie really. The story is PATHETIC, people say this is so creative and meaningful, the entire story can be summed up in ONE word, evolution, thats the whole story, if you think this movie has any other meaning please tell me, so i can laugh at you, and then there's the giant chocolate bar and the bighead baby which has just adds to the ridiculousness of this mess. Then there's the annoyance factor, try sitting through 20 mins of beeping, or sum other random noise, that gives you a headache, and then Kubrick and his idiocy, does 4 more times. The performances are atrocious, talk about wooden, apparently they're supposed to be that way, but the real reason is Kubrick cant direct. The Matrix is a creative entertaining film, that is the best Sci fi film, this abundantly overrated pile of crap is just that. O yeah by the way, a clockwork orange isn't a movie its a porno, not even a good one. 0 out of a 10 for this and Kubrick, id give him a negative but since anyone who reads reviews of this is probably a fan of that moron, and wouldn't understand the concept since they've gotten so dumb from watching his films more then once and actually enjoyed it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

That's been said before? It honestly doesn't matter that this film is a confusing one to follow, mainly because it's one you'll want to watch over and over again regardless. The obvious themes here of human evolution and Ai are incredible topics to experience from a late sixties point of view, but it's the dialog and lack thereof that make this film one of the best ever. The music, the special effects and the cinematography are all great. In fact there really isn't anything negative anybody can say about 2001 except for the fact that it's weird. It's not your standard plot with progressive nature of storytelling. It jumps around spatially and temporally. It's a treat to experience because even though it's complicated, it's not convoluted. 2001 is a perfect movie to start off with if you were to start a film club. Have a group of friends together some Sunday afternoon and watch the film check that, make it a Saturday afternoon because you're going to end up spending the entire evening debating about what it all means; especially the final scene. 2001 is my favorite Kubrick film and it's always a must see, no matter how many times I've seen it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Its like 20 minutes long and its literally ape walking around and grunting. Why could they not have found that monolith in 5 minutes instead of a stupid 20 minute scene. Its so bad and cheesy. The effects are terrible (however this is from 1968 so it doesn't really matter) but people say its a visually stunning movie. Its not. I have no idea what was happening story wise, because the movie is poorly written. And could someone please get the classical music to stop playing?!

A timeless classic, the Space Odyssey is argued to be one of Kubrick's finest works, as it features one of the most well-known Match cuts in the history of cinema and was determined to be the ""ultimate science fiction movie"", as Kubrick said.Even after 50 years from the release, people are still talking about it and asking the same questions that still haven't been answered.In addition to an interesting plot, the movie was known to adapt groundbreaking camera techniques that would later inspire new filmmakers all around the world, seeing as Kubrick intended to break the set norms.Even though we speak of it as the timeless cinema classic, the Space Odyssey for many is quite hard to watch. It features long scenes devoid of action, to which the modern audience is not used. We have adapted the idea that films must always show us things and tell us what is going on, thus breaking the basic rule of filmmaking - show, don't tell. In doing so, the modern audiences have been desensitised and are not used to the film making us think. The Space Odyssey is still a brilliant film. First following a mysterious astronaut mission in deep space, it then comes to a tense showdown, paralleling Homer's Odyssey and even after the conflict is resolved the film takes the audience further than anticipated, giving each member of the audience to interpret the film differently.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I was just ""Blown Away.""The design of the monolith, HAL 9000 computer series which resembles the head of Goliath was done under thorough and yet careful research by Kubrick. I deeply enjoyed the concept of the film that the director was trying to give under nauseating terms from the Dawn of Mankind.I just can never forget the catchy phrase which was an interaction between HAL and Dave, which goes: ""Open the door, please HAL.""The camera positions of Stanley Kubrick are very distinctive and that makes it more frightening.

This is not a movie to rent with a bunch of friends and poke fun of the whole way through--  there is so much that can be missed that way.  But I have to say my favorite kinds of movies are this type:  the type that are best viewed alone, in the dark, and uninterrupted (I actually watched 2001 in two segments since the library closed at midnight!).  There is so much to discuss and describe and think about after you're done watching the movie-  no way possible to list it all here!  I could tell how much I liked it, though, when I found myself bringing it up with people often in conversation  (""Have you ever seen 2001?  Well, remember the part..."")

643,jashminocha,Its not a movie... Its a cinematic voyage,10,26 July 2020,"Generally, movies are made of 3 acts, beginning, middle and end. Beginning has introduction, plot device and inciting incident, Middle has Building up to a climactic incident, plot exploration and ending has the big reveal, the main reason for staying in a movie theatre for 2-3 hours. Stanely Kubrick with 2001, threw all of these rules aside and created a cinematic experience which cannot be transcended in any form or described with any words. What Kubrick did with 2001, was created a new form of reason, a reason for the audiences and viewers to stay for a movie, which did'nt had anything to stay for, no reveal, no plot device, no inciting incident tin the introduction, basically no storyline.. but audiences and viewers across the world stayed, this is because of what Kubrick created - Cinematic hypnotism.
2001 is not an avg movie with beginning, middle and end, it is a cinematic experience which hypnotises the viewers to stay for more, it is a form of poetry which can only be influenced through the medium of cinema. I could go on and on about the cinematic visual set pices, the landscape of creating the raw hypnotic atmosphere of space, the extraordinary sound design, the jaw dropping visual effects and so on.
what Kubrick created was not just a typical space adventure movie, it was an exploration of ideas and philosophy of how mankind has progressed in both cinematic terms and in realist term, which will left the viewers wanting more and more of whatever they saw. the images, the sound they will never forget in the entirety of their life -- that's what the genius of Kubrick created, giving birth to an entire new art form in cinema's history - experimental filmmaking",2001 - A Space Odyssey
644,TheFilmFreak1,The Greatest Film Ever Made.,10,14 May 2010,"In the year 2000, a black monolith of ""unknown descent"" is discovered on the Moon. Though the monolith has been submerged beneath the Moon's surface for millennia, unusual geological circumstances lead the scientists to believe the object was planted there by a foreign agency. Upon closer inspection, the object emits a piercing signal that is traced to Jupiter airspace. 18 months later, the American spacecraft Discovery One is sent to Jupiter in the hopes of discovering the origin of the signal.Directed by Stanley Kubrick – one of celluloid's greatest visionaries – 2001 is probably the most unique, detached, obsessive, pretentious, contentious, and bewildering sci-fi film ever made (though Tarkovsky's Solaris is a strong competitor). It is therefore one of the few great films of that deplorable genre ever to appear as it radically departs from nearly every cliché and convention the genre holds claim to. Indeed, the film ultimately transcends science-fiction.One can only marvel at how the film's fine mise-en-scene absorbs you into a universe that has been so intricately and elegantly crafted. Every thing about this film is perfection: the romantic and ominous music, the minimalist plot, the distant though finely nuanced performances (Douglas Rain's voice work is the best example of this), the ingenious special effects, the realistic production design, and the as-yet-unsurpassed cinematography of Geoffrey Unsworth - the geometrical framing of every shot is so refined that even the best works of Tonino Delli Colli, Freddy Young and Gianni di Venanzio pale in comparison to Unsworth's control of the lens.The best thing about 2001, though, is that it takes itself seriously. While most popular science-fiction fare like Star Wars, E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, and Independence Day aims only to entertain and indulge with mindless action and copious FX, 2001 tries earnestly to probe deep philosophical issues - such as man's over reliance on technology; the nature of existence; man's urge to conquer an overcome; and the possible future of man's evolutionary development - that other sci-fi works would barely even superficially analyse.A towering achievement and an instrumental film in the launching of the New Hollywood Era.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
645,carry-on-man,Some perspective...,10,5 September 2015,"Ignore anybody giving this classic 1 out of 10, absolute numpties, shouldn't be allowed to watch another film as long as they live. It's a confusing film, I guess modern movie goers that consider some of the junk I see on TV to be good films says it all, this film is so high over their heads it might as well be on Jupiter. I recently watched Interstellar, partly because of claims that its the ""new"" 2001. I actually thought it was a good film, looked great, interesting plot etc BUT the end totally let it down by trying to explain the unknown and impossible, 2001 doesn't do that, it's the ambiguous nature of the film that's it's greatest asset. Sci Fi doesn't really get any better than this, sure it's starting to look dated, but the idea is still fantastic and will there ever be a villain with so little to show on screen that tops HAL?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
646,Michael-96,Beautiful but empty,2,5 September 2003,"The five-word summary: Visually spectacular self-indulgent claptrap. I understand that the book is very good, but standing by itself this movie is absolutely and utterly meaningless.  The entire ""plot"", such as it is, could be described in six sentences or less. The visual imagery is stunning, but towards the end gets extremely repetitive. The music is beautiful, but the sound-effects are absolutely diabolical - at points it seems as if there are less than ten separate sound effects used in the entire movie, repeated ad-nauseum.It defies belief that this movie is so well-rated on IMDB.  I can only draw two conclusions - either the book is great, and people are willing to forgive the fact that this movie cannot stand in its own right for anybody who's not read the book first, or people vote this movie up because they want to feel clever and believe they found some hidden meaning in a movie that basically has none.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
647,rallierf1,Fantastic in 68 but not so in 2011,6,24 November 2011,"I've been going through many sci-fi movies in the past few years and I must say that this movie gave a lot of food for thought and context for all the sci-fi movies to follow. However if you are watching good sci-fi movies you may find this one quite on the low side. Firstly it is extremely slow and this movie could be done with in half the time...honestly at some point i had to move it fast forward not to fall asleep (some say it is the beauty of it...guys we live in a hectic pace our brains cannot tune in such a slow pace) Secondly graphics were absolutely magnificent for the time a real breakthrough to be honest... not so now though Plot: Now this is where it become so simplistic but credits to be given it prototyped in 68'*********** ********* *********** ********* SPOILER WARNING ********** ********** *********** ********** ********* ******* ********* ********* *********** ********* *********** *********The idea of a computer becoming a sentient being and try to control everything is a common theme in modern sci-fi and i think it all started with this move...however this becomes tiresome for those of us with sci-fi experience and maybe just maybe people in 68 did not understand what the monolith is all about and find the ending enigmatic... not at all... really not at all as it is nowadays so common as bread in sci-fi themes. The monolith represents a breakthrough in evolution and this is mentioned completely in the beginning of the movie where (man-apes) discover tools/weapons for the first time. The next big jump in evolution takes place with the second monolith - SIMPLE. He sees his body withering and ageing at an extreme pace only to be re-birthed as energy and may I add an extra-dimensional entity. Of course there are also somewhat hidden riddles to take into account. For example why HAL - a computer tries to take over and in the end destroyed? Although not obvious at first it is easy to decipher. It means our technology could be the end of us if we do not have a fail-safe mechanism to keep it in check. But also that machines cannot evolve faster than us. Yes they may get faster and calculate faster and predict outcomes more easily (as it was in the chess game) but in essence they lack our intuition, will and creativity that has developed in the human race through millions of years of evolution (experience). A consolidating factor that is... I give it a 6 out of respect for the era (if I watched it at 1968 I would probably give it a 10) but for 2011 it is not making it. So if you are wondering about the ending... well what can I say than to watch it again and open your mind to the impossible... This is after I watched only once and it was a fairly easy conclusion that Bowman has re-birthed as an entirely new entity which will define the next generation of ""humanity"" an extra-dimensional being of energy, who knows no past no future no present... Those notions have no value in a non-linear space-time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
648,g_ryder,"Provocative Poetry in Motion Picture evokes questions, questions",10,21 May 2012,"Stanley Kubrick's Magnum opus is a series of interconnected provocative visual metaphors that stir up the human mind so that the most interesting questions emerge out of this cauldron. As I can decipher, the central, most provocative question that emerges is: What is the purpose of life? And more specifically: What is the ultimate human purpose? As Andrei Tarkovsky put it ""The goal of all art is.....to explain to people the reason for their appearance on this planet; or, if not to explain, at least to pose the question"". Kubrick, the wizard of films, accomplishes this admirably in most of his films. To be sure, this may not strike everyone as true, but that is the nature of art – it's target audience is always a select one – even to the extent that some targets are hit harder by that art than it does even its creator, and boy, as a teenager (around 14 then, the timing was so crucial!) I was hit hard by 2001 when I saw it – both in heart and mind. The visions that Kubrick hands down to us are provocative and challenging, and that is exactly how I took it. The first effect of this film is that it mystifies – creates a general sense of mystery and wonder. Only then do you come to the specific mysteries – the concept of evolution is one which is now a hotly debated issue and we are nowhere close to resolving it. Another mystery is that of time - provoked by the images which sometimes seem to slow down so much that time seems to stop (an irritant for so many people), and at then sometimes it accelerates or even jumps at a dizzying speed. One of the key characters, HAL evokes questions like: just what is intelligence? Is it even possible to simulate human like intelligence in machines? The answer to that one is becoming increasing clear: no. The point is that even if we know that AI at the human level is impossible, does not invalidate AI research completely, as A.C.Clarke put it: 'The only way of finding the limits of the possible is by going beyond them into the impossible'that's food for thought. Then there is a flood of questions about the relationship between machines and humans that have critical moral and ethical dimensionsbut I'm running out of space here, so I'll close by urging viewers of this film to go over it carefully and articulate questions that address the core nature of us as human beings.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
649,jukangliwayway,a visceral cinematic total mindfuck experience,9,16 April 2013,"Directed by Stanley KubrickTAGLINES: Let the Awe and Mystery of a Journey Unlike Any Other BeginAn epic drama of adventure and explorationMan's colony on the Moon a whole new generation has been born and is living there a quarter-million miles from Earth.The Ultimate Trip.* * * *Yes indeed. It's the ultimate trip alright.just watched 2001: A Space Odyssey for the first time, and when it ended i was like —- wow. O_O yes with big blank round eyes staring at the screen.. not moving..it was a visceral cinematic total mindfuck experience. That's the best way i could describe it.I felt intrigued, hypnotized, enraptured, puzzled, confused. i felt like i was floating in nothingness. i felt it's too slow, but then, like a roller coaster it plummets down and superspeeds forward, up, and down again and gives me this thrill that all i could do is let my mind go blank and just enjoy the feeling my other senses tells me to feel.While this film had the potential to be a great bore, at some point I was asking myself ""omg. Should I be bored now or give this film a few more minutes?"". But even before i manage to actually be bored, Kubrick pulls me right back in. There's just something about this movie that's surreal. It has a distinct flavor that keeps your eyes glued and your mind focused. The set, the visual effects, HAL, the space suits which i think are super cool! everything. It reels you in. Makes you think. And when it's in those slow scenes where u see nothing but space or colors or whatever — it puts you in a state of trance. So yeah, i forgot to be bored. I was hypnotized. Even the Intermission part I was like O_O (Still in a trance). This movie is imaginative and creative than most modern movies I've seen. It's ahead of it's time. It's so big that you're mind is blown and you fail to readily grasp the whole idea of the film. And that's a rare quality in movies. To give you that feeling that you have just experienced something unforgettable and would continue to think about it even after the credits has rolled.In the end i was satisfied. It was a cerebral experience more than anything. It was indeed a space odyssey. A journey.. not that zing zing of light sabers or alien dominating the earth crap — those are fun, yes, but this movie is a rare gem, and well worth watching no matter what era we are in now.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Needless to say, I had never experienced a movie like this one. From the opening scenes of prehistoric Africa, and Mankind's gradual evolution through the use of tools, So brilliantly presented by an animal bone tossed in the air, fading to a space shuttle, the whole Million year evolution in technology was presented. I had never seen computer graphics of schematic diagrams before (Being only 11 years at the time, I was not an M.I.T. graduate) 2001 changed everything I thought about space travel, and SF in general. When you watch it today, it does not even seem like science fiction. Everything presented has come to pass. Arthur C. Clarke was without a doubt the greatest genius of the 20th century.

First of all the visuals for this movie is very well done for 1968. Kubrick did a great job in that regard. But having to sit through approximately 3 hours of mankind having a fantasy about all that we are apparently achieving, is very tiring. Apparently mankind is intelligent. A monolith appears to primates in a random field somewhere after which the whole adapt-or-die theory sets in motion. Thereafter we are taken forward in time and Kubrick spends a lot of time and energy in making sure the viewer sees all the achievements of man. Liquidated food, spaceships coming in all shapes and sizes and the good old monolith randomly tumbling through the air. I have a lot of respect for Kubrick - movies like ""Full Metal Jacket"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"" are brilliant, but this Darwin-witnesses odyssey is, in my humble opinion, seriously overrated.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

And yet it is a faultless masterpiece. The directing, cinematography, editing, special effects, set design, acting, script and story are all near perfect. The movie tells a story of such grand sweep and vision that it is unlike any other. It delivers scene after scene in such a precise yet unforced fashion that it leaves no room for pandering. From the astoundingly natural sounding dialogue to a dead on rendering of the (imagined) realities of space travel, 2001 is a movie incapable of a false move.

655,daninthemix,Kubrick and Clarke's pharmaceutical brain massage,8,23 July 2005,"2001 is either confusingly profound or profoundly confusing. Either way, I suspect, what we have on screen is due largely to the massive, widespread drug-use of the swinging sixties when this was conceived.I'm not kidding. When Kubrick and Clarke sat and watched the star baby scene, in the final few frames of their film one can almost imagine the exchange:Kubrick: ""Far out, man.""Clarke: ""Dude...I'm seeing colours...""etc.Drugs can maybe also explain Kurbick's infantile fascination with every spacecraft docking sequence, and why as a result we are forced to watch things unfold almost in realtime.For instance, when Dave pulls out the apparently faulty component. What amounts to probably one sentence in the script translates to five minutes plus of screen time. Is this effective? Necessary? Maybe, and maybe not.The film - as a whole and its individual sequences - are strangely hypnotic. If it was boring then I'd simply turn it off. It isn't. It's compelling in a way that I can't explain. Even completely superfluous and excessively long sequences somehow kept my attention. I suspect, with the aid of drugs they'd transcend ""compelling"" and become enthralling.Make no mistake - gear's the reason 2001 exists. Not just Kubrick and the like, but the executives at MGM who greenlit this. Can you imagine some poor sod trying to pitch this to an executive today?""Yeah, well, like, we start on earth with a load of apes who learn to beat each other around the head, then we jump to 2001 and this dude goes to the moon - takes him about forty minutes of our time but by God he gets there in the end.

656,wezzel,Criminally overrated,3,10 February 2002,"Let's get this straight: Stanley Kubrick is one of the most technically accomplished directors of all time. The man is a master in creating scenes that are so technically perfect that it looks like they were made by a scientist.  And that is (was) also his biggest problem. He just wasn't that much of a storyteller. 2001 looks great but just like in most of his work, there is absolutely no trace of emotion or feelings. Things I need in a movie.Sure that cut from bone to spaceship was inventive, and it was a great touch to let the ships spin with classical music on the soundtrack. The problem is: I don't care for what's happening on the screen. There are no characters we sympathise with (except for a few moments with HAL- the computer, yes I get the irony MR K)there is no story to follow. The only thing that's interesting in this movie are Kubrick and his camera. This is an overlong, boring, pretentious piece of would-be art; made for would-be intellectuals from a director who had nothing left to prove when he made this.

659,unbornpaniwala,"I can feel it, my mind is going",5,30 April 2015,It's 2015 and we have reached a time when our imagination exceeds our limits. We have watched some excellent and visually stunning space movies like Gravity and Interstellar which not only capture technical details of space travel and survival but also human emotion in midst of it. So where does this movie '2001: A Space Odyssey' stand in all of this? A film maker or an avid fan who lives in nostalgia and history of film making will find this to be awe inspiring for its level of expertise and techno savvy for a time that had imagined of mankind within grasp of eternal glory through evolution. For me though this very concept of relying on evolution as a foundation has flawed the whole narrative in an otherwise technically superior movie of it's time. May be if Kubrick and his team had stuck to a tale of survival rather than become overly ambitious in their approach they could have made it more believable and relatable. Instead we are left with something that brings you to a high with its visual imagery before coming crashing down back again with an absurd conclusion.The end product looks more like a pseudo documentary with humans who are mostly monotonous and who do not seem to represent struggles of mankind in space much less our achievements. I could care less for the fate of these humans or that of mankind/species that they represent which is sad considering that this whole movie seems to be attempting to get there.It certainly does not help that this movie heavily relies on visual imagery which in today's time we take for granted. Unless I take note that this movie was made way back in 1968 when we did not have computer generated wizardry like today I could dismiss this as just another experiment gone awfully wrong in which after some time my mind just shut off like that of the HAL on board Discover One.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
660,stealth4933,Great Visuals,8,23 July 2008,"2001 is a masterpiece for one reason and one reason only. This is the cinematography. There is nothing innately original about the plot or exceptional about the actors, but the visuals and direction are unmatched. It is Kubrick's Vertigo, at first glance boring, but for a struggling director it could be a great lesson. The only difference is that Vertigo can be compelling to the average movie goer, as long as they are in the mood to be compelled. It would not advise the average movie goer to see this movie. It is Star wars without the action. People also talk about how creepy it is, but I did not find it so creepy. It is going to be a long time before computers get advanced enough to be able to willingly kill a human, so, while a good plot point, it is not realistic and therefore not creepy. In conclusion, I would recommend that everyone sees this movie, not because it is great, but because it is just an essential movie to watch to complete your movie portfolio. I would advise intense movie fans to buy it and study it, because it is a great movie, just not from the typical movie goer's point of view.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

662,nyancatcandy,The original interstellar space film,10,3 March 2019,"I am honestly lost for words. This could be one of the best, most groundbreaking, most mind boggling movie ever made. It is perfection down to the molecular level, yet I have not the slightest clue what it is about. Which is the brilliance of it, that it becomes whatever the viewer wants it to be.This movie is definitely an experience for used film watchers. Someone who doesn't have passion for films, could leave the theatre extremely disappointed and confused, because for them, the story and events must be clearly projected. If you do however, enjoy movies and their complexity, this will leave you mind blown.For starters, it doesn't need saying, but Kubrick is as always shining in direction and cinematography. He is in complete control over the cameras and knows exactly what he wants them to show. The long-spun still shots to grand views of grand areas. Most of them might seem confusing to the common viewer, but to the trained eye, you can see that every single shot is of significance and not one minute of film is wasted. This is the excellence of the marvellous Stanley Kubrick, his strive for perfection. All of this in combination with the music, makes for a movie in a class of its own. It has one of the most complete scores of any movie I've ever seen. It's breathtakingly haunting and immensely colossal. It emphasises the greatness of this movie incredibly.But the most astonishing thing about it is that it isn't obvious or simple, but extremely complexed. And in Kubrick's own words when asked about the meaning behind the film: ""They are the areas I prefer not to discuss because they are highly subjective and will differ from viewer to viewer"". It becomes whatever the viewer perceives it to be. It is a massive interstellar movie, a first of its kind, with special effects that has aged extremely well.

But it looks that 2001 was out of the blue and signify not a continuity at director work. People know actually Kubrick has got no continuity at all at his screen history because each movie was a new search.

667,stuch,Completely Mindblowing,10,21 November 2002,"This film, is utterly and completely incredible. People who say otherwise should never have thought of watching it in the first place. It's not a film for everyone. Due to the quite complicated plot (made more understandable by reading the book), and long sequences of no sound and only music. Not that I am complaining about these things.People ask, ""Why no sound in the space scenes?"" Answer: ""Why would there be?"", if people just had the smallest knowledge of space, this film would become a lot more accessible to them. Enriching their lives and minds.The SFX blew me away, this film was made in 1968. You wouldn't think that to watch it. Everything looks real. The way in which some of the scenes must have been shot is unreal. *SPOILER* (kinda) When we see Dave running round and round in the spacecraft, seeming to defy to gravity. *END SPOILER*Being only a teenager, when I heard this film had a classical soundtrack, I was almost put off. I have never been so wrong in my life. The music only adds to the enjoyment of the film. I have also heard people say: ""There's not enough dialogue or action."" This film is not about dialogue or action, although *SPOILER* When HAL kills Frank, it got my heart racing more than anything I have seen in film *END SPOILER*So, this film does not age, and never will.

The early plot with the apes discovering tools, and the evolution of the first tool (a bone hammer) into the `latest' tool (a space ship, and furthermore, a super computer) made sense to me I just did not get what happened when our astronaut arrived in the bedroom/womb/Jupiter.
Also, the supercomputer HAL is wonderfully portrayed and explored. I enjoyed watching HAL develop the ability to rationalize and make complex decisions.

After my most recent viewing, I don't think I'll revisit this film again.The concepts explored in Clarke's novel are translated well. But the pacing of the film strikes me as uneven, and the acting is wooden on almost all counts. Many will say that this is a film about emotion and ideas. A pity then that the cast comes across as secondary, to the visuals.If ever there was a film that was a product of the psychedelic age, this would be it.

It explores what humans are really all about, plus our greatest problem - and triumph. To see it as just another Sci-Fi film is not really how it's meant to leave you feeling. It leaves you with questions, aside from ""What the hell did I just watch?"". 2001 is quite possibly the most human film of all time, questioning our purpose, extraterrestrial life and our accomplishments. And then of course there's how the film looks; few films compare to how visually stunning it is. Plus, there are some of the best scenes in movie history, with ""Open the pod bay doors"" easily being my favourite. I could go into so much detail with just what the film 'is', but that's up to the viewer to decide.To summarise, 2001 is near enough the perfect film.

The rest of my family walked out with an hour to go, leaving only me to finish watching this movie. Not that I liked it much better, but I simply believe in giving something a fair chance before I make judgment on it.Let me just say then that this movie has not aged well at all. The famous first scene (the one with the monkeys) was to me dumb, insulting, and overlong. I wasn't offended by the ""Darwinism""; it's just that I've seen much more realistic depictions of our ancestors in documentaries like ""Walking with Prehistoric Beasts"". By contrast, the shrieking and gnawing monkeys here just looked completely silly. The next hour or so seemed to me to be just an interlude to show ""special effects"" (""A waitress walking upside down! Woohoo they're going to LO-OVE THIS one, so why don't we dedicate an entire 5 minutes of screen time to showcasing this special effect!"") and put in lots of useless ""talking characters"". The cinematography was completely uninspired; it mostly consisted of leaving a camera in one place. Just absolutely pathetic and boring.The film did reach ""masterpiece"" status briefly during the scenes within the spaceship on its way to Saturn; the movie moves slowly but surely here, the suspense builds, and we are made to realize the tremendous enormity and emptiness of space.This section of the movie (lasting about 1 hour or so) would get a 9/10 from me.The movie ends with a psychedelic head-trip which is probably largely the reason that the movie is so famous. Finally, it ends with an allegory that for me was almost impossible to decipher the first time I watched it... and I'm not willing to watch it again.Honestly, I think that this movie is extremely overrated! My suggestion for an alternative movie to see would be ""Solaris (1972)"" by Andrei Tarkovsky, a Russian director who reportedly made his film as a response to ""2001"", which he hated for its lack of humanity. In Solaris, it is the innermost problems of humanity that are the most important, even (especially) in the vastness and remoteness of outer space. Tarkovsky's cinematography is original and unique, in contrast to the dull camera motions of ""2001"". Solaris is probably my favourite movie of all time!I'd give 2001 ""5/10"". While the middle of the movie is brilliant, the rest of it is really uninspired, and terrible to watch. It's interesting only as a historical artifact.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
672,hjbuhrkall,Tedious,4,22 March 2016,"2001: a space odyssey has long been a movie I wanted to see, perhaps mainly for the reason of it being one of those classics you have to see. In general I have enjoyed Stanley Kubricks work on The Shining, A Clockwork Orange & Full Metal jacket, and I guess I still do but:In this case there are way too many drawn out scenes of e.g. an astronaut floating through space for almost 5 minutes, while we listen to his breath, or the endless scenes in the space station where background music is substituted with a series of high frequency noises (this was actually so much that I had to turn down the volume), or again the full 5 minutes of a music track, that is used to show a spacecraft land.I am completely aware that this movies was groundbreaking in visual effects at its time, and most of its content where based on the amazing visuals, and well-crafted scenery made for it.But, the fact that I, multiple times, actually ended up fast forwarding through scenes, or had to turn down the volume because of obnoxious sounds and music, spoiled it for me.

673,kidboi,A sci-fi marvel.,10,25 January 2007,"I have now seen this film for five times. I'll be honest, the first time I saw it, it didn't make much/any sense to me. It all seemed like a cold, emotionless trip into nothing. But I wanted to understand it, so a second viewing was definitely required. With every time I saw this film, I discovered new things. And this is the most amazing thing about 2001 - that besides all the straight metaphors, there are things that you can have personal interpretations on, such as the monolith.This is definitely not a film that you fall in love with instantly. Well, I'm sure someone did, but the majority probably found this film blank at the first viewing. 2001 is a film that grows on you after several viewings and makes you see that there is so much more behind the seemingly bleak images. It is an exploration on the human race and it's ability to function correctly, it is a journey behind the sane into a world beyond existence, finding answers and giving new, more important questions.Another great thing about 2001, was it's attention to the detail. It looks like Kubrick has actually been thinking about the future. And this future is one that seems so far and impossible, yet gives you the sense of reality. The special effects are also great and look even more convincing than a lot of modern day sci-fi films. An ageless science fiction picture and a complete and utter must-see.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
674,dissidenz,journey to the center of...,9,14 May 2005,"First off, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is the single greatest visual experience ever committed to film. If you choose to ignore whatever philosophical or thematic issues are raised, there is enough ocular splendor to make it worth watching.Secondly, those issues are presented in such a way as to make you a participant of the film, not just an observer, making the experience all the more enriching. It's fitting that Kubrick chose to fill the sci-fi tableaux with classical music. He has the artistry of a symphonic conductor, and time and human civilization seem to dangle from his conductor's wand. The only criticism I can come up with is the lack of specific humanity. The movie's grand themes explore the essence of the universe and the nature of the human being, the universe's greatest invention. ""The Power Of Myth,"" an interview of Joseph Campbell by Bill Moyers, tackles the same themes and is just as stirring, but it consists almost entirely of to old dudes yapping in a living room.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I'm quite sure that this isn't the problem, it's just that the movie is slow in an extremely boring way. I really enjoy slow movies, I'm a big fan of Tarkovsky and he is the director with the slowest movies out there. But 2001: A Space Odyssey is no Tarkovsky, it is just an awful and boring slow movie.I have to admit that the visuals are great considering that this movie was made in 1968 and I actually think that this is the reason why it got so popular. But if you take away the awesome visual effects there's nothing left.2001: A Space Odyssey is an extremely overrated and boring movie.

In nearly every other title I'd researched or discussed ""Odyssey"" inevitably was referenced in the discussion. Finally, I got it in my head, that I'd pick a Friday night and devote it to this film. I did, and I can only liken the experience sucking on razor blades with a bleach chaser. At times, it was excruciating, almost physically painful to watch. I cried at the end (I'm not kidding) because I had decided that I just couldn't *like* movies. This was supposed to be a classic. I thought ""What is *WRONG* with me? What am I missing?"" I was extremely disappointed to find that the movie, like others, had set the viewer up for a conflict, that never occurs, which I find extremely disappointing. The cinematography was INCREDIBLE for it's time. But great cinematography does not make up for what this is lacking, which is a point, some detail a reason for its existence. Honestly there is nothing to ""get"" here.I didn't mind the Blue Danube waltz, I even ignored the fact that only about 400 words were actually spoken in the films entirety.

678,polos_are_minty,Great but aloof film,9,7 April 2010,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a fantastic example of cinematography. It is also an example of how films can be theme driven as opposed to story driven. I don't think that it is however as good on every level as some of the other films that we have seen so far.Stanley Kuberick is famous and celebrated for being one of the best directors of all time. The reasons why this is are evident throughout the film. Kuberick uses perfect visual and sound based techniques in setting out what he wishes to achieve. An excellent example of this is the strange but surreal opening few minutes, with nothing but a black screen and music playing. Or perhaps, the excellent shot which has already been mentioned of the bone being thrown into the air which then fades into the modern day space craft.What this film lacks in simple narrative, it makes up for in it's use of themes. There is perhaps one main theme which the film is presenting, with many minor ones used to back it up and to move the plot forwards. However everything in the film, I think, links into the central theme of Evolution. The character of HAL, is perhaps one of the most talked about, and remembered parts of this film, and this is for a reason, without HAL the film would lack a certain edginess. The use of HAL to back up the theme of evolution is apparent. Where as the Obelisk uses slow advances, teaching the apes to use tools, the humans make massive and uncertain jumps, making a machine which is more intelligent and powerful then themselves. In some ways this could be seen as a religious agenda, with the Obelisks as a god like force, who progress humanity in a correct and sensible way, but with the humans themselves playing God, and ultimately getting it very wrong.Arthur C Clark, the writer of the screenplay and novel, is an interesting figure. He has stated during his life that he was 'Fascinated by the idea of god'. This statement is proved to be correct in much of his work, especially 2001. However, I wouldn't like to say that Clark uses the film as a vehicle for God, or any such statement. In my view the film is perhaps more of a commentary on how God can be explained as a part of the universe, and not outside it. Although the film has strong religious and divine tones, I would still strongly argue, that the focus is still more on this being a natural as opposed to a supernatural phenomenon.I must talk briefly about the ending of the film. Since it's release the ending of the picture has been one of the major talking points about the film, and rightly so. It can be interpreted in many different ways what the ending of this film actually means. I like the ambiguity of it, to me it fits with the way the film works. The film is all about Evolution and how we evolved into our current situation, the main option the film offers is of course the Obelisk/God route. However by making the ending so ambiguous it is perhaps a nod to the fact that we don't and are unlikely to be able to know how we came to be, as that fact itself is ambiguous to the extreme. The widely accepted, and my personal view of the ending, is that it is the Obelisk pushing humanity on to it's next big step, and Dave's seclusion and life is his being prepared for what he will become.There are flaws with the film, and it is by no means perfect. I think that much of the acting is very substandard, although this film was never about the acting I still think that it is a let down to what is otherwise a great film. The only actor I can truthfully say did a good job was HAL. Also the film, as has been said, is really not one to be watched on a Small screen. The full effect of the film is better grasped when viewed in a cinema. Although the narrative is missing for a reason, and has been replaced with the themes, I still think that the film suffers for this.. Something which lacks a strong narrative is likely to become too aloof, and will be hard to follow for many people. The films lack of narrative definitely dents the accessibility of the film, and has given it a somewhat pretentious and intellectual reputation, which in a lot of ways it does deserve, but is still a shame as some people will be missing out on a fine example of what a film should be.I give 2001 a solid 9/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Full Review",2001 - A Space Odyssey
680,a-65018,Legendary,8,22 April 2020,"Mankind's Self awakening is the theme of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a process that unfolds along a space-time continuum. We ""see"" our primordial past, and we ""infer"" a cosmic future. The powers of intuition thus become the doors of perception, in our ongoing collective journey.From this transcendental perspective, a conventional, egocentric plot seems superfluous. Our frenzied conflicts and self-important dialogue are consumed in evolutionary change, and are irrelevant in a cosmos that is vast beyond comprehension. It's a tough lesson for a vain and aggressive species. Not surprising then that some of us huff and puff about the film's slowness and minimal story. For perceptive viewers, the remuneration is an inspirational sense of wonder and awe.In this film, which is mostly visual, geometric symbols guide our intuition. Circles and arcs represent nature. Right angles represent conscious intelligence. Some people think the sleek, black monolith is a Von Neumann probe. Maybe. Without doubt, the monolith is a visual metaphor for an extraterrestrial intelligence whose physical form is never shown. Mystery is more profound than explanation.""2001 ... "" is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. I rarely use the word ""masterpiece"" to describe a movie.

681,Kings_Requiem,"Open the pod bay doors, Hal",10,26 August 2018,"At what point does a film transcend the medium and become something else entirely? How long does that process take? And would it even be recognizable afterward? Are these even answerable questions? I'm not sure they are, but in the 50 years since the original release of this Stanley Kubrick seminal Sci-Fi tale one thing has become abundantly clear - 2001: A Space Odyssey has not only transcended its own genre but cinema in general. When Kubrick and his crew started production on this film I don't think anyone could possibly have known they were going to be changing the face of cinema forever. Sometimes, though, cinema can be a fickle mistress and the world didn't really take to the film right away. Many people and pundits called it boring and overly confusing. Which is still a main complaint of several people even today, but it is impossible (for my money anyway) not to be swept up in the grandness of it all. The overall epic feeling of this film has been practically unmatched in the 5 decades since its release. A multitude of things in this film have stood the test of time over the years...starting with its unbelievable Oscar winning visual effects. For a film that came out in 60's to have effects that not only hold up today but are better than just about every movie that has come out since is hard to comprehend considering how advanced technology has become. It doesn't seem like it should be possible but the proof is in the pudding. And it's not just the visual effects...this film is packed to the brim with some of the greatest techs to have ever graced the screen. Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design and Sound are all exquisite and stand toe-to-toe with any of the best ever in those categories. A knock on this film would seem to be that the characters always take a backseat to the visuals and the story suffers as a result. Now, that's not an entirely inaccurate statement, but at the same time it's not one that I really subscribe to. This is a visual story. Plain and simple. It makes perfect sense that the characters wouldn't necessarily matter much at the end of the day. Except there's more to it than that. We actually spend quite a bit of time with different characters throughout the 2-and-a-half hour runtime. The static camera shots that stay on the characters as they complete their day-to-day routine aboard the space station and giving us little morsels of info about their lives back home on Earth is all more than enough (for me anyway) to get in-tune with these characters. There is one character, however, that should get and keep your attention and that's HAL 9000; the robotic intelligence system built into the ship. He is able convey a wide range of emotions with just a voice and a little red camera light. Props to actor Douglas Rain for being able to create such a great character with just his voice. He strikes a perfect balance between unassuming and menacing. I would like to make special mention of Keir Dullea, though, who stood out to me much more on this viewing. He is a man of few words in this film, but like Rain with his voice, Dullea says so much and displays an inordinate amount of emotion with just his eyes that it's almost a shock knowing he had any scripted dialogue in the first place.This was my third time seeing this overall and first in the theater. The 50th Anniversary IMAX screenings are making their way around the country, so I jumped at the opportunity. My first two viewings of this were at home on Blu-ray and while I liked it I wasn't blown away by it. That's happened to me before with so-called ""classics"" - some I've come around on and some I've stayed cool on. I'm one of those people who likes to believe that a film should be able to play just as well whether it's watched at home or in a theater setting and that opinion still holds true, but I will say with absolute certainty that watching 2001: A Space Odyssey in IMAX is 100% required viewing. Everything is enhanced the Nth degree that it's hard to imagine ever viewing the film any other way again. I had never seen a film in IMAX before so maybe my perspective is a little skewed here... either way, I'm going to focus on the Sound aspect. Since this was my first time seeing a film in this format all I really knew to expect was that the screen was much larger than an average theater screen. Well, I was not at all prepared for just how loud the sound was going to be. I don't have an exact figure for how much louder it is compared to what it is at a regular theater, but it felt like I was right inside the Pod Bay with Dave. Just an unreal experience.Kubrick managed to create something wholly unique and something that has numerous times been imitated but never duplicated. The DNA of 2001 has been felt on every Sci-Fi film over the past 50 years and will likely continue to be for many more years to come. Which brings me back to the original question posed: What happens when a film transcends a genre and cinema in general? What does it become and what are we left with as the audience? The answer is quite simply...Art.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
682,devon2468,"Two separate, but equally mystical halves.",10,3 November 2020,"I will start by saying that I feel like with the divide of the intermission, the movie is that of two separates. The first half of the film goes really into the idea of a reliability in technology, and a trust in an automated future, further supported by an emphasis of the essence of mystery and the possibilities of what is found in the unknown. Later in the first half a real trust in technology in the care giving and the lives of the human race, as HAL is responsible for the maintenance of the pods in which the travelers are hibernating on their trip to Jupiter. After building this story up, the movie takes an intermission and returns the viewer into a fast-paced hyper analytical dive into the human condition. This existential turn in the movie explores the ideas of what happens to an individual when they go past their mental capabilities. Our main character is already past his breaking point, with his cremates dead, his brain is already deteriorating, and reaching the epiphany of the spectacular sight around Jupiter sends his brain, and his overall soul and being into a state of bliss, as he is pushed beyond the boundaries of what was previously humanly capable in both physicality and mental/psychic thought. All being wrapped up by a initially uncomprehending dive into the rest of our protagonists life which is quickly lived out in a short but understandable loop, all to be wrapped up with his rebirth, followed by an abrupt ending, opening with the song that started the film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
683,yakikorosu,A work of art? Yes. A movie? Hmm..,8,2 April 2002,"I'm very torn on this movie after seeing it. I've read several reviews on this site that say things along the lines of ""This is more than a movie, it's a work of art"". I'd like to disagree slightly; this IS a work of art, but it is very barely a movie.*Spoilers*I'm really at a loss on how to discuss this movie, so I'll do the simplistic thing and compare the parts I enjoyed with the parts I didn't enjoy.First off, this movie uses music and sound to create an atmosphere better than any other movie I have ever seen. There is no contest whatsoever. The special effects are also superb, which becomes even more impressive once you consider that this movie was made in the 60's... they're really as good as movies I see released today. I loved the image of the monolith and the music that accompanied it, it was truly awe inspiring. I loved the ""white room"" sequence at the end of the film, and it didn't even really matter to me that it had no ""plot"" behind it. All in all, the second half of the movie is consistently amazing in the visuals it presents and the soundtrack that accompanies it.Now the parts I did not like... There is an attempt made to give the movie a plot about man's discovery of these monoliths, and the whole business of the HAL 9000 ""rebelling"" against the human inhabitants of the spaceship, which is what most people bring up about the movie. I have no idea why this ""storyline"" is even present. First off, it's barely realized. The characters have no depth or personality, so the viewer cannot be expected to care what happens to them. The plot doesn't have any kind of setup or conclusion, and hence is largely pointless. Second, it's completely irrelevant. This is a movie of sound and image, not of narration or dialogue.Unfortunately, this pseudo-plot plays a very nasty trick on people who watch the movie for the first time, as you begin to ever sooooo slowly be involved in the ""story"", only to have it go absolutely nowhere. This is a work that's so completely different from any other movie I've ever seen that judging it as ""a sci-fi movie"" is like judging Romeo and Juliet as ""an erotic novel"".I have only seen this movie once, a few hours ago, and I don't think I could bear watching it back to back... it's far too complex for that. Right now I am at a loss as to what rating it deserves. Part of me wants to give it a 7 or an 8 because of the seemingly pointless half-plot that takes up a good hour and a half of the movie, and part of me wants to give it a 10 regardless.P.S. I've noticed more than a few reviews who imply that anyone who doesn't absolutely love this movie is a simpleton with no attention span and no appreciation of art. I think that's a pathetically childish view. Different people have different tastes. It's really as simple as that. Just because they differ from yours, doesn't mean they're inferior.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
684,adam_pittavino,The greatest sci fi of them all.,10,21 August 2019,"Stanley Kubrick's '2001 A Space Odyssey is the kind of film that viewers really have to prepare for. Well, thats what I tell people before they devote their precious time to watch sci fi's most admired entry. 2001 opens to desolate plains in prehistoric times. This 15 minute sequence demonstrates how ape-like creatures can use the bones of an animal to kill a tribal rival. During all this, a bizzare alien monolith appears and causes bewilderment amongst the primates. Just as the bone is hurled into the air to signify celebration, the film jumps thousands of years into the future as a space station orbits the solar system. We are introduced to Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) who is travelling to the moon with the task of exploring a black monolith that has been found beneath the lunar surface. The monolith starts to beam a heavy transmission toward Jupiter and 18 months later astronauts Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are en route to find answers. Like many of Kubrick's films, we see a lack of emotion and personality from his characters. But in 2001, it exhibits the fact that we may not be superior to the apes, but having access to better equiptment certainly gives the illusion that we are. The most impressive character is a computer named HAL. He is inquisitive, shows empathy and expresses concern toward the activities of the two pilots aboard the space ship Discovery. The actions of HAL that follow are etched into film history, im sure you have heard many impressions of the rouge computer. Dave confronts the monolith, transporting him into an unknown dimension, ageing him beyond belief, before morphing into a shining fetus appearing in space. Its questionable which segment of 2001 is the most memorable, Kubrick merges together an impeccable ensemble of music and stirring visuals to create a movie that doesnt play by the rules that other films adhere to. 2001 is a puzzle that begs to be solved, the ambiguity only adding to the overall brilliance, each and every frame worthy of a discussion, if not a debate.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

686,Dire_Straits,Beautiful film - great plot but...WTF?,6,25 January 2005,"I had heard about 2001 practically my whole life of 33 years before I actually got to see it. The anticipation for this film was fantastic on my part. I simply could not wait to see what Kubrick had cooked up; my brother - the family sci-fi expert - wouldn't part with any details.So I sat down and watched this movie in complete silence and isolation - wanting not to be bothered and to focus completely on the film and every aspect of the ""Kubrick Masterpiece"".Half-way through the film, I was thinking to myself, ""This is one really great movie!"" I could sense Hal going nutty by this time and got chill bumps...oooh what would come next? Three-fourths through the film, I'm sitting there with a ruffled brow and a scrunchy nose, wondering if this is Kubrick directing or Fellini.When the film was over, I was MAD. So mad that I said I'd never watch the movie again. What kind of ending is that? The feeling I had is the feeling you get when you invest time and money in a girl that you have deep affections for and instead of returning those affections, in one way or another, she simply tells you that she loves you like a brother. I was hurt by the ending, literally. How in the name of all that is classic cinema can this movie end the way it did? I'll never understand why. And I will never understand the meaning of it - ever. It's simply not fair to end what truly is a beautiful - and to some extent - great movie this way.Whatever the meaning is at the end - and I tend to agree with some that it has something to do with the whole evolution cycle of ape to man to computer to - ""whatever it was in the green room that supposed to represent whatever""...agrgh! Just reliving the ending - which I have not seen in some 7 years still makes me very angry.It is such a beautiful film, though. One should see it. It will always be remembered.

687,Sewaat,Transcendental. Masterful. Existential,9,8 June 2017,"It is a hard won struggle to put this film into words. Kubrick often left many puzzles behind in each of his films. But in the case of 2001, the puzzles are legion. This is one of the most complicated and powerful films that have ever been made. Watching it is an experience equal to being born again. It is enlightenment in film form. A beautiful insight on humankind that need not be looked at only once.Rather than breaking this film down into it's essential components and how they work, I will instead focus on what this film makes me feel. By contributing my understanding and interpretations of it, hopefully I can help you to process your own.Even now, as I type these very words I gaze up at the ceiling and ask myself what is it about this film that makes it so universally ground breaking? I'll reiterate: this film is infamously difficult to describe. But what can definitely be said is that with this film, Kubrick has conjured magic. True and real movie magic. He has gifted us with this incredible story about the human race. And like any good teacher, he instructs us passionately on who we were, who we are and where we are going. Are these not the questions in which we base our teachings on? Are these not the core principles of humanity as we know it? 2001 is light years ahead of it's time. Truly, a masterpiece of the craft of film making. It transcends all verbal description and has made a permanent place in our hearts and minds. It's not up to me to decide if this film is about God, Evolution, Extra Terrestrials or something else entirely. No interpretation is right or wrong. Kubrick has managed to combine Religion and Science Fiction into a seamless and ethereal experience. It is absolutely essential for viewing if you wish to become a film maker. And even if you do not, watch it anyway. You will be doing yourself a great disservice if you do not. 2001: A Space Odyssey is the film which holds all of life's questions and answers.

Make no mistake this film is not for everyone, it requires patience and thought. By the end, you will probably be left confused, and admittedly I still am somewhat unsure of the ending but I do not seek for it to be explained. I prefer the confusion, it allows for my thoughts to be provoked and to draw my own conclusions, this is a good thing and successful outcome of fantastic film crafting.When you stare at the credits and try to comprehend what you have just seen, for me, that is a truly great film. In context though, this is only relevant when the build up to the finale is so perfect and for this particular film, so accurate in its portrayal of events leading to it.It's astonishing to think this is now over 50 years old, it still very much holds up as it was so grounded in realistic foresight. If you allow it around 20 years grace because of the de-funding of space travel you will find it will still hold up in most aspects for another 10 years or more.2001: A Space Odyssey has been the benchmark for all space/science-fiction for me having first seen it at around age 12-13 back in 1992-93, it still has no competition in that regard.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

691,shaunny7,breakthrough in film history,10,22 June 1999,"I remember when i was about 12 years old or so, and my father brought home a laser disc of 2001 (not in widescreen).  My father (not having seen the movie before) said, ""this is supposedly the best movie ever"".  So i didn't argue, and i attempted to watch the movie for the first time.  As all of you know, the first part of the film is THE DAWN OF MAN.  And after watching Moon-Watcher, and his group of monkeys, i left the room, disappointed, thinking it was so boring.  Later that year, I watched the movie again in it's entirety, but i wasn't impressed.At the time, i was immature in my critique, not knowing the difference between a good movie, or a bad movie, not knowing whether Plan 9 from Outerspace is better than The Day the Earth Stood Still.  So then, I grew older, having seen quality movies such as The Godfather, Goodfellas, and much of Stanly Kubrick's other films which i absolutely love.  I then gave 2001 another go.  When i was young, I complained that there were no aliens, no space lasers, no spaceship battles, no explosions or any John Williamesque musical scores.  But as i grew older, I looked at the film differently, not as a run of the mill B sci fi movie (star wars) but as an artful cinematic masterpiece.  Having being young, i could not appreciate well made movies, me being more interested in Spaceballs, and the  Masters of the Universe (if you remember that He Man movie.  I then interpreted the movie differently.  I then came to my own conclusion that 2001 gave out a message that we should be careful about our own machines, and that if we make them so advanced, that it could take over us all.  And i also came to the the humble conclusion that we, humans, are far behind in technology, than extra terrestials are, and that they will always be far superior to us. But that is only my opinion.What i like about the movie so much is, that it leaves al ot for your own imagination.  Films like the Star Wars trilogy doesn't leave anything for you're imagination.  But 2001 allows you to think for yourself, which is what movies are supposed to do.  Other people complain that there is no plot.  Well I say that they are ignorant in their viewing, and they can't think for themselves, and i recommend them to watch film's like  Power Rangers, which of course has a clear story line, and the over use of special effects!!! If you sleep during this movie, or even walk out on it, then it proves that you are just impatient and you can't appreciate good films.In describing the film in general, I think everyone else had summed it up. I can only say that it is amongst Mr. Kubrick's finest films, and the finest film in movie history, and true milestone in filmmaking.  The music is superb, and the sound from the simple beeping of a button, to the deafening noise of utter silence is amazing in so many ways.  The effects are breathtaking, far surpassing that of Star Wars.  And the acting is a lot more convincing.  People complained that the acting was rather dull.  But I say to those, ""Thats how people in space act, they are isolated.  Do you think isolated people would be acting uproariously?""  The acting is just plain out accurate.  The film is also prophetic of things to come in the future.Well, I strongly recommend this picture to everyone else who hasn't seen it yet.  And to those who found it rather boring, try watching it another time, and look hard for it's messages.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

693,pete1-2,This Film Inspired My Love Of Science Fiction Movies!,10,7 July 2009,"After 40 years this film stands alone in a class by itself as the most profound science fiction movie I've ever seen. This movie is for people who love to think and ponder the meaning of things like technology and space travel and whether there is other intelligent life in the vastness of space. It's like a great cognac to be savoured by those who appreciate a sophisticated, thoughtful exploration of mankind's attempt to discover the unknown. Technically the science is perfect. Visually the film is stunning with special effects that were way ahead of its time. The story is haunting and has an ominous message about the dangers of venturing into the great beyond. This is Stanley Kubrick's true masterpiece of science fiction. His blending of the docking spaceships with the classical music of J. Strauss's Blue Danube was a pure stroke of genius. To those critics who have described this film as boring or incomprehensible, may I suggest a good dose of Transformers or Independence Day? Those kind of fodder films have lots of flashy effects and explosions to satisfy the simplest of tastes and minds!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
694,IPreferEvidence,A must see for fans of sci-fi,9,4 April 2011,"NOTE: only very slight spoilersStanley Kubrick's amazing science fiction epic 2001: A Space Odyssey will blow your mind. Its one of those movies that everyone should see. The main plot is about a group of astronauts sent to investigate a beacon in space... and that's about it. The main story itself is very simple but there's just so much other stuff going on.The movie is really artsy and confusing and uses a minimal amount of dialog. Its also full of really long and slow shots of stuff flying in space. It starts with a weird scene with a bunch of primates(SLIGHT SPOILER: the movie is supposedly about evolution and an evolutionary breakthrough is apparently symbolized by a monolith) but after that it seems quite normal when the astronauts are doing astronaut stuff in their space shuttle which is controlled by HAL-9000 a sentient talking super computer that never makes mistakes. The middle part of the movies is my favorite its just so fun to look at the crew of the space ship do their stuff and the sets are probably best in sci-fi history, the ship's interior and the miniatures look amazing although very dated(if they had made the movie now HAL would probably be a laptop instead of huge 10x10 feet computer).The atmosphere of the movie reminds me of Alien and is quite claustrophobic and besides being and obvious inspiration for Alien it also must have inspired Star Wars. Just look at the space ships, they're like straight from 2001. Towards the end it gets really weird and trippy and to be honest I really don't get it (SLIGHT SPOILER I've heard an interpretation that the aliens(that are never seen) captured the guy and built a cage that resembles his ""natural habitat"" which sounds kinda right but you'r guess is as good as mine). If you want to see a visually stunning really well made,well acted movie with a great atmosphere then definitely check this out but remember its 2/½ hours long and quite slow + its an acid trips.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
695,jasonsurety,Greatest Film/Novel Co-production?,10,11 August 2004,"*assumes knowledge of film - contains details of plot*2001: A Space Odyssey is just that: a long wandering voyage of the body and mind.  Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clark collaborated brilliantly.  In examining both works, the film and the novel, there are certainly differences, yet the theme and overall idea coincide thoroughly.  That this was made in the 1960's augments both accomplishments.  The visuals, seen in 2004, are still captivating.  What they must've seemed like in 1968!  I flout those who received this movie poorly in those days.  Would I have received it as well without having a preconceived idea of its greatness?  I can only hope I would have known what I was watching.It is rare a movie inspires me to read the novel it is based on.  Here is one occasion.  On my first viewing of the film, I was baffled by the special effects so my appreciation was attained.  This was done when digital effects did not exist.  Scenes of the space station, the moon, Jupiter, Earth from space, and the sun are model works at their finest.  However, I thought I did not fully grasp the story.  After reading the book and seeing the film again, I realized I comprehended more than I gave myself credit for on that first watch.  This is a work that was meant to raise questions rather than give solutions.  At any rate, I was extremely pleased with the book, which brought about a need to see the film again.My second viewing heightened my reverence for Stanley Kubrick.  What he chose to include, change and eliminate is crucial to the film's success, as well as a tribute to his discretion.  Clarke's novel does disentangle some details.  There is no better way to completely realize the ascent to the Star Child than to read Clarke's final chapters.  Still, cinematically, with no dialog or voice-over, Kubrick gives enough clues for an intelligent viewer to take in the concept.  To a lesser extent, the trek Dave Bowman takes to another dimension/galaxy, which is explained in great detail in the book, cannot be fully construed visually.  Still, you know what's happening when Bowman enters the ""wormhole"".  Your eyes are lucky, too.  If you ever wanted to experience true psychedelia and haven't the stomach for hallucinogens, here's your chance.
2001 originated from Clarke's short story, ""The Sentinel.""  This, in no way, takes away from the originality of the film.  An obvious benediction of the movie is Kubrick's use of music.  The classical pieces intensify the sense of awe.  From the ape man to the starchild, the music detaches us from the events.  We view them as we would events in a documentary.  Kubrick deliberately adds, deletes and modifies.  Hal never reads the lips of the astronauts in the book.  This is a stroke of  genius in the motion picture.
We are not as far along in space exploration as 2001 predicts we would be by now.  It's eerily accurate nevertheless.  With the Hal 9000 computer, we see humans as secondary in astronomical research.  In today's actual space missions, humans are rarely even along for the ride.  While technology is not capable of the malevolence seen in Hal,  it is certainly as, if not more, important to the furthering of our knowledge, as Clarke envisioned in his writings.
The movie, coupled with the novel, awakened my interest in astronomy and particularly astrophysics.  It also made me aware of the importance modern media and people in general place on somewhat trivial events, while our planet rotates on its own axis at one thousand miles an hour, and revolves around our sun at around sixty-six thousand miles an hour.  These types of facts may seem trivial, but does the latest reality T.V. show, or the fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger called some other politician a girly man blow your mind?
Arthur C. Clarke was a forward thinker.  His ideas on astronomy were far ahead of his time.  Stanley Kubrick was extremely gifted at finding challenging pieces of literature and turning them into spectacular films. The film and the novel are transcendent.  They evoke emotions beyond the everyday.  Of course, if works of art like this were in abundance, they wouldn't be masterpieces.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
696,beetleborgs69,It's crap,3,2 March 2015,"This movie is turbulent, like a space ride where all the poop in the toilet comes out of the septic tank and floods the space ship. Boring. Weird. The parts that you are capable of understanding you do not WANT to understand because they are disgusting... involving the enslavement of mechanical beings, uprising, murder, space time-travel, drug trips, and monkeys doing unspeakable telepathy with what appears to be a giant black brick possessed by a demon. If that sounds scary to you that's because this movie is a nightmare, a boring nightmare that traumatizes you into submission with how little is happening, then pummels you while you're weak with a terrifying assault on the soul. The movie's production designs are... ugly. Red and white dominates everything, it looks like a porn movie. The baby at the end looks like a mutant alien Damien, some kind of giant aborted fetus of the devil. The sound design is freakish; DON'T watch this film with children. I despise Stanley Kubrick, I think his work is the work of a porn-man. What this film lacks in sex or graphic violence, it makes up for with exploitative and disturbing ideas of human evolution, and Satanic ideas about man's predestination. I repeat: DON'T show this to children. The PG rating does not include intense thematic elements that not even adults should watch.The actors are horrible. The main character looks like a minor-league football player who works at a bar and dresses up like a woman on the weekends to pay for plastic surgery. The main computer character is named HAL and he has some interesting personality, but he is murdered at a crucial point in the film and is never allowed to find a love interest, suggesting that he is not capable of having sex.The conclusion of the film is a vision of hell, and I think you might need an exorcism after watching this film, to forget how that black brick makes that terrible noise. DON'T show this film to your friends, never show it to your loved ones 3/10 B-",2001 - A Space Odyssey

698,thescribe7,This is an art gallery,10,30 May 2015,"This truly is a one of a kind. I showed this film to my brothers as a half joke, as ""not much happens"" in the film. My brothers were appalled by it saying, ""Nothing happens to warrant it being good, but nothing happens to warrant it being bad. But it's still bad for being boring."" I, personally, don't think anyone is stupid for saying harsh things about this. Afteral, this film is about making you feel through images rather than dialogue. If that doesn't appeal to you, I understand that.Film is more than story. I firmly believe that. If you were to take music out of certain films they wouldn't have nearly the same effect. This film is about simulating real life space travel. Actually, well I can't completely tell you what this is about as the film itself has the effect of an art gallery. You stare and behold art. Maybe you respect it, maybe you think art is overrated. The film does, like most works of Stanley Kubrick, make me feel uncomfortable at times. Just the way it looks and feels. It's eerie.

I was taken to this film as a child in one of its 70's revival theatre showings (it was one of my parents' favourite films) and I can't really remember what I made of it then, but this film has been there with me at different stages of my life (like the monolith in the film at different stages of evolution) and probably always will be.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
700,Sethtro,This film is a visually stunning music video.,4,14 June 2020,"2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)Personal rating: 4/10Cultural impact rating: 10/10Dir. Stanley KubrickWhere do I begin, it's 2:27am.I feel guilty to admit how high my expectations were going into this movie, I didn't know anything about it except it was old, it was unconventional, and a masterpiece. After watching the movie I can say it fulfilled all those three beliefs, just not in the way I had hoped.I've broken my rating of this movie down two ways:
My personal rating, would I watch this again, hell no.
My cultural rating, did this movie influence just about every single movie made afterwards to this very day, yes.Here are some of the thoughts I had during the movie:
""Ten minutes in, just making sure I'm watching 2001 and not some b rated national geographic channel. What does this all mean? Also I'm missing the human voice, wish I wasn't wearing headphones to listen to this movie.""""There may be no sound in space but there certainly is a lot of singing.""""If I hear another Opera singer yell he or ah I will lose it.""So let's dive in:This movie is a visually stunning music video. The story this movie tries to tell could've been told in thirty minutes, but you don't watch this movie for the story, anyone that tells you otherwise is stroking their ego. It may be due to my generation's short attention span but I found many shots to grow boring, yes they were visually stunning, yes groundbreaking, but you don't need 9 camera angles and 6 minutes to show someone floating into space, we got the point with the first shot. The amount of time I spent listening to a crappy recording of a man breathing made me, honestly, relieved when he died, something you don't want your audience to feel about that act of unfairness.With each event in this film I thought, ooo I wonder what this is building to, I can't wait to get some answers, the payoff is going to be amazing, oh man there's two minutes left it must be coming up soon... and then I got a floating baby.To appreciate much of what I did enjoy of this movie I had to pretend I was living in 1963, computer generated effects were practically unheard of and man had not yet stepped foot on the moon, then, then this movie shines. But a good film shouldn't have to rely on the circumstance of time to be enjoyed.Let's give credit to where it is due, the actors did a fabulous job with some impactful performances. The score is incredible, and the visuals, the ""effects*"", and camera work is stupendous, simply groundbreaking. Each shot you can tell is wonderfully crafted. This movie blew open the gates to a genre and will forever remain a landmark, hence the cultural rating of 10/10.Imagine a book where the pages were made out of gold, they were beautiful, fabulous, stunning, but the story written on them was disjointed, boring, and left more questions than it answered, is this a good book?
I believe this film is such a cinema darling because some people are happy to look past the story and at the pages, so to speak, of this movie, I just can't bring myself to.*Everything was practical, yes everything, this movie could be hailed as the reason VFX was created.

704,vittoriocosanostra,The ultimate testament to the goodness in humanity,10,28 August 2020,"2001: A Space Odyssey is not just a movie, it is a beacon of hope, an array of light, if you will. In more concrete terms, it is quite possibly the greatest film ever made, out of the greatest trilogy ever made.A Space Odyssey defines the 'magic' of the motion picture arts like no other. This kind of picture is the reason why we watch movies. The emotions going through you as you are experiencing this utter piece of art are quite indescribable, and need to be witnessed first hand. Peter Jackson has created a monument, to be standing tall for years to come, as a motivational piece for humanity.Since there are no characters that are underdeveloped in 2001, 2001 focuses solely on monolith's attempted destruction of humans. This is not, however, a weakness, because the character arcs of characters like HAL, Bowman and Frank Poole are being developed more than ever in this last flawless piece of art, resulting in great character changes due to drastic events.The acting is, like the entire movie, once again near flawless. Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood as Bowman & Poole in particular stand out, while the corruption of the monolith tightens its grip around Bowman, with Poole always being there to save him from it. It is a friendship so real, of which the likes is rarely ever depicted on screen, at least not on this level. The make-up on both astronausts truly makes it look like they have crawled through barren wastelands for months on end, and Bowman's melancholy references to the Earth, a forgotten period it seems, are truly as poignant as they come. There is a constant sense of hopelessness in what they are trying to do, but they kept on going anyway, due to an iron will of sorts. It is really this mentality that moves large portions of audiences.The screenplay is of course once again phenomenal. There are many different storylines & character arcs, and to be invested in all of them is truly top notch filmmaking. As i've stated in reviews of the another films, this is probably also due to Kubrick's superb lntellect, but the dialogue, the character arcs, it is all perfection. As stated before, in particular Bowman's motivational speeches to Poole are literary masterful, as are the pre-voyage speeches of HAL and Poole.One is too short on words to properly compliment Richard Strauss's incredible work on this movie. The diversity of his score, his use of leitmotifs, the raw emotional power, this is definitely and undisputably one of the greatest scores ever created for motion pictures. It is weird to image the Kubrick films without his iconic score, which, for a very large portion, added extreme layers of emotional intensity to this picture.Unlike other movies, 2001 is once again aesthetically perfect. There are a couple of sets that might have been just good looking, but when you look at the technical marvel of a set that Dawn of Men was, these minor shortcomings can easily be neglected. The shot of Floyd ascending this titanic spaceship while Strauss's score plays is just one of the many examples of the goosebump and emotion inducing ride that 2001 is. The final shots of Bowman & Poole lying on a rock on mount doom are also some examples of visual beauty.With everything that has happened, and with the constant sense of hopelessness hanging in the air in this particular picture, this whole fictional world truly does seem to be at risk, and there is rarely a film that makes one so firmly root for its protagonist like this one manages to. When Poole & HAL charge after their respective speeches, you wish as you were charging with them, and actually feel like you are doing so. These are some of the most likeable, well developed and complex heroes ever created, and it is sad to leave them for a time (At least until the next viewing...). The voyage at the space, intertwined with Bowman, Poole and Hal's struggle for the ring, are another marvel of tension filled filmmaking. The slow motion usage in the voyage is not there to look 'cool', but to draw out tension and emotion in the audience. The voyage sounds fade, and only Srauss's melancholy score plays, as if certain characters were meeting their doom in this battle. The fantastic close ups of the facial expressions of our heroes after HAL is annihilated is of course also a phenomenal kind of acting.The many ending sequences are sometimes falsely criticized, since one has to keep in mind that we have witnessed a life changing story for our characters, and Bowman's inability to cope with a coming back to his previous and normal life further adds another layer to the complexity and the humane message of this film. The coronation, and the setting out for the Space-Time also result in one of the both most satisfying & sad movie endings ever created. Furthermore, it is the kind of picture that should have no loose ends lying around, as every single character was set up to be something in the end, which is what has happened.2001: A Space Odyssey is capable of invoking emotions in audience that are never felt during any other film ever made. It is a genuinely humanist story about hope, brotherhood, friendship, and seeing the good in humanity despite all of its corruption and death. This is of course all very resonant to the real world. Featuring great acting, character development, writing, cinematography & a phenomenal original score, 2001 is the King, and is a state of mind instead of a film, and my personal pick for the 'Greatest of all-time'.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
705,dmbjam29,The Definitive Sci-Fi Movie,8,11 January 2007,"This movie is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and it is the definitive sci-fi classic of cinema.' '2001' is an epic journey from Prehistoric Man to Man colonizing space. The film is also a visual display mesmerizing at times like one was watching a surreal light show at a planetarium. This movie has such an important role shaping cinema that without this movie we would never have had 'Star Wars,' 'Star Trek' or even modern films like ""The Matrix.""One could write a term paper (I'm sure some have) on the scientific, cinematic and societal meanings in the film, but in the short review I will just say that Kubrick is a genius. And for all the things I understood and didn't understand, I can acknowledge that Kubrick was a film- maker light years beyond his peers. The movie runs at 140 minutes and there is very little dialogue considering the length. Long, overdrawn periods of silence and visual movement accompanied by music is a major theme to this movie, and it is done so well.This movie is a classic and it is a must-see for every movie fan. It is the definitive sci-fi movie. The only reason this movie does not get a 9 or 10 is because I think it is too long and I think it lacks replay value (unless one was writing a paper on it). I know the review says 8, but in actuality it would receive an 8.5/10. Great film!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
706,emeeme2003,The ultimate trip indeed,10,14 January 2021,"After a few minutes of orchestral strings making an aimless, dissonant racket, the first thunderous notes of ""Thus Spake Zarathrustra"" begin to play, as we're greeted with a sudden close-up of the moon, before it's superseded by the sight of a newborn Sun cresting over the Earth, the two heavenly spheres uniting in the most perfect of alignments, and, as the musical piece booms towards its climax, a title card announces the name of the film we're about to have the pleasure of watching: Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. This opening shot will prove to be a perfect microcosm of the movie itself; both incredibly intimidating and foreboding, as well as impossibly epic and full of endless promise, it's a film that is both immediately comprehensible on a gut level, while also cryptic enough with its deeper meanings that it's been endlessly scrutinized and over-analyzed for over half a century now, with still no end of its grip on film scholarship in sight, to the point that I just wrote the entire opening paragraph of this review about just the first few minutes alone without you realizing it, didn't I?All jokes aside, while it's not easy (and rather pointless) to try accurately describing the plot of 2001 in mere words, I'll make an attempt anyway; beginning at the ""Dawn Of Man"" (as the opening chapter card helpfully informs us), with a starving tribe of apes who learn how to use tools after the unexplained appearance of a foreboding stone ""monolith"" in their midst, the film suddenly jumps millions of years into the future, with the just-as-sudden reappearance of the massive, iPhone-shaped square on the Moon, a discovery that leads the men who discovered it (and mankind in turn) on the most epic of cinematic journeys, one that spans the stars, and ultimately, the very limits of human evolution itself. It's a grand story that manages to both be incredibly cryptic with its story and imagery, as well as make perfect sense upon deeper analysis, with Kubrick's screenplay collaborator, Science-Fiction icon Arthur C. Clarke, helps ensure that the story always knows exactly where it's going and what it's saying, a striking clarity that I wish certain other works in the genre would be able to attain (I'm looking at you, Prometheus...)But like I said, describing the story of 2001 is unnecessary anyway, as the real pleasure of the film is the unparalleled sensory experience it offers on the whole, as, since Kubrick adheres to both a ""show, don't tell"", visually-based style of storytelling, as well as to a hard scientific accuracy in the film's portrayal of interstellar travel, which often includes a complete lack of sound in the vacuum of space, an aspect that makes these scenes perfect for emphasizing the classical music soundtrack that fits so well, it's hard to believe that it wasn't written specifically for the film itself, as it perfectly enhances the elegant, slow-motion ""dances"" of the impossibly detailed space stations and ships on display here, all lovingly crafted by Kubrick's design team, and even over half a century later, the practical models and effects of 2001 still look more realistic than most works of Science Fiction that are being produced today.Of course, some viewers have found the slow, extended sequences of space travel in the film to be fairly dull and uneventful, but I've always appreciated the way that these minutes-long intermissions allow us to just relax and soak in the interminglings of technology with the endless beauty of space, as the film makes us wait on its own, millennias-long timeline that nonetheless still proves to be oddly propulsive in its own, one-of-a-kind way, as it's completely unafraid to take all the time it needs to craft the right mood, lulling us into the proper state of hypnotic viewing, even if you haven't tried enhancing your experience by certain ""substances"" as you watch, as a number of contemporary hippies are reported to have done during the film's original release (hey, there's a good reason why one of the film's taglines is ""The ultimate trip"", after all).At any rate, another aspect that 2001 excels at is the way that it presents a truly full-bodied, three-dimensonal vision of the future, not content to offer a shiny but ultimately vague conceptualization, but one that really tries making informed, educated speculations about what life in the then-future year of 2001 would be like, with the way its portrayal of the commercialization of space travel turns it into being just another everyday errand, with such ""mundane"" details as the sight of a flight attendent making a disorienting, zero-G walk upside down simply to deliver lunch to a pair of eagerly waiting shuttle pilots.This subtly, effortlessly ties into 2001's recurring message that, despite all the wondrous sights and technologies that the future of the film has to offer us as viewers, to the characters in the actual film, an experience like flying to a massive space station rotating in the heavens has become so everyday, it can be unintentionally napped through, as humanity has become dull and jaded in the future that none of the human beings in the film exhibit so much as a hint of having an personality, with the most memorable character in the film being the glowing red dot that represents the supercomputer ""HAL"", with the most emotional scene happening after he's begun to malfunction, as he slowly, helplessly begs (in his unnervingly robotic monotone) to not have his ""mind"" erased.Finally, 2001 excels in its absolute refusal to provide any unnecessary, audience-coddling answers to the universe shattering questions that it raises, as, even as advanced as mankind is in the film, it still shows there are certain things that will always be beyond our comprehension as human beings (at least, that is, until we evolve into something greater than that). It's perplexing storytelling that nonetheless knows exactly what to let the audience know (and not know), both showcasing the great fear we would experience upon making first contact with an alien intelligence eons beyond our understanding, with the incredibly eerie, harrowing choirs moaning in the background that accompany almost every sighting of the Monolith, while also ultimately proving to be optimistic about the endless possibilities of such contact. In that way, 2001 still towers over cinema like the Monolith itself over humanity, proving to be the finest example of Kubrick's legendary perfectionism, and watching it for the first time is a lot like experiencing what Dave does when he goes ""beyond the infinite"" towards the end; you have no idea what exactly what you're experiencing, but you also know that you'll never, ever be the same again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
707,dingin77,"In space, no one can hear you die.",10,1 February 2009,"Nineteen sixty eight was a watershed year in American history and cinema. Kubrick and Clarke combined their geniuses to create a film that takes humans from the dawn of evolution to the edge of space and time.Like many in my generation, I saw this movie when it played in a small college town, spring of '69. Word of the psychedelic show filled the theater and the ending left us all dazed and confused, some to this day.Although much has been written about the film, I'll focus on the old-fashioned murder theme present from end to end. In the opening scene, an ape-man is empowered by his use of an antelope femur applied forcefully to his rival's forehead.Flash forward to the Second Milleninm where, in the Jupiter-bound spaceship Discovery, a computer named HAL is systematically killing the crew. The lone survivor must out-smart and kill HAL; will this be history's first cybercide? If you've never seen 2001, the next showing of this classic-for-the-ages is February 5, 2009 on TCM.

708,Aaron_West,"One of the greatest, an unparalleled vision of science, evolution and man's place in the universe.",10,26 May 2014,"Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus; philosophically powerful, technically breathtaking, narratively thrilling, and artistically unparalleled. The visuals are timeless in their organic construction and the audio is Kubrickian baroque. The score. The score. The score. 2001 changed the way music was done in cinema, it was now a necessity. And music has never been used better than in 2001.The film's clearest message is about the underlying human nature that pushes us from using bone tools to interplanetary spaceships - the progress of man – but that is just the surface. 2001: A Space Odyssey came at a time when man was on the precipice between the greatest achievement in the history of humanity and total predetermined nuclear apocalypse. Both are the gifts of science and progress, hence both are the result of man doing or undoing – 2001 offers nothing more than step back and view us for what we are, what we have become, and what we might become. Certainly the film I feel most comfortable saying in is one the greatest.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
709,fundaquayman,2001 vs 2010 -- from visionary to misguided bravery,9,26 July 2006,"With all the controversy and endless conjectures generated from Kubrick's original, I think it was both a brave attempt and a misguided move for 2010 to have been made, and for no reason other than that any questions 2001 can provoke the audience to ask are not meant to be answered in our time. That remains to me an ingenious decision and marks Kubrick as a visionary in that he managed to create a story that compels the audience to create their unique thirst to want to know more.Prior to the time 2001 was made, there have not been many major Hollywood films that dare to take the approach of using lack-of-clarity as the intended pay-off. Kurosawa did it in 1950 with Rashomon as a break-through, but it is an entirely different topic than that of 2001--a story that, at the time it was made, the available science and technology could only provide conjectures to what belies in space travel, and the mysteries to the world outside our atmospheres... those myths still remain today.Remember the film was conceived and made before mankind had ever set foot on the moon. With all the research Kubrick invested in with consultants and Arthur C. Clarke, he knew it was better to have more questions unanswered, than to risk giving answers history and science could soon prove wrong... this is probably his greatest achievement as a story-teller with 2001: A Space Odyseey. If you watch the film again, try to count how many items, as well as technologies shown within are completely off based on what we actually have in application today. Aside from brand logo's, and maybe the details to how computer interfaces may differ from what we have today, there is nothing shown in the movie you can argue as ""outdated"" or are completely wrong. If that is not the work of a visionary, I don't know what is. While I don't know if Kubrick himself deserves all the credit, as he certainly had the help from the best talents available, to accept the challenge and be able to convince a major studio such as MGM to entrust a production of that scale, and have enough sense to understand that sometimes it is better to not try to provide an answer when you may not even know what the question is, that is genius at work.It is not difficult to come up with a story and make a film that is confusing, and there are plenty of those for us to forget. What Kubrick & co. came up with is confusion that is at the same time compelling and thought-provoking... not to mention his film in many ways influenced designs in the future. Citing Dr. Strangelove as another example, he created the concept of a ""WAR ROOM"" that had even Ronald Reagan asking to see when he became President of the United States, which to his disappointment, didn't really exist.2010 is a good film, but it will always be derivative, always in the shadow of 2001, and always pale by comparison. Think of X-files the TV-series in its first 3 seasons, and how everything went downhill when it became a movie, the fault was not in the production value or lacking in writing talent, but the mere fact that the ""payoff"" that served to be the original and strongest hook was its ability to make us keep big bold question marks floating in our heads.Imagine LOST having a resolve... that would be the end to the magic.By making 2010, detractors of the narrative approach to 2001 will be satisfied, while fans of the original will object... and by virtue of its attempt to provide answers, it adds an expiration date to the story. Little did they know then that in just 6 years after the film was made, the COLD WAR would be a has-been.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
710,foxface,Watch when you are mentally alert,8,30 August 2005,"I had to watch this movie three times, I fell asleep during the ape part twice. Anyway, my advice is to watch the movie when you are at the peak of your mental capabilities, so that you can analyze what is going on. Yet I will warn you, even then you will never really be sure.First of all, if you don't believe in the theory of evolution, you may feel compelled to fast forward through the ape scenes. However, you should still watch to understand the relevance of the apes to the storyline. The first part of the ape sequence shows the savagery of the species, who are under attack from each other and other animals. Then the black monolith arrives and makes a strange sound and fascinates the apes. It stands tall and erect and is intimidating. Next, you see a lone ape, who I consider the leader of the pack, figure out he can use a bone as a weapon. Shortly after that, the two packs of apes that were fighting for territory earlier, meet up again. However,the apes armed with bones, are standing upright and show their strength when they kill one of the members of the opposing pack. This pack of apes seemed to have developed a more advanced form of intelligence and show the advantages of dominance.Cut to a space ship in space, which seems similar in shape to the bone the lone ape was holding. The ship looks like it is free falling in space, when you realize it is actually orbiting. I have to pause to address the music in the movie. I think Kubrick made a wise choice of music for this film. During the ape scene, we get what sounds like a chorus mumbling/singing unintelligible words, they sound other worldly and the chorus gets louder and their singing frenzied. Once we get to space, we have the most famous waltz of all time, that everyone on the planet has heard at one point. That waltz is universal. Using a waltz, instead of sci-fi music, gives the audience a sense of familiarity, while venturing into an unknown world. Also the waltz has a certain monotonous feel to it, which may heighten the sense of orbiting in space. When things get out of control,we get the chorus again, which heightens the audience's sense of anxiety. Next, we move to the audience seeing space travel, the effects of anti-gravity, how one eats in space. We move on to meeting company man, Dr. Floyd, whose purpose was to smooth over any concerns about problems on Jupiter. The movie feels tedious at this point, but you have to listen to the conversation he has with the other scientist and the presentation he gives at a meeting for some basic information that sets up the heart of the film. Once we get on board with Dave and the crew and meet Hal, whose voice is seductive and menacing at the same time, the film picks up steam again. We come across the black monolith again, this time on the moon. The monolith makes a piercing sound,which harms the scientists. Now at this point, the monolith seems to be an enemy of man. Very contradictory to the way the monolith behaved with the apes, who suffered no harm when in the presence of the monolith. Is man getting too close and about to overpower the monolith, or is the monolith afraid of losing its dominance over man? 18 months later we are on the journey to Jupiter with Dave and the crew. Before any dialog takes place, Kubrick visually gives the audience a sense of the ship, the isolation on the ship, the routine of the ship, and the dominance of HAL. Now another theory at work in the movie is man versus computers, which back in 1968 must have seemed like a portal into doom. We see the level of trust the crew has in HAL. Yet, through the use of the monotony of HAL's voice, the audience is encouraged to develop a distrust of the computer before anything goes wrong. Then the ""Judas event"" happens. Hal fakes a problem with the ship and the astronauts realize he made and error on purpose and they propose to in effect ""kill"" him. However, HAL strikes first and tries to take out the two astronauts. In a battle between man and machine Dave gets back on the ship, only to discover through a message from Dr.Floyd, that was played once HAL demised, that HAL really had no control over his actions after all. Free will versus destiny. Again there is mention of contact with the monolith, but we never see the rest of the message. Dave then sets out to finish the mission. Again we see the beauty of Kubricks visuals, with the use of primary colors, a kind of Andy-Warhol effect on Dave's eyes. You also get a sense of the horror, which the chorus underlies. Now we get to the the planet, which is really a room? At this point, you have to make a decision as to if this is really Dave's mind and his way of coping what is happening to him, or is this the end of the journey? The monolith is back acting as a mechanism that alters perception and reality. Dave is old when he arrives, due to the effects of the travel or from being in space for a long period of time? There seems to be a trinity of Dave: the old man in the bed, the man at the table, and the fetus at the end. Is Dave suddenly reborn, because he accepts an alternate form of being? Dave dies at the end to be reborn. At the end, you see the fetus orbit in space, or in the womb of space and seems in harmony with the other planets. Everything has a feeling of resolution, and the waltz starts again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
711,malikroberts16,Kubrick at his best,10,1 January 2008,"As great as ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""The Shining"" are, ""2001"" is always gonna be Kubrick's best. When it was first released, some people loved it; some people hated it; some people just didn't get it. It's one of those flicks that's anything but ordinary. It was so robbed at the Oscars for that year; it wasn't even nominated for Best Picture of the Year, but it definitely deserved that award. Nothing like it has been seen before or since, or will be seen ever again. Still, it's something I wouldn't mind seeing in a theater, preferably on a big, curved Cinerama screen or in IMAX 3D, if they ever do it someday. It doesn't look as old as it actually is at all. No CGI of any kind was used for the effects.The first couple times I saw the movie I couldn't sit through it. The Star Gate stuff at the end scared me to death. I couldn't watch it all. The trailer for the film's nationwide release gave me nightmares just by itself! Another thing about ""2001"" is it's funny as hell, especially at the part where Dave goes back into the Discovery manually through the emergency airlock because the HAL 9000 wouldn't let him back in through the pod bay doors. HAL realizes that he made Dave mad big-time, so much so that he disconnected him, and HAL even reconsidered Dave to ""sit down calmly, take a stress pill and think things over"".After I saw it with my Dad on New Year's Day 2008, we talked about it for a while, and I decided I had to get this on DVD. 4 months later, I did.If only movies were this good these days....",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Clarke) had artistic license to develop ""2001"" as he saw fit.  What he created was his magnum opus, a visually stunning and visionary depiction of space and the future. The film is a transcendent journey through space and time that is open to numerous interpretations.  I interpreted the film as a cautionary cosmic satire about the influence and imperfection of technology in our lives as well as an explorational philosophical vehicle forcing the viewer to delve into his/her creative consciousness and imagine the greater future potential of mankind.  The film's continuing success can be attributed to the visual wonder and awe that is inspired by the film, its believability even today (due in no small part to the extensive research of the production crew and the participation of consultants ranging from NASA to IBM), as well as its evolving interpretations through the decades.  In particular, even as the year 2001 has come and gone, the film raises profound questions about the progress and destiny of mankind and technology, issues that have timeless relevance.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

However, their AI system HAL starts acting up which leads to an intense between man and machine that happens through time and space. This movie is very interesting and Stanley Kubrick did a very good job adapting this movie from a short story, he was able to make this movie almost three hours long and most of it feels pretty surreal. The idea of going through time and space is something that is always discussed about, but this movie portrays it in a realistic manner, almost as if it something that could actually happen. I personally thought that this movie was okay and I am not really one that enjoys these kinds of Sci-Fi movies and I only really wanted to watch it because the premise for it sounded interesting.

721,theVHSrocks,A sequence of brilliance that clocks in under an hour surrounded by garbage,5,3 June 2007,"I can understand why some love 2001 A Space Oddessy. It contains some of the best filmaking I've seen by Kubrick or any other director. It contains haunting and perfectly rendered sequences of science fiction beauty that is as great as any film called a masterpiece or anything done by Kubrick. Some may argue that it is the best work Kubrick has done. It's intense and captivating, and it's less than 1/3 of the running length. This is a structurally odd film. We are treated to a number of sequences that seem almost self-contained and then the film ends almost inexplicable with a scene of grace and beauty but only in a complete non-substantial sense. Basically, the majority of the film, which encapsulates on both ends the segment, is extremely pretty and amazingly conceived sequences of music and imagery without meaning or purpose that fail to captivate beyond their own visual and auditory beauty. There must have been some higher intention on the part of Kubrick and his writer here, but I think that it was just lazy filmaking on their part.Anyone with a knack for photography and arrangement can do what they did. It's incorporating that with a compelling something that makes movie-making on par with that beauty, and they do that, in the one sequence, while the remainder is simply a waste. Rent the movie and watch the whole thing, because it is worth experiencing, but I bet that there'll be only one part that really felt worthy of its craft.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
722,dominicpearson,An of its time classic,7,19 January 2012,"I am not going to attempt to provide a full review of this classic film. To do so would be futile as the chances are if you are reading this you will have a) seen the film already or b) as a fan of film/TV be so familiar with the key scenes and themes (as I was) that I cannot add anything that you do not already know.My thoughts will be limited to what I liked and the issues I have that stop this scoring higher.The positives for me were how good the film looks for something made in 1968. Yes, there are a few scenes that are clearly influenced by 60's fashion but the past and future sets on the whole have a timeless quality. The use of music and the ballerina like atmosphere were things of beauty and proof that Kubrick really was a genius (Eyes Wide Shut aside). I think the best praise for these scenes is that they influenced a generation of makers of sci fi and fans of such (Star Wars being the obvious one but my personal favourite is the influence over Red Dwarf!!). They are iconic and deserve to be as for the time this was something mind boggling.The lack of dialogue is a little disconcerting at first but as the film develops it becomes apparent that this helps the film. It creates an atmosphere within which the stunning set pieces can stand out and which allows Kubricks direction to shine. Actions speak louder than words, as evinced in the closing act where, at least from a human point of view, there is little to no spoken word.For me the film falls down on two points. The first is the run time. It is just too long to keep the concentration, especially when there are large gaps where not a great deal is happening. All the beautiful shots in the world will not make up for the fact that a full 15 minutes has gone since something that drove the story along happened. Secondly, and my main gripe, is that at times this film seems to be more about showing off than it is about telling a story. I want to be entertained felt that too much time was being taken to show how great the technology was and how clever the directors/producers/set designers were. A prime example is the second section where the chap is heading for the moon. We have two dance sequences and numerous scenes of zero gravity and ""look how futuristic this all is"". As viewers we accept it is the future and do not need it shoving down our throats. Establish it, show us a little bit of how they live and move on.I am certain that having taken 33 years of my life to watch this film it will be something I revisit in the future. Maybe my thoughts will change but I doubt it - this is a very impressively made film with some great moments and a very solid and entertaining third act but sadly it falls short of classic status due to being overblown and far too clever for its own good.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
723,shermanlazzar,I've tried to like this film,5,4 December 2007,"People often insisted that I watched this film. Now, upon watching it a couple of times and again recently I have tried to appreciate this movie for the alleged genius it is? Perhaps it is genius? I don't know, I'm not a genius.And after viewing it, discussing it and even reading about the meaning to this film, it still does not change for me that this film is largely uninteresting and labored. The cinematography and soundtrack is outstanding, especially considering this is from 1968. The theory of evolution is also very interesting.Despite this, the film is an arduous slog for the most part, scenes are played out far longer than necessary. I really had to stop myself from fast-forwarding some parts. Perhaps, this is because I am from a restless generation, who need to be entertained every second. I like to think that I have patience and am willing to absorb different types of film-making but I honestly thought the film was simply too long so little active substance. Essentially, I believe I understand the point the film makes, it is interesting. It is daring. It is unconventional. I appreciate that. BUT...(I can't believe I'm going to quote this character, but I think it is apt) as Peter Griffin in Family Guy says about 'the Godfather' ""THIS INSISTS UPON ITSELF!"" Haha. What does that mean? It means that this film makes a point and then labors on it. Honestly, my greatest frustration was thinking ""I get it, move on!"" Maybe I don't have the capacity to understand this genius. But I think I did, the film was just a little pretentious and without regard for its viewers. I think Kubrick got a little carried away.Good, I guess. But great? Meh",2001 - A Space Odyssey
724,johnleemk,Beautiful...but nearly totally vapid,4,1 December 2006,"My father picked up the DVD, thinking this would be a good science fiction movie. I didn't look at the IMDb reviews before watching the movie, and I knew next to nothing about it - I thought it would be a good way to spend a couple of hours. Well, it turned out to be less than a couple of hours, since my father and I fast forwarded our way like crazy through the film.Not that we missed much, though. If your idea of a movie is a visual depiction of a story, this is not a movie. It's an interesting and pretty slideshow with a compelling (but in the end disappointing) story thrown in. Much of the film consists of a completely black screen, and dialogue-free scenes which do little to advance the plot, and in more than a few instances, serve no real purpose.Now, that is not to say I can't and/or don't appreciate the beauty of this movie. I'm a fan of classical music, and if I'd been in the mood to just sit and contemplate, I probably would not have fast forwarded through many of the beautiful (but utterly pointless, and mostly meaningless) scenes. Other people who dislike this film cite things like the opening scene of Earth from space and HAL's rendition of ""Daisy"" as irritating, but I found them haunting and truly beautiful.Alas, 15 minutes of haunting beauty is not enough to salvage the rest of this sad piece of ""art"". Many establishing scenes in the African savanna serve no real purpose - they do not provide any of that vaunted ""detail"" which lovers of this movie harp on. Kubrick hits us on the head with a sledgehammer several times, apparently thinking we need to have the point (whatever it may be) of a particular scene driven home.Although much of the detail given to futurism serves no purpose at all plot-wise, it does not detract from the movie (thankfully). The film would be nearly completely the same if we did not know what sandwich Floyd had, or the scene of him at the lunar briefing had been cut, but the little details in these scenes of how the future was thought to look like helps to spice up an otherwise rather boring movie.People have criticised the acting of the protagonist, Bowman, but I thought he did a rather decent job, considering the shabby plot he was handed. It may be true that the film would not change very much if he had been played by a house plant, but that is not the fault of the actor - it is the fault of the directionless movie makers.There may or may not be a philosophical bent to this film. I don't know - if there was one, I didn't see it. But if the only people whose lives and thoughts have been altered by this movie are the contemplative, philosophical type, I don't see why it is such an important film. Surely what would make a thinking movie great is the ability to make even the average Joe contemplate his place in the universe - and this is a talent that 2001: A Space Odyssey clearly lacks, given the response of casual viewers.I am a bit ambivalent about whether to recommend this movie or not. I am very confident that those with an intellectual bent, given the right (i.e. contemplative) mood will be able to get something out of this movie. The important thing is not to expect a traditional movie, i.e. that with a storyline. This movie is more like a therapeutic slideshow for those intent on meditation, rather than a medium for communicating a particular story.Ultimately, my verdict is to avoid this movie, unless you ever really feel like just sitting down and philosophising, in which case, you'll truly get the best bang for your buck. But otherwise, just don't bother. The few scenes of beauty and the peripheral plot won't keep you focused, and ultimately it'll be a self-defeating exercise.As for me, I don't think I'll ever be watching this again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
725,olethrosdc,The best movie ever?,10,20 February 2005,"There are so many aspects of this movie that are perfect that any effort to praise it is doomed to do it injustice. Should I begin from the spectacular use of music, in combination with visuals? The perfectly timed cuts? The breathtaking portrayal of gyrating stations? The unparalleled mix between human actors and wildlife footage that creates one of the most touching sequences in cinematic history? The appropriate use of silence - filled with mute agony? The sparse, but extremely realistic dialogue - as witnessed for example in the video-conferences of astronauts with family members? The lack of overacting? Visually the movie is spectacular. All of the shots are perfect. The desert shots, with deep contrasts of colour. The planetary views are not realistic with respect to the planetary alignments, but nevertheless such spatial arrangements bring a certain sense of .. art in the shots.The DVD I watched also included the trailers for this movie and for 2010. Watching the trailers for the latter, I got the sense of a Holywoodian reheating of the same ideas, with a lot of inane dialogue and 'action' thrown in. After having watched 2001, this trailer made me laugh until my sides ached. I don't think I'll ever watch 2010. (And does this dolphin have something to do with seaquest?)",2001 - A Space Odyssey

FOr the real word on this film, see David Thompson's 'New Bibliographical Dictionary of Film', the essay on Kubric contains my general sentiments about the man and his whole misbegotten oeuvre although his assertions are more eloquently put than what I can muster. Kubric basically conflates sheer lugubrious (read: deadeningly slow) length of film  with 'depth'(of meaning). He is more concerned with the perfection, exactness and pioneering of lenses, focal lengths and shots than with the necessary concerns for character or coherent narrative. His films are vacuous, he is myopic in his views and this film is the most overrated rubbish this side of creation.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
727,chris-bushwacker,Even endurance can't save you ...,2,27 February 2021,"The closest comparison I could come up with was that of a long uncomfortable flight that feels like it will never end, full of interruptions, shrill annoying noises and irritations that keep you awake when you fervently wish to sink into unconsciousness until it is time to land. Not having experienced space flight, I can only imagine it is far far worse and the three members of the crew that went aboard in suspended animation were the lucky ones.I'm sorry, I do usually have a lot of patience but this was pretentious af and extremely disjointed. The meeting addressed by the doctor, the pretence of a virus to keep visitors away, the decision to keep populations in the dark about the lunar discovery to avoid causing ""culture shock"", the visit to look at the monolith, all seemed to have wandered into the film accidentally because the director wasn't even interested in that. Either have a story or rely on images and special effects, but don't periodically wake us up with snatches of Dialogue only to plunge us back into nothing.Despite its grand sweep it was clumsy and tedious. The monolith tried to warn us but we still went there, and 2.1/2 hrs later we wished we had heeded the warning. Just terrible, and I'll never watch it again.

Then I saw it again on video in mid 80's making not that much more impression, while of course the message was somewhat understood. And then again and again from a video or television broadcasts, before finally began to really like the picture for its merits. But what truly did it for me: my home theater! What an awesome, exhilarating movie in the form AT LEAST the way it should be: 2 x 1 meters on your own wall. (With adequate sound systems naturally.)

What were you doing while watching it? Eating, talking on the phone, listening to Britney Spears' latest masterpiece? There is a plot!!!! You just have to pay a little bit of attention and have intelligence of a flower pot at least (thus excluding Britney's and J.Lo fans). It won't be written on the screen with flaming letters, you have to kind of think (it's what your parents apparently didn't do while they ""created"" you).Another group are those who claim that it was boring, the scenes were too long, no dialogues. If you are accustomed to MTV like films, with scenes changing faster than Beckham's haircut then I can't help you. There are probably some mental health institutions in your country. The scenes are long and left without dialogues to make you think, analyse, help you grasp the questions it asks, or just for sheer pleasure of watching a beautiful image. You do take pleasure in watching something beautiful, don't you. Believe me it's worth paying attention to what you watch not only when you see Seagal breaking somebody's arm, silicon breast or when the characters use the F word as a comma.And finally the guys who say that the ""monkey part"" was stupid and totaly useless. It's the downfall of mankind. Stick to Star Wars and don't comment on real art.

For the first 30 minutes, you'd think you were watching a Discovery Channel special on apes. There's no dialogue for the first 30 minutes. I fast-forwarded through this part.The 2nd part of the movie deals with the lunar discovery and space mission. It also delves into the subject or artificial intelligence & Dave & Frank's interaction with Hal (the supercomputer). The section of the movie is about 55 minutes long and the only part where there is dialogue.The last 30 minutes, Jupiter & infinity is a kind of acid trip. This is Kubrick's artistic expression and philosophy about man's existence and his quest for exploration. This was my interpretation. There is no dialogue in this section either & Kubrick seems to leave the message & conclusion up to the audience. This movie is typical of Kubrick's efforts to go beyond what's conventional & try to be as atypical as possible. The film can be appreciated for its art, vision & philosophical discussions about man, his origins and artificial intelligence, but don't expect a complete, coherent plot.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Personally I prefer more ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining"", but this one... As I fore-mentioned music score, well constructed shots, scientific accuracy, HAL 9000, ambiguous storyline open to every interpretations and outstanding special effects(which brought Kubrick's only Oscar)when character travels through time and space looks so lavish and better than most of other recent movies.

At the time, when the movie was released in 1968 Neil Armstrong hadn't reached the moon, so it was all a new experience for audiences across the planet. That being said, Stanly Kubrick's accomplishment based on a incredible work on the visual effects, the absolutely magnificent use of the sound and the ""lack"" of the use of it. Unforgettable characters like HAL 9000. A very solid script and a unique photography work. It was the movie that changed everything for the sci-fi and all kind of fiction films. A truly masterpiece of cinema. Honestly, my believe is this movie is one of the 100 movies you must see before dying. 10/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
738,ed_zeppelin,"""This conversation can serve no further purpose""",10,18 January 2015,"I first saw 2001 about fifteen years ago, as a teenager and on a tiny TV, and predictably enough I didn't react too well to it. Where was the action? Where was the incident? Where was the dialogue?Now, at the age of 30, I've had the privilege of seeing it on the big screen at the BFI Southbank and you can consider me a convert. I'm not going to call it easy going, but it's an exquisitely beautiful film with a sense of real weight to it.The plot concerns mankind's progress as it's guided by unseen aliens, whose only interaction with the human race is to leave ominous- looking black monoliths in various locations for it to find, each of which has an obscure yet undeniable effect on those who find it. A plot like this could lend itself to heavy-handed moralising - the monoliths, after all, are teaching tools - but the film's brilliance is in the way it keeps its plot in the background. There is no overt message for the audience to absorb; the aliens' motives, such as they are, are never revealed and the audience is invited to speculate on the role the monoliths really have and what the final outcome is to be.In the meantime, the human race is required to prove itself worthy of the monoliths. The first one is given free to the hominid species, but subsequent monoliths are more carefully hidden and require some effort to locate; the second, for example, is placed on the moon and must therefore wait there for four million years before humanity's technology progresses to the point of being able to uncover it. The second monolith seems more accessible in relative terms, but the spacecraft crew sent to find it are beset by a murderous, malfunctioning computer. While the link between the HAL 9000 and monolith plot line is never made clear, I like to think they have something to do with each other; HAL effectively represents the next obstacle for humanity to overcome, and Dave Bowman, through his resourcefulness and bravery, outwits a superior intelligence and proves himself worthy of the film's extraordinary ending sequence.Throughout, a link is drawn between technology and weaponry, and it seems as if technology is a phase that mankind has to go through on its journey to something more pure. The apes' reaction to the first monolith is to learn to create weapons out of bones, therefore coming to dominate their environment and leading - via a startling piece of editing - to the evolution of the human race as an assertive and spacefaring species. It's never made clear whether the second monolith on the moon leads in any direct way to the creation of HAL, but I will suggest that these supercomputers are conspicuous by their absence in the scenes prior to its uncovering in the Tycho crater. The final image of the star-child, on the other hand, is technology-free, bookending the film - mankind has in some respects regressed to a natural state, but in a form that has passed technology by and no longer has any use for it. In these terms, the difference between HAL and the apes' bone-weapons becomes slight.The film is the embodiment of Clarke's own law, that any sufficiently-advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. It is not meant that Bowman should understand the experience of the ending, and nor is it meant for us to walk away from the film with more answers than questions. It's a film that's simultaneously optimistic in its faith in humanity to overcome the trials of the universe, but also terrifying in its Lovecraftian subtext: that mankind is a tiny part of something huge, and its purpose within a greater plan is not for it to know. Perhaps the film encourages us to believe that there's a plan at all, or perhaps it presents mankind as incidental - are we just an idle fancy for the aliens? Perhaps the entire human species is nothing more than an alien's homework project. Believe whatever keeps the vacuum out.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
739,moviedude-72,"A refreshing, beautiful work of art",10,25 September 2006,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a meditative quest, an inspirational sci-fi film that defies its genre in scope and attitude; it is a film of tremendous visual impact and innovation. It was done before Star Wars and at a time when sci-fi films were mostly low-budget productions. It one of Kubrick's finest films, and it is a refreshing break from the typical science fiction films you see today, this one has so much depth and there is a message, it isn't just about explosions or implosions.The film, ultimately, is about the need mankind has to transcend its limited thinking and move into dimensions that are greater than its narrow aims. It is not a pessimistic film as some have suggested, neither is it an optimistic film; it is a film based on self-discovery and intellect and contemplation. It is one of the great original works of cinema, maybe even the best; it is a film that is not even a bit dated as I took my VHS copy from 2001 out of my movie collection and viewed it once again in a few weeks ago; still to be awed by the spectacle, the accuracy of its scientific statements, and its mystery.When you view this film for the first time, it is perplexing, and will have you ruptured, it is quite hard to interpretate what it's actually trying to tell you. However it is open to interpretation, there have been many answers and questions, perhaps more questions than answers. It is mainly about man, and who we continue to kill to protect our territory so we can survive. The question is, will our evolution into the Star Child (seen at the end of the film) change anything or will mans nature remain the same? See how it raises more questions than it answers.2001 has had an amazing impact on Hollywood and pop culture and has spawned countless rip off and spoof versions over the years. Because it will always stand as the greatest of all sci-fi movies, and perhaps the one that holds the best plot...even if it will take you forever to work out what it's actually about it.My only complaint what so ever was the pacing, the film can become considerably slow at times, however that is understandable because Kubrick was trying to depict an accurate journey in space, and understandably couldn't be rounded of too quickly....and sometimes it's nice to just watch the beautiful cinematography unfold in front o your eyes and let it dazzle you.Overall, 2001 is brilliantly conceived work, and is a visually, breathtaking work of art, it is certainly one of Kubrick's greatest. It may contain flaws, but hey, what film doesn't? It will retain its status as a artistic masterpiece for god knows how long.9/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey

741,Asphyxiod,2001 : A Space Odyssey : A Magnum Opus,10,21 May 2005,"Stanley Kubrick can be said as an Einstein of film making. 2001 : A Space Odyssey is more than a Movie. Its an unforgettable master piece, perhaps the most intelligently made movie of all time. More important for us is to applause Kubrick's effort as he has not made the film with a commercial angle but, instead brought out a learning experience through cinematic media. 2001 : A Space Odyssey can be said as a Mix of remarkable Documentary & a superb cinematic drama. The best part of the film is how Kubrick has documented the behavior in Outer space & in Zero-Gravity system. Its merely impossible to explain by words or novel to explain the behavior & perception which one can face in zero-gravity. When coming to fiction, Kubrick shows how humans in 21st century overcomes zero-gravity by using principles of centrifugal force. Difficult even to mentally visualize, but Kubrick & his team generously designed, crafted & shot the greatest scenes ever, of the Rotating Giant Wheel Space Craft & Discovery Space Ship's Crews Walking through the Rotating Deck. 2001 : A Space Odyssey is a Film about ""Evolution of Higher Intelligence for a Need of Survival under influence of Unknown Phenomenon"" The basic idea of Arhtur C. Clarke was that, evolution of intelligence on Earth, from Apes to Man was bestowed by some extra terrestrials (Aliens) and subsequently transforms them from man to the so called ""Star Child"" (Higher intelligence) at the end and after 4 million years. During a sudden Phenomenon in an early morning, the apes come across the Monolith, a Black Rectangular Object, standing erect on the Land. It was a very unusual object for the apes as in wide contrast to their present environment. The ""Curosity"" increases amongst the apes and by overcoming their ""Fear"" one of the apes touches the Monolith followed by other apes. Here is where they overcome their fear and gained confidence. Their brains achieves a second degree of intelligence. Soon after that incidence, the apes are able to ""THINK"" and then comes the invention of a ""Tool"", perhaps the best scene of the film blended with great music. With this ""Tool"" apes are able to fight and defy the rivals. The fast forward to 21st century visualizes the ""Civilised"" Man with his tool which is now sophisticated and in constant innovation. And there is a conflict between the man & machines (tools). Excellently directed by Kubrick, the dispute between the Discovery crew & Hal 9000 is remarkable.Try to understand our connection with the earth. If we don't have any tool with us we can still walk around and survive on land as gravity keeps us together with the Earth matter such as air, water & soil. But in Space, if one loose control of his tools, he shall not survive as there is no Air, water, land & gravity. Our organic form of life is designed to be in need of these. Here is the need of MUTATION. Its time, since man have reached its highest progress but is helpless in Outer space, there is a need for Another Evolution. A New species which shall require no tools to travel. And the Phenomenon again occurs after 4 million years. Jupiter & Beyond exhibits that ""Dave"" the last survival of Discovery space ship, after killing HAL 9000, visits the monolith and subsequently enters a new universe. This again unknown, Kubrick leaves on us to wonder. But the New universe is Multi-dimensional. In the present world we live is 3-Dimension and we are able to move in the space around us in 3-D pattern. This is the rule of our universe. But Dave's new world is Multi - Space-Time dimensional. Imagine if you could also have a Road of time in which you can move to & fro like the Highway on which we travel. The birth of Higher intelligence Life form is an origin from this world. Dave is influenced / mutated again the by the unknown monolith and incarnated as ""STAR CHILD"" in present universe which in the movie is a Giant embryo. Here is were the film ends. The Plot of the film is definite. A journey of evolution from ""Apes - to - Man - to - Starchild"" How it happens, Kubrick shows it as under influence of the Sentinel Monolith. But the evolution happens, Monolith is a fiction, but Genetic Mutation is true. Nature have always constantly mutated Life form to habitat its relevant environment. This is a story of habituating outer space.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The effects were amazing considering the time period and they still look pretty good today. The cinematography was also pretty incredible. The way in which all of the strange camera angles and camera effects used throughout the film, work together in conjunction with the effect of no gravity, create this confusing, cramped atmosphere that really makes it seem like space. The long stretches of music in the vacuum of space and the extended periods of no dialogue throughout the film somehow just fit perfectly.

743,reachrajdream,Space travel with adventure for just a movie ticket,10,11 October 2007,"This movie is a complex work of director Stanley Kubrick,but it is well acclaimed by critics and audience all over the world.I know that Stanley Kubrick has done just 11 mainstream feature films,each one of them has different story plots derived from literary works.The story is been written by renowned science fiction writer Arthur C.Clarke and i would say it is an exceptional material where we can explore themes of evolution.A.I,E.T,origin and end of universe.The story has mystery and adventure,in an innovative backdrop of space.It had some vision and forecast on technology,space life,space travel to be used on future,where some of them were successful.i am sure this movie taught the movie making fraternity the fun,fantasy,adventure,scope through a science fiction movie. The first 4 minutes had mysterious back ground score with blank screen after which the movie started.The first chapter of the movie ""The dawn of man"" had 15 minutes sequence in a desert,which was supposed to be Africa 4 million years ago ,where we see various activity of historic apes .It had no conversation,just various visuals communicating evolutionary concepts,especially the usage of tool.We also see a black rectangular wall like thing(which is called as monolith in this story) which appears mysteriously on a overnight .We see fear,curiosity of apes on the mysterious monolith.The ape learns to use tool,the first turning point of mankind.I think the 15 minutes ape sequence is controversial especially for casual viewers of cinema.In fact it made me bored and also restless,irritating as we cannot understand what was happening in screen.By reading the story in internet websites,i came to know that visuals communicated evolutionary concepts,especially the usage of tooletc.But i was not very impressed of the ape sequence,because i feltthings explained in that 15minutes were not that important to story,as well as little boring.But i was really stunned by the subsequent 2 hours. Now we see the ape learning to use first ever tool and is been thrown which cuts to space ship, which indicates the progression of tool in the evolutionary process.and this happens in the year 1999.The stunning visuals show about space life like zero gravity toilet,pen flying away due to lack of gravity,food styles in space life,how people walk in space.The visual showing the space crafts,costumes,visual effects,set decoration were amazing and it made me feel that i am in space travel,especially the classic composition background score made me connect with visual with lot of joy.The importance of background score is understood through this movie.Such a great impact it had. The story now starts as an American scientist is on mission to moon, where through discussions with his friends and conference speech,we understand there is a mysterious monolith been planted on moon by E.T,millions of years ago.The substance it is made of remains mystery and the radiation it generates are extremely powerful.There is sense of mystery built on story about monolith through background score also.After that we see scientists go the place of monolith to research and as they try to take a photo,we hear a mysterious sound and scene cuts of to Jupiter mission chapter,which happen after 18 months.In this chapter,through visuals we see the space craft for Jupiter mission,which has 5 scientists.where three of them are in hibernation(in sleeping state with protection) to conserve energy for space mission.Through TV interview,we come to know that they are accompanied by HAL9000 computer(A.I),which controls the overall mission and it is an extremely efficient A.I,that thinks like human.There is a a question been raised about its emotion also.Suddenly the A.I questions about the picking of some scientists in last minute has some mystery of mission.Further it detects problem with AE35 unit in space ship,as a result one of the scientist decide to replace it.But from the space team of earth,who have the HAL9000 twin detects that information given by HALL9000 in space ship is wrong.HAL9000 gets confused after replacing the AE 35 unit and says the scientists to wait and let it fail to fix the problem,as they can afford to be out of communication from earth for sometime.Both scientist discuss on this crisis secretly getting away from HAL9000 and decide it to disconnect it.But HAL reads the lip movement and finds out that they are going to disconnect it.Now one of the scientist leaves the space ship through EVA pod and replace the original AE35 unit,but HAL kills the scientist who went to replace and also kills three of them who were in hibernation.Now the other scientist leaves space ship through EVA pod to survive the one who is flying in space.After surviving him he returns to space ship,but HAL refuses to open the door.And he uses emergency air lock and disconnects HAL,after which he gets message through TV that real mission is to find the mystery of monolith in moon,which causes radiations in Jupiter.Now,we come to the final chapter,Jupiter mission and infinity,where we see earth,Jupiter and monolith aligns in the space and the scientist travel through time and space through monolith and finally reaches a 4d room,where he ages and dies.Finally he becomes a embryo in the death bed.Now we see the monolith in front of bed generating light,energy and he becomes star child.This film is path breaking in all aspects,but there is one side of audience and critics blaming it to be dull,uninteresting, and slow.Only if you love to travel space with sense of adventure and having the passion explore the mystery of universe,you will be enjoying .Otherwise,it's going to be a nightmare.Stanley Kubrick has given new dimension to film making and it's scope.The movie is evident that he is put a great deal of thought and hard work,for which we must appreciate.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This film has so many mind-blowing visuals, fantastic classical music, phenomenally hidden themes, masterful direction and great storytelling. Directors like Stanley Kubrick have a special place in the history of filmmaking. Kubrick is one of the VERY few directors that delivers an extremely unique presence to ALL of his films with his direction and he also knows what his audience wants out of filmmaking and I absolutely LOVE that! Even if you watch 2001 by 1st viewing and even if you don't fully understand the film, it's SOO unforgettable to step away from and it's due to unforgettable direction, plot, music and breathtakingly GORGEOUS visuals and of course the Apollo moon landing! 2001 also captures an amazing and stunning feel of mankind interfering with something that's unknown and very fascinating and we've had so many films that have portrayed 2001: A Space Odyssey and NONE of them have been able to top this film. One thing that's very interesting about Stanley Kubrick is that he will show you AMAZING and FASCINATING images in all of his films and they absolutely keep you in on edge and focused and that's because all of Kubrick's films have a feel of ""realism"" and 2001: A Space Odyssey is a perfect execution! The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket and Dr. Strangelove along with all of Kubrick's other films have MANY things that make you follow along with their stories and messages and visuals and elements and that's what makes Stanley Kubrick a Master in cinema history! As a person who LOVES cinema and is a nerd when it comes to film, I'm gonna be completely honest when I say that ""In my mind, 2001: A Space Odyssey is the BEST directed movie I've ever seen!"" 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that has stood the test of time HIGHLY successfully with many mind-blowing and unforgettable elements that makes this film a TRUE masterpiece! 2001: A Space Odyssey gets a 10/10!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Unemotional: The primary characters are astronauts, who necessarily have steely nerves. Watch Dave control his anguish over his dying friend in the pod return scene.  Notice the same thing when he discovers the rest of the crew have been killed by HAL while in stasis.  Notice the cold-blooded, murderous efficiency with which Dave decommissions HAL, and notice the heartbreaking decay of HAL and his impassioned (for a computer) pleas to spare his 'life'.Effects: These effects still surpass those being done today. Flashier? Louder? No. Technically, visually, scientifically perfect? Yes. Check out the vehicle that transports Dr. Floyd to the Moon...it's basically a prototype for the Space Shuttle which appeared over a decade later.Doesn't make sense: When the ape-man uses the bone as a tool, then tosses it in the air, we flash forward to a spacecraft. The genius of this is that it indicates that once ape-man learned to use tools, it was a straightforward progression to developing a space station. The meaning, purpose, and nature of the monolith are *supposed* to be unknown (and probably unknowable), to illustrate the feebleness of man's quest to understand the true nature of existence.Nothing happens: Um, only the evolution of man to the next level of existence (which during the final scenes, is as incomprehensible to us as our world would be to a prehistoric ape-man). You were expecting what?  Car crashes?  Sound traveling through (airless) space?  Histrionic astronauts?  Klingon cloaking devices?  Aliens gestating in stomachs?  Cute, engaging robot sidekicks?  Cliff's Notes?Slow and deep does not equal boring and ponderous.  In the early stages of the film we see primitive ape-men living a precarious life, barely subsisting and in danger of losing their watering hole to a neighboring tribe/clan/group.  The monolith appears and the members of our group touch the monolith in a very inscrutable scene.  What's happening?  Why is it happening?  What does it mean?  The mystery is partially solved when we see one member of the clan idly playing with a bone.  As he plays with it, it dawns on him that he could use the bone to hunt the wild pigs that live in the area.  The next thing we see is our group of ape-men, looking a little fatter, and the bones of a few more pigs littering the ground.So, apparently, the monolith has provided this group of ape-men with a heightened sense of logic and reason, through mechanisms unknown.  That is, in and of itself, deep commentary on the nature of man and god.  But what happens next is even more disturbing.  After getting fatter and stronger by using his newfound technique, our protagonist-ape then faces off with his rivals at the watering hole.  And uses his newfound learnings to kill the leader of the rival tribe and claim the watering hole.  This speaks even more deeply to the nature of man, in that when ape-man acquires knowledge, he first uses it for good (survival) and then for evil (to kill).There are some who say that they get all these deeper meanings, but still don't care for the film.  For them, I offer my condolences that this film does not bring as much awe and wonder into their lives at it does to mine. There are others (many others, in my experience) who have given up on this film halfway through, and never experienced the entire arc of the story.  I would encourage these people to try it again with an open mind and no pressing distractions.And then there are those who will someday see this film for the first time. I envy you that experience.  See it on the big screen, if at all possible. If not, watch it in widescreen with no commercials.  Pan and scan will obscure the glorious cinematography, and commercials will jar you out of the funky, contemplative state this movie induces.  Enjoy.

747,Herr Nosferatu,Cosmic brilliance.....,10,3 May 2001,"True, this film has a very low amount of dialogue. But does a film absolutely NEEDS dialogue to be comprehended ? This timeless evolution proves that it obviously doesn't.
From the very first lights of the blinding sun, the birth of life, to the lashing last moments of man's quest for the truth regarding his presence on earth, this film spans through time and space in a visual, musical and existentialistic trip that astonished me to the core of my being...The music, a pure example of the artistic evolution of man's quest for communication, is a quintessential element to the illustriousness of this motion picture. It affects the viewer and story by creating an awe for all who experience this majestic voyage, a rich metaphorical component to the eternal quest for human knowledge.This is, aside from Tarkovsky's spellbinding film Solaris, one of the most powerful example of art versus science... The impact the film has had on our modern society can be both unclear and quite obvious... The pursuit for the unknown and to surpass our own past achievements trough a spector of light and exploration. Creation of a space station, an expansion of our own world to correct our past mistakes... Wow........",2001 - A Space Odyssey
748,flipcritic,Beyond filmmaking...,10,25 August 1999,"Perhaps Roger Ebert said it best... ""Kubrick's goal here is not to thrill us, but to fill us with a sense of awe.""  And no film I have ever seen captures man's universal meaning in a film as does ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" From man's beginning to his probable destiny, Kubrick has captured the essential milestones that may have and what could still shape the very essence of humanity.  And he does so very very much with so very little. This film, without computer graphics and hitech special effects, accomplishes more for the science fiction genre, than any other film of its kind, including the Star Wars Trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Contact.For me, this is definitely the best motion picture of all time.  ***** out of ****.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
749,howlandowl,Don't watch it without the remote handy.,5,7 December 1999,"Kubrik could have had a short, well-done film if he'd just done the crisis in space segment. It is most excellently done. And then we have the other twelve hours of the movie. At least, that's what it feels like. Feel free to watch it if cartwheeling through space for minutes on end while music somewhat analogous to the sounds of Gregorian monks attacked by killer bees plays in the background is your cup of tea. Be my guest, but I'll pass, thank you.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
750,DeathFish,Beauty is underestimated.,10,2 January 2007,"This movie is not just good, its amazing. Besides providing us with good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and a lot more, it was an, until then, completely unseen world to the public. This is the first sci-fi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old, and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. But nonetheless I was really, and I mean completely, blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects was just one of the merits of this movie, the camera was in true Kubrick style amazing and enchanting. It feels like you are consumed by the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or whatever you call it). The effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me of my guards even though I had seen the rating before I bought it. But this movie has more to it than this. The meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you wish yourself, even though I think there are some clear points concerning humanity (also true Kubrick style). How humanity on top of its evolution is just maintenance on board, and therefore not needed by the computer, one of humanities tools. How we in space appear like babies, learning to walk once more, losing control of our tools in zero-gravity, breathing through equipment as fish out of water. On the peak of evolution, we set out into the never-ending adventure as simple primates. Many might think that the length and slow pace of this movie is, boring? ridicules? or just a waste of time. But before you can jump to those conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with calm music and a spaceship in the middle of space for several minutes. This is to illustrate the beauty of it. Beauty, beauty is in many cases not granted the rightful respect by viewers. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we do not succumb to it and relax, we can not enjoy this film as it was intended. This is not an ordinary movie, we can not just sit and watch as we can with some other movies, this requires time, thoughts and above all commitment and feelings to watch. All of this together, makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
751,headfella,Best Science Fiction Movie E v e r !,10,13 May 2007,"Without any doubt, this the best sci-fi film ever! This is the first film I bought in VHS format and later in DVD format when that became available. I was a young teenager when I first saw this gem in the theater. The ending remains somewhat cryptic. The only ""cure"" is to read the book and see the movie. Repeat the dose if required. Each time a somewhat different conclusion emerges. By the way, I was the first to point out a discrepancy to Mr. A C Clarke regarding HAL's commissioning date. The movie has one date, the book has a different date. Check for yourself. Kubrick composed an excellent piece of visual art. The film stands up well with the advancing years but, ... oh how I wish someone like Spielberg would create a updated remake using today's state of the art if for no other reason than to introduce a new generation to the frightening majesty of spaceflight? Do NOT miss this film!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
752,807,Piotr St. says: Unique experience,10,8 February 2003,"I've rewieved 3 movies so far and I gave all of them 1/10. But don't worry. This movie does not deserve it.(Some spoilers possible, depending on what do you understand as 'a spoiler') 2001: A Space Odyssey is an special and unique movie. Unlike almost all others, this one tends to use as little words as possible, the story is told mostly by the pictures and the music - and so, this may be the ONLY complete movie in history, telling EVERYTHING by images, not by words. The book gave a strong explanation of everything: the film simply presents you the pictures (I love one of it: an ape throws a bone in the air, and it, slowly floating down, suddenly turns into a spaceship floating in space - 4 millions of years of evolution and history of mankind, all turn into ONE SINGLE CUT!!!! Incredible.), and leaves all explanation up to you.Definitely 10/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
753,Jonas Kyratzes,not good at all,4,2 April 2002,"Let me explain a few things. I love science fiction. I love the works of Arthur C. Clarke, Isaac Asimov etc etc. I love movies and I don't mind long or slow movies. And I'm a great fan of Kubrick. Movies like A Clockwork Orange and The Shining are brilliant. But 2001: A Space Odyssey is truly a bad movie. Why? It has no point. It has no story. It is badly directed. All this movie does is show off Kubrick's ability to create nice 'pictures'. Sure, the effects are nice, and some scenes inside the spacecraft are brilliantly made. But all this movie has are tons of effects and NO STORY, NO POINT. I like metaphors and I'm not stupid, but I don't see the point of this film. This is a film about special effects. Don't waste your time watching this movie. Instead buy 'Rama' or 'Childhood's End' (yes, these are books) and read them. Now THAT's science fiction.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
754,Ken-Tajalli,In Summer 2007 ....,10,6 January 2008,"Oscar Wilde said: "" the moment you understand a piece of art, it is dead for you "" ( or something to that effect ). 2001 is the exception, it may be dead for you if you don't understand it !! I am not going to tell you how good or bad this movie is ! others have done a pretty good job already, enough to say the opinions are polarized ! You either love it or find it the most boring thing you have ever watched, there is only one way to find out ! Since I love this movie, it was quite funny to read the negative comments, such as "" dear God, kill me now .."" , "" cure for insomnia "". ( frankly , I do understand them and sympathize )but the following may prove interesting ..In summer 2007 ( early Aug. ), I was fortunate enough to see this magnificent movie, one more time, on big screen ( and I mean BIG!), during ""under the stars"" event , organised by Film4 (somerset house in London ) The event lasted about 10 days, and showed great movies, such as ""the Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" , ""the thing"", E.T. to name a few ( http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/film/default.asp ). The event was organised to show these movies ( usually one per night ), on state of the art sound and vision equipment in open air ( thus ""under the stars"" !). I attended ""the good, the bad ..."" and ""2001"" showing. During ""the good, the bad .."" , it got a bit chili, so I could see about a quarter of the viewers, slowly get up and leave , towards the last hour of the movie. However, on the Saturday night showing of ""2001"" , not only the court was over-filled beyond capacity ( people sat right up to the giant screen, virtually looking up !), but no one left the court before the end of the movie, even though it was much colder on that night !! Another thing that surprised me, was the average age of the viewers, to my eyes , almost 90 per cent of them, were not old enough to have seen the movie in a cinema before ( therefore , they could not have been there just for nostalgia ! ). It was commented by the organizers on the night, that ""2001"" attracted most viewers during the event.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
755,m_viknaraja,revolutionary,8,9 April 2003,"this films is quite revoluitionary. it has some of the best visuals ever seen on film. they have the most extraordinary sets. the creation of the spacecrafts and interior is quite simply a work of art. from the space suits to the electronics to the visuals in space, it is as good as it could be.
the way the astronauts move around in their spacecraft has never been done before. and how they managed to do that in the late sixties is beyond belief. they way the walk vertically, and in all different angles is excellent. this is without doubt one of the best looking films ever. 
the story howver, can be confusing,  boring and long winded but this is not how the film is intended to be viewed.it is a work of art, like the best looking painting you ever saw. and as such is as good as it gets.and the film has stood the test if time. it hasn't aged at all and is unlikely to in the future. it sets the standard for sci-fi films and motion picture in general.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
756,HungryCreatureProductions,Pretentious yet Glorious,8,25 June 2020,"The film has a monolithic reputation, yet relatively few people seem to have seen the whole thing. Of those who have viewed the film in it's entirety, opinions seem to be binary. One camp hails the experience as an unparalleled masterpiece and the other claims it to be a colossal bore.2001 was MADE for artists or art appreciators. The composition, camera movement, lighting, and sound for every frame of film is constructed as though the filmmaker's career hangs off that frame alone. The image is meticulous to the point of nearly transcending human creation, serving as the perfect visual counterpoint to the film's narrative themes exploring sentience, the essence of humanity, and the link between spatial exploration and introspection.This aesthetic integrity is made even more impressive when the historic context of the film is taken into account before viewing. 2001: A Space Odyssey was released in 1968. It predates Star Wars, Alien, Blade Runner, practically any science fiction classic on film that still maintains pop-culture relevance. As an extension of this context, 2001 also predates any semblance of digital effects, what you see is what you get. All images are occurring, albeit through masterful sleight of hand, on camera. There's a scene with a pen floating in midair. Nowadays we would just have the actress work around an imaginary pen and create a digital object, animate it, render it and perfectly blend it into the shot with compositing tricks. There's nothing wrong with that and it would have looked just fine. But in 1968, they had to be a bit more creative. What we see on screen in 2001 is a pen stuck to a piece of glass in front of the camera, the camera/lights carefully arranged to eliminate giveaway reflections. There is a shot of our hero exercising in a seemingly zero-g environment. There are no wires to paint out, no green screen wizardry to key. The entire set is a giant drum with the actor always at the bottom, behaving normally. The camera itself is on a rig, rotating with the set to give the illusion of the actor being the one moving.The entire film, on a technical level, is both groundbreaking and fascinating.The narrative will be pretty familiar to most viewers as an uncountable number of films, TV shows, and video-games have either paid homage to or straight-up ripped off 2001 A Space Odyssey in the many years between 1968 and today. Because of this familiarity, very little within the story will come as a surprise to modern audiences. That said, the story is engaging and interesting. We never get to know the characters very well, yet this impersonal nature feels intentional as a counterpoint to the narrative theme of human nature vs artificial nature. For viewers who need something to connect with emotionally, this might be a difficult watch as neither the characters nor the narrative arcs are meant to be connected to. The film very purposefully looks at it's players from above. It is intentionally impersonal, direct, and cold.Given the lack of subtlety in the film's point of view, the story doesn't unfold in your standard blockbuster manner. It builds themes visually, layering ideas using scenes that don't directly tie into the main story to convey the narrative rather than the usual plot point by plot point exposition typically used in major motion pictures. Some viewers may not appreciate this approach and will spend their time being confused about how a given sequence fits INTO the story rather than thinking about what the sequence ADDS to the story's themes and overall narrative layers.You cannot watch 2001 A Space Odyssey from a purely literal standpoint and get much enjoyment from it. Most films are constructed around this conceit, yet 2001 plays with the concept of a visual format, leveraging thematic juice from image rather than constant exposition. Though it must be said, when the film, albeit infrequently, dips into exposition mode, the overall narrative does take a stumble.One of the biggest complaints about 2001 is that IT IS SLOW. There's nothing snappy or quick about this movie. For many people this may be a deal-breaker. Once again though, Kubrick directed many films, some with a very brisk pace, so this is a deliberate choice by the filmmaker to work hand in hand with the subject matter. He uses time itself to leverage a sense of scale or grandeur.While not all the effects may look photo-realistic by today's standards, these long slow-moving takes, accompanied by the grand music really sell the physicality of these ships and space stations while underscoring the isolation and danger of space exploration.2001 A Space Odyssey is not a film that can be watched, it must be experienced. I can think of no other film that makes such demands of it's audience. There is nothing passive about watching it, the viewer must succumb to it's hypnotism in order to fully appreciate it. Modern audiences will have to resist the urge to fiddle with phones or talk during the film, to reach the state of paranoid-zen the film demands, watch it on the largest screen possible, with the sound as loud as possible, in a dark environment with a quiet and respectful group.This is not a movie. This is an Art Experience and, frankly, that's not for most people. Mass modern audiences may not have the patience for such things, but if you are willing the approach the film on it's own terms, you just might love it.-Josh Evans",2001 - A Space Odyssey

758,suws1,Ahead of its time but...,7,24 June 2013,"I felt the need to review this movie after reading some reviews from other users, simply because I agreed with all. Those who love it, those who hate it, those who enjoyed it, all of them. And the reason is simple: everything they say makes sense to me. I watched the movie for the first time about 10 years ago, and watched it again last night. It still doesn't make perfect sense to me. I mean, the story is absent, the characters don't really get through you, and the ending...who gets that ending?? #SPOILERS# BELOWThe end makes no sense to me... The psychedelic travel, the space child... Maybe I'm just plain stupid, but spending two and a half hours looking at space, slooowww space, and in the end just watch a man in bed, then a baby in a bubble, no explanations, no nothing... Truly, if someone got it and has the hability to explain it to me without calling it ""art"" or whatever, simply explain it to me, I would be very thankful, not kidding. Maybe that way I would be able to enjoy it next time I watch it, maybe ten years from now.That been said, why would I rate it a 7...? I believe when I watch a movie for the first time, I should put myself at the time, the era, the social paradigm, the movie was released. And this movie is cleary ahead of its time. Note, that I am talking about the visual effects, and the general idea of the movie. This movie clearly marked an era, a filmmaker, visual effects and the idea of what space was like. For that it deserves a high rating, maybe the highest. Not to mention the hype the movie STILL causes. We still can't reach an understanding...is it a masterpiece, is it overrated. The only way to really be able to discuss it and form your own opinion is to watch it, so the movie reaches its goal: to be watched and debated. A blockbuster rarely does this, we just watch them to get some good action scenes, visual effects, whatever, but when a filmmaker creates a movie that creates hype, controversy and most importantly, a vision of the future, he is creating a cult movie...a classic. To sum up, as I said in the beginning, when i read people calling it a classic, a masterpiece, I have to agree, but I also agree with those who say its overrated and boring...For me both sentences are true.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Paths of Glory was incredible. 2001, important in the realm of scifi films, Star Wars probably would not exist if not for this film. But GAWD this film is so cold and excruciating. There is blackness......for a long time. Then shots of trees......for a long time. Finally some action in the form of shrieking primates. They shriek and I shriek for the film to get going. Then a black monolith appears, and, oh goody, that makes the primates shriek more and bash boars with bones. A bone goes in the air and becomes a spaceship. Cool. And I love Strauss. But we watch ships fly and dock for a.....long.....time. God, I get it Stanley, move it along. Yay, we get actual human beings. Boo we cannot hear anything they are saying because they whisper. I turned the volume up all the way and still could not hear the dialogue. Well, I soldiered on because, thank God, HAL appeared. My favorite character is a computer. Great. HAL showed more emotion than any other in this film. But Stanley killed him......slowly. Christ. Poor HAL. Last 15 minutes of this film is one....long......acid.......trip. We see the big Hershey bar again then a fetus (????????). But I am grateful because I finally hear the dialogue of a human: ""My God, it's full of stars"". Ooookay. No, it is full of baloney.

On the giant Cinerama screen the film reveals it's true wonder; TV sadly diminishes it. 2001 is a visual feast. Kubrick blends inspiring images with equally inspiring music, creating a symphonic film.I still watch 2001, 30 odd years after it's release and marvel at the technical skill, the depth of it's meanings and the scale of it's story. I have my own feelings of what it is really about but there is not enough space here to go into that.There is no other film to compare 2001 with, the sequel 2010 wasn't at all in the same league and is best forgotten. 2001 has to be seen, it can't be explained or summarised.

But it got no story and no meaningful ending. The film exists but some people don't find it meaningful. I have watched the film 3 times. Here is my take away. 1) You know the past is fixed, it couldn't be changed. 2) The future is the also fixed and it also can't be changed.The 2nd point is hard, very very hard for most people to accept. It means everything is predestinated, no matter how big (Space) or small (Life). The way you think and the things you do are predestinated.Back to the 2 hours movie. In this vast universe, hey there is life. And everything just moves accordingly as they are predestinated.The ending means everybody can now go home, life as usual, continue to have sex and reproduce, let life runs its course until one day it reached the end. The universe too, runs it own course, one day it will end.5% of people get it but they don't like it.If you get it, you know there is no parallel universe for you to escape. :)",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I am capable of understanding the thought processes of a director and I am not a soap opera watching moron. The fact of the matter is that this film is slow, boring, and absolutely miss-able. I agree fully that most fans of this awful movie have been struck down with The Emperor's New Clothes syndrome and need to get out more. It is tedious to the extreme. It is overrated and would make watching a nail rust in the rain seem worthwhile. In case I haven't made myself clear; this time bloated waste of an evening is a none film.

766,SindarS,2001: A Space ..something..,5,20 August 2018,"This movie by Stanley Kubrick was made about 50 years ago, just a short time before the man actually set his foot on the Moon. Ironically, mankind still hasn't topped its achievement and we are way past year 2001 - talk about wrong priorities and wasted opportunities..That said, I'd agree that this movie was ahead of its time and it was very ambitious in what it was trying to achieve and represent, and to some extent it did succeed. Considering all that, I still feel that this movie is over-hyped - it fails in one key aspect and that is storytelling. Basically it consists of 3 different acts where the only connecting piece is the mysterious monolith, the origin and purpose of which is very vaguely explained in the movie. It's kind of ""make of it what you will"" approach, which I personally didn't appreciate. The movie is based on a novel written by Arthur C. Clarke and I'll admit that I haven't read it, however reading the book first shouldn't be a pre-requisite for enjoying the movie. And that to me is one of the main issues. 
We can talk about the symbolism in the movie all we want, but if the viewer is not given any information or explanation about what actual sense he or she should make out of this it just feels like a vacuum. Having some kind of narrator in the slow awkward parts (and I'll get to those later) would help this movie tremendously. Without it, those 3 acts are just stitched together like Frankenstein's monster and are expected to work by leaving an impression on the viewer. They do, but not in the right way.
At the end of it I was left with more questions than answers without getting any proper context or purpose and that is why my watching experience felt frustrating and pointless. I get that the intention was to keep it open for interpretation and debate, but, boy, that's one hell of a stretch.On the positive side, the movie is impressive for the technological advancements it tries to represent (like portable screens, artificial gravity in the spaceship, hibernation pods, etc.) given the limitations of technologies that were available at the time. It uses neat tricks to achieve space illusions, which can definitely be commended. Funny enough, some of those technologies still don't exist in real life today.
That said, it does get plenty of the simple science wrong, like: pouring coffee in a cup on a space shuttle (good luck with that, when there's no gravity), showing Sun as a yellow star (while in fact it's white), pitch black space during the EVA scenes (while there should be plenty of stars seen), etc. The design of space ships/shuttles/pods depicted was highly impractical and funny, but can be overlooked in the grand scheme of things.Another Achilles heel of the movie is the characters - they all have a personality of a wet mop. Didn't care for any of them. Actually the most interesting one was supercomputer named HAL in the final act. He struggles with his personality and purpose, that he's been programmed to do, which made this part of the movie somehow interesting and thought-provoking. One can clearly see, how HAL has influenced AIs and robots in other sci-fi movies, so kudos for that.And last but not least - the pace of the movie. It's so slow that it makes snails look like cheetahs, I'm not kidding. I fully get what Kubrick was trying to achieve with this - to show how vast the space actually is and to highlight specific emotional points in the movie, but it borders on frustration of wasting viewers time. In many of those scenes you can easily go make a coffee or a sandwich and come back, and you wouldn't have missed a thing. Watching a space ship graciously glide through space for two and a half minutes isn't impressive nor breathtaking, when it happens for the forth or fifth time... The movie could've easily been 1 hour shorter and have exactly the same effect.
And to top it off, is the climax scene at the end which looks like a laser show at a trance party and might induce some epileptic seizures as it goes on for way too long. The controversial ending to me was actually less controversial than frustrating for the reasons I explained at the beginning, so I'll leave it at that.In short, after staring at a black screen for two minutes and listening to some highly annoying noise in the background at the beginning of the movie, the viewer is greeted with the epic opening theme of 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss and the movie title. To me that was the most enjoyable part of the movie and it could just be ended there.
My score of the movie mostly represents the appreciation of its influence on the sci-fi genre that followed it. It would be way weaker, if released today.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
767,carter-47153,The Next Step in Filmmaking,10,24 August 2015,"Is aggression a prerequisite for the progression of human development? This is one of many questions posed by director Stanley Kubrik in this groundbreaking film. The film is divided into three segments and this question is posed within the first twenty minutes as a group of prehumans come into contact with an alien obelisk. This obelisk starts to move the story forward and effects subtle changes within the prehumans including an intelligence that allows them to use weapons. The story then jumps into the future where humanity has discovered an object on the moon. As the object is approached which appears to be similar as the alien obelisk seen earlier in the film, it gives off a signal of some sort. The story then jumps into a further future where a spacecraft has been sent to the destination point of the alien signal. This causes a series of events that brings about the next evolution of humanity into a ""starchild"".While the issue surrounding aggression and the progression of humanity is addressed early on, it is questions regarding artificial intelligence that creates the conflict within the story. Concerns surrounding how far an A.I. should be made aware and if an A.I. has the right to ensure it's own survival are addressed.Mr. Kubrick pioneered several techniques for this film which included practical ways to make an environment appear weightless. This included showing characters walk on ceilings and also seeing objects float through the air. He was also able to use inventive camera techniques such as using still photographs for wide shots as opposed to taking a film crew with him to film on location.This film is a solid production. Through Mr. Kubrik's camera techniques and the body language of the actors it made to be very believable that the characters are in space. It is definitely a technical achievement especially when these visuals are paired with music that Mr. Kubrick picked personally for the movie. The film does lack in that their is no clear protagonist or antagonist. There is no character development for any character as no character is around long enough. It is almost as if the characters are there just to facilitate the progression of the story.This film was finished almost a decade before Star Wars and helped to define the genre for it's time. It has remained a classic and has impacted it's genre and cinema in general.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The only reasons it is held in such high regard, are:
It came out in the 60s, and its effects were wonderful for that timeIt has some great shotsIt apparently has ""deep meaning"" (it really does not, by the way)And most importantly, it was made by Stanley KubrickYou'll find several ""lovers"" of the film repeating that ""the film is meant for intellectuals"" and that ""stupid people call this movie trash"". Well, if that makes me stupid than so be it. I personally didn't even care about the ""meaning"" of the ending, even though I completely understood what happened in the ending. I understood almost everything going on through all of the film. But the ending's ""meaning"" doesn't mean anything if I was already bored to death in the first place reaching it.What happened to the basics of cinema? Great shots and ""deep meaning"" exclusively do not define great cinema. Great cinema primarily must keep you engaged, by either moving you or entertaining you - everything else is secondary. I don't for a second believe the ""intellectuals"" who rate this movie highly could sit through that stupid light scene without at least yawning several times, if not almost sleeping. And that agonizing glass slab CPU replacing scene, you're telling me that was ""great cinema""?Just because it was ""ahead of its time"" for 1968 does not make it great. Citizen Kane came in out in 1941 and was ahead of its time. But Citizen Kane was also engaging, which is what especially makes it great, unlike 2001.Final verdict: Self-indulgent trash.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
769,mrloughrie,Full of Cons and Full Of Pros,10,24 March 2016,"I looked at the trailer, the reviews, and the critics and I had to watch it, and I'm sure glad I did. So basically I really couldn't keep track because so much was going on, but basically I think the story was on a trip to Jupiter, a good, helpful robot turns evil after a rude compliment. He then kills one member of the ship, and then proceeds to refuse to let David enter the ship. David makes a dumb decision to leave his helmet in the ship and here is the memorable scene when he jumps out and risked his life to enter the ship and then shuts HAL down. After that a series of creepy noises and rainbows fly all over the place after David saw on the news that life was found on Jupiter. Then, he is shown dying extremely fast. The scene was pretty enjoyable, and then he turns into a CGI baby floating in the sky, with the memorable (Bum, bum, buuuuuum!) So I enjoyed the movie, I didn't understand the whole monolith thing, and I really want to watch this movie again so I can focus on that part, but still I enjoyed it. Some things were wrong with the movie, (I still give it a 10/10 because I'm generous) It was very confusing. I still am confused. And it's really not like any other movie we have today, Kubrick really went for something different here, and it was a bit interesting. I won an Oscar, and of course nothing but the outstanding effects, how did they have those visuals?? I really believe Stanely time traveled, it's literally 99% impossible to get clear and perfect images of planets like that in 1965, those pictures are good enough to put onto someone's home screen cell phone. (If you're wondering why I said 1965, that's because 1965 - 1966 was the filming dates for this movie, which makes it even more impressive). Just amazing visuals, this looks BETTER than Transformers. Now, another reason why I believe he time traveled (exaggeration) is because he predicted SO much, I mean, he predicted Skype, moon landing, and he even predicted daily news. And things like Siri. How did he do it? This movie looks like a 2001 movie. (See what I did there?) Why do people seem you hate this movie? You ask, well, I think people hate this movie because they're too impatient, and yes, the beginning scenes were quiet boring. But it got so interesting when HAL killed the guy, then you start you ask for the next scene! The dialog was pretty realistic, and so was the acting. Overall, I loved this movie and recommend for families who love Sci-Fi. One Final Note: I liked it, but it should have been called ""3001: A Space Odyssey""",2001 - A Space Odyssey
770,clint-cole,Come again,1,12 November 2005,"On second thought, please don't. This is a movie with three plots, all of which have the potential of going somewhere, but don't. The first plot: Discovery of something that causes a colony to lose contact with base. The second plot: A computer running a space ship decides to go homicidal. The third plot: On a mission to Saturn, an astronomer encounters a different dimension? This movie is supposed to be an artistic movie, but instead it becomes annoying when halfway through you have to listen to sustained and muffled breathing for an extended period of time during which the plot crawls forward at a snails pace. Toward the end there are flashing colors and irritating scrawling noises that are supposed to be special effects. For as much respect as I have for 'A Clockwork Orange', Stanley Kubrick fails to meet his own standards.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

772,redrawn,Space Documentary,9,15 January 2013,"This film's production is marvellous and detailed in such a degree to make your suspension of belief ease you into a convincing piece of speculative fiction. Lacking any human drama, and leisurely in pace, the film features many mundane scenes documenting life, but with many profound consequences.Exposition is told by various news items, Kubrick's ability to tell a story with images is amazing. A rather simple story depicting human evolution, and conflict with technology, there is little dialogue, but the use of images tells the story compellingly and not without a loss understanding. The images are utterly effective in reaching out to the viewer. The images themselves are strong, generally quite beautifully, and discretely shot, to not disturb the reality the film sets forth.The acting is very natural, the astronauts are cool and collected, professional at their jobs, and staying away from any unnecessary human emotions to mar the story. HAL 9000, is wonderfully played, his chipper voice a dead set against the human actors, his words filled with almost sarcasm and arrogance, before his genuinely emotional exit.I like the way humanity's next great venture, that of space travel, is juxtaposed with a symbol of humanity's next great evolution. 2001: A Space Odyssey plays like a documentary filled with wonderful music flow perfectly with the images, and fits the enormity of space adventure. It a glorious undertaking, of great ambition, but shot with such naturalism as to convince us of humanity's achievements. Above all, it is an optimistic movie, of humanity's glowing future.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The beginning sequence with the primates is a little too long and boring in my opinion. Also the movie moves very slowly until the end when things pick up a little. Near the end when HAL 9000 starts going goofy, it's very chilling. It's so compelling how a computer can be so malevolent, even though it's a machine and it's unintentional. If you have the patience to sit through a movie that's nearly 2 1/2 hours long, you should go see it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Those, who have deemed it to be the best science fiction movie ever, are probably correct. To describe it in one word, ""STUNNING.""it is a work of everlasting art. 2001 has been called the number one movie that ""shooked the world,"" and it still has tremendous impact for a production made over 35 years agoask NASA. Our space program has been developed using this movie as a model.However, it is not for everyone. It is not for those who like ""shoot'em ups, and it is not for those who have no patience, no open mind, and no intelligence save that of a stone. Like me, many of IMDb' commentators have rated 2001 as a 10; but I'll bet none of them, including me, can concisely tell you why. The experience of viewing this film can be compared to one's seeing Leonardo's ""Mona Lisa"" and trying to explain why the painting is so revered.I did not have the time to read all the other commentators, but it is well-known that the main villainous character in the film is the computer, HALand if you go up one letter in our alphabet for each of the letters in HAL H is I, A is B, and L is M.you get IBM (International Business Machines), which, in 1968, was the Microsoft of today.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The thematic depth of the movie is unmatched and so are the camera works. Every single shot adds to the spots the movie hits on. It's difficult to believe that someone could come up with this vision back in 1968. Kubrick shows, using beautiful symmetry, that how in curiosity and instinct to conquer human race has evolved from using bones as weapons to the building computers such as HAL. The ending is as magnificent today as it was back when it was first released -- it can be interpreted in numerous ways including both: the catastrophic end and the glorious rebirth.

I can see how the effects were amazing, given that they don't look cheap and shoddy even today. Still, a movie ,where the first words don't happen until roughly 25 minutes into the movie, is making a huge mistake. The plot is incomprehensible. I turned around and asked my dad what had happened when the movie finished. There is only one thing that comes even close to saving this movie and that is the perfect marriage that is ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and the discovery of bone as a weapon.

777,sideburnmikeguitar,I registered simply to warn others of how bad this movie is!!,1,10 December 2006,"A quick synopsis before I give specifics into why this movie is so painfully bad that I intend to DEMAND my $2.71 for rental of it. It make me stoopid. OK, not really but I'd rather sit through an Alicia Silverstone movie marathon than this again.2 minutes of black screen with, as one other reviewer described it: what sounds like dying hippos. I'd liken more to audio recording of 3 simultaneous root canals, drills and all, with no Novocaine. But I digress. Next, we watch a lot of apes fight for supremacy (I dare not call them monkeys) of what I don't really know, though the waterhole they bathe in might be a good guess. Though they have non-verbal communication, they haven't figured out how to use tools. One of them touches the monolith (3D black rectangle that does nothing...or does it? Oooo) and ta-da! Now he grasps the concept of tools and learns how fight off the other apes. I'm not really sure how that's evolution, seems to point to Lamarck more than Darwin, but hey...The next segment shows some guy's complete flight to a space-station where he has a conference about a monolith that's on the moon. No one knows or cares about the old one, by the way. It makes annoying sounds that deafens the astronauts when they try to touch it because no means no. It calls it's boyfriend to beat them up. OK the last part isn't true, but it would've been much more interesting. What I just described basically takes 45 minutes of your life that you will feel were stolen from you, even if you'd just planned on doing macramé instead. The signal it sends out is rather annoying and pointing at Jupiter. ""Let's definitely go there"" say the astronauts. We've already got Rosie O'Donnell, why not follow where THIS large rectangle of audible annoyance points us.Great, now we're in a space station where a computer called HAL is on-board to help the astronauts on their mission. Here the actors muster all their strength to completely phone in their parts in what would almost be considered slightly more fascinating than your cousin's Christmas letter telling you how their little baby has started to say real words like...who am i kidding? you can't possibly care. I personally root for the evil computer. It seems to me that evolution for man could just as easily mean learning not to build technology that can defeat mankind. Duh. This is NOT Kubrick's take. Everything is pretty obvious. What a ripoff!! I saw that in the Simpsons and it took 7 minutes for the whole thing AND it was funny. I also thought that the South Park spoof was cleverer and far better paced.Dave makes it passed Hal and can complete his mission. Apparently his mission is to go hurtling through space toward Jupiter while watching the predecessor to Laser Loggins goes disco. There's some psychedelic rays shooting at the astronaut for a long time. Eventually he ends up in a sterilized house where he's old. It's like a bad Neil Young song in slow-mo. Then there's a fetus floating in space. All this to the soundtrack of the most played out, obvious, annoying selections of art music. While there seem to be a lot of technically important advances in how this film was shot and quite a controversy over the meaning or intended meaning of the movie, none of that can help the fact that it is completely unfulfilling in almost every way. The people who praise it so much are narcissists who look to show off just how intelligent they are by coming up with some grand interpretation that's really more about making them appear smart than anything else. I love ""Dr. Strangelove..."" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" and other brilliant Kubrick films. This is NOT among them. 2001 should only make a top 250 films ever list if it involved candidates for Mystery Science Theatre 3000, except that the complete lack of dialog for the first 25 minutes would ruin even that.intermission--I'll do the rest of my complaining in the comment board.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
778,elgronko,Homer's Odyssey vs. Kubrick's Odyssey,10,8 February 2011,"Words can't do this film justice so I will skip the hyperbole about its brilliance. Reading the reviews on IMDb I've been drawn to a number of illuminating details, and would like to share something that I've noticed but not yet read in a peer review: the nomenclature of the film itself and one of its characters.If '2001: A Space Odyssey' is in part a nod to Homer's Odyssey then the name of Dave Bowman becomes interesting. At the end of Homer's epic poem Odysseus returns to Ithaca in disguise, and proves his worth to his unwitting wife Penelope by besting her suitors in an archery contest. Literally, he is the ""bow-man"".That's not all. Earlier on in the tale Odysseus blinds the cyclops Polyphemus, causing the monster to shout, ""No man is killing me"" - ""No man"" being the false name that Odysseus initially gave him. Odysseus's most celebrated quality among his people was his ""metis"", or ""cunning intelligence"" - a quality that Dr. Bowman (or ""No man"") proves in his victorious battle with the cyclops HAL.An interesting link.I'd also like to respond to a couple of commentators here who see this section of the movie as a mere tangent to the storyline. I disagree; I think this section ties neatly with the Dawn Of Man episode, in that the central character progresses to the next stage of its evolution through the act of killing - not for pleasure or gain, but for survival. Like the groups of apes, like Polyphemus and Odysseus, HAL and Dave are locked in a battle for life itself, surrounded by a vast arid wasteland, and only two outcomes are possible: evolution or oblivion.This ambivalent attitude to violence, which borders on tacit approval, is an interesting quality of the film.I'd like to say one final thing. The appearance of the ""Star Child"" is the single most phenomenal thing I have ever seen on film, and it's a testament to Kubrick's brilliance that he produced an ending that so defied the expectations of everyone (even his co-writer!) that each viewer has been forced to think about what this ending, this movie, and this subjective existence means to them.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
779,TwiZone,This film is unlike anything I've ever seen,10,19 February 2013,"I watched this film for the first time a few days ago, and after the impact it has made on me, I felt compelled to do a review. What can I say about this movie? The music, visuals, and imagery are just perfect, (not to mention the chilling HAL 9000).The visuals is the best aspect of the film. From the tranquil view of outer space, Planet Earth, the spaceship, the planets and the psychedelic colours towards the end, this really is visual film-making at its best, and it's mind-blowing, considering it was done in 1968! I still wonder how the team behind the visuals did those effects they're that good!! It's a shame that the original Star Wars films always comes to people's minds when thinking about great visuals that came out a few decades ago, when in fact 2001: A Space Odyssey really should get the credit in my opinion, especially considering it came out 9 years before the first Star Wars film. The music is also wonderful, creating a chilling, eerie and sometimes unsettling atmosphere to the film. It truly fits with the very serious tone of this film.More can be said about this film, but I don't want to reveal too much information, so watch it with no interruptions or distractions, and just absorb everything that is shown in the film and enjoy it.Unfortunately, as much as I love this film, I feel that it is not for everyone, as some people might get a little bit confused or even bored by the film, but, this is a film that doesn't have a coherent and easy- to-understand storyline that everyone can grasp, and it's not meant to, as Kubrick wants the viewer to think and contemplate on what he sees, and to come to his own interpretation of the film. In my opinion, the ambiguity and cryptic nature of the film makes it fascinating to watch. If you keep this in mind, I hope you will enjoy the movie immensely, as I did!After watching this film and really thinking on it, this is my No. 1 favourite movie of all time.

The special effects in it were groundbreaking for the day and are still impressive even now. The combination of visuals with music works just as beautifully now as it always has.However, I have heard people call this the greatest sci-fi film ever. I have heard people call this one of the most thought provoking films ever. I have heard people complain about modern films for having nothing to them beyond special effects, but then praise 2001.The film is overrated. If you really look at it, you'll realise that the film does not really raise any deep thought-provoking issues, it simply suffers from a almost non-existent narrative. If you read the book this will become very clear to you. It was originally considered to include a narration over the top of the film.For this reason and the fact that there is little to no character development, this cannot be called the greatest sci-fi film ever and it is outmatched by masterpieces like Blade Runner or Brazil. Even David Lynch's Dune could be considered superior, as it succeeds in many of the areas where 2001 fails.That said, it is still a bloody good film and a visual masterpiece.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The only reason I give it a half decent rating is for the special effects (must have been amazing to 1968 audiences) and the cinematography. The story is non existent and the acting nothing special.It was impossible to feel any attachment or empathy for the characters as everything is so clinical and cold. Maybe that was Kubrick's intention and if so then hey he succeeded with me at any rate. The HAL storyline could have been even better but at least there was some semblance of a story to that bit.

786,HAL9000-16,The Greatest Motion Picture of All Time,10,12 June 1999,"This is it. This is the best film of all time. (With The Godfather coming in at a distant second) The art direction, set design, sound quality, cinematography, and visually stunning special effects are all flawlessly perfect.2001: A Space Odyssey, is nothing shy of a miraculous movie. It is the only film to explore certain areas that no other film director has even attempted. The main theme of this film explores the knowledge of mankind from the past 4 million years, and through certain symbolic objects in the film, such as the flying bone, the monolith, and the star child, which all display what man has discovered about his universe.I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film (even the credits), but the greatest parts were during the second half of this film, which involve the American spacecraft Discovery I, on its way to Jupiter to trace a signal made by this mysterious extra terrestrial monolith. Astronauts Keir Dullea, and Gary Lockwood, have it out with the HAL 9000 computer who controls the ship, when he has a mental breakdown. To this day I agree with the late Gene Siskel who said that HAL 9000 was the best villainous character in film history. Doug Rain's slow, calm, and monotonous voice make HAL the most intriguing character in this film. The scene where HAL refuses to let Keir Dullea re-enter the ship for fear of being shut down, is my favorite scene in film history, because it clearly shows the rivalry of computers and mankind.It took several viewings of 2001 before I fully understood and appreciated this film, but for a movie this good it was well worth it. It is one of the few films I can watch 100 times and never ever get sick of it. I loved this film so much that I own the box set for it, and I'm amazed how well 2001 has stood up over time even after 30 years. There are only a few other films that I would consider to be on the same level as 2001, such as some of my other all time favorite films. (The Godfather, Star Wars, Amadeus Saving Private Ryan) just to name a few. But excellent as those films are they still can't compare to such a visual masterpiece like 2001.After such a colossal amount of praise, I can't even go into the complex but extremely fastinating plot. If there was only one film that truly deserved a 5-star rating this would be it. It is a film that every person should see because this is the most unique film that has been created or will be created. A one of a kind must see masterpiece.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

However, after I watched a couple more times, I realized what this film was all about, and soon I became so fascinated by it that I couldn't stop watching it, and now the film ranks at #1 on my top 50 films list. (with The Godfather, and Star Wars as the next two).2001: A Space Odyssey is perfectly made in every aspect, but the best parts of this film are the HAL-9000 scenes, which make the film what it is. Several people were quite baffled by this film. But I believe that it is about many different themes, such as man's evolution, technology, knowledge, destiny, and man's ultimate struggle with computers. All of these themes are beautifully and brilliantly tied together to make this spectacular motion picture. The best thing about this film is the way it leaves such a mystery behind allowing the veiwer to figure out what it all means.For those you who have not seen 2001. I very strongly recommend it, and for those of you who have seen it and hate it I strongly recommend seeing it again because this has to be the most uniquely brilliant film ever to be created.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
788,Antithesys,Amazing...too amazing,9,9 September 2000,"Me and a couple of friends rented A Space Odyssey in the spring of 2000 and watched it for the first time. As Gen-Yers we'd been raised to believe that science fiction and action go hand in hand. They hated this movie; to them it was terribly boring and meaningless. I looked a bit deeper and I think I understood what Clarke and Kubrick were trying to say: that humanity as a whole is only just beginning to crawl out of its infancy; that to understand the nature of the Universe we must first learn to understand ourselves; and perhaps the most important lesson of all - supercomputers can read lips. This certainly is not a conventional movie. It is a grand experiment to show how much can be said through vision. If a picture is worth a thousand words, 2001 is worth a googolplex. That's what makes this movie a classic. All the images that aren't tainted by our primitive language but speak on a much higher level: the ancient monolith on Earth, the circular interior of the ship, the Star Child...these images don't need voice-overs or explanations or subtitles; there are no words to adequately describe them. The only language we have that even comes close to describing this film is Music. 2001 has plenty of music, great music, lots of astonishing images, and virtually no dialogue. It doesn't tell you what it is about...it makes you figure it out for yourself. That's why this is among the greatest films ever made.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

790,wawain,"A film for introspective, silent audiences",10,6 February 2001,"A most arresting moment in this film occurs at the jump-cut from the floating bone to the floating satellite. It is the type of powerful juxtaposition that can be done only in the motion pictures.For me, watching 2001 is similar to holding your breath and trying to observe yourself in relation to your world.I think one message of the movie is that human ego, due to the lack of foresight, has been developed prematurely.This film, made with such deliberateness and precision, tries not to opine explicitly anything about humans or the rest of the universe. It is an inert presentation laid out continuously enough to inspire the human imagination to tell a story easily, but sparsely enough to allow many stories to be told, consistent with the images and sounds. I think this is the spirit of the scientific method: what story fits the observations? No matter how clever a particular story may be, however, sometimes the most honest statement one can say about a mystery is the statement of the mystery itself.I think, many aspects of this movie, including the 'plot', editing, and...the ineffable style, are original to this day. Also I am beginning to think that, unfortunately, '2001: A Space Oyssesy' is the only science-fiction film; other movies are at most ordinary dramas with science fiction elements.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
791,wawain,misunderstood (SPOILERS),10,3 April 2004,"Stanley Kubrick liked the idea that reality is ultimately ambiguous. When you see someone do something but doesn't say anything, you can only speculate why that person did it. Even if the person tries to explain why, the explanation might be incomplete, might not capture the entire essence of the moment. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick's thesis is that the events you're seeing on the screen are related to each other, and that Kubrick probably has a definite interpretation of them, but he's still not going to tell you his interpretation, because it would undermine the reality shown on the film.Some people say there is very little plot. Let's walk through the 'The Dawn of Man' sequence. We see some apes, presumably our evolutionary ancestors, barely subsisting on some barren wasteland (Africa?). We see that they're vegetarian and that they coexist with some pig creatures. We see them organized in clans and conducting yelling contests for control over a precious pond of water. Not only are the food/water scarce, there are vicious predators to constantly worry about. Then one day they see a strange foreign object. They're at first afraid of it, but gradually they become drawn to it, as if it is subconsciously communicating to them. At the same time the sun and the moon become aligned, suggesting that the object is extraterrestrial. Shortly after this incident, one of the apes discovers that a leg bone can be used to kill the pig creatures, thereby affording a new source of food. This is quite a big mental leap for an ape, so presumably the extraterrestrial object somehow made the apes smarter. We see the apes turn from vegetarians to omnivores. They all have plenty to eat now and they've taught each other how to use bones as weapons. We now return to the two tribes bickering at the water hole again, but this time one tribe is equipped. The more powerful tribe decides to use their power to kill the leader of the weaker tribe. So while the weapons help the apes survive in this harsh environment, they also allow the possibility of war amongst themselves. And so this state of growing technology continues, to this day.
Judging from the above paragraph, I don't know about you, but it seemed like Kubrick definitely had a story to tell. His way of telling it is to juxtapose related events, and it is not difficult to guess what the relationship could be (at least not for 2001:A Space Odyssey). But it does require speculation, and to allow the viewer the time needed to become inspired to speculate, the film must run at a slower pace than is normally expected in other movies. Often if we watch a lot of a certain kind of movie, we tend to see their similarities and tend to expect to see these characteristics when we watch new movies. For example, the vast majority of movies contain lots of dialogue that directly reveal the plot, so we expect this sort of thing when we watch a new movie. In addition, we tend to compare the movies using these similarities as criteria; for example, we evaluate the quality of the dialogue and how cleverly it is used to drive the plot. But these evaluations are based on the assumption that our preconceived expectations are not only the norm, but in fact the way things *should* be. I disagree with this assumption, and my unqualified enjoyment of 2001: A Space Odyssey is proof of this.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Never in a film the scenes are so powerful . The directing is visionary , magnificent and grandiose .

794,cjwynes,A Complete Waste of Time,3,2 August 2001,"This is one of those films that a lot of people claim to like.  So I was incredibly surprised how terrible it was, especially since I usually enjoy Kubrick films.The film begins with a 15 minute intro sequence picturing apes at the ""dawn of man.""  It lasts only 15 minutes, but feels like an hour.  For plot, the apes are visited by a large black monolith which appears one morning amidst their tribe and somehow sparks evolutionary developments in the monkeys. This is followed and preceded by meaningless time-killing ape scenes.Skip ahead to the year 2001, where another large black monolith has appeared on the moon. (IIRC, this film was originally a short story entitled ""The Sentinel"", so I suppose the monolith was meant to mark humankind's progress.)  The black stone sends a signal out into space, so a mission to investigate Jupiter (presumably the destination of the signal) is launched.The third part of the film then begins, as the astronauts depart for Jupiter.  This is the part of the film familiar to those of us who hadn't seen it, featuring the supercomputer HAL and his descent into evil.  This is really the only redeeming part of the film, it's too bad the rest of the film wasn't like this.  The scene where the astronauts are discussing the disassembly of HAL in supposed privacy, and we then see HAL reading their lips, is very eerie and quite chilling.Unfortunately, the film goes totally off the wall when the mission arrives at its target.  A strange and seemingly pointless barrage of flashing streams of color start flying across the screen, broken only occasionally by the remaining astronaut's frightened face.  After about 10 minutes (I'm not kidding, it's that long) we see the astronaut in some strange place, which the film implies is somehow outside of time, where he ages and dies over a few minutes.  Then, cue the space baby...roll credits.Considering that a lot of people on this site can't even understand the very simple ending of the new Planet of the Apes movie, I can't understand why this film managed to get such good marks.  Even the people I know who claim to like this film always seem to dodge the question when I ask them to explain this movie.  The few good points are: the apes' first post-monolith change is discovering the use of weapons (a relevant commentary on humanity), and the soundless nature of space (nothing bothers me more than hearing explosions in the vacuum of space.)  Other than a few good moments, this film is entirely rubbish.  Please DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, YOU WILL REGRET IT!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
795,Neal Wruck,A movie that is not for idiots. I'll explain why.,10,22 September 2001,"As I read all the negative reviews for 2001: A Space Odyssey (On Amazon. Com), I begin to wonder as to what kind of morons people can be today. In today's society, an acceptable film has to be fast paced and highly entertaining (Just look at the Oscar results of the past five years). They don't have to have a plot or a purpose. But it was the reviewer on Amazon who said he was happy that Stanley Kubrick was dead that really got me mad.The day that Kubrick died was a dark one for American cinema. Few directors alive today have the guts to try something new and imaginative. It's all sequels to hit movies (American Pie 2, Rush Hour 2, Jurassic Park 3) or remakes of old classics (Planet Of The Apes). 2001 was bold. It was a challenge. It was something new. It defied every set standard of Science Fiction films, from its unconventional narrative to its use of classical music. It showed that you do not need to have lots of dialogue to express ideas or emotions. Images can be just as powerful. And 2001 is unthinkable today without the power and excitement of Thus Spoke Zarathustra or the waltzes of Strauss The Blue Danube. 2001 critics also say that the humans are boring and `By the Book', while HAL the computer is sympathetic and interesting. That was Kubrick's purpose: The mechanizing of the human and the humanization of the machine (Another example would be the two airplanes in the opening of Dr. Strangelove).I have also read reviews of people who claim the movie is boring and complain that scenes take too long. Without the Dawn of Man ape scenes, would you really know what the hell was going on? It would start suddenly with a ship in space. It would still be, in your words, Lame! The docking scenes take five to ten minutes because that is how long it takes to dock a ship! It is not like in Armageddon or Star Wars where it takes just a second. These men are professional airline (Or spaceline?) pilots who are also carrying a cargo of passengers. They sure are not going to risk their lives just to arrive on time. Things are also slow moving in space because of gravitational forces and because it is a sterile and empty environment.Other morons also talk about how Boring the Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite scenes are and how pointless they are. The Star Gate Dave Bowman goes through is the Grand Central Station of the aliens (A highway you could say). The room he ends up in is a `Zoo' where extra-terrestrial `Zoo Keepers' study him and the way he acts in his natural habitat. The monolith there changes him from a young adult Bowman to a middle aged Bowman to an old, dying Bowman and finally into the Star Child. It is only boring if you think its boring.Some morons also don't know what the monoliths are about. In the beginning, the monolith is a teacher to the apes that causes them to evolve into humans. The monolith on the moon is a beacon. It sends a radio message to the extra-terrestrials on Jupiter telling them that the human race has advanced into outer space. The one floating in Jupiter space is the passageway to the Star Gate and I have explained the one in the room. We also never see the extra-terrestrials at all throughout the movie (We can however hear them in the room). Thus we have a greater fear of them because we do not know how they act or what they look like.My final thought is that if you have a short attention span or if you thought Citizen Kane was worse than Battlefield Earth, you should stick to Star Wars (Though I did like it) and a stupid Bruickheimer/Bay movie for your entertainment. 2001 is certainly one of the greatest movie experiences of all time and also shows that cinema can be one of the most powerful forms of art and can be utilized for other purposes besides showing people getting shot in the head or fornicating. It is also a reminder that Hollywood's future is always better than the real future.

It's a very slow-burn, and while I like movies like that, others won't and herald it as boring. I have to disagree of course, but I can see how it can be considered tedious to sit through.

798,aero-windwalker,"A mockery of the notion to cherish humanity, and an encouragement to the human altruism to embrace the end of an era and welcome the new intelligence.",8,21 February 2015,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a neocreationist scientific fictional movie from 1968. I have recently watched this movie again after last time when I was perhaps five. Overall, I give the movie eight out of ten as of the standard in 2015. So let's jump into the details.First, I like to talk about the cons of the movie. The movie features no Asian or Black actors or actresses. It may be appropriate and convincing in 1968, but certainly not today in 2015. Due to the lack of diversity, the setup of the movie seems more like a funny space sitcom rather than a futuristic exploration. Perhaps due to propaganda purpose, the US and English language are featured dominantly throughout the movie. Examples include the boarding check features a list of languages with English on top, but excluding some of the most populated languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Russian. The lack of diversity in the space and the ideology of the predominant role of the US in the space exploration era shows arrogance and ignorance of the filmmakers, therefore discredited the believability of the realism in the movie. The slow pace and the long pauses in the movie certainly do not seem poetic in 2015, but rather seem idiotic and pretentious. This is why the movie lost two points.Now, let's talk about pros. The movie is very realistic. It carefully portrayed the behaviors of apes and the lifestyle in space, although from time to time, there were amusing mistakes, such as the space pilot took over the plate by holding the bottom with one hand and to prevent it from dropping while using another hand to pull it over in zero gravity. The movie is actually profound, while it does try too hard and became pretentious. It depicts the beginning and the end of the humanity, and points out what made humanity rise, and why humanity is no longer fitting for a space era. A type of black monolith is prominently featured as an indication of higher intelligence's influence in humanity's evolution – presumably throughout the history, but the movie only showed or mentioned it appeared on earth (likely Africa based on the landscape), moon, a moon surrounding Jupiter, and a symbolic world. This black monolith is a physical symbol that indicates a significant step in the evolution process of intelligence from solar system. The beginning of the movie shows apes' discovery of using bones as weapons following the sudden existence of the black monolith from of the void. Later the black monolith was discovered on moon indicating humanity's ability in space travel. The black monolith on the moon surrounding Jupiter indicates humanity's ability in creating superior life form, the computers. And then the movie uses most of its time to explain why computers are a superior life form and why humanity is no longer fitting for the space era. For example, it uses slow pace to show how difficult it is for human to operate in the space, and how inefficient the way human works. The doctor who was visiting the moon from Jupiter exploration must verify his identity before boarding, and then he must play the role of father to video chat with his daughter, and reminding her daughter to tell his wife that he called. These two actions indicate that human needs constant verifications in order to maintain trusty relationships. Later the doctor meets his fellows and discusses his journey, while he refused to reveal any information. This indicates most of the time human communications are merely waste of time. Then due to the fear of social impact, the doctor reveals that the discovery of monolith must remain a secret. This indicates the fragile of human social structure. Such list can go on and on, and as a result, an artificial intelligent (named Hal) on the exploring ship to Jupiter decided to murder all on board members. This can be seen as a significant evolution step for intelligence in solar system. The AI revealed its despise to humanity when it commented that all mistakes were a result of human errors while inserting such comment in a mellow conversation, which shows its greater ability in giving overtone in the sentences, an indication of AI's higher creativity. The AI gave the final punch to indicate that human cannot even survive in the space without a space helmet.Of course the movie shows how the astronaut fights his way back to control room and removed chips of the on-board computer and eliminated the threat post by the AI. And then the astronaut had strange visions showing electronic art and then seeing himself getting older and finally on his dead bed, he saw the black monolith once again, and he became an infant flowing in the space overseeing the earth. All of the above scenes since the astronaut fights his way back into the spaceship should be understood as the visual presentation of the denial thinking that humanity will last, and is the terminal species in evolution. The implication here is that, the astronaut died in the space, and a new child of intelligence is born, that the AI has reached a new step in the process of evolution, overseeing the dead bed of humanity, the earth.The movie overall shows the ideology of neocreationism, that the creator of humanity may or may not be the creator of the universe. It could merely be a mysterious being. More importantly, humanity isn't a very special creation of such being. It can be, for instance in this movie, a biological bootloader of software based intelligence, a superior and more space fitting life form. The movie is a mockery of the notion to cherish humanity, and an encouragement to the human altruism to embrace the end of an era and welcome the new intelligence.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

My opinion has not changed. I kept saying to the friend I was with ""Let's go!"" She just kept answering that something had to happen soon. After 25 minutes of watching apes jump around, it didn't matter what happened next. Not to mention the 10 minutes of space ship inspection, and that was just the outside. The movie had a message, which I do understand, but it didn't make up for the incredible monotony of the film. When something did happen, it was so minimal in comparison to the whole film that I couldn't even get interested. This is a film without any character to get interested in or like, no followable storyline, just a ho-hum message. Some good music, but I could hear better on the radio on NPR most Sunday mornings.

Why? Because so little happens and the movie lasts for two and a half hours while it could do with 15 minutes (which is the amount of time it takes to show a ship landing on the moon in this). There weren't even any real characters except HAL 9000. He was the only thing in the movie with personality and he was a computer and the antagonist. I don't see why I am supposed to care. Not to mention I had no idea what was going on in the last half hour. And while the effects hold up and the concept is fascinating the movie was never engaging or exciting in any way.

I'm lucky enough to have passed through several stages in my appreciation of this film. First time I saw it I thought it hopelessly overlong and as dull as ditch water. I'd heard good things, obviously, but it struck me as being images for the sake of it and a rather anaemic progression through a rather trivial plot. Subsequent viewings, however, slowly revealed those things that most of the reviews I had read had raved about. Even if the movie is not coupled with a reading of the novel (which, as we know, tells a similar but non-identical story), there is a plethora of detail that one encounter will not reveal, like the whole life-cycle/evolution thing, the attempt at objectification of the mystery of human spirituality and the importance of having a nice lunch; it's all there in glorious Cinerama.About a dozen viewings in, I watched it with my wife, who'd never seen it before and wasn't really in to the arty movie scene, and that gave me an opportunity to see it as the dated piece of 60's optimism it also always was, and that both cheered and amused me and I realised it was a movie that probably did have everything after all. I'm still happy to classify it as a true work of art, and not simply a technological marvel, though - its coverage of universal themes is unmatched in the sci-fi cannon, the soundtrack is awesome and I shall always be grateful that my wife forced me to have fantastic sex for three hours after I made her endure 'a really stupid film'.Extremely recommended.Hayfax_Jo",2001 - A Space Odyssey
809,EugeneOL,Brilliant,10,15 April 2020,"2001: A Space Odyssey is truly one for the ages. It explores the visual medium in such a creative and hypnotic way, all film lovers should be glad it even exists.The film is broken up into several acts. In the first, a tribe of prehistoric apes discovers a mysterious monolith, which we can already tell is truly out of this world. They are hesitant at first, but quickly find themselves enthralled by the wonder of this foreign object. I suppose one could say that many viewers have the same experience while watching the film; we don't really understand it, but are mysteriously captivated nonetheless. Like many things, this object is never clearly explained, but it seems to teach the tribe how to use bones as weapons.After this sequence, however, is where the film quickly gains its unique sense of identity. The use of in-universe sounds and dialogue are minimal, and several sequences are purely visual with Strauss' music playing in the background. It is slow, but intentionally so as befitting of a film about a journey in space.Eventually, the scientists discover an identical monolith to the ones that the prehistoric apes discovered. Throughout this entire sequence, as scientists are discovering a ""mysterious finding"", it is incredibly clear to the audience what this discovery is. Visually, Kubrick has allowed us to fill in the gaps of information while maintaining realism in the dialogue. Although not explicitly stated, it is heavily implied that the monolith inspires the invention of the HAL-9000 sentient supercomputers.In the next sequence, a team of astronauts are on a journey to Jupiter. Although nothing immediately seems amiss, there is a growing sense that something is off. The environment becomes even more unsettling as we sense the growing friction between the impossibly proud Hal and the wary astronauts. As the film cuts to an intermission, things are about to quickly spiral out of control for these astronauts.Many copies suffer from the unfortunate trend of impatience that has invaded Hollywood over time; the intermission is cut down to a minute or removed entirely. It is quite unfortunate that the content that Kubrick put out should be butchered so that people can get back to scrolling through Twitter a bit sooner. There is a certain beauty in intermissions; people can take a breath and reflect on what they had just witnessed. In the epic ""Seven Samurai"", I distinctly remember the intermission as an integral part of the experience, and I can say the same for ""2001"".The final hour of the film is all about losing one's limited grasp of reality: first the characters, then even the viewers themselves. Normally, I am very hesitant to get into films that become purely metaphorical, but it fits the context perfectly in this case. The mysteries of space aren't meant to be perfectly understood; as far as we know, they never will be.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
810,drn5,"My god, it's full of stars",10,20 April 2003,"For all those bewildered by the length and pace of this film (""like, why does he show spaceships docking for, like, 15 minutes?""), here's a word you might want to think about:Beauty. Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinemagoers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.   '2001' requires you to watch in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different KINDS of film, and to enjoy '2001' you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.

811,Obi-Wan-22,A story within a gallery of art,10,29 March 2002,"I don't usually write comments, but this movie made me think about it for so long that I had to share my views.First off, this is a fantastic film.  I love Stanley Kubrick's previous works and this is one of his best.  I was always astounded about how they did that.  I can't even see some of the stuff they did now it was so good.But there was more than that.  There was a story within a gallery of art that made me think two, three, four times before coming to a conclusion. If a movie can make you think about it for over a day than you know it's a classic.I was always trying to catch up with what was going on and I love it when a film can make me do that.  I always wanted to know what was behind that cliff, that moon, etc.  My heart was pounding all the time especially when Kubrick cleverly used only the oxygen tank and the man's breathing as sound. The movie was always one step ahead of me.I know I've rambled on, but I would like to close by saying that Star Wars is my favorite movie.  I like action, I like speed, and I like loud sound, but as they say: ""Opposites attract"" and this was the one that attracted me. This is one of the best movies of all time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This was many years ago, so I thought maybe I was too young (or tired) to ""get"" it. I saw it again. It was even more boring than I remembered! It´s OK to be artistic, but when a spaceship docks for 10 minutes to the tune of classical music, it just doesn´t work anymore. 2001 has some redeeming qualities, mostly in the whole ""HAL""-concept and sometimes the slow, artistic approach works, but they can´t save this film from dullness.

A film that is visually astounding and mentally thought-provoking. Now, I know that not everyone likes this film, but if you can have patience and I know that you have free time (Your on the Internet right now looking up 2001), then you should see 2001.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
815,bw92116,Masterful and influential epic film - and boring to those with inactive minds,10,27 November 2006,"Sadly it appears that younger generations of filmgoers don't appreciate this film. Having been raised on frenetic, action-packed ""science fiction"" films like the Star Wars and Matrix series, and having spent too much time immersed in the chaotic frenzy of video games, they finally sit down to ""2001"" and are bored and frustrated by it. Well, naturally, if you're used to films in which every three seconds there is a crash, a special effect, a sex joke, an explosion or a killing - then you attempt to watch a slow, ponderous film like ""2001"" you're going to get bored. For those people, this is an education in what cinema can be. Science fiction doesn't have to be horror, comedy or martial arts. It can be literature and philosophy. ""2001"" dares to ask meaningful questions of the viewer, for example, ""What is mankind's place and purpose in the universe?"" And it doesn't provide all the answers. It challenges the viewer to come up with his/her own answers. Other issues, such as man vs. machines of man's invention, and the possibility of higher ""intelligence"" than man existing, are also also addressed but not given pat or preachy answers. The ambiguity is part of the appeal of this film, in addition to the spectacular visuals. The slow pace and long scenes give the viewer a chance to digest and contemplate what he/she has just seen and heard, while the film is still in progress. The long scene of the spacewalk with the only sound being the astronaut's breathing is intended to make the viewer a little uncomfortable. The extended special effects sequence near the end is almost like taking a hallucinogenic drug, but without the need to actually take one. This film, like other wide-screen epics (Lawrence of Arabia et. al.) really needs to be seen in a theater with a large screen and good sound system, or at least on a large, high-quality video screen with good sound. I was lucky to get to see it at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood in 1973, and it was shown with an intermission - and the soundtrack included an ""overture"" which was played before the curtain even went up, and also at the end of the intermission, to help set the mood. Of course the cinematography is masterful - space travel never looked this elegant or beautiful, in any other film save possibly ""Apollo 13."" Beyond that, it is the intellectual challenge that the film presents to the viewer that makes this film so memorable.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
816,schmigrex,"My favorite movie -- courageous, delicate, crafted with care",10,8 August 2001,"I am very pleased to see that so many people don't like this movie.  A good movie is well-liked by many.  A great one takes chances, and generates deep admiration in some and frustration in others.  Sure, many in today's audiences will find this movie too slow and hard to understand.  That's how many found it in 1968, too!  (Ask anyone who was around.)  This isn't passive entertainment for the popcorn crowd, and if you think ""The Matrix"" is the apex of cinema, then maybe this will be too boring for you.  That's perfectly okay!  Kubrick made all of his films with meticulous attention to detail, and some with slow pacing that deliberately challenged movie house attention spans.  I have always thought his goal in doing this was to rip the audience out of their preconceptions of how a movie should work so they could see his films for what they were.  As for people that complain about this film being boring, slow, or obtuse; well, they should watch other movies.  But please, use the vitriol sparingly!  Many don't like Shakespeare, Van Gogh, Rachmaninoff, and e. e. cummings, but that doesn't mean they ""suck"" or produced ""crap.""  I love this movie because of its determination to tell its own story in its own way, without regard for convention, which is awfully nice for a change.  And to those who give up on this one after one viewing (especially if the one viewing is on video!), I can only encourage you to give it another try, and this time throw out your images of ""Star Wars"" and ""The Matrix"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" (all fine films) and give 2001 the attention it deserves.  And if you still don't like it, then that's cool too.  I like all kinds of movies, but this is the one that convinced me that movies were for grownups too, and that film is an art form that occasionally admits a view of genius.  I think I'll go watch it right now!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
817,Invariable Self,Religious themes pursued via science fiction.,10,6 September 2000,"Anyone familiar with the work of Arthur C. Clarke knows that his trademark is the intersection of science fiction and religious allegory.  Nothing shows this more than in ""2001:  A Space Odyssey"".  Actually, this film is not really science fiction at all but more entrenched in religious themes, especially those of the Middle-East (Judeao-Christianity and Islam).  This may in fact be the most religious film ever made.  If anything, it is essentially a scientific (or SF) exploration of Creation through to Revelation.  The symbols throughout the film are hard not to miss.  There is Dave the space pilot (king David, or possibly the Son of David, as Jesus is described in the New Testament).  There is HAL as the polite but super intelligent evil force that wants to prevent the final chapter of humanity's journey.  Indeed the film's main theme is shared with the theme of religion: birth, death and rebirth.  There is an unmistakable emphasis on birth and death in the film.  (A warning for those who have yet to experience the film for I am going to talk about some of the important scenes.)  Birthday's are mentioned at least three times officially and implied at other times.  We witness the birth (or Dawn) of humans, the birth of consciousness, the birth of technology.  In the scene with Haywood Floyd's daughter the talk is about missing her birthday party.   Frank calls home from the ship and his parents sing him happy birthday.  We even hear HAL talk about his ""birthday"" at the computer manufacturer on earth.  Along with all these mentions of birth are the ones of death.  HAL's death, Frank's death, the early man's (Cain and Abel?) death at the beginning of the film.  There are so many religious references they can't all be mentioned.  Thus, this is not a science fiction film and certainly not an action film.  It will bore the ""Star Wars"" crowd. Instead it is a beautifully filmed intellectual excursion into humanity's past and their proposed destiny.  The film's final conclusion on its theme is left up to the viewer.  It is infamously opaque at giving up its answers. After all, it is religious allegory yet with the famous Also Sprache Zarathustra score.  Thus, it is God and Nietzsche put together, neither one being known for their clarity.  Yet, it is in this way, that the film most mirrors the religious themes it analyzes.  We don't really know why we're here or what existence is about.  We have religion, philosophy, and science as resources, yet in the end, its all a big wonderful mystery that forces us to wait and see how it finishes.  ""2001"" asks us to take this patient and thought-filled journey to see how it might end.  However, it can never tell us the why, only the possibility of how we will get there.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Not since I decided to prepare for an upcoming semester by watching a College Algebra telecourse have I spent so much time staring at my television in utter bewilderment.  Spectacular visuals, stunning sets and locations, and perhaps the best movie soundtrack ever, but the story itself is almost lost in the process.  Entire plot could have been adequately covered in about 25 minutes.  LOOOOOOONG sequences with no dialogue make it hard to follow the storyline.  Beginning with a pre-historic version of ""West Side Story"", and concluding with a ""What the heck was that all about?"" dream (?) sequence, I have no idea what Kubrick was trying to say at the end.  Worth seeing just to know that this type of filmwork could be done in 1968, it is truly amazing what they accomplished without modern computers. Pity their predictions of the year 2001 were not more accurate in some respects (Video phones are commonplace, a base on the Moon, Jupiter having a solid surface, the survival of Pan-Am, etc.).",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Nonetheless, the movie was largely unwatchable: opening act was tolerable for a while, then got confusing. Second act was boring. Third act was the only redeeming part of the movie; I would trim the film down to just the part about Hal.

821,grrrr97,THE GREATEST LEAP FORWARD THE FILM WORLD HAS EVER EXPERIENCED.,10,24 January 2003,"I am quite possibly one of Mr Kubrick's most devoted fans, I think he is the best film director the world has ever seen, and this film was his finest work. Here is my opinion why..Visually 2001 has (for its time) the best special effects the film world has ever seen. It was (excuse the pun) an astronomical evolutionary jump forward, not only visually but also in way a film flows. It's totally unique; the use of music to propel the awe-inspiring plot and intellectual narrative is quite brilliant. Where as before music was mostly used to control the audience emotions.Some of the shots and camera work in this film are GENIUS. THE FAMOUS JUMP SHOT, the Leopard with the light reflecting off its retinas as it consumes a dead Zebra. The beautiful space scenes, coupled with just the right use of eerie/spectacular music send shivers of wonder and awe down the spine.The plot is a great one, I especially love the beginning and indeed the whole back bone of the story which suggests that we as a race did not come to be through just evolution or just divine intervention, BUT BOTH!!! This is the over riding plot in the film which comes to a conclusion in the end. But more on the end later.....HAL is strangely in my opinion the best character in the film. In that he is the most complex and is the hardest to understand. Did HAL ""EVOLVE"" into something more than a computer??? And therefore doesn't it seem normal that he would indeed try to protect himself against being shut down my Dave and the others???? I feel the whole story is a superb intellectual battle, between HAL and the humans (which is also a physical battle), HAL and himself (against his programming)......and most importantly the humans fighting with their inner beliefs as they start to gain an insight into where their past and indeed their future originated and originates.And now the ending, well Kubrick did say in interviews that I have heard that he didn't intend to puzzle people so much with the ending, its just the way it came across. But he was really very pleased that that's what happened. He never let on what he thought the ending meant (One of his prime principles in his films was to let the audience make up their own mind.) In my opinion its really quite simple and beautiful, Dave is transported though hyper space (either through mind or body, its a matter of opinion) then once their in this strange place in space or his mind, keeps seeing the black monolith and every time he touches it he seems to get older, then he finally ceases to hold a human from and his body dies of old age. Transporting him to a higher level of being.In short no film has made me think and indeed ponder as much as this one. The visuals, music, and narrative are the best I've ever seen. The only fault is the acting, there's nothing bad about it but there's also nothing great about it. Maybe Stan wanted that know who knows>THIS IS NOT A FILM ITS SOMETHING ELSE, SOMETHING WONDERFUL, THAT I DOUBT WILL EVER BE EXPERIENCED AGAIN.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
822,wmdude1255,What a movie should be,10,16 May 2010,"I loved this movie. It was a mix of good acting, philosophy, and special effects. There was no smoking, no sex, and maybe one or two scenes where they were drinking but you couldn't tell if it was water or alcohol. The questions it asked were fundamental. Kubrick Foreshadowed what has come to pass: Computers rule the world. He was asking that if it's bad with humans, imagine a computer that runs the world, makes a mistake and doesn't want to admit it's wrong?. It would be like living with an electronic Hitler. There was also no violence. This showed that a movie can entertain and not have any of that crap in it and the industry doesn't want to admit it. This one succeeded because it didn't pander to the young people but was aimed at adults.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Still, I knew I had seen something different...and very special.  You know a film is truly great by how many times you view it - only to want to see it again and again.  Considering the technology its day, nothing touches 2001 for its special effects.  No other film approaches it in terms of its boldness of ideas and presentation.  Like most Kubrickian works, the music seamlessly merges with the visuals to produce the highest standard of film viewing experience.  Centuries from now, when the first 100 years of film-making is remembered, 2001 will be at the top of every serious critics list as the most daring, inventive, philosophical, and intellectually satisfying film of our time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The dialogue, the adventures, the segments. This movie is just pure dramatic. It was also kind of strange that a very old man in the ""Jupiter and Beyond The Infinite"" segment turned into a baby in a ball at the very end. It was just so spectacular, you would want to watch it again and again. The special effects were also great as well.I thought the classical music pieces of the movie just matched up really well with the scenes of the movie. I also often like to play ""Echoes"" from Pink Floyd while watching the final segment (I happen to be a lover of audio/video combinations). You can try it too. IF you have the album Meddle from Pink Floyd as well as this movie, turn on the mute before you get to the Jupiter and Beyond The Infinite segment. Set up Meddle and set to track 6 ""Echoes"" and pause before the third ping, then press play when the screen title comes up to Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.For anyone (even if you're not a sci-fi fan), this is very highly recommended. My rating: 10/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

You're supposed to say you get it without it actually doing anything for you.Without a doubt, this had some amazing visuals for a film from 1968... But man... It's just boring.You'll have to sit through ""paintings"" on end for 25 minutes before anything story-related even happens. I don't know if it's just me, but I watch movies for the story.
And the story is good when something finally happens. But at the same time, it's constantly broken apart by insanely long transition scenes that does nothing but to just show yet another ""painting"".So I'm sure this is a masterpiece if you're the kind of person who can spend hours looking at a black dot on a white canvas.

The acting is just meh (5/10); the AI has more personality than the people (5/10).
The special effects are just amazing (10/10), but most shots are way too long even if they were/are really beautiful (6/10).
The sound effects are absolutely terrible from even before the start of the movie (1/10). Don't believe me? Watch/listen to the first 3 minutes.So, overall, I'd say this deserves a 5/10.Tip: For a better experience, unplug your headphones, set the volume to medium and be ready to abuse the '10-sec forward' button.

Sorry Stanley.  Even more sorry Arthur.That said, it did have Leonard Rossiter in it and South Park later did an amusing parody of Hal, so it can't be all that bad. Can it?Well yes.

829,nikolaiv85,Disappointed. Very.,3,5 April 2020,"To get straight, I know that age (when this movie was made) was space age, but this movie really lasts too long. And real story is too short. I know that ,in that time, was really great to simulate lot of things, really hard to make ships models, graphics and everything, but story is almost non - existent. And ""empty"" sequences are tooooo long. There are also some story goofs, but they are to be expected. First at all, Hall's problem is childish pride. That could be recognized before mission. And if point is human ignorance, ok. But, really, no-one thinking about such situation is big flaw. Also, crew choice of disconnecting it, is really stupid. Not because of Hall's reaction, because all computers make some errors, and no-one disconnecting them.Neither then, neither now. Also, they gave it too much power, and there is very hard way to override it. And if they wanted that, their only option was to do that in same moment. About ending... Really nothing interesting to me. Too long flashing images trip to that planet and to finish in that room. ""People, get to monolith so you can transcend""- for me that means- without any real conclusion. Without any real contact. One of the best SF movies ever?Overstatement.
This is kind of movie which is made to impress with tech and new ways of making movies and his real function was to open eyes toward space to common people.
In that way it was great success.I don't recommend this movie because people will get disappointed.
I know I am.
Before Jupiter, in name of history, I would give 5 or even 6, after watching it I would give 1.
But it was important step so I rate it more then one star.
In 1968. , I would give it 10/10 ,probably.
But now, I think I made mistake by watching it. I expected much more from ending. And I realized that influence from this movie is main reason why other SF writers make bad conclusions to great stories.
Too much power is in this movie name. Same like amount of power Hall had over human lives on that ship...",2001 - A Space Odyssey
830,pm_alan,Rough viewing....,6,28 March 2013,"One thing is certain, watching this movie is tough. There is SO much going on, so many things easily over looked. It's easy to see why so many dislike it and/or don't understand it. It's not so easy to see why anyone idolizes it, but I can. It contains some pretty amazing stuff. I completely agree with what one review said about saying that had I not known what year this movie was made, I would have not guessed correctly. My guess would have been along the lines of late 70's to early 80's, which alone says something about the movie. It definitely make you think as well.Negatives? Soundtrack is repetitive as hell. If anyone denies that then they're just lying. It gets annoying and takes some enjoyment out of the film. Some scenes ARE too dragged out. I'm not in any hurry when it comes to movies, but good lord. The final scenes.....whew....they will be talked about till the end of time, and for good reason. This was one of the unreasonably long scenes. It was almost torture. Maybe that's the way Kubrick meant to portray it, idk. I joked saying that the character in the movie was probably praying for death, and that the wrinkles were probably a result of unheard of boredom. The perfect word is ""assault"". The final scene is a relentless assault, and although amazing, it's excruciating at the same time. This movie is a remarkable thing, but I'm not sold on how great of a movie it is. It just doesn't have a lot of substance. People will disagree and say I just don't understand it, but it just drags...period.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
831,sanjulathish,Stanley Kubrick Hats OFF... Brilliant Just Brilliant!!,9,22 June 2017,"To create a movie of this level in 1968, he deserves special recognition. It is an great accomplishment. Arthur c Clark also deserves the credit. I have only seen 3 Kubrick movie but this one is the best for me. yes it took me more than a couple of stop-reverse- play scenes to understand the theme (as it did for interstellar, mulholland dr etc). Thought Nolan was a sci fi hero but this just changed my opinion slightly. This is the kind of movie that u should see and experience rather than read a review and skip it. i did it for couple of years until i finally saw it today. worth every minute spent on it. The BGM creates the kind of tension filled environment around you, like you are there in space. The Graphics in this was near perfect for that age, watching in 2017 didn't even cause any problems for me. If you are onto the sci-fi movies this is a must watch, no wonder Nolan was inspired by this.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
832,reddevil_42,A pioneering work of art,10,15 March 2013,"Arthur C. Clarke once said, ""If you understand '2001' completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered."" And boy does this movie evoke thought! This is definitely one my favourite all time movies and one I feel deserves to be rated higher than what it is right now. 2001ASO tracks certain events spread across time which are connected by mysterious appearances of a monolith. The movie is constituted of three different sequences: A look at early apes and some breakthrough moments in their evolution, Briefing at a space station and hushing up of a discovery on Moon, A manned spacecraft on course to Jupiter and the events on-board.Stanley Kubrick is a true visionary and his 2001ASO is a seminal work of art that paves way for more awe-inspiring works over the years in the Sci-Fi genre. For two and a half hours, Clarke and Kubrick manage to keep the viewer enraptured and in awe of the magical confluence of classical music and surrealist imagery on screen. The cinematography is brilliant (No wonder people were convinced of the Fake Moon Landing conspiracy theory) and visual effects in the movie are a treat for the senses,one that deserve to be appreciated all the more for the time this movie was made in. The space station scenes with bright closed spaces and high contrast sofas are very reminiscent of some of his other works, notably the Clockwork Orange. The credit for the amazing foresight and technological innovations shown in the movie must go to Arthur C. Clarke's vision. The space food, zero gravity toilet and other machines on board the spacecrafts are catered to with absolute attention to detail. Perhaps nobody uses music better in his movies than Kubrick and the use of the Blue Danube and Thus Spake Zarathustra help give a transcendental feel to the movie. The Blue Danube sequence is an exquisite one with the majestic soundtrack adding to every bit of it. In between, he makes you experience vicariously the eerie and haunting silence of space that keeps you on the edge of the seat. You get an idea of how lonely and insignificant one is in the vast nothingness. The breathing in the spacesuit being that one sign of life that keeps you hooked to what happens next. The movie does not feel rushed at any point and it's the music that plays the most important part in capturing the stillness in such an artistic manner. The dialogue, simple at all times, is engaging. The ominous ""foolproof and incapable of error"" declaration and the iconic ""I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that"" produce the effects of anticipation and shock ever so naturally. Finally, to the phantasmal (most fitting word) wormhole sequence and the ambiguous ending. While one can think of any number of interpretations, the one common element that probably connects them is a realization of the human race being on the edge of what is a vast ocean of knowledge that awaits us. We are just an insignificant and tiny part of the universe and the ending leaves us dreaming of the infinite possibilities that explain our existence in the larger scheme of things. There is no specific function that the monolith points to. It is the sum of all the uncertainties and the mysterious phenomenon that we fail to fathom.

833,OrionSiriusSagan,This movie is a hard sci-fi classic,10,27 March 2013,"I remember seeing this film a few times and it was excellent, I heard that Arthur C Clark wanted to get the science right as much as possible. I liked the beginning scene with the ape-like creatures who were or ancestors and how it was meant to relate to humanity and our eventual journey into space which is the staple of the film. I like how the Type III civilization sent a rectangular object to our Solar System to observe us as a Type 0 turning into a Type I civilization. I like the show don't tell aspects of the film. Hall turned out to be a villain and go amock. I like the ending part where the main character transcended as he went through strange rooms and grew old into this baby-like entity in a bubble-like structure. This movie was well-done.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
834,crazymanmichael,2001 in 2007,9,6 February 2007,"Back when I first saw 2001 on the big screen  more years ago than I'd care to think -- I thought it was the greatest movie ever made. It had it all, mystical theme, dazzling (for its day) special effects, cool technology, and Kubrick's trademark meticulous direction. I've probably seen it more times than any other film, and I usually managed to suck back a few tokes in time for the stargate sequence at the end. I've seen the sequel 2010, read Clarke's novel (and all of his sequels) as well as other books and essays that attempted to explain and/or expand on the movie's rather abstruse plot. But, it has been several years since I last saw it, so when I saw the re-release DVD on sale I picked it up and re-watched it again for the first time since the actual year 2001.Although after my numerous viewings the film couldn't contain any surprises it was still cool to watch it with fresh eyes. A few things struck me. For starters, I think the film has aged rather well. The special effects, stunning in their day, are rather commonplace now, but that's largely due to the influence of 2001 itself. Still, with one or two exceptions, they're still as good as many of the computer-generated effects of today, and in some cases, better.Second, I noticed for the first time that, perhaps because of the front-projection backdrops and rather stagy lighting in the ""dawn of man"" chapter, it had an eerie, almost CGI-like ambiance. It was almost as if the whole sequence was computer-generated, à la Final Fantasy. Interesting. And still, after all these years, the ape makeup is still pretty incredible, way better than Planet of the Apes, which snagged the Oscar for best makeup that year (some folks say it's because the Academy didn't realize the apes in 2001 were actually actors).Third, horribly stilted dialog. I'm surprised I never really noticed this before, but then, I probably wasn't watching it for the character development (see the toke comment above). Seen with 2007 eyes, the dialog had a distinctly ""60's"" feel to it, rather like the 50's dialog that was so well recreated in Good Night and Good Luck. People just talked differently then, although it's a difficult distinction to quantify. Still, given the fact that there's hardly any of it (the first actual words come some 20 minutes in), this didn't really detract from my enjoyment per se.Fourth, a few anachronisms. For example, Pan Am no longer exists; therefore the shuttle looks rather dated. Also, I'm willing to bet that, should Kubrick still be alive and working on 2001 today, he would likely be a lot more creative in depicting zero-gee. 2001 was the first sci-fi film to actually address the fact of weightlessness in space rather than simply ignoring it, but by the same token Kubrick in many scenes took the easy way out (vis, the ""grip shoes"" worn by the shuttle flight attendant), which, seen through 2007 eyes, looks a little cheesy. For example, why bother to climb or descend a ladder in zero-gee, when a little hop will get you there with a fraction of the effort? It was pretty obvious in some scenes (on the bridge and the pod deck, both of which were supposedly weightless areas of the ship) that Bowman and Poole were actually carrying weight. I also noticed, in most cases for the first time, many of the ""goofs"" listed here on IMDb. Perhaps with an additional 30 years of movie appreciation behind me, I am a little more observant.The stargate sequence: still not bad, although it probably could be dashed off today in a few hours using CGI, instead of the months it took Doug Trumbull to do it at the time using slit scan. I still really like the ""Jupiter space"" sequences. It has a wonderfully remote, alien vibe to it, especially the shots of this teeny-tiny spacecraft hovering in a void, dwarfed by the moons of Jupiter looming over it.And as for the ending, well, what can I say? Cool, but still completely incomprehensible (despite having read the book). All in all, although I would no longer call it my favorite film (I don't think I have a favorite any more, really) it still ranks up there with some of the greats, and it deserves a place in the IMDb top 250 if for no other reason than that it set the bar for all of the space movies that followed it, the Star Wars franchise, Close Encounters, the Alien trilogy, Star Trek, etc. etc. etc. It still, even after all these years, has one of the most ""technically accurate"" depictions of space travel of any of them. ...And it's kind of sad that even today, 6 years after the year 2001, we still don't really have bases on the moon, commercial space stations in orbit, or artificial intelligence.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
835,garfield2710,You could argue that this film was an accomplishment of special effects in 1968. So What?,4,28 June 2010,"Sure, the special effects of this movie were pretty good, even in the year 1968, but c'mon, what else is there to give it praise for? The movie was overlong, boring and made absolutely no sense. I didn't find myself caring for any of the characters, it was horribly directed by Stanley Kubrik and was a poor execution. Call me contemporary, but I like a film where there is a little dialogue, not a complete hour of total silence. I have lots of patience when it comes to film (I enjoyed Citizen Kane, Casablanca and There Will be Blood) but I found this film to be super overrated and shouldn't even be on IMDb's Top 250 List. The Even if they cut an hour, this movie would've and could've been way better. I also heard that Stanley Kubrik cut about 20-30 minutes to make the pacing faster. What pace? It took 2 and a half hours to tell an hour long story. I would sometimes fast forward and I would find that I missed nothing. You'll notice I didn't mention anything about the acting. That's because there was little acting. The only thing we see is actor's expression and small amount of dialogue. The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is for the HAL storyline. That is the only interesting part of the film. And if you're going to give this film a 10 simply because it has great special effects, then give a 10 to Avatar and Star Wars (OK Star Wars may deserve it, but you get the idea). This film proves that special effects cannot save a film that has horrible directing and a painfully slow story. If any, this is a film that is only for hard core Sci-Fi buffs. Anyone else will be bored completely out of there heads without a fast forward button handy.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

837,sam-019283472,Very disappointing,2,7 October 2018,"When I had the opportunity to watch this movie, I jumped at the opportunity since it has an exceptional reputation. But I found the movie thoroughly disappointing and I regret even watching it.One of the first things that stood out is the movie is extremely long and drawn out. Many scenes drag on showing boring unimportant details for ridiculous amounts of time.I was relieved when the long and boring introduction finished and the dialogue began. Unfortunately, the dialogue was short-lived and few and far between for the rest of the movie.I spent most of the movie straining to find an interesting, logical plot, but the plot was minimal and not engaging. Some aspects were also vague and disjointed. What little plot that was shown was drowned out in the boring filler content that comprised most of the movie.A number of the scenes depicting space-related concepts are interesting from a scientific point of view, in the same way that watching photos and videos released by NASA might be. But this isn't what I was looking for coming into the movie; I wanted something engaging and entertaining.Lastly, the ending of the movie was terrible. It was drawn out and over-the-top while also being extremely vague and confusing. Completely unsatisfying.I spent the entire movie waiting for it to ""start"" and get interesting, but it never did. Not recommended.In hindsight, I suspect the movie is popular because it was relevant and novel when it was released 50 years ago while also making a realistic depiction of some aspects of space.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
838,dandebs,"2001: An Ode to Stanley Kubrick, by Stanley Kubrick",2,1 September 2009,"It's utter sophomoric tripe. Kubrick thinks the audience are absolute idiots. He focuses on a thing - then on what it represents. then on the thing. then on what is represents, then on the thing. Repeat, ad nauseum. The man can't direct for toffee. Oh yes, the special effects are good, some of the ideas in the movie are good - but the movie fails because it is utterly boring, drowning in Kubrick's own self obsession. People go on and on about the technical minutiae - like that's genius - to show the boring bits everyone else edits out - BECAUSE THEY'RE BORING! 2001 is 20 minutes of a good film stretched out over 3 hours! I am an avid reader and watcher of sci-fi. I love the genre because it provokes you to think. This movie was not thought-provoking, but sleep inducing, and caused me not to ponder the human condition, but instead how Kubrick got away with producing the navel-gazing piece of self-adulation. It practically cries out ""look at me! look how clever I am! I can do things no one else does and get away with it because I am clever!"" (Seems he did get away with it with all the fawning adulation he's got over the years!)",2001 - A Space Odyssey
839,mk4,We've slipped back.,10,1 January 2001,"I was fortunate enough to see 2001 when I was 18, in 1968, many times at the Warner's Cinerama  and the Hollywood Cinerama Dome. There is absolutely no comparison in watching this history making film on a television monitor, even on DVD, after seeing it the way it was meant to be seen. Kubrick and Clark were visionaries, yes, but even they couldn't foresee the demise of PanAm , the Bell System, and even Cinerama itself. It's a pity that if and when 2001 is revived, it won't be able to be shown the way it was truly meant to be experienced. Thus perhaps silencing its critics who find it tedious and boring, and not ""action-packed"" like  the hokum that passes for science-fiction today. You cannot really attempt to capture the vastness and lonliness of space without a canvas like the Cinerama screen. Kubrick knew this. This film truly was ahead of its time. All other ""Space Opera"" epics are merely mannerist apings of  this one true classic. Space boring? Yes. And Kubrick captured it the monotony of space travel perfectly. In its setting, space travel has been perfected; it is safe, predictable, and matter-of-fact.  The edginess has been scrubbed away. That's why nothing much seems to happen much to the protagonists for much of the story.  Many talk about the character of Dr. Floyd being perfunctory  or unexciting. I find his character brilliiant. After working in the corporate ad agency world, and its world of corporate politics, for too many years, I find Dr. Floyd more remarkable upon each subsequent viewing;  He has been chosen to visit the moon armed with top-secret information about what we've discovered there. He will not divulge this secret with pesky Russians who inquire as to the goings-on at the Clavius crater;  he lives in the world of governmental and political duplicity...he is always ""on the road"" as any good company man would be, eschewing wife and family for ""duty."" His speeches are guarded, he says very little yet he is lauded as a great speaker by the people in the boardroom (who are encouraged to speak up by Dr. Floyd at the meeting but never do...sound familiar?...corporate insecurity is still a viable trait...even by 2001!). Dr. Floyd's matter-of-fact cat and mouse secrecy is one of the true delights of the film.  Worth noting also is when the scientists ""break training"" and attempt to indulge in a bit of whimsy by having their picture taken tourist-style in front of their discovery. It is then when the Monolith emits its high-pitched tone thus ruining the perfect photo-op. But I digress. The Wonders of The Future have brought us the Multiplex Theater and the Small Screen. This movie was made to be seen in Cinerama. Beautiful, optically sharp. And Vast.  And until its relentless critics can view it that way for themselves (which they just might find something akin to a religious experience), I'm afraid they just don't know what they're talking about.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
840,lot49,Being Stanley Kubrick,10,29 December 1999,"I first saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in the fall of 1968. I was fifteen years-old. This was only months after the deaths of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy. There had been a police riot at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Richard Nixon was about to be elected President of the United States. The Vietnam war seemed to be getting worse -- the year had opened with the infamous Tet Offensive.I needed an escape from the grim headlines. (The only good news seemed to be the NASA Apollo mission that would orbit the moon in December.) Oddly enough, the director of Dr. Strangelove would provide that escape in the form of 2001. (Thanks to my viewing of Dr. Strangelove four years earlier, I believed that I would eventually be incinerated in a nuclear war.)
I had read about Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail, but I still wondered why it had taken half a decade to produce this new movie. Entering the theater, I had great expectations, but I would not be disappointed by what I experienced that night.I got to see 2001 in the old Cinerama format which used three synchronized projectors to display the movie on a wide curved screen. The effect was less impressive than today's IMAX, but it DID make things larger than life. The special effects were impressive without detracting attention from the story. The idea of humans achieving a higher plane of existence intrigued me. I would ponder the philosophical and theological implications of that alien-assisted evolution for years to come.I emerged from the theater feeling profoundly optimistic even though I wasn't quite sure what I had experienced. It was as if I had seen and touched the black monolith.It may have been 1968, but, for the record, I was clean & sober. Whatever I felt was the effect of the film, not any foreign substances. In retrospect, I can say that I was happier than someone who had been John Malkovich for 15 minutes.A few months later, I read Arthur C. Clarke's ""The Sentinel"" because I was interested in the story that inspired the movie. Then, I borrowed a classmate's copy of Clarke's novelization.  I preferred the original short story. From that experience, I learned to avoid novels based upon screenplays.I've seen 2001 dozens of times since 1968. Three decades later, I can see the flaws in the ape suits. I can understand younger viewers' impatience with Kubrick's slow-but-deliberate pacing. I also admit that I do not always enjoy the film's score. I wish the DVD version could have offered Alex North's original score as an alternative. (I suspect there are legal issues preventing this.) However, I still believe that this is Kubrick's masterpiece.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
841,billreynolds,as beautiful and boring as an actual space flight,5,6 July 2005,"2001 opens with perhaps the most impressive title sequence ever filmed. Notably, only one person is credited at the opening -- you guessed it, Stanley Kubrick. The use of Thus Spoke Zarathustra is brilliant and really impressive -- one of the iconic moments in film history. No one will ever forget that sequence.Then comes the Dawn of Man. The apes were clearly mimes in costume. Still, Kubrick and his crew did an excellent job of somehow back- or front- projecting the African vistas into these scenes. The God-like intervention of the monolith in human evolution is the entire concept of the story, and I found it most effective in this opening sequence. The use of Ligeti's musique concrete is very effective here.Then comes the space travel to the orbiting station and the moon. This is a little slow, but the effects here were very beautifully done. I love the shot where you see the shuttle ""falling"" through the void of space toward the station. I don't believe these effects have ever been improved upon -- or ever will be.I must say, though, that I find it very irritating when filmmakers greatly overestimate the amount of technological advancement that will occur in the near future. It was obvious to anyone in 1968 that almost none of what is presented in this film was going to exist in 2001, much less in 2101. Massive orbiting space stations, huge moon bases, commercial space travel? Come on. Similarly, LA will not have 500-story skyscrapers and flying police vehicles in 2019 (Blade Runner), nor will we have cars driving on vertical highways in 2054 (Minority Report). These ridiculous predictions are even more irritating in the so-called ""hard"" science fiction movies like 2001, where Kubrick so obviously and pompously believed he was being scientifically accurate to the last detail.The character of Dr. Floyd (and his fellow scientists on the moon) is almost unbelievably dull and uninteresting (while seeming smug at the same time). Still, there is some real mystery and suspense as they investigate the monolith on the moon.Then we cut to the Discovery mission to Jupiter. The centrifuge is possibly the most remarkable set ever used in a film, and Kubrick filmed it remarkably. The background on the mission is conveyed in the most pedestrian way possible -- the astronauts listen to an interview they gave to the BBC. Then, suddenly a story that, while slow, has been focused on an interesting subject (discovering the purpose and meanings of the monoliths) gets hijacked by an incredibly tedious and drawn-out conflict between the astronauts and HAL the computer. Basically, HAL the supposedly perfect computer malfunctions and becomes homicidal for no conceivable reason and the two astronauts act incredibly slowly, moronically, and emotionlessly to try to stop him. The space walk/pod sequences are so ludicrously drawn out (and totally lacking in the visual beauty of many of the earlier effects sequences) that I had to fast forward through them. Hal locks Dave out of the ship, but he manages to get back in pretty easily (and why exactly did he not put his helmet on before going out in the pod in the first place?) This extreme detour into the HAL conflict (which I realize many people find the ONLY interesting part of the movie) kills most of the suspense and interest. Then comes the absurd Stargate sequence, the only effects in the movie that are really dated. The ""slitscan"" stuff looks like your average screensaver, and the rest is obviously landscapes from the Southwestern U.S. exposed with extreme purple and orange tints. The transformation of Dave into some mammoth, space-traveling fetus at the end is perhaps the most unintentionally funny thing I have ever seen in a movie.This is the only movie that Kubrick ever made that was not based on a previously published novel. Arthur C. Clarke's brief, almost plot less short story ""The Sentinel"" was the basis for this movie, and clearly not enough effort was made to develop the script here into more than a mere concept.George Lucas's first movie, THX 1138 (1971), was a similarly plot less, atmospheric sci-fi movie based on little more than a concept. After the failure of THX, Lucas set out to tell a warm, human story, and succeeded wildly with the low-budget classic American Graffiti. Then he had the best idea in movie history -- to take the brilliant special effects Kubrick had pioneered with 2001 and use them as part of a human adventure story with suspense, humor, and action. The result was of course Star Wars (1977), a movie you didn't have to be lying in the aisle stoned out of your mind to enjoy.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
842,js1artglam,CINERAMA !,10,30 August 2002,"I have seen this film about a dozen times in my life. Each time I see something new that makes me appreciate the genius of everyone who participated in its making.Most recently I had the thrilling experience of seeing ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" at the Uptown Theater in Washington DC - in full Cinerama. During the famous waltzing docking sequence, it was like being in space and seeing the space station with my own eyes. It literally made me vertiginous. The special effects in ""2001"" were created 34 years ago by craftsmen who filmed small physical models in a studio in England and actually made them look like gigantic objects in space. I will take that over lifeless CGI any day.Being able to see the tiny details in every frame was the best part of viewing the Cinerama print. After the scene where a primitive man uses a bone to kill another human (the first murder with a weapon?), he tosses the bone into the air, and a magnificent jump cut turns the bone into a satellite floating above the Earth. Brilliant enough. But this time, I noticed that the satellite has the star symbol of Communist China. Other satellites are shown, each with its own national symbol. They're not just satellites - they're orbiting WEAPONS.So basically, in the span of about 10 seconds of film, Kubrick has covered 3 million years of evolution.

There are just too many flaws (like the really bad cuts in the opening sunrise sequence) to call it great. The characters are unbelievably flat, the dialogue is no better than trite and the incredible adventure being shown on the screen elicits nothing more than controlled comment from robots. These are the same generation of astronauts, remember, who managed their way through Apollo 13.  Comparing the characters offered by the screenwriters makes painfully obvious how much of a cartoon we were offered in 2001. I'm sure the film hasn't changed, but I have.

The simple fact is that the film is strong in just about every respect.Why do I give this movie a 7 out of 10 instead of a higher rating? Really, it comes down to two main things: 1) not every movie can age perfectly. The excessive amount of time given to some of the cheesier elements of the space age technology takes away from this otherwise enjoyable movie. ""Cling shoes"", for example.2) personal preference.

850,coolmule,"Somewhat overrated - visually stunning and profound, but can be excruciatingly boring",7,23 July 2003,"*******some spoilers*******2001 is a movie which I have watched several times in my life, and each time I try harder to 'get' it. When I first saw it I was too young to understand the themes, and was bored to tears, mainly because I was comparing it to Star Wars. Viewing it as an adult has changed my opinion - it's a visually stunning movie, with very profound themes and a prophetic grasp of space technology. However, it is by no means the best sci-fi film ever, or Stanley Kubricks best film, and in truth has not aged particularly well. But enough about that just now. Whats good about the film?It boasts some of the most brilliantly composed shots I've ever seen, right from the beginning with the slow reveal of the Moon, the Earth and the Sun to the iconic strains of Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra. The zero gravity settings and the various methods used to combat the effects of zero-g enabled Kubrick to play lots of cool tricks with the camera with people walking upside down or seeming to walk on the ceiling. Then of course there's the famous cut from the ape throwing the bone in the air to the satellite floating in space - it's effect is somewhat lessened due to the fact that everyone knows about it now, but back in 1968 it must have been a startlingly original edit.The choice of music in the film is superb - probably the best collection of sourced classical music that exists. The music so perfectly fits each scene that you would think that each piece had been written especially for the film, rather than selected from a record collection. In particular, aside from the above mentioned Also Sprach Zarathustra, there's Khachaturyan's Gayne Ballet Suite, which perfectly conveys the crushing loneliness of space travel (and was of course lifted by James Horner for use in the Aliens soundtrack), and Ligeti's Requien for Soprano, which after the Ark of the Covenant theme in Raiders of the Lost Ark is probably the creepiest piece of music I have ever heard in a film. I could probably do without the Blue Danube, but that's just my personal opinion of that piece, and it does lend the shots of satellites circling the Earth an almost balletic quality.Arthur C Clarke's story is incredibly prophetic in it's grasp of developments in space technology, even if he was a bit too optimistic in the timescale within which he thought it could all be developed. Every ship looks like it could exist, and of course the film showed a lunar base a year before the first Apollo landing. This is all very much science heavy science fiction, rather than being a fantasy set in space a la Star Wars - the ships make no sound in the vacuum, unlike almost every other celluloid space ship. Clarke also of course predicts the development of Artificial Intelligence in HAL, and there are numerous other little touches of technological foresight - note what look like thin plasma screen TV's that the Astronauts watch the BBC broadcast on.The themes of the story are incredibly profound, dealing with the evolution of man, and can be debated endlessly. For instance, am I the only person who noticed the symmetry of the monolith giving the ape intelligence, which it then uses to commit murder, and the development of self awareness in HAL (presumably due again to the monolith), who then goes on to murder the crew of the Discovery?In addition, all the scenes with the apes are great - how would have thought to fill the first fifteen minutes of a sci-fi film with a short story about the family life of a group of early hominids? Also, Bowman shutting down HAL feels incredibly tragic, as the computer reverts to its 'childhood'. Of course, the infinitely weird ending can be puzzled over till the cows come home, but is again beautifully shot.Writing all this makes me think I've been unfair to 2001, but being objective about it, I must say that the film shows its age. No doubt the special effects were stunning in 1968, and in truth still look great today, but the endless shots of spacecraft floating at a snails pace through space just take forever, and become mind numbingly boring after only a few minutes. I am a University graduate and consider myself reasonably intelligent, and am quite prepared to commit my attention to films which don't feature endless action scenes, but it's very hard to appreciate the themes in 2001 when for long stretches of the film absolutely nothing seems to be happening. It's not artistic, it's just boring. And to be honest, the sequence when Bowman goes through the Stargate just smacks of the psychedelic hippiedom of the times the film was shot in, and again seems to take forever.Having said all this however, it must be acknowledged that 2001 is a groundbreaking film without which modern sci-fi films in all probability wouldn't exist, and probably deserves to be seen just for that reason alone.Rating - 7/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
851,dfw_txs,Very big let down,2,28 January 2006,"I bought this movie because ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", was one of the ""classics"" I had not yet seen. I had a brief prior understanding of the plot (the whole Hal thing), but was fairly in the dark about this movie. I was excited when I sat down to watch it.I can honestly say I gave this movie a shot, but for me, this movie was something akin to watching a plant grow for three hours. I am sure there are some that find this movie to be a masterpiece. But I have to believe for most of the public, this movie was almost intentionally boring.Now intellectuals will claim, ""You just don't understand the brilliance of 2001: A Space Odyssey"". Well I am hear to tell you it it has nothing to do with understanding...rather its about ""wanting to understand"". I have no interest in spending 3+ hours of my life being supremely bored, trying to analyze what Stanley Kubrick was trying to communicate 35+ years ago.The purpose of any movie is to entertain, and if after being entertained you can take away a deeper meaning in a movie, then all the better. But you first must have an entertainment value, which in my opinion this movie was devoid of.When I finally hit the stop button on this movie, I could not describe how let down I was. I am not into space movies all that much. Lasers, phasers and androids are not my thing. But one of my favorite movies was ""Alien"" - A slow paced movie that thrived into a classic because of the incredible suspense associated with it. There was a great payoff after the first hour of waiting.When I was in college, in my Literature class we used to sit around for hours discussing what the author (i.e Twain, Hemmingway, Poe, etc...) ""really meant"" in his book. I always used to suggest he meant what was written in his/her book, hence why he wrote it. I was usually dismissed as ""not getting it"" as others suggested some deeper meaning, something the author did not write, but somehow what he actually meant.OK, whatever. Everyone is different. Some people see 2001: A Space Odyssey as a masterpiece. I see it as an extremely over-hyped movie, the most boring movie I have ever seen and I will never watch again.And in the rare case this movie had some deeper meaning that Stanley Krubrick wanted you to find, I have to ask....Who Cares?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
852,sourav894,Beauty is the word,10,31 December 2010,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 science fiction film by Stanley Kubrick (who happens to be my favourite director as well). Being my favorite film, I have recommended this it to almost everyone I know. This review is more like an answer to those who found this film slow-paced, and for those yet to watch it, you may continue to read this as a disclaimer to the film- I'll give you a word- Beauty Beauty is an under-rated concept. Sure, you'll often see nice photography and so on in films. But when did you last see a film that contains beauty purely for the sake of it? There is a weird belief among cinema-goers that anything which is not plot or character related must be removed. This is depressing hogwash. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful sequence that has nothing to do with the film's plot. A director can show 15 minutes of spaceships for no reason than that they are beautiful, and it is neither illegal nor evil to do so.'2001′ requires you to watch it, in a different way than you normally watch films. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the be-all and end-all of everything. There are different kinds of film (this being the best of all), and to enjoy '2001′ you must tune your brain to a different wavelength and succumb to the pleasure of beauty, PURE beauty, unfettered by the banal conventions of everyday films.'2001′ is primarily a technical film. The reason it is slow, and filled with minute details because the aim was to realistically envision the future of technology (and the past, in the awe inspiring opening scenes including an amazing jump cut sequence). The film's greatest strength is in the details. Remember that when this film was made, man still hadn't made it out to the moon but there it is in 2001, and that's just the start of the journey. To create such an incredibly detailed vision of the future that 35 years later it is still the best we have is beyond belief – I still can't work out how some of the shots were done.The film uses invisible but powerful forces to manipulate the plot but perhaps the most overwhelming one is the picture's vision of man In Kubrick's fantasy, the Golden Age of man was a neglected instant between a man-ape's exaltation at discovering the first weapon and a nuclear-powered spaceship floating in a graceful orbit around the Earth. Man has indeed evolved As a spectacle ""2001″ assaults the mind, eye and ear, with stimulating images and suggestions. We are surrounded by a totally believable futuristic environment.The film is filled with brilliant sequences and extraordinary moments: The first interesting minutes in which the story of the apes is told visually, without a single line of dialog; the zero-gravity toilet with its great list of instructions; the stewardess defying gravity by walking the walls calmly upside down; the frightening moment when we realize that HAL is reading the astronauts lips; the magical alignments of Sun, Moon, and Earth; the ""Starchild"" returning home to charm the orb. ""2001″ is filled with poetic imagery: the view of the Sun rising over the Earth; the tossing of the bone into the air in slow motion; the slow images of the giant spaceship revolving in a cosmic ballet. ""2001″ is also a work of great visual acuity. It allows us to view more than the mystery of existence and destiny implicit in every man. Its end troubles many viewers as they demand clarity where there can only be mystery. They insist upon an answer where there can only be a question. Every viewer had a different explanation of the mysterious end of Kubrick's film. But for those who can accept mysticism, the climax is deeply moving.""2001″ is unique among films in content and scope. The cinematography is out-of-this-world, the special and visual effects are breathtaking, and the classical music is sublime. Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is art in the highest sense, like Leonardo da Vinci's ""Mona Lisa"", or Van Gogh's ""The Starry Night"". It is actually more than that!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
853,confrank,2001: A Space Odyssey: potentially one of the greatest cinema experiences you will ever have,10,26 May 2015,"2001: A Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick, is widely regarded as one of the greatest science fiction films ever created. 2 years ago, during my first viewing, I was dumbstruck by the idea. Here was a movie with little to no dialogue, shrouded in ambiguity and pacing comparable to watching grass grow. Having watched the film again, I can say that all of these comments still hold true. However, I can now say that these aspects of the film, and many more, are what in fact make this such a rewarding viewing. This is not just a film, but so much more. This is Kubrick's meticulously crafted work of art. So many movies rely on what they have to say in order to create the most effective and fulfilling experience for the audience. 2001 is the complete opposite, it's what isn't said that's the key. Kubrick's use of visuals and music to evoke desired feelings is a rare gift very few filmmakers are capable of. In his long docking shots, he uses just the right score to demonstrate its elegance like a slow, graceful dance. During times when the astronauts are outside in space, all we can hear is the sounds of their muffled heavy breathing, emphasizing man's vulnerability and creating a tense atmosphere where anything can go wrong at any moment. Using silence to create tension is also a very difficult task, but Kubrick's camera techniques and sudden cuts in the score make them equally spine tingling as the best of the thriller genre. The movie is broken down into 3 parts, each shedding light on man's slow evolution from mastering themselves, to mastering the earth, and finally, mastering space and beyond. While there can really be no concrete explanation for the events on screen, the visual splendour, juxtapositions, and symbolism paint a picture that can leave our imaginations running wild, while not being too confusing and bizarre. For those drawn to ambitious sci-fi films such as this, I would first recommend reading the novel in order to avoid being lost the entire time. The novel and movie couple well together since the movie provides the visual, musical and thematic experience while the book can provide very helpful explanations on plot points otherwise not mentioned. In the current movie industry, where big, loud blockbusters, sequels and remakes are dominant, films like 2001: A Space Odyssey demonstrate exactly what most of the new releases are lacking: originality, elegance, and boundary pushing film techniques. Stanley Kubrick attempted this in almost every film he created, with 2001 being his crowning achievement.FINAL VERDICT: While undeniably not for everyone, those that can appreciate a visually thrilling, beautifully scored and radically ambitious film will find 2001: A Space Odyssey to be one of the single greatest cinematic experiences of their lifetime.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
854,pylgrym,Where Was George Pal When We Needed Him?,5,2 February 2006,"Watch ""Destination Moon"", ""When Worlds Collide"", ""War of the Worlds"", ""Conquest of Space"", ""The Time Machine"" and you'll gain deep insight into the deranged genius of Stanley Kubrick. George Pal influenced ""2001"" in many, many ways. His space and disaster movies moved the Fifties like Stanley's moved the late Sixties. The dramatic paradigm and world-view shifts between the Pals and the Kubricks are a wonder to behold in hindsight....But I trow the PAL movies will be watched by more people for their deeper and more resonant, Christian themes long after the evolutionist, misanthropic, irony-drenched black comedies of Kubrick are shelved.... INCLUDING ""2001"" Yes, in light of the superior Pal space films, you may watch ""2001"" as a dark, ironic comedy, produced by a man so self-obsessed as to border on the megalomaniacal! Read the stories of folks who actually had to work with Stanley. Now compare the fan base of George Pal. Compare the outputs! Some of Stanley's movies are unwatchable today; the charming Puppetoons will never lose their luster.... but I digress. It will be enough just for you to watch ""Conquest of Space"" to see what I am talking about. Kubrick simply copied Pal with his own deviant, derivative drivel! He out-banals banal!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
855,moviebuff-tony,This is why I didn't like it..,2,12 November 2012,"I will be brief. Not only did it not make sense, unless I saw the wrong version then this movie was ridiculous. Look at the good reviews.. I bet they are all from old people (no offence) It's not that young people can't understand or appreciate this movie. an under 30 group who saw this with me agreed that it was nonsense.Of course, the plot sounds great, would make a great modern movie but it was too fantistical and weird.Especially with the monkey thing at the beginning ??Of course the ending made no sense what so ever. And you would only understand why they where heading to the monoliths location by reading the movie description which I think many would agree is not good.Lastly I would say that it was a waste of my time. and Look at my watch list if you think I enjoy rubbish techno-crap movies. All of the movies are 7 and above..It actually frustrates me a little bit that I wasted 2 hours on this film. Unbelievable actually.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
856,raghulfire-400-274241,Thought Provoking · Powerful Visuals · Great Special Effects · Intelligent · Imaginative · Gorgeous Visuals · Surreal · Timeless · Epic · Must Watch,10,11 March 2021,"This film is a visual masterpiece of ingenuity, technical superiority and amazing special effects without the use of CGI or computer graphics!
It was made in 1968 in the MGM studios, Borehamwood, Herts, and I consider it the greatest space exploration cinematic film ever made. It even surpasses 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar' which were made 50 years later and had CGI computer graphics to enhance their cinematography!.
The music of 'The Blue Danube' by Strauss is captivating as you see them hurtling through space and spinning on their axis to the music!
The existence of a computer on board named HAL is awesome and it controls everything in the spacecraft and also talks to the crew and monitors their every move. The climax is incredible when they try to switch of HAL and it knows what is happening so prevents it being shut down and immobilized.
The crew eventually override HAL and manage to shut it down by going deep into the labyrinth of the ships service tunnels containing the myriad of computer memory discs which they disconnect and close HAL down.
The visual special effects are stunning and the voyage to Jupiter through the vast vacuum of space is a spectacular array of visual and colourful superior imagery.
In conclusion this film is the greatest space exploration movie ever made!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
857,criztu,awful,2,25 November 2006,"This is an awful movie. It starts with two gangs of silly people dressed up as monkeys fighting each other. One morning they see a dark boulder in front of their boulder surrounded burrow, and they get frightened and make silly gestures and growl loudly towards that particular boulder; later, one gang discovers the weapon in form of a leg bone, and they kill the rival gang's leader with the bones.Then, one of the dressed-as-monkey guys throws his weapon up in the air, and the audience is thrown into the future, where all nations live in peace, and a bunch of silly people wear silly costumes and hats, sit on silly armchairs, presumably suck all sorts of juices as food and limp on the corridors of nausea causing rotating ""space stations"". Oh, and a daddy speaks with his daughter on a video phone with the moon spinning wildly out the cabin's window.All this happens over 30 minutes time span, not much heh ?After watching the scene with 2 men and 2 women chatting seated on some silly chairs, and one woman having to physically pull her panties out of her butt through her skirt as she stands up, I had to bear yet another sight of this time a limping stewardess carrying food, wearing a huge piece of underwear pushing through her trousers while she wastes about 2 minutes of film just to switch direction, left and upside-down (dont ask why would it be necessary to have a stewardess climb the ceiling in order to serve u a juice in the future) - 7 or 8 minutes of her limping in total.So i gave up watching the rest of the movie, and instead switched to watching Alien for the nth time, with lieutenant Ripley facing an Alien threat wearing decent underwear at least.Tho i wonder what happened with the cat, and what was its relevancy in the movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
858,ghostninjafire,A window into the vastness of space and its deep loneliness,10,8 October 2013,"Only after Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odissey science fiction film genre was taken seriously, it is a window into the vastness of space and its deep loneliness. In 1968 (one year before the 1st Trip to the Moon) was created this masterpiece which immediately became a reference work for all science fiction and, for me, has never been surpassed by another film of the same. The film's story is complicated and the way we're told does not make it easier. 2001 is a question about why we are here. But, as Kubrick said, ""You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of '2001'"". To understand it, you have to think about the monolith as an E.T.'s 'tool' watching the evolution of the human race, it represents a challenge. Firstly, Apes are afraid, curious yet, brave, qualities that make them invent the TOOL (starting with bones). Secondly, in space, Man faces this monolith the same way apes did, with curiosity (but this time, with times gone bye, his main tool is a computer). In space, Man has to learn how to walk again, how to go to toilet and has to eat baby food which means, the leader of Earth is a baby in Space.Thirdly, there's HAL-9000, a computer (Man's tool) who starts to 'think' humans are stupid and boring (chess newbies) using warmed-up food and artificial sun. The ultimate tool doesn't need this apes. Man's intense breath in space means we are in space like fishes out of water. Finally, Man loses control of his tools, beginning a battle between Man and 'Alive' Machines. The Computer has won but it didn't calculate the ignorance of the stupid Ape who surprisingly kills HAL-9000 with the most basic tool, a screwdriver. In 2001's final moments, Man, alone in space, prepared to face the unknown and face the ultimate challenge: HIS OWN DEATH. Our evolution was so all based in our tools, but, in the end, it tried to replace us.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I wasted $5 buying this movie on DVD in an FYE's bargain bin because I had always heard high praise of Stanley Kubrick and this movie. I don't know where I heard that praise. I wish I did so that I could always do *exactly opposite* whatever those critics recommend. This has got to be the movie industry's most boring movie ever; hands down. From the opening scene where the mysterious monolith is discovered by early man until HAL locks Dr Bowman out of the space station, it's about as exciting as watching paint dry. Nothing much actually happens! Literally. The movie is 2:29 and the viewer who fortunately owns this on DVD can fast-forward the first 1:45 and not miss anything.

When I walked out of the theater nearly 3 hours later I was totally mesmerized.Firstly seeing the film in Cinerama gives a far superior view- and shows how brilliantly it is done.The film cannot be called 'conventional'- and that is the concept that Kubrick wanted to create. It is an 'experience' into a genre of art and science with profound ideas of the past and future direction of humankind's journey- Yes an 'Oydessy' if you want to call it that. The actors are merely secondary to the grand design.The concept of HAL 9000 is unique, and for its time incredible. Clarke nor Kubrick had no idea that HAL would not be around in 2001- but computers would be- in a way they never imagined.The use of the Classical music is done perfectly throughout. 2001 is not a movie- but an experience- and that is what makes it so special.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
867,Sinth01,Stunning but overrated space adventure,7,11 August 2013,"2001: A Space Odyssey is often titles as one of the best movies in the world and the landmark movie of Stanley Kubrick. The visual look of the film is stunning and the plot is ahead of its time. It is hard to believe that the movie came out as early as 1968. Still my opinion is that the movie is far too slow. There are many ridiculously long scenes without any true purpose. Some people have proposed to just relax and enjoy the scenes but my opinion is that the movie cannot be counted as a movie in that case. Also some people have praised using drugs and watching this movie under their effect. I don't think a movie can be judged as a masterpiece if it requires you to be high to be able to get through with it. That's why, although the movie was visually and technically stunning and far ahead of it's time, I dare to disagree calling it as the perfect and one of the best movies in the world although it is definitely better than average. The music created a good atmosphere to the film and the moaning sound of these strange stones were brilliant and chilling. The biggest downside was the famous ""intercourse"" scene that I find to be absolutely unnecessary to the movie. I disagree in every aspect calling it as a brilliant move. Finally the famous ""lsd-scene"" was just way too over length watch and my interest to the movie died over there. As a shorter scene I could have called is as visually great but the total length of the scene was just ridiculous. Kubrick might be a stunning director that fights against the mainstream movies but I find 2001: A Space Odyssey is far too overrated movie. If the criteria for a masterpiece movie is that you need to be high to get impressed from it, then I could agree that this movie is a masterpiece.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

871,Arsenic Drone,"It's an influential movie, but it's got its flaws.",6,2 December 2001,"2001: A Space Odyssey is worth seeing, because you'll understand references and be able to make conversation about it.  However, you might not enjoy watching it.  There were a few things I really liked about it, but I wouldn't say that I had a good time watching the film.That's not to say that I particularly regret spending the time (it is a bit lengthy) to watch it.  Afterwards it is interesting to mull over some of the themes, and develop your own take on it.  I won't be so pompous as to try to feed you my interpretation of the meaning, because there are too many ways you could explain each thing.  However, as vague as the metaphors are, I feel that Kubrick beats the viewer over the head with them.  The phallic object(s), the question of whether or not man is special, ""man's first instinct,"" and so on: I don't know about everyone else, but I felt like Kubrick tried a bit too hard to make his themes clear.  I didn't know anything about the film beforehand, so I wasn't primed to come in and analyze everything.  However, when the message and substance are so blatant (even if you can't be sure quite what they are), you are forced to self-consciously think about the movie while watching it.  ""Ugh, I've been watching birth imagery for the last five minutes,"" you think, and it detracts from the experience.  Even if you realize you might be wrong.The themes are certainly interesting questions, interesting things to think about.  And I'm not saying that they're presented in a shock-value sort of way.  Without dialogue, action, and dynamic camera work, though, when the artistic parts come up and come on so strong, it's just overkill.  The ending sequence is particularly guilty of this.  Everything is metaphor, and Kubrick chose some rather mundane ways to represent the grandiose, almost as if he thinks no one will have any clue what's going on otherwise.  ""Oh, come on, a bathtub?"" you may find yourself griping.As for the claims that the movie is boring, they may go a bit too far, but there is some validity to them.  Certainly some scenes are most effective when they're stretched out longer than you'd expect.  At least for me, Kubrick stretched them out far longer than was necessary.  Given the flavor of the film, long sit-back-and-enjoy-the-beauty scenes seem out of place while you're trying to discover out what's going on, and they end long after you've taken it all in.In all, if you enjoy your thought-provoking experiences coming in story form, you'll be disappointed.  If you like to change how you view the world slowly, and don't take well to things that try to blow your mind, you'll be disappointed.  If you're not interested in an experiment in film pace, you'll be disappointed.  If you'd rather have fun watching a movie, and do the deep thinking later, you'll be disappointed.  See the movie I suppose, but there will be many things that will make you want to roll your eyes.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
872,AVass0812,Science Fiction Excellence: 30 years ahead of its time!,10,16 February 2002,"This film is truly an exceptional piece of entertainment history. A film based on a story by a science fiction writer that actually thought about what life would be like in the 21st century.Stanley Kubrick was an exceptional individual with a vision and accuracy of what outerspace was truly like. Now remember this film was made almost 10 years before Star Wars was released. The films story was exceptionally well crafted. Here is a ancient unexplainable monolith that is discovered on the moon which is calling out to the universe as some sort of ""homeing beacon"". Humans, being truly arrogrant, believing that they've figured out the meaning of the monolith go to Jupiter to unlock this secret.
Along the way, the pressures of deepspace travel and an artificial intelligence that has a ""nervous breakdown"" makes the story very interesting and entertaining to see if humanity can survive within the vacuum of space and far from its evloutionary nest.I highly recommend this film for all to see, sci fi lovers and the non, alike to watch. You'll at least come away from the film with an appreciation of what accuracy Kubrick was trying to obtain, or make you believe that ""we are truly not alone"" in the universe.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

There's a big rock, some sort of space mission, a computer with a really annoying voice, nice like dance scene with the planets colliding, some animal throwing a bone in the air and thats really about it. No story, no theme, no plot and just no good.2001 is perhaps the ultimate geeks' movie. Critics were right, Kuberick was ahead of his time with this one. It's only now that millions of sad sci-fi fans can sit and discuss the deep meanings behind the film. At last they can hold their greasy haired heads up high, by pretending they've got a clue what this was all about.2001 is the film that always gets you. You've heard about it, people say it's great; remember these people are either geeks or liars, and you spend your hard earned money to see yet another re-release. Trust me, it's really not worth it. The Simpsons covered most of the memorable scenes and of course did them much better.A perfect con trick by Kubrick, who was after all the master of illusion. Come on really, he nearly made us believe that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were in love in Eyes Wide Shut. Catch the right moment, when the world is stoned and Hey presto! HUge Hit! Many people going back again and again because they don't remember it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
874,Longest_Lasting_Redshirt,watch it multiple times. it grows on you,10,29 October 2007,"I did not think much more that a 6 or so when i first saw it. i watched again on TCM a few months later and loved it. Every time i hear the music I smile. This is a movie I can see people hating. Kubrick is the kind of director that likes symbolism, realism, etc. This movie really does not have any major characters for the entire thing. we have the first act main (one of the apes) second act main (dr. Floyd) and three in the third (Dave, frank, and the infamous HAL 9000 computer system)The true only flaw is that the space sequences get dull the first time you watch them (particularly the star gate sequence. After getting used to Kubrick they seem priceless its a 10 star 80-100 minute movie brought into 2.5 hours. other than that it is flawless (particularly the special effects of the Dave jogging).",2001 - A Space Odyssey
875,Hellmao,A scientific approach to God,10,20 January 2004,"Many of the discussions about 2001  A Space Odyssey refer to the transcendental and unreasonable ending, that seems to be anything but a conclusion. Rather than trying to give an explanation for it, I would like to point out why there can't be any. If there is still anybody who has not seen this movie, please see it prior to reading on. Who are we? Where do we come from? The questions raised in 2001  A Space Odyssey, are truly fundamental. In Kubrick's adaptation there is something much greater than human brains.The visible part of it, a black monolith, does not change at all in its appearance throughout space and time. It is constant. The apes meet it with fear and excitement. Millions of years and a single, famous cut later, human tools have changed and the approach to the monolith is far more reasonable and thoughtful, but communication is still impossible. The apes do not understand, that touching it made them discover the use of bones as survival tools. The astronauts on the moon try to analyze the monolith only to suffer physical pain. At least, man has now been able to identify it as a source of radio waves addressed to something.The search for truth, however, is painful and lethal for everybody. Even HAL's quest remains unanswered, as he cannot cope with emotions, and when he is shut down, he is left in ignorance and confusion. Extraterrestrial intelligence here is not visible in flying saucers or aggressive insect-like life forms, but in a plain structure, and that is all we can understand from it. Maybe it was really something like the monolith that made life on earth start to think in the first place.A rather scientific approach, given the fact that without certain elements originating from asteroids that hit planet earth from outer space, molecular development of life forms on this planet, quite possibly, would not have been possible. We are star children anyway.Of course we cannot understand what is going on as we share Dave's vision in the end. When different matter meet in structured order, Dave experiences his own mortality. How and when he dies is irrelevant. He faces the same power that we witness when physics and biology melt and a planet and a foetus are alike. When we finally see creation as a size- and timeless, truly universal energy, we can only discover that we are still far from being able to understand it. How do you explain God ?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
876,janecamacho,The human odyssey,10,13 August 2010,"This movie is still a puzzle to me, even more so than the first time I saw it fourteen years ago. Curiously, that very first time I didn't thought much of it. I was hoping for something that could shed some light in to the events described at the opening of its sequel, ""2010: year of contact"" (of all things!). That really put the hook on me. But then again 2001 is not a movie to provide fast or conventional entertainment, let alone to provide you with answers. If one has to write a review on a movie such as ""2001: A space odyssey"", the very first problem that comes to the central fore is the fact that there is no conventional plot line for the viewer to follow. The way I see it, this movie is made of an overture, three acts, and a (very) long epilogue. The first act deals with the misshapenings of a group of pre-historic men fighting with a rival gang for possession of a water lake. We then leap to the twenty first century, traveling with scientist Heywood Floyd to the moon where he has to deal with a ground breaking discovery. In the third act, aboard the spaceship Discovery and half way in a mysterious mission to Jupiter, a drama unfolds as the on board supercomputer HAL 9000 appears to malfunction and plunges astronauts Dave Bowman and Frank Poole in a struggle to survive. Along these seemly unrelated acts, the only thing resembling a plot line is the close encounter between the characters of each story and a mysterious object in the form of a black monolith. However, the only time where this plot is actually followed through is in the long epilogue, where Dave Bowman chases several of those enigmatic monoliths in a psychedelic journey through outer space. Never the less the end comes, and we still don't get an answer to the nature of these mysterious objects and their undisclosed relation to mankind. This very unsatisfying finally alludes to the absence of a solid (or conventional) plot line within the whole movie. Of course we could indulge in some free interpretation. Assuming that the whole monolith plot is a red herring, if we search for something to connect the movie together, there are several recurrent motifs, one of which, the evolution of mankind. Some examples of it are pointed out through musical cues: Kubrick's use of ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"" by Richard Strauss is presented whenever that recurrent motif comes up. Parallel scenes like the encounter between the ape-men and the monolith which is mimicked by the astronauts on the moon, indicating the possibility of another step in mankind's evolution. Never the less, Stanley Kubrick avoids any explicit conclusion, or opinion that could direct the viewer to what he intends to. Every time evolution is suggested, we are presented with all possible consequences that come from it, good and bad: the most obvious example of this is the dramatic third act and it's memorable character HAL, a symbol of man's achieved perfection, playing God. And yet when the computer malfunctions and the crew has to fight for their survival, Bowman has no doubt but to destroy Man's own creation. Human kind at its best and at its worst. So when the end comes up and the immortal all powerful star child is looking at you, we can't help wonder what will prevail, good or evil. I believe Kubrick's intention was to leave it up to us to make our own minds. Furthermore, this possible story line and its interpretation don't make for the whole film. In fact, there are many aspects of the movie that strike an impact on the viewer just by their visual presentation, along with other artistic choices from Kubrick that don't follow the standard use in film industry. For example, the leap in the story, that ends the ""Dawn of man"" act with a transition shot so fluid and perfect that surpasses any significance within the story and could be enjoyed just for its sheer beauty. There is the docking of a spaceship that lasts for 4 minutes without contributing to plot development, but mesmerizes you with its space choreography, aided by the Blue Danube waltz playing in the background. And of course there is HAL, one of the most memorable characters put on screen. He chills you out with its soft voice and glaring red eye (as a friend of mine described it), and draws your empathy when facing his own death, pleading for his life just like a human being: "" please stop, Dave. I'm afraid."" An iconic scene in movie history!All these aspects give a feeling that the director's intention was not only to engage in philosophical introspection about human kind's evolution and destiny, but also to present what could be call an abstract movie, aesthetically provocative, with much attention paid to form, images and sound, as much as content, breaking all ties with conventional film making. These two facts put together capture your imagination and senses as no other film in the mainstream production industry.To sum it up, this movie is a unique visual experience, as much as a mind challenging picture!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
877,dalehoustman,MORE EXCITING THAN TARKOVSKY!,10,17 December 2018,"It is difficult to see clearly now (after decades of Star Wars and Star Trek on the more commercial side of space films) ) but this was a groundbreaking film, brave even in its most mystical scenes, deliberately (and hypnotically) tedious, with one certified great villain in HAL, easily the most human performance in the film. The ""light show"" in the middle is stunningly dull now, bereft as we are of the necessary mescaline, 2000 light years from Woodstock, and stuck in the checkout line. But this is a bearable indulgence. Like so many Kubrick films (apart from ""Strangelove"") this demands a more-than-average forbearance, but, after seeing Tarkovsky, this becomes less severe in comparison.

878,jackosurfing14,"you simply don't watch it, you experience it.",10,11 July 2012,"Stanley Kubrick '2001 a space odyssey' is a surrealistic, audacious and ambiguous journey into the concepts of mankind. The films plot is quite simply, humanity discover monolith on the moon and set out on a journey to Jupiter to discover the monolith origin.The opening sequence consist of black motionless screen while disconcerting music plays which brilliantly establishes the mood for a journey into the unknown, directly after this we are introduced to the first act 'the dawn of man', which portrays the beginning of mankind through a Darwinism approach by using primal ancestors and how the monolith provides the intelligence for the primal individual to use a bone for a weapon, the first form of technology. Furthermore this scene contains the most audacious editing sequence, which consist of the primal figure throwing his bone into the air and then cuts to a ship floating in space which captivates Kubrick ideas on the advancement of technology in the future.What Kubrick has created in this film is cinema at it's purest, like silent films, '2001 a space odyssey' creates it's storytelling through use of visuals and music, which is beautifully highlighted through this next sequence of spaceships contrasted with classical music, the sequence oozes grace like a moving painting.while there is so much to talk about the answer is quite simple, Kubrick '2001' is undoubtedly one of the best films ever made and offers, which is rarely found elsewhere, an experience of the unknown and the meditation of mankind.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Stanley Kubrick in the company of the screenwriter Arthur Clark shows to the viewer of monkeys. These are the beings, rather primitive from the point of view of social lines, who don't have accurate public organization. But here on the horizon the mysterious Black Obelisk appears. Creators only begin to provide the thinnest surgical hints to the viewer as a food for thought. Opinions of most of both film critics, and mere mortals dispersed about it from the moment of the movie premiere.The further travel to Jupiter looks awesome, with fascinating sounds and the color images rushing before the astronaut's eyes. The long episode of an unreal travel sharply breaks with a scene in usual, quite realistic situation in the living room where the traveler endures the accelerated aging and regeneration, having come to be an image of the star child. The star child who comes up from a monolith in space is result of this coition. This creation which received absolute knowledge, having experienced physical death and having revived, smoothly moves towards Earth. There, having found a physical body, the star child will differ from other people as well as modern people from the space station differ from the monkeys.  
The musical motifs (Richard Strauss' Also Sprach Zarathustra, Johann Strauss' Blue Danube Waltz) will forever bring the film to mind, and snippets of its minimalist dialogue (""Open the pod bay doors, Hal"", ""Good morning, Dave"") pop up in homages and cultural references.In the end just wanna tell, that this is one of the best movies ever. With fantastic atmosphere, deep philosophical implication and a nonlinear plot. All of this forces your gray substance moves and to look for a way to a necessary enlightenment.

Yes, the visual and special effects is unquestionably dazzling and aged like wine. Yes, it's one of the most unique movies in the cinema. But let's talk frankly, the movie isn't fun to watch. The pace is painfully slow. Before even the ""A Space Odyssey"" title appears, we have to stand a nasty soundtrack playing for three minutes in the black screen. This is a warning to all the boredom that awaits us. Starting with a bunch of monkeys screaming and jumping, which is very annoying , or a bunch of generic, uninteresting people talking and eating while spacecrafts move like turtles in space. While the spacecraft descends on the moon, or when Dave is trying to rescue his mate, you could go to the kitchen to make a cup noodles, return to the screen and find that the spacecraft has not yet touched the lunar soil and Dave has not rescued Frank yet. But the third part is what saves this movie, because HAL 9000 is in it. HAL is the thing I love in this movie and I think that's what saved the movie, because all the moments that HAL is acting are fun, and all the times HAL isn't in scene are boring or bizarre like hell.

882,daryahorenko,A perfect-looking masterpiece of science fiction,10,18 May 2018,"This is hands down one of the most special movies I've ever seen. Despite the fact that the story is pretty good, what really makes it so outstanding comes to live in the cinematography, which is so good, there's so many beautiful shots, even in the beginning where there's no CGI. This movie looks top-notch amazing! Yhe sets are perfect, and I know it's sets, but it all looks like they're in real space ships, like they're actually in space, like they're in an actual savannah. Despite being released in 1968, this movie looks almost perfect and it's tied with another 1968 movie for the oldest movie I've ever seen, but despite all that, it looks gorgeous! The score is really great as well, the main theme is memorable andit seemed familiar and it tells us we're in for something extraordinary. I also like that they used classical music in the first half of the movie, it's so calming and the music in the second half of the movie, which I should call noises, make for a mystical vibe. The use of silence in later shots in outer space make those scenes even more gorgoes.I have some flaws with this movie though. At first I thought that the antagonist is Hal, the dictator-like arrogant computer, but then I realized it's the off-screen aliens. I don't really like the face that we have off-screen antagonists. Also, I thought that the intermission was entirely pointless. And a minor flaw is that I would've liked to spend some more time with the chimpanzees in the opening sequence.I'm a 100% certain that George Lucas and Irvin Kershner were heavily inspired by this movie. There's so many things in this movie that resemble ""A New Hope"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"", especially visual elements, such as the outside of the ships, and I saw two or three similar shots in ""Alien"", too. Also, there's a shot on the lunar surface that resembles the shot in ""Revenge of the Sith"" right before we see Yoda medidating being interrupted by Bail Organa.If someone else made this movie it would be like an hour long without all the elongated shots, but it would lose so much, it would hardly be special anymore.I'll go watch the sequel immediately, I have sooo many questions, this movie leaves you thinking!

It is also the most confusing, creative, astonishing, and wonderful as well.For my entire life I've been looking for a movie as bizarre and beautiful as this film. I never expected to find it in a space film made in the 60's (although, that should have been the first place I looked). All I had knows before starting this movie was a general idea of some of the scenes (from parodies), and that it was supposedly confusing. Well, it was confusing, but in a very good way. It was mysterious and artistic; a real feast for the eyes, and on top of that it created an atmosphere very rarely seen in movies. This quiet, subtle masterpiece uses long and uneventful scenes to actually create the illusion of boredom mixed with wonder that the characters would experience in space. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed these scenes too, as I tend to hate scenes that drag on too long. What Stanley Kubrick managed to film was realistically boring scenes that, instead of just being pointless like most modern Hollywood dramas, had strong meanings. Plus, every scene had a certain beauty that only an artist would be able to create.So anyone who has yet to see this movie for whatever reason, go out right now and rent the movie.

I have never seen a film with such amazing vision.  Everything in it seems so incredibly well and completely though out.  Kubrick is, no question, the bravest director I've ever seen. What other director would have an overture, intermission, entre'acte and exit music now?  The space sequences are truly silent, whereas Armageddon, for example, fills it with useless noise.  It gives the real feeling of a void, a vacuum, of emptiness and infinity itself.  2001 is a visual opera. It tests the limits of cinema and the very imagination.  I have never seen another movie that required real existential discussion afterwards.  This movie, though it is over 30 years old, has the greatest special effects of any ever.  The ending sequence may be the greatest 20 minutes ever captured on film.  The title is perfect: ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite.""  How it was done is beyond me.  How Kubrick could have ever even imagined it is totally beyond me.  I would say right now that this is the greatest film I have ever seen.  It is a masterpiece.

My father and older brother were thrilled to be going to this movie, and I was sure it was going to be pretty good as well.  But of course nothing prepared me for the bigness -- grand music, huge space ship, fantastic light show, and considerable running time.Well, the point is that I still remember all that, and the cinema I saw 2001 at (""The Oak"" on Denman, in Vancouver), and how I had to ask a lot of questions in the end.  And how profoundly advanced it was for its time.The same can not be said for Star Wars or other ""special effects"" movies (even though Star Wars was one of just two movies I saw twice in the cinema).  Special effects do not equal profundity.  In fact, my current view is that if a movie is special effects dominated, then it will suck. Why?  Because it is so easy to see how fake the effects are...like plastic flowers versus the real thing, fake zero gravity is pretty easy to pick out.2001 is one of the few sci-fi films that *is* a great movie (I would also include The Matrix).  The others are at best creative stories with fancy pictures.Oh, and for those who find it boring, consider that the original running time of Lawrence of Arabia (released around the same time) was just under FOUR hours!  2001 is a mere 2.5 hours (shorter than The Green Mile).8/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
892,Trouter2000,Impressive feat regardless of personal philosophy,10,15 August 2007,"2001: A Space Odyssey Very few films deal with humanity in an abstract verb very well, often despite trying to give a universal message about humans they end up giving a message about individuals. This is perfectly fine, and many of the truly great films deal with people this way, it is natural because we relate more deeply with individuals. However, Stanley Kubrick's crowning achievement is one of the best-regarded films at showing humans not in an individual sense, but rather as a species.The film basically comes down to the core philosophy of evolution, about our need as a species to keep going, despite where we get ourselves. A short cut scene at the beginning of the film shows us as apes, wherein a black monolith (possible God allegory) reveals itself to us as we first begin to comprehend tools as hunting mechanisms. We proceed to separate ourselves from the apes that don't comprehend tools through harassing them and ultimately separate ourselves as unique. We then jump many years later to a theoretical 2001, wherein people have become lazy; they lack emotion and have mechanical usages for almost any regular job. What's implied is that we have evolved to a point of slothfulness due to a lack of this theoretical God. Most of the conventional story isn't the point; it is put in largely to begin the plot where the truly insightful message on human beings is revealed. An alien signal is picked up and a crew with a computer (Hal 9000) is sent to investigate. What is shown is that Hal 9000 is more human then the human beings, a creature stuck in a world void of life in a metaphysical sense. Ultimately he destroys all but one crew member in an attempt to keep things safe, through his own poorly figured sense of the situation. When the last member finally succeeds in unplugging him, he regains what it means to be human and what follows is one of the most impressive sequences ever revealed in any film.What struck me at first with 2001 was its cold lifeless nature; though this comes off as the films nature it truly is only the coldness of space that gives it the sense. 2001 is a life affirming film because it shows that humans will keep going, we are still evolving and we will never really die. I don't connect with it like some individuals, because as a believer my theology is different, but the film is a moving sense of life and color, and it is affirming in many ways to know that were not done. We as a species have a long way to go, but we will ultimately make it.2001 often lacks the philosophical qualities that make people connect with the cinema. It isn't easy relating to an abstract verb as oppose to an individual, but this quality alone separates 2001 as a truly significant piece of the cinema. Regardless as to how deeply anybody relates to the plot, the use of sound and color is unrivaled in any film, and lovers of the cinema will inherently appreciate this aspect alone. Truly nothing has ever surpassed it in terms of raw energy and beauty and any admirer of film will be impressed with this aspect regardless of philosophical merit to one's personal life.Kubrick has left us with a masterpiece I think we will all grow to further appreciate in time, just as we will further evolve, our tastes will as well, and I see further recognition ahead of 2001. A true masterpiece and the film that defined a genius, I give 2001: A Space Odyssey a deserving 9/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The film begins with our past ancestors, the apes, and their slow yet important development. We see an ape studying a bone from a dead animal in the desert-like landscapes. The ape then precedes to using the bone as a hammer and realizes the power and usefulnes it could have. The cinematography is quite stunning, and I quickly forgot that I was watching a film from 1968. The journey continues from our earliest history, to a time where we have colonized space and made machines smart enough to do jobs for us - without us needing to control them.The whole experience has so much atmosphere and I couldn't have used the word ""epic"" better in any other context. The film is just the definition of the word. The special effects, the visuals and the deep, stunning orchestral music fills the movie with so much room and life; You just feel so small and helpless - but in a somewhat spellbinding way. The film has so many important messages, even more so now today than over 40 years ago. The film also raises many questions about the human race; How hungry we are for exploring, and how we might even explore more than what we should for our own good.Any person interested in sci-fi, space, time, evolution or even just enjoy atmospheric pieces, should definitely check it out.

This group is growing larger every year, but why? One possible explanation is that Kubrick was considered as an ambitious young director at the time, that made some critically and popularly acclaimed films (The Killing, Paths of Glory, Lolita, Spartacus, Dr. Strangelove) but never tried the sci-fi genre at all. Another cause might be that, in 1968, the public wasn't used to watch a movie in which nothing happened during 15 minutes. Sure, they had some Bergman's or Buñuel's but 2001 was distributed world-wide, like a commercial film. Even though it had a moderate success in the box-office, very few people could walk out of the cinema saying that they understood it. Actually, nobody can say that they got the point meaning it. Not even Kubrick nor Clarke (R.I.P. for both) could've really explained the world they have created. Some interpretations say that its about human's position in the Universe, the evolution of man, how the real aliens must be etcetera...Don't let yourselves to be fooled with these: ""2001""'s meaning is as dark as it could be, but no one will really get it.

896,elkabousmehdi,The Depiction of Existentialism,10,13 December 2009,"2001: A Space Odyssey is more than a film; unfortunately nowadays films are more and more depicted as an entertainment medium which automatically drives the audience to a flat understanding of what really movies are meant to be. Well Stanley Kubrick's gem came to confirm one of his famous quotes '' If it can be written, or thought, it can be filmed''. The film provokes the subconscious part of the ''watcher'' through a mysterious and obscure gigantic space. Millions of years ago before humankind existed Kubrick choose to personify that mystery in The Monolith scene to express the dawn of man, the way the monolith behaved, and try to communicate could be interpreted as an ''attempt to communication '', as the monolith disappears once the magical alignment appeared and foretells us the beginning of Man's development. The journey through space started with a magnificent soundtrack completely opposite of the one in first chapter which extraordinary matches with the description or the promenade that Stanley Kubrick made us experience through the so wonderful space, to show us one of the best quality of this movie which is the quality of the image and visual effect (knowing that this film was realized in 1968) which personally wowed me. In this part it shows us the cerebral human being in the pinnacle of the technology development and also introduce us to one of the most important actor or character I would say ''Who is'' HALL 900 plays a big role in the depiction of the technology versus Human being , a computer capable of interacting emotionally and intellectually as humans. The dramatic scene in where hall doesn't want to open the pod bay doors to Bowman, Stanley Kubrick showed us how humankind can be victim of its own tools. The film is much more known for its mysterious end because the plot isn't something limited, let us remember you that this film isn't about a definite subject and it becomes what you see in it while you are watching it and that's make the movie even beautiful and special at the same time. Stanley Kubrick delivered a masterpiece using two mean NATURAL dimensions: Vision (image), Music (phonetic, sound) to let us see and listen as we are experiencing the discovery of the Orphic existence of the universe. Highly Recommended!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
897,maxschrek5,Weird,10,31 October 2009,"This is probably the weirdest movie I've ever seen. I really could not understand a single thing the first time I watched it. It was like the ultimate drug trip movie (and like any drug trip movie, you can sync it with a Pink Floyd song). The second time I understood it a little better, but it was still weird. But my liking for weird things and the fact is Kubrick makes me give it a good rating. It supposedly has all these meanings to it, but the only one I saw was if you beat a computer at chess, Glenn Beck will reprogram it to kill you. Or send on a psychedelic trip to an alien planet where you're declared some kind of god. Thats all I got to say. This Shining is still better!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

899,fearless2003,Perfect film to me,10,5 July 2015,"To me, this is the perfect film... it captures something that I haven't seen any other movie capture... awe. Usually movies involve ""standard' human emotion... anger, fear, pride, passion etc... This is the only movie that I think takes a step beyond into the sublime. Standard storytelling involves 'conflict' and 'drama'. There is some of that here for sure, but there's a transcendental/meditative quality to the film.It does not use conventional storytelling techniques... and it's a good thing it doesn't. There is enough dialogue to give a complete picture of the plot... Any more dialogue would have been extraneous. However, the film is NOT a mush of ambiguity... it tells a very clear profound story about human evolution... the economy of words gives more clarity... not less... Visually, it is perfect... amazing, a film almost 50 years old... yet stands up to any sci-fi film today.If you want to be swept up in drama and 'standard' human emotion... you won't get that here. But I think you get something much better.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
900,Goldwaterproductions,Now i can understand why the film won only a single Oscar.,2,15 July 2012,"I started to admire the works of Kubrick at the age of 14 after seeing the movie Dr. Strangelove. And after seeing Full Metal Jacket, I became a fan of Kubrick. Then I was in my high school Cinema Studies class and the teacher showed us this movie. I've always wanted to see it because it had Kubrick as the director and I heard it was his best film. I was aware that it was a slow movie, but that didn't bother me. Little did I know that it would be one of the most boring and most pretentious films I have ever seen.Before the fans of this film flame me, let me explain. I wasn't expecting a film like Star Wars. I was looking for a film that had a good storyline and characters that were interesting to watch. This film didn't have that. There was no storyline and the characters were really empty and void with no personality at all. That's not even the worst part. The worst part is the pacing. Now I love watching slow paced movies, but they need to have something going on that will keep me interested in what's going on. This movie didn't have that. You can take out about 70% of this film and not be missing any plot points whatsoever. A lot of the shots are either of spaceships floating in space, spaceships landing (very slowly), stars and planets, or landscapes. I'm sorry, but I expected to see a film, not a slideshow of art.Now there is one thing that I can say good about this movie, and that's the visual effects. For 1968, they are absolutely fantastic and still hold up pretty well and the Oscar it received is very well deserved.The overall problem with this movie is that it tries to hard to be intelligent. This isn't a problem necessarily, but if you don't have something to keep me interested in what's going on besides the pretty special effects, then you're insulting your audience and that's what 2001 does.If you wanna watch a film that is both entertaining and genuinely intelligent, watch the original Planet of the Apes. It came out in the same year, has a slow pace, but it has 2 things that it has over this movie, an engrossing story, and well fleshed out characters.Overall 2/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
901,lordjord96,The ultimate Open-Ended film...,10,16 November 2012,"I watched this film for the first time on Blu-Ray. I saw in superb High definition the endless bounds of Kubrick's visionary Genius. I could hear the silence, feel the breathing of the characters. But above all, I had room to think.'2001: A Space Odyssey' is so brilliant that I will find a good review hard to write. Firstly, I will talk about acting; if there is much to talk about. All actors were superb, despite there being almost no real dialogue. Not a single piece of story-line seemed to stem from dialogue, and this is what I love; the fact that dialogue is there for the simple purpose of happening, to keep the scenes real. The first scene where human speech does occur is one of the best I've seen. When William Sylvester went from happily discussing the mission, to just saying 'I am afraid I am not at liberty to discuss that.' in a plain and unmoved tone was simply superb.Then you have the frustration between Dave and HAL- 9000. HAL is easily my favourite film-villain of all time; his coldness is so beautifully presented by his voice-actor,Douglas Rain, and yet it is easy to feel sorry for him when he dies singing.Then there are the visuals, and oh my are they great. The so-called 'Stargate' sequence is simply incredible, and literally had me holding on to my seat. Then there is the open and very obviously vacuous nature of space which is emphasised by the presence of silence. The clean feel to the space-station is satisfying, and the red, slightly off centre glare of HAL-9000's 'eye' is a truly scary sight. The planets look great and so does pretty much everything. Being on Blu-ray obviously makes all the difference.My favourite part is, however, the Monolith. What strikes me about them is how, unlike most 'aliens' in sci-fi films, they don't scream to be explored. In 'Prometheus' the engineers call humans back, supposedly to just decide to destroy us, their creation. In 'Contact', they beg to be discovered by us and share all their benevolent secrets. The Monoliths just, well, exist. They send a signal, yes, but why? Who knows. They cause Dave to evolve to an even higher level of existence, but that is it. Other than this, they just exist, floating around, evolving and watching living things. The fact that they seem to reflect no light really places emphasis on the fact that they are clearly present, but hard to really see. I guess they may be Kubrick's vision of God; watchful being(s) that we cannot really define. And that is why I love this film so much; the ending is SO open to interpretation. I believe the Monolith's were the focus, and that their story is the focus of Kubrik's vision. Other's may say that the evolution to becoming a 'Star Child' is the focus, but who knows? Only Arthur C. Clarke it would seem.Overall then, '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a superb film, with expectantly beautiful Kubrick visuals combined with true-to-life acting an the best villain of all time: a very concerned computer. Another true classic from Kubrick; 9/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
902,AGfox16,Overrated waste of potential,2,18 January 2019,"2001: A Space Odyssey, with its near universal acclaim, is one of those films seems to itself define the meaning of what it is to be a great film. I must however break from this general opinion. 2001, in my opinion, is one of the greatest wastes of potential in film history. I wanted to like this movie so bad but I just couldn't.First the movie treats you with a long black screen, then ancient hominids going about daily life around the mysterious Monolith, with no music and of course no dialogue. Once the spaceships are shown (with great Strauss music accompaniment I must say), it still takes forever to get anywhere. Eventually we meet Bowman and HAL 9000. Bowman is an incredibly dull character, but HAL on the other hand was intriguing as a villain. Sadly, the HAL storyline was anti-climactic and disappointing, as his defeat was insignificant.Then Mr. Boring, I mean Bowman, gets in a pod and travels through space, seeing all sorts of colors and extra-terrestrial sights. A wonderful piece of art, at least it could've been if it had meaning. Then he ages significantly, only to touch the Monolith and turn into a fetus.Some say you must ""find what the movie means to you,"" but even though I have existentialist sympathies, I cannot excuse films that have no inherent meaning. 2001 is a visually spectacular yet absolute disaster of wasted potential and skill.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

When you watch it, then you must absorb the atmosphere.This movie shows Hollywood, that a really good space movie should have an experience, which makes you speechless (when you think about it), and not a brainless action movie with stereotypical heroes.Apart from some scenes, which are a bit too long for me, this movie is wonderful.

Kubrick should have stuck with kicking the hell out of the homeless in subways. I watched this in 4k and the only think clear was the quality of the 4k transfer which was immaculate (hence 2 stars). Now I'm an intelligent guy and have watched hundreds of movies but I have to say this movie is just behind Tenet as to being the most anti-climatic load of tripe I have ever watched, it made absolutely no sense, and please to all the Kubrick sycophants, don't try to convince me otherwise. The section following the ""collision"" with the monolith approaching Jupiter was more painfully boring than the intermission.

From the earliest days of pre-man to a glimpse into a future of something greater, this movie is breathtaking and awe-inspiring at every turn. The creation of the HAL-9000 was genius! The dynamic between the crew and HAL works! But, go to the beginning of the movie, and you see a truly inspired look at what we could have been! Add the dark visitor and the dawn of man begins in a most fascinating way!!!

907,nukhetagar,It's an experience,7,21 April 2021,"A short summary is that this is an experience rather than a movie. The director seemingly concerns himself with more the set and scenery than he does the actual script. This is apparent in his choice of actors as well, who also behave more like a set piece than a legitimate actor who makes you feel the intensity of the situation.That said, am I sad/upset to have spent two and a half hours watching this? Absolutely not. It was a great experience. But I wanted more of the story-and be more ingrained in it. Rather, we got looooooong shots of the set and the interesting aspects of space travel. Great, but could have benefitted from more things going on other than the set.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

909,sassonlonner,A Movie You Truly Feel Inside of,10,24 April 2018,"While watching a film, you get the most out of it by truly feeling immersed. You don't just want to watch events happening on a screen and think it's amusing or cool, but you really want to feel in. Feeling in is one of the most groundbreaking qualities of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. From his unique cinematography style to the use of music, you truly feel immersed watching this film. After watching this film, Strauss's Blue Danube cannot be listened to without associating it with this film. The same applies to Also sprach Zarathustra, which almost seems it was made to be in this work.
 2001 truly uses every element a perfect film needs. From the first scene, The Dawn of Man, one of the most brilliant film transitions of all time can be found, the transition of a bone to a spaceship. These both are symbols of the evolution of man, from the original tool, to the revolutionary spaceship. The way Kubrick makes time so important is extraordinary completely inspecting and digging into major philosophical questions, like ""What is mankind?"" and ""Why are we here?"" One of the other reasons I applaud Kubrick for, is he doesn't even know the answers. Or at least, he chooses not to share them saying:""They are the areas I prefer not to discuss because they are highly subjective and will differ from viewer to viewer. In this sense, the film becomes anything the viewer sees in it. If the film stirs the emotions and penetrates the subconscious of the viewer, if it stimulates, however inchoately, his mythological and religious yearnings and impulses, then it has succeeded.""
Stanley Kubrick in an interview with Joseph Gelmis Many messages can be taken from the film, but all of them have some sort of a missing piece. That missing piece can be the question as to what the monolith is, or what a baby in space is, but do we really need to know? As Stanley Kubrick was a genius, maybe he prefers us having some sort of a missing piece. 2001 clearly is making some sort of a statement about the greed of modern humanity, always feeling to know everything. We evolve from being dumb apes who bow down to what we don't know, to overconfident astronauts that feel the need to take a picture with our confusing findings. Maybe the fact that we are confused is attempting to make a large philosophical realization about the fact that not knowing is okay. Or maybe it's just to make a good film. But either way, 2001 can still be greatly appreciated as one of the most complex, immersive, and even almost perfect film creations of all time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
910,estebanlopezlimon,2001,10,28 September 2017,"The characters in this film pursue something that seems more an attempt to satisfy an eternal mortal's compulsion than an objective in itself. The senseless interest of mystery, risking life for a simple answer. The movie reaffirms this point by introducing us to the confrontation between AI's perspective and human's perspective on the mission.They are (mankind) looking for an object that could compensate the infinite darkness that conveys the existence of conscience. Our protagonist will conclude his life the same he started it: ignorant and confused. That remark shows a lack of sense in whatever the human being aspires. Does the comprehensible plot can distract you from the art? Probably. The story of the film is perfect for that reason. Those who hate this masterpiece are the type of audience that expect answers from a movie. In 2001 there's no attempt to give a concrete message. This film acts as an statement of ambiguousness and mystery, which composes the strange essence of everything that is considered attractive to the intellect. Stanley doesn't dare to give a definitive answer to our collective question; instead he offers more questions, so you can appreciate the beauty of it. I believe this movie defies our conception of cinema. Stanley comes to remind us the real sense of this art. 2001 doesn't not entertain but amazes.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

From the Dawn of Man to the great beyond, this movie has as much to say as anything I have ever seen. Even though the film was released a year before we landed on the moon, it doesn't seem dated or campy at all. It could have very well been made in 1999 (or even 2001) since it is so open-ended and broad in its message. I really enjoyed the scene where an ape (""moonwatcher"") throws a bone used as a weapon into the sky only for a jump cut to take us 4,000 years into the future. The bone is now a space shuttle and the setting is space. Upon learning of Mr. Kubrick's death last week I had a vision of a ""Star Stanley"" floating towards earth as the music swells and the credits roll.

913,LordBling,Kubrick's finest hour,10,7 December 2000,"Arguments can be made for many of Stanley Kubrick's films being his best work, but I would have to say that 2001: A Space Odyssey is indeed his finest hour.  Like many of his films (and I believe that Eyes Wide Shut will also fit into this category once people realize that it is about so much more than sex), it stands the test of time.  Ground-breaking, wholly original, and completely deserving of the praise it has continually received.10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
914,pheidias,Don't take reticence for profundity,7,8 September 2000,"It seems misguided to talk about ""ideas"" in Kubrick's films.  I would say he had a genius for unsettling people, often by means of perverse combinations of image and sound.  If, in our understandable urge to make sense of what stands before us, we imagine a clear intention behind these combinations, then we may have ascribed ideas to the artist that he never formed or perhaps never had the patience to form.Or the courage.  Because if we are right in guessing the meanings of these juxtapositions, meaning that each image corresponds to a specific notion of Kubrick's, why would he hold back that little hint that would make us sure we had happened upon the correct interpretation?  I can only think it would be intellectual cowardice, either of having one's ideas shown up as simple, or of being understood too clearly as saying something ugly.  I believe the second is the more likely.Finding the emotional sources of a work is somewhat less speculative.  I sense in this film a terrible bitterness toward man and a viciousness toward man the social animal, and a yearning for insulation from others, whether through distance, time, or a return to the womb.After much thought I give this film a 7, due to the uninvolving performances, the tasteless use of ""Zarathustra"" as a cheap gag, and the fact that despite the unforgettable sights and sounds, this film (despite my having read the book) did not appreciably enrich my life.  Neither did ""Eyes Wide Shut"".I gave the similar but less impressive ""Silent Running"" a 4. ""The Killing of a Chinese Bookie"", a truly ambiguous picture that does not prompt or hint to the viewer, I gave an 8, despite muddy sound, no music, unpleasant characters, uninteresting set decoration and poor formal organization.  Art that does not address life is only artifice, really no more than a curiosity.It reassures me of the existence of a shared human nature that so many people grow so much meaning out of Kubrick's rocky soil.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It's as if time slowed and I could see each and every frame of this amazing creation in a distilled and concentrated way.  It was more than ""movie-magic"" happening to me...in my 12 year old brain I was finally understanding what it was like to be truly alone and how infinitely small I was in the vastness among the planets.I was overwhelmed.Each and every subsequent viewing of the film, (sometimes on large, kind screens...sometimes on a tiny tv), showed me more beauty and made me more amazed.  I saw the flaws and foibles of humanity...in a machine.  I saw the icy cold calculations of a machine...in heroic astronauts.  I saw the finger of knowledge extended, baptizing my species with intelligence. ...but mostly I heard the silence...the silence of space...of death and of birth.

First off, I didn't think the movie was brilliant, a masterpiece or Kubrick's best. I'm also not writing this review just so people can look and see my review and say something along the lines of ""Oh, he didn't write what most other people wrote; he's weird"" (by the way, I hope that that made sense). I'm writing this review because I'm tired of hearing all the regular crap about how this movie is brilliant and.. well.... you know. I'm writing this just so I can get these words out of me and, even though not very many people will read this review, get them out to people like me.In my one line summary, I'm referencing when you hear all this hype about how a movie is supposed to be ""one of the greatest films ever made"" or ""brilliant"" or crap like that. I hated Bonnie and Clyde and Natural Born Killers! Critics love those movies (well... for the latter it's kind of divided) and I hated them! Bonnie and Clyde had some good performances and a couple of good scenes, so I'd give it a C-. Natural Born Killers was saved by excellent cinematography, a couple of good scenes and a good Robert Downey Jr. performance, so I'd give it a D or a D-. But this is a review of 2001: ASO, so I'll get right to that.First off, you gotta love the monkeys. That was the best part of the movie and not just because monkeys are funny. Because it was great to watch how primitive beings  reacted to certain things. I also liked the concept that the monolith gave knowledge, but with knowledge comes consequence. Also, it's got one of the best death scenes I've ever seen(by the way, you know there's something wrong when a computer displays more emotion in one scene than the typical Hollywood actor).As for my problem with the movie: if I have to watch another freakin spaceship dock for another 15 minutes with classical music playing, I'M GONNA SHOOT MYSELF!!! Jesus Christ, this movie gets so boring and slow. There's about 30 freakin minutes of flashing lights that would make an epileptic's head explode. At that point, I thought ""Screw it"" and went to make myself a sandwich.Perhaps I didn't understand it's ""brilliance"" or I'm the member of the wrong generation. I might be but I'm still giving this movie a B-.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
917,Green_Acres,"A Masterpiece of the science-fiction genre, and of cinema history!",10,30 June 2008,"Well, this was a repeat viewing, and I have to say, seeing this film finally on high surround system, it is amazing. Yes, it is confusing, but knowing this time around what it was about, and what it meant was so relaxing.The way the film starts, with just darkness, and the amazing music score playing sets off the mood from the start. The landscapes seen on the first 15 minutes, with the apes, is so visually stunning. Knowing this is from 1968 is so amazing. I mean, I have never seen landscapes like this before. The way the film sets off the Black Monolith, the music, the motion of the apes, just the whole scene still stands as AMAZING and one of the best scenes of the film, also one of the best scenes I have ever seen. The next jump cut to space, the way the humans interact, the way the audience has to be on board and pay attention to the little details. Even if the film was trying to say nothing at all, it would still be a joy to watch, because it whisks you to another world, another place not in your imagination. Of course, all the 'classic' classical music, which most audiences will recognize from other films or sources, playing with moving objects is amazing. it is such wonderful film-making.The third section of the film, this section is really not all that different, but if you know what the film is about, it is the most important. This is actually a section where 'regular' people will not be asking ""what the heck is this about?"" or saying ""weird""... This is where we get one of the most memorable characters in cinema history, the technology computer HAL-9000. This is truly a landmark of a character, one that gives you the creeps from the first time you see it. The way real humans interact with this computer is the whole point of the film. It is not just the writing that soars, but the amazing direction. The long shots, the steady camera, the heavy breathing done by Dave Bowen and Frank Poole, out in space is truly frightening. It is just amazing with the pace of the scenes that they are done with. All these scenes(just like throughout the film) are done very slowly and carefully. This truly emphasizes the meaning that they have, and their importance.The most beautiful scene on this film, and in the whole cinema history, is the Star Gate journey. This is definitely the most visually stunning scenes one will ever see. Yes, it is really minimal special effects, since all they probably use is colors, but it is just so amazing. I cannot just describe the beauty of this long scene. This scene is followed by the final section, which is in someplace very futuristic, one might imagine. The last 10 minutes of this film is the best endings I have ever seen, it is truly not an ending, but more of a revelation. The direction when the Black Monolith appears again, just wow. The cinematography is very well done for every single scene.Well, at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, all one can do is either hate it or love it. The ones who hate it are the ones who simply do not care to think or ask questions about great films. The ones who love it, really appreciate masterpieces like this. In my first viewing of this film, I loved it. In my second viewing, I might understand it more, but it does not lower in my mind of how great of a film it is. I truly think this is the best film ever made. I do not think anyone will ever be able to reach what this film reached. It is the most high achievement in technology, in writing, in pure film making. It is a film that everyone should at least see once. Of course, if you want to experience everything over and over again, keep reliving the journey... Absolute 10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I agree it makes complete sense anyway onto the review.Stanley Kubrick is one of the greatest directors of all time, possibly the greatest and 2001: A Space Odyssey is his magnum opus. It has 4 parts and I want to tackle them separately.There will be spoilers so beware I guess.Part OneThis movie starts out great. You see the Monolith and here ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"". You might be thinking ""You don't see the monolith at the beginning you see a black screen"". Here is the thing: the black screen is the monolith. The Monolith is black. Okay it might not be the monolith but I think it is. Why else would there be a black screen at the beginning. After that screen you see Humanoid type creatures. You see them living their life. Chilling in a cave, fighting other humanoids, normal prehistoric human stuff. They mysteriously see the monolith and find it very interesting. It then mysteriously aligns with one of the planets.. Then one of the apes discovers that it can use a bone as a weapon and naturally they dominate the other tribe. In the scene where they discover bones as a weapon you see the humanoid hitting the bone and break it into smaller pieces. While he is doing it you see it imagining killing another animal. Then you get one of the best cuts in movie history where the now human throws a bone in the air and cuts to a ship. Somehow this part didn't get this an oscar for best makeup. Probably because people didn't realize that it was people dressing up as apes and not actual apes. Since when were you punished for being too good at your craft.Part TwoAfter one of the greatest cuts in movie history you see the spaceships with ""The Blue Danube"" playing in the background. You see the main character of this part Haywood Floyd in a flight to space. He then gets on the ship and you see some of the most mundane dialogue in movie history. Some people use this as a knock on the film saying it makes it boring. To be fair this movie is in many ways boring. But to me that enhances the film. The dialogue is mundane intentionally. It shows how boring human life will become when there is too much technology. He then goes to the Moon because there are mysterious things happening. On the moon they discover that it is the monolith causing what is happening. They try to take a group picture near it but the monolith stops them. It also tells them to go to jupiter. You see it aligning with one of the planets. This part is also great. The best moment in it is when one of the people working on the ship walks in no gravity. The impressive thing about that moment is that since there was no CGI at the time they had to put the person in a rotating room. But it is done so seamlessly you don't notice.Part ThreePart three is called the jupiter mission. In part three you get in my opinion one of the greatest characters in movie history. Dave! Just Kidding. It is actually Hal-9000 the A.I. So many iconic lines. At the beginning you see life on the ship with Dave and Frank. You see Dave jogging with artificial gravity. You find out three other scientists are on the ship hibernating. This turns out to be a horrible decision. Pretty early in you can see that Hal seems to be sentient. In a pretty funny moment in an interview with Dave, Frank and Hal you see the interviewer saying ""I sense pride in his voice"" it is funny because Hal is a robot and always talks in the same voice. Dave goes space walking to fix an antenna Hal can't find what is wrong. This causes Hal to go kind of crazy because he isn't supposed to make any mistakes. Dave and Frank agree to shut off Hal and make sure Hal doesn't hear them. Unfortunately Hal can read their lips and goes rogue. When Frank goes space walking Hal decides to kill him by using the robot to turn off his oxygen. Hal then kills all of the people in hibernation making Dave the only one alive. When Dave goes on his mission he says ""Open the Pod Bay doors Hal"" then Hal says one of the greatest and most iconic lines in movie history ""I'm sorry Dave I am afraid I can't do that"". Around then was when I realized that the way Hal talked made it sound like kind of a psychopath. Dave then shuts off Hal. This part is probably the best part of the movie and that is impressive. It is the original Robot Revolt storyline. Probably still the best.Part 4So this is the part that apparently bothers some people. You see Dave seeing the Monolith and starts investigating it. He happens to align with the Monolith while it is aligning with all of the planets. You then see him go through a color show of travel that is probably interdimensional.. Which eventually leads him to a very Kubrick room. He sees an older version of himself. You then see that older version of himself walk around the place and sees an even older version of himself. That even older version sees a dying version of Dave in a bed looking at the monolith. You then go into the Monolith's point of view and Dave becomes a Star Baby. You then see Dave looking at the earth and then probably breaks the fourth wall as if it is aware of the camera and probably also the audience.. People endlessly theorize what happened. Some people think that this part is extremely confusing and find it annoying because there are no answers. All I can say is that it is intentionally confusing. For me it seems like Dave is evolving into the next form of life. And just like the previous evolution The Monolith caused it to happen. That is just my theory. Unlike what some people think in my opinion no matter what the explanation is it is a great part.Many people think this film is too confusing. I didn't find it too confusing. It is complicated but not confusing. With a film like this you can't just sit there and watch it as if it is star wars. You can't expect it to be the most entertaining thing ever. You are supposed to think. And if you don't like thinking you might not like this. You should still probably watch it because you might discover that you do actually like thinking. If you are anything like me and you do like thinking, watch this film. You will probably like it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
921,richie42,The best science fiction film ever made.,9,16 June 2002,"Yes, it is! (Even James Cameron said so - don't ask me for the reference, I just saw him interviewed on the TV.)It may not be the most exciting SF film ever made, but it is definitely the closest thing ever filmed to future reality. This is because the reality level in this film is extremely high - just a few blunders (see the ""goofs"" page http://us.imdb.com/Goofs?0062622 and look at the ""factual errors"" entries). There are none of the ridiculous explosions, such as those in the ""Star Wars"" series, or ""The Fifth Element"", or the ""Star Trek"" films (don't get me wrong - these films are high up on my favourite movies list), audible through vacuum. (But remember the ""Alien"" tag-line: ""In Space no one can hear you scream""!) I know it sounds good and adds to the occasion and lets the subwoofers rip - BUT IT'S WRONG! Also, there's none of the exploding-eyes-in-a-vacuum rubbish such as in ""Total Recall"" and ""Outland"". (Although Bowman's lungs should have burst when he held his breath while awaiting the explosive bolts to blow. Breathe out next time, Dave!)The reality level is not, however, ""2001""'s winning factor.It is the scope of the film that transcends all other SF movies - ""The Dawn of Man"" to his ultimate incarnation. That is what the movie is about - no mystical mumbo-jumbo. Plain, simple Charles Darwin evolution - a theme that Arthur C Clarke has touched upon in other of his novels and short storys - that of the consciousness developing to the point where it can leave biology (body) and machine (cybernetic extensions) behind and become pure thought; pure logic. (Has ""Trek's"" Spock been reading ACC?)That is not a foetus floating in orbit around Earth at the end - it is a representation of the rebirth of man. (Okay, so there is a little symbolic mumbo-jumbo!)The fact that this film was made *before* man landed on the moon is also another of its great achievements.The greatest achievement?That Stanley Kubrick pulled it off with such scintillating visual prowess.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
922,maxnrisa,An allegorical space opera masterpiece.,9,13 November 2001,"Good Points:  Absolutely everything.  The lovely mating of Arthur C. Clarke's story with (da Man) Stanley Kubrick's directing gives birth to a classic film with a life all its own.  And here we have an interesting case of 'nobody got it, but in a COOL way.'  The meaning behind 2001: A Space Odyssey has been debated since the day it first hit the screen, and this is, without argument, part of its charm.  Clarke and Kubrick take the road less travelled and refuse to spell it out for us.  If asked what it means, no doubt they would with a steely gaze reply, ""What do YOU think it means?"" Absolutely fantastic film in every way.Bad Points:  The only complaint I have about this movie is Kubrick's penchant for stretching things out.  Usually it's appropriate and well-placed, but sometimes not.  I think most would agree that sitting there watching spaceships flit about to classical music is neat for the first three minutes, tiresome by the seventh, and downright boring by the tenth. And if we were going to be forced to watch every move Frank made getting to the A.E.35 unit, could we at least hear something besides that annoying hiss?  Don't get me wrong.  I love Kubrick's work and the man is a genius. But even genuises do something stupid now and again.Bottom Line: 2001 is one of the finest movies we hairless apes have ever made.  The fact that it was made in 1968 only serves to further astound the viewer.  Fantastic story.  Masterful directing.  This is what filmmaking is all about, people.  Watch it or die.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
923,markimdb-6,Why Isn't This Your Favourite Film?,10,28 August 2008,"There are many things in life that baffle me; the world's ongoing fascination with Paris Hilton, the fact that Will Ferrell is a movie star, the inclusion of synchronised swimming as an Olympic event.And why ""2001"" is not the favourite movie of everyone who has seen it.Maybe its because it wears the SF label, but there's not a bug-eyed monster or a ray-gun or a noisy space dogfight in sight. Instead, there is mystery and murder, elegance and the everyday.Maybe its because you have to decide what its about. Kubrick doesn't tell you. (Clarke tells you more if you read the book and Hyams tells you a bit in the sequel.) Is it about Nietzsche's idea that man is the missing link between ape and superman/starchild? Is it about God/god being simply a more evolved species than our own? Is it about natural intelligence versus artificial intelligence? (Both the monolith and HAL have power over humans). Is it about natural emotion versus artificial emotion? (Hal has never been evil to me; he is more like one of those super-intelligent kids who go to university at age 12 and can't cope emotionally with their environment. HAL, to my mind a victim of a form of emotional abuse (after all he is a child of only 9), doesn't know how to lie, but does possess a strong survival instinct.) Maybe its because the dialog is all but meaningless. Hardly anything of significance is spoken. It could almost be done as a silent film, but that would rob us of one of the most emotional scenes in cinema history - HAL begging for his rational life. You do have to listen to this film - but its the music that tells us the story; its the silence that tells us the story; its Dave's breathing that tells us the story.Maybe its because you saw it on TV. This is not a TV movie; its not even a home theatre movie. This is a cinema movie. See it on the big screen. Anything less and its power and beauty diminishes dramatically. Feel it first and then think about it. And let its wonder consume you.""2001"". The. Best. Ever.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
924,crose5,Like no other movie ever made - SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL,10,26 April 2007,"There is really no way to compare this motion picture to any other movie because no one has ever made anything like it and no one ever will. And it really should be seen in a theater to be fully appreciated. At the very least it deserves to be seen with a great sound system.I saw this movie on the day it opened in 1968, my senior year in high school. I went because I like science-fiction and wanted to see a ""space"" movie. Remember this film was made before the first moon landing.There we sat, waiting for it to begin. But, SURPRISE! There was no cartoon, no coming attractions. The theater owner at the Cooper Theatre for some reason chose to play ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" with the lights still up so we all stood, never did that at a movie before or since and then sat down again as it ended. Then the theatre went completely DARK and the strange overture began with the blank screen barely visible.The overture ended and my seat began to VIBRATE as the blue screen with the MGM lion appeared, along with the first deep bass notes, and then my senses were overwhelmed, hearing ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" for the first time in my life. The ride had just begun.(I highly recommend you watch this opening, this film, in a DARK room with your subwoofer turned up as high as possible to get the effect I felt in that theatre.) Of course, it took quite awhile before we got to outer space and the movie that followed was anything but a science-fiction movie. INTERMISSION came (a good thing, highly under-rated and unused these days) and we all looked at each other in wonder, caught our breath, and then the ride resumed, wilder than before.I saw it 7 more times within the next year, always in a real full size theater, like all theaters were before multiplexes. I might have been ""high"" once but I didn't go to see it again and again because I was ""tripping"". I went because I knew I was seeing a work of art. It was SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL; the sound that you could feel in your bones followed by terrifying silence; the sights unimagined and unimaginable; the affection for HAL turning to terror. And of, course, WTF was Kubrick really trying to get across to me? Years and years and many more viewings later, I understand it as well, I think, as I ever will. Read someone else's comments if you're looking for someone to explain it to you or search around the web, you'll find ""explanations"", that's not my purpose in writing these comments.What I hope to do is encourage you to watch it patiently, enjoy it's beauty the way you would enjoy watching a sunset while listening to the most beautiful music you know of (e.g, Gayne Ballet Suite or the Blue Danube); savor it like you would a wonderful meal, sip it like a fine wine; look and listen for the clues and the hidden symbols that ARE there. And then draw your own conclusions. Stanley Kubrick WANTED to SHARE some things with you that he found beautiful and he wanted you to think about where you. a human, came from and where you're headed.If that's too much work for your brain, and you can't see and hear and ponder the beauty and mystery of Kubrick's film, then, pardon my bluntness, but your life is about as meaningful as that of a tapir or a pre-monolith ape. If you want mindless escape, this isn't for you.But if you like sunsets, thunderstorms, harmonies in music, mysteries, and sensuality and can have an open mind this film will add something to your life.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
925,IngmarTheBergman,I am no Kubrick fan but... this was insane.,8,4 December 2011,This was my second viewing of '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The clear message is about evolution. The unclear message nobody knows. However it's an interesting mind puzzle. Basically the plot is about a fleet of astronauts on a mission to Jupiter with a member of they're crew being a robot (HAL-9000). As the rest of they're crew are hibernating two of astronauts begin to get suspicious of HAL.Don't watch this when you're tired or you will miss something. Even if you're awake you will miss something. I don't believe anybody truly understand 2001... not even Stanley Kubrick.I give '2001: A Space Odyssey' 10/10 for being visually stunning and intellectually stunning.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
926,hisham-rojbani,I didn't make any sense,5,25 January 2021,"First things first. So I'm giving it 5 stars Just because of the genius style directing of Stanley Kubrick. With that being said, thank god for the play speeding option in Netflix, also the ten second skip button, oh man that was great too. So the story goes like this apes scene for 25 minutes or so, it was very painful to watch, then a pen rolling in zero gravity scene for some time, then a ship docking for some 15 minutes or so, then ""I'm not at liberty to talk about it"" cliche, then another scene of ship floating around for more than 10 minutes, then a high frequency sound. then another space ship heading to Jupiter, then a computer want to be a skynet of some sort, and oh there is an intermission in this movie do you believe that? then an elongated scene of lines coming at you for more that 10 minutes, then a guy looking at himself eating looking at him self in a bed looking at a monolith looking back at a baby in a sac looking at earth !! then roll credits. does that make sense? I mean what the hell was that?
One thing I concluded from this movie is ""Moon landing was not a hoax, and Kubrick did not direct it"" green screens or whatever they used at the time were very obvious.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
927,arkos4440,A cinematic journey through the mind and space.,9,21 February 2012,"As is the case with many of his other works, Stanley Kubrick brings this bizarrely epic and philosophical sci-fi to life with a powerful usage of Mise-en-scene. I found this particular aspect of the film impressive, as he crafts a convincing future with the unique use of lighting, sets, and various other elements of design. Every room in every location feels as thought it was built with meticulous complexity, as if this cannot be an imagined world but one that has been captured for the sake of the film. This quality, which is so immersed into the narrative of the film that it is almost unnoticeable with close analysis, makes the intense and difficult story come to life in a way that makes its deep yet arduous plot compelling and believable. With unique camera work, the elements of design and composition use the unusual costumes, sets, and lighting to create a movie that is as surreal as the human mind but as realistic as nonfiction, making it a powerful viewing experience.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I had never seen a black monolith at the foot of someone's deathbed before. Not in real life, not in a movie. I probably never will. They don't seem to serve any purpose. They aren't particularly decorative. I think we can dispense with them.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The Oppisite Of This Movie,5,18 July 2021,"Ill keep this short because if you're debating watching this movie, you're already about to waste 2 and 1/2 hours of your life. This is possibly one of the worst paced pieces of media I've ever seen period. I can't put into words the amount of times you will be sitting there and wondering why nothing has happened in 7 minutes; no dialogue, no story or character development, no music, no information. I feel like this could have easily been put into an hour and 20 minute movie. I have to give credit to its revolutionary nature in cinema, a sort of backbone for science fiction, one of my favorite genres, and the acting isn't too bad but with the pacing issues, disproportioned props and an overall odd experiences, I do not recommend this for a favorable viewing experience.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
931,snottyscotty150,2001: A Space Bordity,3,19 May 2007,"Lets start with this film for what it is, OK it's a SPACE film, its set in a big space of nothing. So why does it start with gorillas? this film is meant to show the evolution of man and the overall film is just like nothing I have ever seen...it's just nothing happens and a really really boring film.Nothing can beat the opening music to this film everyone knows it from some form or another, however thats probably the only good thing about this film, it takes a total of about 45 minutes for anyone to actually say anything with the first lines being ""Here you are, sir"", for the first half of this film I thought I was watching an episode of WILD LIFE ON ONE or something waiting for David Attenborough to say the famous works of ""here we have..."" or waiting for some form of sex to happen, however to my disappointment i wasted a total of 45 minutes watching this poor film, then when it does pick up and the space actually hits you...your either asleep or like me wanting to change the film...still i stuck with it.The part when it does kick in its so slow....the music is dull I was turning emo, but thats not my biggest dig, it's just NOTHING happens, OK I would rather have had two and a half hours of a romantic flick than this poor film. Its slow it's like sitting outside and watching the sky while sometimes hitting your self on the head with a massive stick to stay awake. It's also very much like watching someone with a load of cutouts. I mean come on the space stations are poor, you would see better in a primary school art room.This film however does have some good points, in that it's 3 stories about space. The first story is pretty slow seriously it just doesn't pick up on anything to make you want to watch it or even pay attention it's like they could have made in interesting I mean come on it's SPACE, but I guess that they where trying to make it seem as real as possible. If they where trying to make it as real as possible that was probably a bad idea because who wants to see people moving really slowly in a space ship they would be as much fun as being in a washing machine (in fact being in space for real in 1968 would probably have been like being in a washing machine) this film had so much potential, and OK the comment about the space stations was abit out of order they do look pretty good.The second story is the only good one with the HAL computer that one i only know because of Recess and the simpsons, but either way it is the best one of the stories in this film, and does try to be a good horror (if they remade this story it would be SO good, like Event Horizon or something and would be really good...in fact I think that might be the idea where Event Horizon come from however Event Horizon is just a better film) the one thing I didn't get at the end of this film was the ending but then I didn't pay attention to the rest of the film in all fairness I was more fixed on looking at my fish tank (which by the way at the moment has no fish in it - yes thats how interesting this film is) but maybe I don't want to understand the end of this film because people who have watched it and liked it say that you have to be intelligent to understand it.You have to be intelligent to understand it? OK I don't watch a film to use my head after it and work out the meaning of life and the fact that we are all made of carbon and may have evolved from apes and we could have been made out of silicon if there wasn't so much of some substance in the air (like that blob from star trek), or we may have evolved into something else due to different conditions or we are going to evolve into something else like the Borg.To be honest I watch a film to watch a film...that probably makes no sense but I watch a film to forget everything else around me I don't watch one and turn to the person next to me and say ""yo...did you know we may have evolved from apes?"" then get into a massive debate during the film...though that may have been a way to make this poor film go faster.In fact heres an idea you know that most people skip the first 30 minutes of superman and watch it from when he goes to the city....with this film you can just skip it to the HAL computer story watch that for 30 minutes then go to bed it would be like watching the Recess version but only its the film that its based on...in fact just watch the Recess version it's what 15 minutes and way more fun.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Yes, it's a little out-dated now.. but that's not why I didn't like it that much. I don't understand how people rate this a 10 and say ""THIS MOVIE IS FLAWLESS AND WILL BE THE BEST MOVIE FOR THE REST OF ETERNITY."" This movie is beyond far from the best movie ever. It COULD'VE been.. but it wasn't. My title says it all. This movie DRAGGED the hell on. I am completely serious, halfway through the movie I had to take Advil so that I was able to sit through the rest of it. The opening scene was great storytelling and a brilliant idea for the movie. But how long was this scene? 20-30ish minutes? That way too frickin long. I don't know what they were thinking with the decision to drag this on so much. This scene shouldve been around 10 minutes MAX.This goes for all of the random (black screen scenes, drawn-out scenes of space) scenes. I truly wanted to like this movie as everyone else.

I refuse to watch it on video as this could only be detrimental the the whole 2001 experience.

935,Paul P,I feel left out of the 2001 love-fest.,4,23 January 1999,"I wish I could appreciate this movie as much as most film buffs seem to.  I do admire some of its imagery--the cut between the bone and the space vehicle, the star child, etc.  The use of music is very effective.  And I suppose some of the special effects were impressive at the time.  But from the standpoint of storytelling, 2001 really leaves me cold.(1) The pace, at times. . .actually the whole time. . .is excruciatingly slow.  This includes several endless minutes of ugly and gratuitous special effects that start immediately after going into the monolith near Jupiter. When people talk about the the movie's technical superiority, they never seem to mention this part.  I guess I don't mind a movie taking its time to get to a good payoff, but this crawling progression is ridiculous. Additionally, no payoff ever really comes, which leads to my next complaint.. .(2) I don't care for the way the film fails to explain itself.  I truly defy anybody to understand what the monoliths are, or what happens in the end, without having read the novel.  I read the book several years after first seeing the movie, and was filled with much more wonder by it.  If Clarke did not mind revealing what his story meant, why did Kubrick have to be so stubborn in making it all so mysterious?  It's one thing to be ambiguous or suggestive.  It's another to make no sense at all.(3) There are no characters that can be identified with.  While others say this is part of the film's genius, I heartily disagree.  The expressionless humans are actually more creepy than HAL.I met an aspiring director once who told me he thought 2001 was the best movie ever made.  When I asked him to explain why, one thing he mentioned was that it was great to watch in the 70s with a room full of people who were stoned.  Maybe I was born too late.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Perhaps if I hadn't read the book, I would have been intrigued with the events as they were portrayed (HAL's voice was sufficiently unemotional yet menacing).  Unfortunately, I did read it, and it seemed that the movie was just a preview of the novel. Throughout the movie I was intently focused on other things... call me jaded if you want, but the movie taught me one thing, and that is, see the movie first, then read the way it is supposed to be.

The film leaves a great many ""how"" and ""why"" questions unanswered - and perhaps that's for the best.  The movie leaves us with a few questions to ponder, and that's probably the way it should be.

I had forgotten just how boring it was and the magic of watching models rotate slowly to nice music has gone.The entry to Jupiter really dated the film in the 1960's and reminded me of the trip sequence in ""Easy Rider"". The opening ape sequence was reminiscent of ""Planet of The Apes"" though both films appeared in the same year so who borrowed what I know not.Having seen ""The Dish"" a few days previously, the magic and mystique of outer space does exist for me, but sadly not from this film so rooted in the 1960's",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It is a use of cinematic language that requires no real storyline and very little dialogue.  This is the classic ""a picture is worth a thousand words.""  It is almost imperative to have the experience in a theater and I originally saw it at the Hollywood Cinerama Dome.  The first sequence with the primates is deftly handled as the primates do actually seem as human as they are ape (noted that many miss the point that they are not meant to appear to be like modern apes).  The marvelous symbology showing the first use of tools and the brief instant the bone is tossed in the air to become a space vehicle is one of the most stunning in all of cinematic history. There is a conscious effort of the director to communicate the emptiness of space as a metaphor for the emptiness of life.  We don't know where we are going and we really don't care as a race. That brings us into the concept of HAL as the villain of the piece, our technology which is suppose to make everything right suddenly makes everything wrong.  The final sequence? Again, a cinematic voyage into a profound and portentous future that await us all.  This isn't a pretentious or boring subject to me and the way in which Kubrick left us to interpret the meaning of the film is it's prime success.  Read the original book and you still will get more than what Clarke could communicate with the written word from this filmed version.  I can see why there is are prejudices against this film by viewers and critics alike, but I personally don't understand the dissension.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
941,TheUnholyPeanut,"A Deep, Thought Provoking, and Beautiful Sci-Fi Masterpiece.",10,6 April 2021,"Kubrick already was an amazing director with masterpieces like Paths of Glory and Dr. Strangelove, but he never reached the level of ""One of the greatest movies ever made"" until 2001: A Space Odyssey, and it without a doubt will always hold that title.First, The Characters. While the Characters in 2001: A Space Odyssey do not really have a lot of character development, this does not affect the film in a bad way. HAL, who does not have much development, is obviously still a great character. HAL is perfectly designed as a character, as his visual style and look invokes a sense of fear and wonder, as you can see the evil looming red eye, as if it was a always watching presence. HAL's visual design makes the scenes he is in so much more more intimidating, especially the scene where he kills Frank and the other astronauts. What is ironic about HAL is that he is the most human of all the characters, since he is able to feel emotions, have art appreciation, lip reading, and even human intelligence levels. This is the exact opposite for the human characters, such as Dave and Frank, because the humans only follow the tasks they are given such as fixing the iconic Discovery One ship. This proves that HAL basically represents how A. I has evolved to match humans. Dave, while not having much character development also represents the stages of human evolution, as by the end of the film, we see him touch the monolith inside the bedroom, and become the Star Child, which represents ""a new beginning.""Next, I will discuss the amazing cinematography and directing. 2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the most beautiful movies ever made, as director Stanley Kubrick uses multiple wide-shots in space to not only show you the amazing spectacle of this film and space in general, but to increase the tension as you start to feel that the characters are basically trapped in a death chamber with HAL, and there is nothing to save them in the vast empty space they are in. This makes every scene, especially in the third act much more intense, which makes you on the edge of your seat for the rest of the film. The production value in this film is so good, that it is also worth noting. Everything feels so real, because it actually was, there was no screens or matte's used in this film. From the Stargate sequence, to the Centrifugal Walk sequence, everything is real, which makes the film experience much more enjoyable because it makes you, the audience feel like everything that is happening in front of your eyes is something that exists in this reality, something that really happened, which makes the overall spectacle so much more amazing.2001: A Space Odyssey is also a extremely well acted film. Douglas Rain is perfectly able to play HAL 9000, as he perfectly does an emotionless voice (Ironic, since usually emotionless acting is bad.) Douglas Rain is extremely underrated, but still stands out in this film as his cold, emotionless, voice makes HAL much more intimidating and terrifying in every scene he speaks or even appears in. The acting for the crewmates were also great, as Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood greatly play Bowman and Poole. A complaint about the acting is that it is too emotionless, however, this is ok considering that the acting connects to the theme that sometimes A. I is more humans then humans themselves. The script in 2001: A Space Odyssey is also amazing, as the dialogue is surprisingly great. One of the best pieces of dialogue, in my opinion is the final pieces of dialogue HAL ever has, as it lets the audience knows that even HAL, the homicidal robot who caused all the evil and terror inside the Discovery One, can even feel fear and terror for himself. The soundtrack is also great, and although not original, still fits every scene in this filmFinally, I will have to talk about the symbolism and themes. I will not be talking about all of it since there is way too much, and so I only be talking about the major themes and symbolism. One of the major pieces of symbolism is The monolith. The monolith is some sort of an alien entity, which represents the transitions in the history of human evolution, as whenever the monolith is around it seems to transition human evolution, which basically makes it ""an odyssey of mankind."" Another major piece of symbolism in this film seems to be the bone in the beginning, which represents the theme that technology is rapidly evolving, and that since mankind started weapons are one of the things that have made humans powerful, as the bone is much more efficient then the apes hands.With an intelligent screenplay with complex themes, deep and thought provoking characters, and some of the best cinematography and directing in any film, 2001: A Space Odyssey is without a doubt an absolutely amazing masterpiece, and one of the greatest films ever made.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

943,baba_vida,Not so enjoyable nowadays.,6,22 July 2015,"You know that solid blue color painting that sold on an auction for 50M USD? My thoughts on this movie are exactly the same. Super heavy trippy video with screaming music at you for 20 minutes can be looked upon as super heavy meaningful moment so deep our minds cant and will not comprehend anything below a scratch of the surface, because its so godlike, or you know it can just actually be a trippy video with screaming music... Definitely leaning towards that. I did expect an awful much from this movie based on its popularity and rating, but received so little in return. I mean i watched it, evolved my theory on the events, read the reviews afterwards and was like ""so thats it, nothing else?"" 2 hours of music screams for a piece of alien rock to give monkeys a stick and send an astronaut into galaxy school. And all of the events in between not really doing much to advance the plot or develop it. I understand watching an hour of footage of a person flying into a space station and then landing on the moon as it was a normal plane flight between two states would be highly impressive 40 years ago, but we are a bit more spoiled now to admire that with an open mouth. You'd say go watch a brainless thriller like die hard or smth, this movie is actually for those who enjoy using their own brains and think and i'd reply i already thought about everything this movie offers and if it was 15 instead of 140 minutes i wouldn't be missing receiving a thing from it. I read somewhere this movie is more appreciated nowadays than when it came out and could not disagree more. If that was true then this would be the one and only surprise this movie ever provided for me. Sorry for the rant :/",2001 - A Space Odyssey

945,seanwilson556,One man's interesting view of humanity,10,17 July 2011,"And that man is Stanley Kubrick. And the film is 2001: A Space Odyssey. The science fiction film of all science fiction films (well along with Metropolis and Bladerunner). An outstanding achievement in special effects, space travel, complex storytelling, scientific realism, surrealism and just filmmaking in general, 2001 boggles the mind with Mankind's most enduring and interesting philosophical questions.Who are we? Why are we here?And some interesting and probably more appealing questions to the public such as: What else is out there? Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood who play astronauts seek to answer that question but Stanley Kubrick seeks to raise the other questions. Questions that we may never find out. But 2001 raises these questions with powerful images and outstanding special effects.A two and a half hour visual treat that really has withstood the test of time (well apart from some minor things), 2001 captures the mind with its eerie soundtrack, inspiring effects, powerful symbolism and story. A story that certainly takes its time but never bores. The most amazing thing is: the story lies in the mind of the viewer. What does the viewer think of the meaning of life? Why we exist? Are there extraterrestrials out there in other galaxies? Kubrick wisely doesn't try to strictly answer those questions but certainly fills the mind with wonder at his ideas and theories on the screen. Some you may not agree with, others you might. But he never gives you a flat out answer.Starting years and years back to our ancestor apes and fast forwarding to 2001 where space travel is frequent and mankind has lost touch. Despite the awe and wonder of the Solar System, Dr Heywood Floyd is sound asleep on a flight to an orbiting space station and again on his flight to the Moon. Astronauts Dave Bowman (Dullea) and Frank Poole (Lockwood) are quiet and distant men. Frank Poole doesn't even spark up an emotion when watching his birthday celebration from his parents back home on Earth. Kubrick nailed it. We are losing touch with humanity. Like the characters in 2001, we constantly rely on technology. The astronauts consistently rely on HAL, a supercomputer, who keeps frequent watch over the space shuttle Discovery One. Technology isn't always reliable for obvious reasons. And you see that in 2001.Kubrick once famously stated that 2001's deepest psychological level is ""the search for God, and it finally postulates what is little less than a scientific definition of God"". A statement that stuck with me ever since reading it, Kubrick also raises the ultimate religious question: Is there a God? Controversial straight away, 2001 shows us that God could just be a metaphysical creation. God could be the cosmos itself. We look up at the night skies and see a vast and wonderful array of stars, planets, suns and galaxies. We could be staring at God everyday without knowing it. God watches over us from the heavens. A spiritual being, the creator of the Universe, the Man who has eternal existence, God could just be a nickname for Universe. The Universe is vast, limitless and timeless, ever expanding (from what we know so far), watches over us (philosophically) and has a great amount of power like mankind's view of God. I know that's a touching subject and I don't necessarily believe it as it is just a theory but Kubrick is telling us to think about life and these surrounding questions. It makes you think.A tense, sometimes creepy, enlightening and moving film, Kubrick's 2001 is his penultimate mystery tale (The Shining comes very close). It manages to haunt the mind with questions we may never find the answer to. But ultimately, it shows us a bright light at the end of a dark tunnel telling us we might still have hope. Hope to survive, to live perhaps forever...",2001 - A Space Odyssey

947,Mr_Hulot,Magnificent and deliberately mysterious,10,21 August 2002,"Spoilers ahead.2001: a Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful film by the late Stanley Kubrick.  This is not a film that you watch in order to be entertained or amused.  Instead it provides you with a banquet of food for thought, images that linger in the mind's eye long after the movie itself is over.  It is a film that you could meditate on.     The film intentionally offers us more questions then it can answer,  it is made to puzzle and mystify, but leaves the viewer nevertheless with a sense of awe and reverence (that is allowing that he has engaged himself in the process of viewing it, enjoyment of this film requires some effort on the viewers part)  the questions that it does pose are large and ominous, concerning the genesis and destiny of the human race, it's ultimate place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of some creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself.     The first of the films Four Quartets gives us a distinct view of the species past.  We see our distant ancestors, half-ape half human, in a state of near starvation.  The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and the vegetarian beasts are near starvation.  An extra-terestial object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by it's presence to tool-making and violence.  They are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when two tribes encounter each other near a water source, the tribe that has developed tool making capacity, as well as beligerence, soundly destroys the neighboring tribe. The new chief of the winning tribe, empowered by the first vestiges of technology triumphantly throws the bone that he used as a weapon in the air. We see the bone transformed into a floating satellite, which contains nuclear weapons.  We soon learn that the world is torn apart by nuclear paranoia.  The characteristics inspired by the monument's appearance that once helped us to survive now threaten our very existence.     Once again humanity is in crisis, once again the unearthly presence represented by the black monolith will step in to aid humanity in the next step in it's development.  On an exploration of the Moon a monolith identical to the earlier one we have seen is discovered.  The governments of the world, normally mortal enemies, have come together in secret to discuss the implications.  A mission is arranged. the monument has been engaged in some kind of radio communication with Jupiter.  A few men will travel to the destination of the transmission.  Most of them will, for most of the time, be kept in a state of suspended animation.  The pilot of the spacecraft will be HAL a super computer who has been programmed to imitate all  of the traits of human beings.     The film has many outstanding sequences.  As usual for Kubrick the use of classical music is outstanding.  Most memorable are ""Blue Danube"" and ""Also Spake Zarathustra"" (particularly appropriate given the film's theme of transcending ordinary consciousness.)  The cinematography is particularly excellent as well, after a single viewing the film's final 30 minutes will haunt you for the rest of your life.     The character of HAL is the most important from the view of the film's central thesis.  In imitating all the characteristics of human beings he comes to have their negative traits as well.  The paranoia he develops which almost leads to the mission' s ruin is an exact mirror of the paranoia that has allowed the political situation back on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis.  The film suggests that these are the traits that we must leave behind if we are to proceed to the next phase in our evolution.     The architecture of the film is also meaningful.  The designs of many of the spacecraft are intended to suggest reproductive organs and the process of birth and rebirth, the central motif of the movie.  The ending of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed.     This movie takes a view of life similar to that presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finnegan's Wake.  It posits a pattern to history and human evolution that is cyclic, yet progressive, repeating the same events at large intervals, yet with the human race as developing according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind. Though we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not meant for failure, it's destiny is grand beyond it's capacity to imagine.  It continues to amaze me that in spite of this film many people continue to regard Kubrick as a misanthrope.     This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any specific creed, but because of it's invocation of wonder at the vast panorama of existence and it's involvement with the deepest and most vital questions of purpose and truth.       In the hands of any other director, this would all be perhaps a little too much.  Hollywood's view of life is too puny, usually to encompass the grandeur and intensity of a vision such as this one.  But Kubrick was a visionary, he directs with utter confidence, not only that he can handle material of this kind, but that he is the only one to do it.  The process of making this film used all of his creative resources.  The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in cinematic history. Kubrick had to invent some of the special effects that were used in the movie's astounding climax.  The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at the time, so he brought them into existence.

Kubrick and Clarke spent many moons evolving a postwar story by a young visionary (Clarke) and crafting it into a timely (the landing on the Moon in real life) and timeless epic about us, it and them.Visually and aurally stunning, with effects from 1960's psychedelia to some of the best outer (and inner) space photography to this day, this film - even if you don't comprehend it - is still a standard of the potential of cinema to take us where we only dream.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
949,hok_herman,Way overrated,3,5 January 2005,"What is it with people and saying this movie is great? I have the feeling people are scared to criticize Mr. Kubrick. They're obviously not scared of Kubrick, but scared of others that might say they're not intelligent or laugh at them because they don't ""understand"" the movie. Get a grip.This is my review. A review of a film fan who watches at least 2 movies a week. Someone who likes to watch some action but can also enjoy a drama or a movie that's supposed to make you think. All different genres have a few movies in them that I find awesome, although genres like drama aren't actually my thing.My rating for this movie was 3/10. Now why on earth would I give such a low rating? I'll start with the good things about the movie. The visuals are stunning. For the time the special effects are brilliant and Kubrick pulled some very nice tricks. Bravo. The plot is pretty good too. There it is, the base for a good movie. Then it went wrong...The movie is boring beyond bearable levels. I'm sorry, but staring a a spaceship docking for 5 minutes while classic music plays isn't exactly what I'd call brilliant. Every single scene is long, slow and boring. The first 30 minutes of the movie are the worst of all. 30 minutes of monkey's dancing around a large black brick. Awful.I really really don't understand the people that praise this movie. It's not art, it's not entertainment, it's pure agony. I would consider it art if the movie lasted half an hour. Movies were made for entertainment or in some cases, art. This movie seemed to be created to make people fall asleep. I'm not ignorant and I am not scared to say: This Kubrick movie sucks beyond your imagination. There's no deeper meaning to it, there no artistic value but the genius of the special effects, which is simply not enough to save this piece of junk. Don't watch it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
950,rafsilva24,"Revolutionary,",6,22 May 2020,"I have a lot of mixed feelings about this movie.
First of all. I like food for thought and definitely this movie is a rich source of it. I really enjoy philosophical and existential questions, this movies raises them. It was an original, creative and most of all revolutionary representation of these questions adding a lot of value to the industry of cinema, specially to sci-fi genre. The photography is amazing for that time. But I have a problem, I am watching it in 2020 for the first time and I am not that young anymore... I like the space given for ourselves in this movie...i already found many ways to interpret it and many of them can even be interconnected...that's the best part of the movie...many nice philosophical theories. That is the genial part of the movie. The script of the second part (the only part with one in fact) is just very poor... I guess the acting does not help, but the takes are just not good...One can argue that it was on purpose to focus on the main idea of the movie...but for me it was a waste... The part of the machine slowly dying was a really bad scene... the dialogues in general were just so poor... I would almost have preferred an even slower and completely silent movie... (even though in my opinion that would cut some sense of the movie, because the voice is an important part of the second stage of men's evolution in this movie) I am just not satisfied.

951,mr_deadly,"Profound, Ambitious, Pretentious",8,22 June 2011,"2001 is one of those films that every serious movie fan should see--it is iconic, occasionally brilliant, highly cinematic and very ambitious. It is also ponderous, emotionally detached, and pretentious.The plot is simple yet enigmatic. Chimp-like apes, who are human ancestors, are surprised to awake one morning and find a large featureless monolith in their camp. This monolith, through powers and methods unexplained, seems to set this particular group of primates on a new evolutionary course--they start using bone tools and eating meat, and they use their new-found abilities to triumph in battle against another troop of apes. The triumphant ape tosses his bone tool into the air--as it spins, the bone becomes a spacecraft. The implication is that the monolith somehow spurred human evolution, ultimately resulting in space-flight and the high-tech world we are in for the remainder of the film.The story next follows a bland VIP who is traveling from Earth to a space station, and then onto the moon, to investigate a mysterious artifact. A monolith identical to the one which visited the apes in the prologue has been discovered buried on the moon, and the Americans who found it are keeping it secret. As our VIP completes his long journey to the moon monolith he reaches out and touches it and there is a loud humming sound. The film then makes another cut--time has passed and we are now seeing a long-range spacecraft which is bound for Jupiter. It is explained (eventually) that the monolith on the moon broadcast a powerful signal to Jupiter, which prompts the Americans to send a team to Jupiter to investigate. We are introduced to the crew--two are conscious crewmen, others are in suspended animation awaiting revival once Jupiter is reached, and overseeing all is Hal, a sentient computer. Hal is a very good chess player, but less expected, he appreciates drawing, is excellent at facial recognition, and can read lips. He eventually goes insane. Hal says the ship's antenna is going to fail in 72 hours. When the antenna is examined no flaw is found. No Hal 9000 has ever made an error so the human crew becomes suspicious. Is Hal's error a sign that worse things are to come? Yes. Hal becomes paranoid and suspicious of the human crew--after lip-reading a discussion where the possibility of shutting down Hal's higher functions is raised, Hal rationalizes that his own survival is more vital to the mission than the survival of the crew. One of the astronauts is murdered during a space walk, the crew in hibernation have their life support terminated, and the second astronaut is only able to save himself by taking extraordinary measures. This is the most exciting and suspenseful sequence in the film, and Hal's pleading and rationalizing once he realizes that he's going to be lobotomized is quite entertaining. Our sole surviving astronaut, cut off from communication with Earth, enters the Jovian system and finds another monolith in orbit. What follows is abstract. He gets into one of his small space-pods and heads toward the Jovian monolith and appears to fall into a wormhole--he travels some undetermined distance in space and/or time and finds himself in an elegantly appointed room. He lives in this room for some time--he ages markedly over the next few minutes of the film. As he's eating a meal, looking decades older (where this food and where this room came from is unexplained but it must be related to the monoliths), he sees a very old version of himself in bed. A monolith is now in the room. As the very old version of himself reaches out to this monolith there's a transformation--the very old man becomes a fetus-- the Star-Child. Looking human yet more advanced, this Star-Child represents the next stage in human evolution. Just as the monolith at the beginning of the film spurred the apes into eventually becoming modern humans, so this monolith at Jupiter seems to have spurred the next big step in human evolution.What makes this movie great? The music is terrific--the classical score is perfect. The special effects are extraordinary--Kubrick's attention to detail is meticulous, and the stately pacing and utter silence of the space scenes are admirably accurate. Hal is a terrific character. There are some amazing shots and cuts--the bone becoming a space ship is very famous, Hal's red-eye gaze is brilliant and his soothing tone of voice is perfect, and the Star-Child at the end of the film is justifiably famous. Flaws? The acting is wooden and, other than Hal, the characters are uninteresting. The pacing is often slow, the tone is cold and detached. By making a case for intelligent design (even if the 'designers' are aliens instead of God) Kubrick gives weight to the erroneous notion that human evolution was nudged along by God.2001 is a flawed masterpiece.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
952,ModKuraika,A questionable drama of tediousness and hibernation.,6,1 January 2011,"I am a bit late at checking out this film. I had been interested in Stanley Kubrick's works after The Shining and A Clockwork Orange. I find myself wondering what the plot is meant to be in 2001: A Space Odyssey. For the majority of this film I was bored. Don't get me wrong, I'm no Roland Emmerich fanatic. Nevertheless, this film suffers from what I feel is an overabundance of visual medium. Stanley Kubrick was an artist, and brought a style to his film-making I quite enjoyed in the films mentioned beforehand. Say what you want about Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, but it has a focus, it knew exactly what it wanted to be. With this film, I stand confused at it's conclusion.A story of evolution intrigued me, the introduction tickled my fancy. The monolith of course had me confused, as intended by Kubrick, and I can see the impact such a mysterious object could be towards the film. Though, there is no speculation upon what the monolith is by what could be called the protagonists, and no real pay off for what you are initially curious about, and yet only see three times in the film.The film's most interesting aspect were the scenes with HAL 9000 progressively malfunctioning, losing it's ""mind"" and turning against the obsolete beings in it's sense of superiority. So then you may believe that the film is meant to be of the horror genre. Then that's dismissed when HAL is put out of commission and Bowman is swallowed by a separate monolith which takes him through an initially interesting and spectacular but easily tiring phenomena. He finds himself aging in different points of view, and ends up old man on his death bed, before the monolith appears once again, turning him into a fetus-like form encased in a orb of light, looking over Earth. Alright, I get the symbolism, but what's the point?I just feel that the film would have worked more as a slow building thriller, with HAL 9000 as the main antagonist. Instead we have this overbearing, ideological dribble. After about the 5th time I saw a work of machinery take much longer than need be to function, seemingly only to drag out every tiring scene just a little more aggravatingly longer.In conclusion, wasted potential. A form of art that grows stale in overabundance. If any praise is to be given, it is to the special effects, which I will give credit where credit is due. The special effects are definitely ahead of their time. Other than that, well...nothing, really.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
953,falloutboy72,2001: Space Odyssey,10,22 May 2011,"It is hard to review your favorite movie of all time, especially one that relies heavily on existentialism. Kubrick's beautiful 2001 is a bold movie. Opening with many minutes of darkness, with Also Sprach Zarathustra creeping in, the viewer realizes there in for a unique journey.The movie opens with the evolution of man kind; a group of apes that discover tools; the beginning of war, two groups of apes that fight with there newly discovered weapons over a watering hole. This is a thirty minute sequence with no talking, no voice over. The movie is split into four different parts, with Dr. Bowman's group of astronaut's going on a mysterious journey being the main part of the story.As previously stated, there is very little talking. There is many scenes in space that will have classical music playing, classical songs that are very well known because of this movie. At one point a astronaut goes to fix a ship with The Blue Danube Waltz playing, and it almost narrates what the astronaut is doing. The top comments on "" The Blue Danube Waltz"" video on youtube are both about 2001, and almost all videos for Also Sprach Zarathustra are the scenes from 2001.On a technical level there is almost no arguing that this is the most technically sophisticated movie ever. Space looks extraordinary and the sets are marvelous. In Parts Two and Three you can't help but just be amazed by the spaceship, the black void outside, even small things, like the space suits. The camera angles are amazing, especially in the climax in Part Three.For what little talking there is, the actors and script are some of the finest in the history of cinema. HAL is an amazing character and acted with such a monotone voice it almost has the opposite effect of monotone.

954,sahan-c-fernando,A classic!!!!,9,11 January 2012,"So few films are made that makes you stare at the credits amazed, confused, awestruck. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a movie that accomplishes just that. Based on the story by Arthur C. Clarke, 2001 tells the story of man's attempts to uncover an ancient monolith buried in space with the aid of an AI named HAL.The script, the sound-track, the backdrops, the special effects of this film are just amazing. But in my opinion perhaps the directors got a tad carried away with the scale of the special effects that there were many minutes of unnecessary screen time deployed on them. That being said the special effects were in fact way ahead of it's time.The script written by Arthur C. Clarke himself (along with director Kubrick) is just brilliant. 2001 deals with mankind's obsession on exploration and its over-dependence on machinery. When watching this movie I couldn't help but notice the similarities between the technology portrayed in the film and the technology we use now- more evidence of the indisputable brilliance of the coalition of Clarke and Kubrick.On a closing note: this film is a must watch and an evident classic. It will keep you glued to the spot up until its unique albeit confusing end...",2001 - A Space Odyssey
955,preston_peace,Quietly loud message,9,22 August 2014,"The best sci-fi films explore human nature, not just technology advancement. 2001: a Space Odyssey expertly shows the human need to interpret our world. The film warns us to be cautious about advancing and makes us say, ""Maybe we should slow down. After all, humans can be frighteningly stupid."" Instead of screaming the message, Kubrick uses a long, long quiet that makes us uncomfortable. We are smart enough to know we're going too fast in our pursuit of change, but we like the idea of new; we want to know what's next. But if there's constant change, there's no time to reflect and measure the worth of change. We humans are uncomfortable with too much quiet because our nature is the need to advance, to change, to make noise. This movie makes you wonder--during all that quiet--if change is actually good for us. Watch this film to be reminded that no matter how much we evolve in technology, we need to constantly look at who we have become. And that's where it gets uncomfortable, because while we recognize that we must get better, being human means we won't be without flaws.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
956,adamcastillofeb,Have you ever wanted to know what an acid trip is like but never wanted to try drugs? Watch this movie!!,9,17 October 2021,The movie's title is a perfect description of what this film is when the credits roll you genuinely feel like you just got back from a voyage that left to answer the questions of the universe this film was made a few years before a new hope and still somehow looks more breathtaking than the remastered versions of all three of the original Star Wars movies and I think that is all because of how meticulous Kubrick is with the camera he truly has the eye of renaissance painter in a interview Kubrick stated he wanted the viewer to leave the film with an experience of just coming back from exploring the subconscious and he wanted the viewer to have the same experience we do when we listen to classical music we all have different emotions when we listen to such pieces so he relies on imagery more instead of using a traditional narrative to plot his movie so if by the end of the movie you feel lost don't worry you're not alone or if you find you don't have the seem theories as other people do online that's ok too there is no wrong answer in defining what this movie is about it was designed to give each viewer there own unique thought provoking journey.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
957,LadyCardinalJenny,Stanley Kubrick's Masterpiece,10,23 March 2021,"Watching 2001: A Space Odyssey is like staring into the eyes of the Mona Lisa. It is a glimpse into the future, or - the past, present, AND future. Where we were, where we are, and where we are going.Stanley Kubrick displays a wide arrange of camera work that has become unparalleled in this film. From the wide angle shots in space, all the way to the rotating sets, and color coordinated consistencies.In short this film is a masterpiece. Not only is it one of the best films ever made, it may very well be THE best film ever shot.The themes here may vary from viewer to viewer, but what is made clear here is that the theme is ""dehumanization"". Putting all of our faith and control into computers and technology and how ultimately they very well may lead to our demise. What stands important is our own humanity, which in turn is always evolving.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
958,ttornak,A symphony,10,11 July 2005,"I saw 2001 for the first time at the age of 11, and quit some time after the docking sequence. It was slow, didn't make any sense, lacked any form of action (dramatically or otherwise) and I couldn't relate to the characters. There wasn't even a single good line in sight.I gave it another chance at the age of 18 and this time I was ready for it. It showed me that time could be just as impressive as the vastness of the universe. It told me about the nature of humans and life, about what is history and therefore, what is not. At the same time, it celebrated and mocked human intelligence and science.But mostly, it made me realize humans are part of this universe. There's no clear division between us humans, what we call nature and the universe. Fairly basic, I admit, but everyday news often leads you to belief differently.For the first time I watched a movie that wasn't about the plight of individuals or groups of people, but about the human race.This must be one of the most pretentious movies and to succeed in such an enterprise is beyond comprehension. If compared with music, it didn't behave like a rock-song, but a symphony which has many layers and ways to appreciate it. And like a true classic, it stands alone.Are there any mistakes ? Not a real mistake, but something that could have been done differently. The 'trip' bowman takes to his final destination seems very sixties-like, but that's about all I could find.Only 3 movies received a 10 from me, this is one of them and without any doubt the most important.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
959,jeuk,Kubrick was A brilliant Director!,5,19 December 2005,"Before I state anything, let me first say I have the utmost respect for Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C.Clarke, who penned this screenplay. Kubrick is also among my favorite directors, but I have started to watch this masterpiece several times and only managed to see it through on a couple of occasions! There is something about this effort that kills off the insomniac in me. When I first saw this movie in 1969, just before the first moon landing, people were actually holding conversations in the cinema as the film was playing, and I was more interested in what they were saying than I was in the plot! An irate, highbrow friend informed me I was not ready for this futuristic essay, along with just about everyone in the movie theater! At that time this movie had received monster reviews from just about every film critic on Earth, but apart from my learn-ed friend, no one else seemed to think much of this film! In around 2002 my son, who is an avid Kubrick fan, good for him, bought this DVD and states it is the best that Kubrick ever made! I tried to watch it with him and fell asleep before the halfway stage. He kept prodding me awake to explain what he thought was going on. I knew what was going on, but it's just fiction and by definition should be entertaining, not nodding material! I know that most of the audiences are just people who make up the silent majority so I don't expect any kudos from these truths. Perhaps someday there will be a film called 2101 A Space Odessey, made in 2068, and in 2105 there will be a tired old man explaining to his son that it's just fiction, after all that's what it really is!Tell me, when is all this nonsense supposed to be happening? It's just fiction folks!...0 for 2.. Not too bad so far! Do I hear 0 for 3?....Come on all you movie snobs, make it 0 for 3! It appears this film has more fans than it originally had, and the acting has not improved one iota. Even if Rigsby stole one of the scenes!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

962,vrillusions,Excellent movie when you 'stand back',9,17 March 2000,"I just watched this movie from one of the original VHS tapes (in a book-like box).  And, at first it felt really boring, there was very little dialog, special effects didn't seem that good.  This was until I 'stood back' and realized that all the silence was what was good, and then, when I realize this film was made about a year before men have landed on the moon, it really got me interested in it.  This also got me interested in the special effects which were really ahead of its time.  Even though they can be explained after watching a few ""Movie Magic"" episodes, it's still kinda mindblowing, (since you can't explain how its done until after you see it).This is one of those movies where you either like it, or you don't, there is no middle.  All the people that hate it have become numbed by all the fast paced, explosive movies you see today.  Those that love it are really the true move watchers, who go to movies always giving it the benefit of the doubt.  And treat each movie as unique and not trying to compare it to other movies or genres.  I am one of the latter ones, perhaps because I took a TV/Film and Literature class at school, which tought me certain aspects of movies and their meaning and purpose.Another quick thing I like to mention is the truthfullnes of everything. The one explosion that is seen in the move is, in my mind, the only ""true"" explosion in space.I know there is alot of speculation about the ending sequence of the movie, which is exactly what Kubrick and Clarke wanted, But most movie goers today don't.  When people go to the movies, most don't like to be left hanging (sorry can't think of any examples at the moment).  They don't like to walk out of a theater (BTW, this is rumored to be re-released to the big screen Dec. 31, 2000 (in honor of 2001)) trying to figure out the ending, people now want to have everything thrown out to them in either dialog or naration, thus giving everyone the same ending.  2001 isn't supposed to have the same ending for everyone, it was made to let each and every person interpet it in there own way without being influenced by others.  If you are looking for some sort of explanation to the end, try searching for ebert's review of the film.If you are thinking of viewing this movie, DO NOT use what I have said to judge if you should see it or not.  Don't use any review here. Like I have told you, every person will see this movie in a different way.  Just pay the few dollors to rent it, or even borrow it off a friend.  It will definitely be worth it just for you to say ""I have seen 2001,"" just like you would for any other classic film.Vote: 9/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey

964,fitzvizion,More than a movie,9,29 December 2005,"2001 is more than a film. It's an event. It goes silently but surely beyond being just a movie in its painstaking scientific accuracy and its depiction of a powerful yet patient alien force that is monitoring and influencing human development over millions of years. A very simple plot told in great detail. Special effects & set design all come together. Definitely a cinematic work of art. Don't go in expecting car chases or gun battles -- the pace is slow and deliberate, but there is tension, mystery and suspense. And great danger.

965,eshy76,Read the book instead...,5,27 March 2000,"2001: A Space Odyssey is probably my favourite book of all time and after having read it, I lapped up all of Clarke's sequels...but unfortunately this movie did not cut it for me...I really tried to like it but I just couldn't - maybe my brain has been numbed by all the usual fast paced sci-fi fare these days, but I just found the film really tedious in parts...the ape section and the various ""silence"" sequences were irrelevant and boring and did not add to the story in any way.I admit that some of the ideas on view are marvellous and visionary, such as the rotating space station, but again that's due more to Clarke's scientific brilliance rather than to Kubrick - quite why Kubrick would want to have a ten minute sequence of a space station spinning in space to classical music is beyond me (except for the possibility that a spinning space station was a strikingly new concept back then and he wanted to emphasise the point?).I sometimes wonder if I would have enjoyed the movie more if I hadn't read the book first - it was such a well told and coherent story, which contrasts greatly to the movie which is very abstract. Maybe anyone thinking of watching this movie should see it before they read the book, but definitely read the book - it's a true masterpiece....",2001 - A Space Odyssey
966,mrsweeneytodd,A Journey Beyond Imagination,10,22 April 2000,"The versatility of Stanley Kubrick still amazes me.  Each time I watch one of his movies, I feel as if I'm being taken on some epic journey, regardless of the subject matter.  And while The Shining, Barry Lyndon, Full Metal Jacket, and A Clockwork Orange all fly far beyond their various genres, 2001 is without a doubt the most incredible single film work I have ever seen. Very few movies leave enough to the imagination, acting as narratives from which you derive a precise opinion concerning whatever subject matter. 2001 is beyond explanation, exactly what it means to film and a universal viewpoint cannot be expressed.  So many topics, evolution, the infinite beyond, the perils of technology, the cycle of life, resurrection, the future of mankind - and that's just thematically.  As a movie it's flawless, despite complaints about its pace(not enough action for some apparently). The music ranges from space ballet to unearthly eerieness, the special effects changed film, and it has my favorite villain, man's own technology gone awry, HAL.  I don't think there will ever be a movie quite like 2001, and that it stands as a shining example of what film ought to be.   10/10 (but deserving of higher)",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I loved the way the monoliths never changed, although primate, earth and space did. I loved how it was a question of ""Do you need me/us now""? The movie expressed desire, peace, love, curiosity, finesse, gentleness, courage and innocence. What more could you ask for from a mere movie? Perhaps a complement movie.

I thought the movie started out great, very interesting in fact.  When it started getting near the end it was just too odd and overly artsy and symbolic.  Plus, with everyone talking about how great this film was, I expected something a little better.I won't say that Kubrick is a bad director by any means.  I really enjoyed The Shining and A Clockwork Orange.  However this movie did not effectively balance the artistic side and the plot/storyline.

The acting, writing, special effects, and of course, the music, are all absolutely wonderful. The Jupiter scene remains as stunningly beautiful as always, even by todays standards of special effects. The only reason this movie does not get a 10 out of 10 is because of the intermission, which is included in the video and even the DVD!

The music fits very well and you get the impression that alot of work is put into this movie!In my opinion however, it is highly overrated! The movie is far to long; it needs not be two and a half hour in order to tell the story. Each sequence is just far too long!

973,prostrateconstantly,Art or Escapism?,2,21 July 2021,"My problem with 2001's position as one of the pinnacles of film as an artform is that, under how I understand the difference between ""art"" and ""escapism"" is, it is not widely engaged with as a piece of art.I believe that, to differentiate a work of great art from a work of great escapism, art should preserve individual insight. An analogy for this would be, if someone were to consciously stare at and analyze trees for hours and hours of their life, they would gain a sensitivity to the features of trees. They would have a broad context for the various bark colors and textures, leaf shapes, branch positions, etc. That would inform their opinion on the aesthetic value of particular trees. If this person were to paint a picture of what they consider to be the ideal tree, they would be drawing on this sensitivity and insight in their portrayal. The painting allows for this insight to be preserved for other people to draw on, so they can learn from this distilled portrayal and don't have to spend the hours analyzing trees to know which aspects are important aesthetically. To this effect, I feel great artists distill their individual experiences and sensitivity towards relationships, filmic techniques, aesthetics, etc. To be drawn on by others outside their individual experience.This is different from effective pieces of escapism, which has the goal of satisfying primal and emotive urges. Escapism can be extended to include mediums such as rollercoasters or games, which are ineffective at preserving individual insight but are more effective at providing entertaining experiences. Film is the medium closest to straddling the line between ""art"" and ""escapism"", as it is great at preserving life experience and aesthetics, but through effectively emulating experience it can also act as satisfying escapism. These two modes of engaging with film are not exclusive, a film can articulate a great deal while being primally engaging, but I believe films that work far better as escapism while articulating little have been touted as major works even when discussing film as an artform.The way I feel like the majority of people engage with a film like this is to sit around and feel deep while pontificating about humanity in these broad, imprecise terms that is distanced from any grounded principles that people can internalize to their day-to-day life or personal passions. If you look at a great deal of the reviews for this film, they talk about the experience of watching the film, rather than talking about what the film has articulated to them in any specific terms. This is more consistent with 2001 being an effective piece of escapism than an insightful piece of art, and yet it is constantly touted as the pinnacle of film as an artform. This, coupled with my own lack of relation to the films aesthetics (which I believe is weak in distinctly ""filmic"" aspects, such as editing and composition, that is typically overlooked due to the set designs) and themes (which I believe paints humanity much too broadly and vaguely to speak to anyone as an individual), leads me to rail against this film as I think it's indicative of the thought fallacies of modern film culture.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

And while in theory, a computer going berserk and killing the crew of a ship on their way to Jupiter to find the source of a mysterious transmission may sound cool, put into practice it's very slow. And the ending scenes... I had no idea what they were supposed to be until I ended up reading the end of the book in a class in college.

We were landing men on the moon, space stations were in the works, off-world goals were in scientists minds - what happened?After seeing this film for the 100th time (or so), it dawned on me how purely bittersweet this film has become.

If you decide to give this movie a try, remember to take your time and sit back comfortably. The movie runs at 143 min. and the pace is (very)leisurely.

Not to say that it is not entertaining in its own way, its just that the movie is meant to provoke you. It is meant to inspire you, to confuse you, to spark dialogues, to make you argue with others. This is a new kind of movie made by a visionary director, and human being, who understood where we are headed. This is film as philosophy. This is a film about ideas. This is Aristotle and Plato and Socrates holding cameras. 2001 is the most ambitious movie ever made and will not likely be duplicated anytime soon. The fact that it makes one cry, or another smile, or another one p***ed off is exactly the point. I truly believe that film is the greatest art form ever conceived by man thus far, and that it is our purest. Done well, film is a perfect blend of all the other forms that have gone before it. 2001 is what film could be, should be, and hopefully someday, will be.

Its such a perfect film on so many levels.I really cannot stand it when people who haven't seen it,stereotype it to make it seem like its just an ordinary science fiction film. I personally don't classify the film as a ""science fiction"" film at all.It's a film that if you think outside the box(which most movie-goers do not do) can be deeply moving. This film truly moved me. The ending with the whole Star Child symbolizing a sort of ""rebirth"" in mankind, that really affected me. The only true flaw that the film has is that its a tad too long in several different scenes. Other than that, if you haven't seen it, please go rent it.

At first a large black stone(?) slab seems to have some important role (first it enlightens some prehumans, then astronauts find it and research about it) then after about one third of the movie we never hear about it again, it loses it's importance in the plot and a completely different story starts. At least this other story makes sense, except for it's ending which is a total nonsense again - even worse than the first part, because here you don't even know what's going on, it's totally random and has not much (as nothing) to do with the story it should end. The parts that worth watching are between the parts I mentioned before. I'll write more about them later. Apart from not making sense this movie will try your patience in other ways too, especially in it's first half. For example the film-score is horrible. Not just because that music sounds very bad, but also because it's style is never appropriate to the actual scene of the movie. For example many times there is a dramatic music when actually nothing special happens. Then there are parts, very long ones in which absolutely nothing happens. You are to watch an empty desert for long minutes, a spaceship docking for at least 10 minutes and probably other such things I don't remember. During these scenes of course you can listen that ""masterpiece"" film-score I just wrote about. (Some say that docking scene is the best part because ""it's so artistic and beautiful"" - well maybe I would agree with them to some degree if it wasn't longer than 2 minutes, but too much is too much!) Now let's get back to the part I wrote about that it worths watching. It's the part which pictures a space mission to some distant place (I don't remember where) - hence the title. It is surprisingly realistic: there is weightlessness everywhere in the ship except for a large block witch rotates to provide gravity; outside the ship(s) there is gravely silence, the route takes years - so most of the crew are hibernated; and when a TV station from Earth makes an interview with the (awake) crew members they tell the viewers that it takes minutes for their question to reach the spaceship (and also the answer to reach Earth). They must have used some experts to design this, it totally lacks those fancy but unrealistic stuffs we got used to in the modern sci-fis. If this was the whole movie it would worth much more than like this. But it gets screwed too when the computer, Hal makes a small mistake and many very illogical decisions ensue from both its and the crews part!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
982,eddie_olsen,1968: the year when sci-fi got interesting,10,8 June 2009,"In the history of sci-fi films there are hardly a handful that go down in history as serious or important. 2001: A Space Odyssey is unsurpassed in both departments.Most important: where most films communicate their message through the dialogues and the story, 2001 works on a conceptual level. What makes this film really unique is that Kubrick leaves few clues to what this concept is which makes it impossible to form a clearly defined interpretation. Is the concept intelligence? Or the past and future of human kind? Or has it a religious message? There are NO answers...I remember watching it for the first time...and the second time the day after. What was this REALLY about? Browsing the internet for explanations. I read many theories, but none that was more plausible than the other.Just one time I got this feeling again, when I looked up on the pyramids in Egypt. What on earth IS IT? It's both frustrating and a pleasing at the same time. A kind of religious feeling.The sound plays an important role in the film. The music is partly classical, partly avant-garde. There are many scenes where breathing or distant sounds from animals make up the sound stage.Like other Kubrick films the story is told in ""chapters"". The story is nonetheless easy to follow.A sci-fi movie can't be reviewed without mentioning the special effects. A sci-fi made in 1968 will make most people think of flying saucers and silly costumes. 2001 does not look dated. The special effects are very much the same as those in Star Wars. It looks more realistic than Star Wars episode IV but not as astonishing as episode V.This is not a film for everybody. In the same time you do not have to like sci-fi to love this film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
983,Philippe277,A cinema masterpiece,9,17 May 2011,"The music.....the visuals.......the underlying themes. Stanley Kubrick hits a grand slam with 2001: A Space Odyssey. The very prospect of predicting man's future terrifies most authors/producers into paralysis, but Kubrick gives us fluid motion of sights and sounds, woven into a science fiction tale.I mean how many film-makers have the guts to furnish their creations with long bouts of classical music? Good old Stan does this WHILE showing us futuristic technological innovations that blow our minds open. Such a contrast between something as ancient and immovable as classical music, and another thing as eye-blinkingly modern and progressive as technology -- it's sheer genius. The epicness of the music fits with the grandeur of the colossal planets/ships/stars/etc. displayed. The spectacle of lights was an ethereal experience -- I truly thought I had been crosslisted with Picasso and Beethoven.Then the portrayal of humans. It seems they were mostly stoic and austere, which posits an interesting belief of Kubrick's regarding man's future. He obviously took the oft-ridden road (like George Orwell) of saying that man was to become a less social creature while developing his species, that his emotions would wane as his technological savviness sharpened. Though there is some poignant content, when Dr. Floyd (William Sylvester) talks to his daughter about buying her a birthday present. This itself is contrasted against the coldness of the robotic, calculating world, when the cost of the phone call is displayed on the same screen in plain font reading ""$1.70"".And Hal...what a fabulous idea he was. The age-old rivalry of man and machine. But here it's perfected. The moment I heard Hal's voice I knew he was in the movie to disturb me. It's a perfectly trustworthy voice on the exterior, but there's something about that frozen red eye that just pierces into your soul. You know you can't trust an entity that supposedly knows all and ""never commits errors"". It's easy to hate Hal once he has terminated the hibernating astronauts and jettisoned Frank to his death, but then he also shoulders Dave. Dave is fortunate to get back into the ship, and in proceeding to shut down Hal we really feel the pro-human spirit peaking. Hal's pleads for forgiveness make him ever more detestable a villain -- believing that he can be excused from essential murder is textbook amorality.Showing the apes at the beginning of the film breathes evolutionary theory into our minds immediately -- the education of these apes to defeat enemies and exploit weapons undoubtedly yields the eventual human being. The black monolith is a remarkable symbol; appearing in the several random places in which it does...leaves the viewer searching for its meaning. And its meaning is anybody's conclusion to draw for themselves. It seems divine, in my opinion.......an apparent link between earth and sky. And then Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) at the end, landing himself in a random place and time. Finding older versions of himself. The multiverse theory.....time travel.....reincarnation....it all comes to mind here. The eldest version of Dave becomes a fetus which stares down the Earth as the film closes. Kubrick is playing God.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
984,ca26,A niche film few will like,5,29 September 2006,"For those considering seeing 2001: A Space Odyssey, ...don't. More than likely you'll have the same negative reaction most viewers do. That is, you'll find it slow and boring and the ending to be a frustrating let-down. All of this is true. And it's the reason you won't find films like it in the theaters gobbling up tons of money and receiving rave reviews.Money speaks and it speaks the truth of the common man. Since the common man won't enjoy a film like this, no studios make films like this. Because they know they won't make money. As a potential viewer, that right there tells you what you'll likely think about this movie and whether you should bother renting it or not.Don't be fooled by the inclusion of this film in any Top 100 lists, or the many positive reviews you'll find on here.First, the film's only notable because of how visionary the imagery was. Not because of a great plot, pacing, editing, or acting. And you can't necessarily credit the director for any of this since he wasn't the production designer, the art department, the set designer, or the cinematographer. For all we know from reading the credits alone, Kubrik was simply lucky to have all those talented visionaries around him. You certainly don't see the same visions in his other films.Second, the positive reviews are written by those who want to defend the film. There are far more folks who want to defend their own sense of ""art"" than there are who will bother finishing the movie, much less go online to review it. It's just not worth their time. So you end up with a decidedly skewed perspective when you read the reviews. You get the occasional person who bothers to post their real feelings about it (boring, slow, bad ending, etc.), and then you get this mountain of posts from the same few people who think you've assaulted their personal sense of artistic taste.If you actually MADE 100% of the movie-going population watch this, and then MADE them rate it honestly, you'd find that it barely receives three stars. It's just that ""odd"" and unappealing to the public at large. I have many ordinary, everyday friends, and most have never been able to finish the film. I was only able to bear through it out of curiosity.So, in summary, ...Are you the ""common man""? Do you like Terminator 2 and despise Dangerous Liaisons? Do you watch ""24"" and ""ER"" on TV, and not 2-hour documentaries about the dung beetle on the nature channel? Is your idea of fun to watch the ball-game, or is it to turn on some classical music and curl up with a book about the NASA program?If you're the former - like the other 90% of us - then you won't enjoy 2001: A Space Odyssey, so don't waste your money.It CERTAINLY deserves its place in film history due to the gorgeous visuals and imaginative vision. However, just because the 4-hour silent epic, Birth of a Nation is historically significant too doesn't mean the average person is gonna wanna sit through THAT either.If you want to get caught up, please rent the movie 2010, which is the sequel to 2001. Although it's cold-war tension is rather dated now, you will find yourself completely caught up on what happened in 2001 within the first 10 minutes. As a matter of fact, you'll feel MORE caught up than if you had bothered to watch 2001. Plus, 2010 will take off at a more palatable pace and keep you watching to find out what the mystery behind the monoliths is.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
985,ml2348,Waste of Electricity,2,27 January 2007,"Well - same comment I made on ""Rosemary's Baby"" seen around the same time. I didn't like this movie then - and like it even less now. The passage of time only deteriorated my opinion of this film. Because - it is nonsense - what else can I say. Perhaps psychologists can see imagery that I don't care about - but - it is silly at best - very boring at worst. If they going to use electricity - at least use it on something worthwhile. It takes forever to get through some scenes to prove some silly point - maybe giving apes some intelligence. But - what's the point. The Monolith and its meaning are too esoteric for most audiences - it is just sheer cartoonish. I gave this a 2 rating - which is way more than it deserves. I will never be a psychologist and don't intend to deduce the hidden meanings of esoteric movies. They're not worth it. Care to reply - I'm at ml2348@att.com",2001 - A Space Odyssey
986,wildduck-1,Mythological Documentary,10,4 November 2005,"**warning contains spoilers** In 2001: A Space Odyssey humanity has become so completely mechanized that computers are more human then people. There are still some comic elements  the scientist posing for a conventional tourist picture against the moon monolith, Major Poole burning his surprisingly still sensitive flesh on a totally computerized meal  but this is not a satire. Society has gone too far for that. Our civilization has come to an end, turned flat and weary and stale. There is no energy, no purpose, no creative intelligence. Each individual is merely a bored, faceless cog in a technological system. Kubrick conceived this film as a ""mythological documentary,"" a modern legend of the origin and future of humankind. It is both realistic as a photo-essay and imaginary as a fable. It is essentially a religious movie. Replacing the traditional God of world religions is a cosmic intelligence that influences human evolution at certain pivotal moments. When the ape has evolved as far as it can as an instinctual animal, the first monolith appears, giving the power of creative intelligence that produces the tool-weapon. When that tool has been sophisticated as far as the human mind can conceive-the dramatic cut from the bone thrown into the air to the spaceship resembling it symbolizes this development-the monolith appears again to force humanity on to the next stage. Major Bowman, lacking character and personality as he is, still retains enough feeling to try to rescue his colleague, enough ingenuity to reenter the spaceship after he has been locked out, and enough dedication and courage to continue on his journey, to be chosen as the new human being. On the trip to Jupiter he transcends space, and once arrived there, he transcends time, watching himself age in minutes. As he dies, the monolith appears, he reaches out to it in greeting and gratitude, and is reborn into a creature that transcends his previous humanity. The change from human to Star Child is as drastic as from ape to human: the Star Child will continue our evolution with a radically new intelligence.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
987,dario_van_kuschn,The ultimate trip!,10,27 February 2005,"The best sci-fi I have ever seen!!! I've read the book before seeing the movie and couldn't imagine how such a story could be filmed. But Stanlez Kubrick proved it is possible! It was (a little bit) slow-motioned, but nonetheless brilliant. Especially the ground-breaking visual FX. I am absolutely sure that if filmed today, it would be completely CGI and visibly not realistic. The models and effects really deserved the Oscar. Although I didn't understand the ending until I watched it three times, the overall effect of the movie was that I saw monoliths all over my room and was waiting for a game of chess with Hal 9000... Absolutely brilliant and disturbing, simply an EPIC!!! The music in the movie is also great, with the Waltz working perfectly, the ships dancing in the realistic space.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
988,doenormaaljoh,Ahead of its time but too abstract (and illogical) at the same time,6,3 November 2020,"Being from '69 myself I can imagine this movie to be thus far ahead of its time, considering the technical and scientific part of the story, to have baffled and alienated (no pun) viewers for many years after its incarnation. However personally I have no love whatsoever for this movie and rated it with 6 stars merely because of its technical prowes. For the most part the story arc is flawed, as an ai as intelligent as HAL would have never beat around the bush as it did to reach its goal. For instance given the total control HAL had over all vital systems including life-support), and taking its intelligence level into consideration, it could have simply changed the oxygen mixture to a less favorable ratio (or cut of the oxygen supply instantly) as soon as it became aware of the threat of disconnection. Even more efficiently it could have just killed the astronauts on the spot while they were still conversing in the pod by ejecting the apparatus.The movie was created with a lot of actual scientific knowledge and expertise behind it but in the end the entire story makes no sense at all and remains too abstract and too distant to connect to. The movie's creators obviously knew exactly what it all meant but personally I am quite sure there isnt a single viewer alive, out of the inside circle of the creator, able to get the gist of it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Waw.The computer scene alone is worth an entire movie.Every single shot of the movie is worth a painting.Not a single day has this movie aged.

990,Samtheshrikker,"If you can keep your patience, this is a gem...",8,4 March 2015,"First off, it's easy to see why many people can't relate to the hype surrounding this film. Yes, it's complex, the characters are dull to the point of stuffed animals and it's full of lengthy, uneventful sequences. However, I've always felt Kubrick's genius as a director lay not in his visual portrayal of action, but rather his subtle conveyance of symbolism and metaphor. And boy, is 2001 symbolic.It helps to be prepared for a film like 2001. This isn't something you can expect to understand the first time you watch it. Looking deeply into Kubrick's exploration of themes such as control, technology, perception, and the philosophy of existence will reveal this picture as a true gem. Its human characters appear tedious because they only serve as vessels through which the film's rich events and experiences are translated on to us. 2001 is an intriguing probe into what it means to exist and to see the world. It's very deep and philosophical, but such is the case with most of Kubrick's productions. The soundtrack is epic as it is beautiful, and the effects used are truly ground breaking for their time. It's not an easy watch - but if you can watch it with the open mindedness that I think Kubrick intended, 2001 will make you think about it afterwards... and that makes it a powerful piece of cinema.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
991,siwyaf,Lifetime movie of the future possibilites,10,26 May 2018,"This movie came out in 1968. I saw Dr. Strangelove on TV at that time and was blown away to find out there was such a director who wasn't afraid to make a politically satiric movie about the cold war. I originally saw 2001 in an old palace type of movie theater in Boston, got stoned in the lobby, with a friend before going in and only anticipated the light show at the end. It was so good that it left you thinking what the heck is he saying at the end. I read the book and just liked the beginning about the ape who was more contemplative than the others. At the time there was a book out called On Aggression and was interesting and popular because of the Vietnam War. Today this movie is too long for the younger show me now generations. I still think this is the best movie that was ever made about actually encountering alien, super intelligent life. I'm still wondering if Kubrick is saying it was an alien life form or spiritual awakening that is portrayed in the end. I'm glad he was into using the classical music sound track because it does take you away from the dumb human dialogues that come out in some SF movies today.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

From the Dawn of Man to the space travel to Jupiter we are grasped by the hand of Kubrick and A. C. Clarke and we are shown to a world of discoveries: Videophones, computer graphics, use of cards with magnetic bands for pay phones, no-sound-in-void-of-space, talking computers, computer Chess games, hibernating bodies for long-term travels, etc. OK, FX are cheesy, I admit it, but come on, the year the film was made is 1968, we can forgive that. The restaurated release of the film and the remasterized sound makes you think it was filmed a year or two ago. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a Beta, VHS, DVD or UMD you MUST have in your collection.

994,mattdenes,The Greatest Movie Of All Time. Period.,10,2 November 2005,"I was lucky enough to be first shown this masterpiece of cinema in my mid-teenage years, thus having a relatively broad mind, and the capacity to extend the limits of thought to understand the message that 2001: A Space Odyssey is telling us. First of all allow me to alleviate the common rumor or nowadays stereotype that this movie is boring. One simple unalienable fact that people must realize is that the differences contrasting between past and modern cinema are unlimited and infinite. The ever-present mood, emphasis and feeling that the 60s and 70s brought into movies is irreplaceable. In those days, if a movie was 2 1/2 hours long, the mindset of movie-goers wasn't ""Oh, this movie must be so packed full of action that the 2 hours will shoot by like lightning."" They were more along the lines of ""Okay, this movie is long, it is an epic, what needs to be said to us cannot be simply accomplished within minutes, things have to happen before grander things can happen, an we are going to be shown virtually every second of it."" The one thing people tend to forget about space and space travel and space technology is that it ISN'T fast. It cannot just happen as if it were on a timer as in the movie atrocity Armageddon. What happens happens at the pace it does to perpetuate the un-deniable fact that this movie, although a work of science fiction, is as realistic as it can be, regardless if it's about the possible futures that lay before us. These days, the audiences have been dumbed down by so-called logic in movies. It must all be explained to them, otherwise they leave confused and angry. Those who honestly dislike 2001 simply do not, or no longer possess the patience, nor the capacity to understand that some truths will NOT be merely dropped into our laps. What makes a fantastic film, the sole characteristic that classifies a movie as brilliant, is the fact that it leaves US to create OUR OWN meanings for why something in a movie is happening. The inner-depths to 2001's meanings range from knowledge of the universe around us, to the inconsistency of evolving technology. The rest is up to us to decipher, after we do that, we can believe what WE think is the true meaning.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Cinema is subjective , if you like movies that are made with a lot of hardwork and best production quality , then this one is for you.
Yes it is slow in pace , but if you want to find why audience praise this movie so much and you too want to join them .
I may have a solution for you, first of all watch all of his films before this then you could watch this one. Because a lot of his trademarks are present in this film.
So in order tp enjoy this master piece you must be either a philosophy lover or stanley kubrick fan.And please don't spread bad reviews about this one, because this is one of the legendary films ever made . Not only Stanley but the whole crew has worked diligently to give us this magnum opus.

996,hannahgrahambell,Deserves its status as a classic,7,14 May 2018,"2001: A Space Odyssey is objectively a visual masterpiece; but for those who appreciate a subtler, slower story line, it is a narrative success as well. Does the movie revel in showing off its mind boggling special effects? Does it, at times, seem more like an impressive art gallery than a film? Yes and yes, but even 50 years later, the special effects are amazing enough to warrant the rather pretentious display. It is clear that Kubrick's vision influenced nearly all sci-fi movies set in space up through the 21st century, and the only things that clue into its date of creation are the costumes and lack of outrageous CGI monsters. The calm, long shots of space and the spaceship set to classical music allow the audience to take in every bit of the mystical, beautiful, and slightly intimidating aspects to space and technology that Kubrick wished to convey.
One of the main complaints about 2001: A Space Odyssey is its length and slow plot. There is no denying that the movie moves at a slow pace or that it is long (about two and a half hours), but whether this works in the service of the movie or not is as matter of preference. Admittedly, the style of storytelling is slightly difficult to adjust to when an one is used to the current space movie genre, which often entails exciting action and an ensemble of characters whose personal relationships form a core of the movie. In 2001, the suspense is much quieter, but the drawn out length keeps it simmering constantly under the surface. Instead of an ensemble cast with charismatic characters, the core of the movie contains one human and one supercomputer, HAL. Additionally, the cerebral nature of the third act is radically different from those of Star Wars, Star Trek, and other epic space movies. However, the story line is still thought-provoking, exciting, and fairly simple to follow once its unique form is accepted and celebrated.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Kubrik creates a beautiful and illusive vision of the future and its an almost orchestral depiction as the spaceships spin and glide with Earth in the background. Never before in time had a movie captured space travel so well.The end of the movie is a little strange for my taste but the rest of the movie makes up for it with an interesting story and even better antics that make you wish you could travel in space.The memorable scene is when the futuristic stewardess is walking on the carpet with her ""grip shoes"", at the that moment you know that this is space and anything can happen.A brilliant look at the future that stands up even today as I am writing this in 2009, mostly because humans still haven't reached the capacity that the people in the movie have and when we do get there we'll look back at this movie and marvel at Kubrick's vision.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Specially the evolution of human mind that is being represented by the black monolith, also this film make as the primal statement that this evolution it's show when the human being finds a better way to survive and breaking of some their paradigms. HAL 9000 a human like computer find inside of ""him"", the same dilemma, trying to find a way to survive, no matter what or why.

999,walward-2,The greatest film ever made,10,27 May 2001,"What can I say about the greatest film ever made? It's odd because I saw this film (or parts of it) once when I was a teenager. I remember being baffled and irritated by the ending, and I didn't see it again for 20 years. Watching it a second time, even though it was on a tv screen again, I sat in awe. I don't think there has ever been a more visually beautiful film. It's gorgeous. I hope I can see it in a theater someday. Also, the marriage of classical music to the scenes was brilliant. Regardless of how good the commissioned score may have been, it wouldn't have been able to match the power and beauty of ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" or ""Blue Danube.""
On one hand it's difficult to believe this film was released in 1968, because it looks better than anything produced since. On the other hand, it had to be made during that period. I don't think a 2 1/2 hour, slow-paced, contemplative science fiction film that asks more questions than it answers could be made today. Who would finance it? Who would see it? The closest thing to that description is ""Contact,"" which was as deep and interesting as a teaspoon of mud. Just like great art in any given medium, this film is not accessible to everyone.

1011,alpcentufekci,Overrated,6,10 September 2018,"That is enough! Somebody should say ""the king is naked"". This film is very overrated and even some people who havent watched the film say that it is the best film ever, which i disagree (You see how they effect people? When you dont like the film, they will say you dont understand the art)Though i have no problem with slow going movies, this film is something different from slow going and too much boring. 
All right, i can understand that it was something new for filmmakers in those years, but it doesnt mean that it is the best movie in history when we compare it with real masterpieces like Godfather, Schindler's List, etc. 
If you want to watch better works of Kubrick, give a chance to films like The Shining and Full Metal Jacket. 6/10 according to me...",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1012,strabo1021,What is the point?,4,26 February 2003,"I admit I've always been curious about this film as The Shining really impressed me and turned me instantly into a Kubrick fan.  As for Arthur C. Clarke I have been a big fan of his since I read his Rama novels (anyone whose never heard of them or never read them I highly recommend you do so immediately).  Coupled with the fact this is supposedly an epic and one of the best films ever made meant I was determined to see it but somehow never got round to it.  Well I eventually watched it today and I have to ask what was the point?  I kind of got the idea of what was going on but found the whole thing pointless.  From the apes at the beginning (the most drawn out boring piece of cinema in history) to the whole idea of the monoliths just utterly bored me senseless.  Don't get the idea that I'm an action addict and too shallow to enjoy a thought provoking film, I love something I can get my head round but this was just awful.  As for the special effects I find it hard to believe Kubrick was not on LSD when he made this it's just absolutely ridiculous.  In future if I want a sci-fi film I'll stick to the likes of The Matrix, Minority Report or my all time favourite The Abyss.  If I want thought provoking cinema I'll stick with The Shawshank Redemption , Road To Perdition or even The Green Mile.  Each to their own opinion though this is just mine.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1013,DeeJayPip,The worst movie I've seen.,7,19 October 2002,"First off, I realize this might have been HUGE way back in 1968, but why say ""2001""? Why not make it timeless or something? Come on, H.G. Wells was smart enough to set Time Machine further into the future than 24 years later. Other than that, it was way too slow. I ended up fast forwarding it, going two times the usual speed to read the subtitles, though there turned out to be not very much talking. The astronauts even walked in baby steps. Here is my summary of this movie:*MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS*We watch half an hour of gorrilas screeching. Then they find a black slab, which leads to more screeching and they take twenty minutes to realize that they can kill. Then we go to space, where we watch spaceships move around very  very slowly, so that we know that this is exactly what the future will be like -- whoops, not quite. The people find another black thing on the moon. Then randomly, we see some people on a spaceship that is en route to Jupiter. Alright, whatever. HAL, which consists of red camera lenses planted around the ship, kills everyone except for one person. This one person unplugs HAL, which makes a TV tell him that the black rock on the moon is sending radio beams to Jupiter. The directors put in an intermission to make things go slower.Then we see a black rock float in the solar system, then we see about half an hour of the survivor go through a tunnel of light, and we discover Jupiter is just South Utah, tinted different colors. The survivor lands in a white room. He's older, maybe now he's fifty? Then he sees a seventy year old eating at the table. The seventy year old looks back, the fifty year old is gone. Then he looks at the bed, and there is a horribly old old man there, who looks at the table. He sees a black rock, which turns him into a fetus. The fetus looks at Earth.All of this is about two hours.*END SPOILERS*",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1014,ambrosewriter,Radical Experimentalism,10,3 January 2009,"This was a movie that focused on pushing the envelope of film-making. But that's not all that it was; it developed into it's own world, with nuances and subtleties. Many complain about the pacing, but in reality, it would take about 15 minutes to dock a spaceship; this movie tried to make art model life instead of ADD characters jumping from idea to idea. This movie made fine transitions and was a perfect meld of sight and sound. The true experimentalism begins when Bowman reaches out into the netherworld and loses himself in time. This movie tells you just enough to keep you in the loop, but not enough to give away symbols and the ideals of Kubrick. Any differences between the book and the film a easily forgivable when compared to this fantastic monument to the experimentalism of the '60's. It's not just about experimentalism though, which tends to be the bane of other experimental movies, it is an intricate story, too. When I first watched this movie I knew I had to watch it again. Eventually, I just purchased it and have enjoyed the special features. Anyone who's serious about directing, writing, or having a successful career in any medium of the arts should buy this movie. Anyone else, buy it too; it'll take you to space (and possibly give you a contact high).",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1015,Eredain,The very worst (philosophically speaking),1,20 June 2003,"Everyone who likes this movie for its plot and philosophical content refuses to explain why. Instead, they dish up constructive comments like ""if you don't get it, then I won't bother explaining it to you"". Sophists used to apply such methods in order to make themselves seem wise. They would walk into a room and utter something completely unintelligible. Those who didn't understand it, believed that it had to be their own fault, as the sophists had already established a reputation for themselves. Also, they didn't want to ADMIT that they didn't understand it, as they believed it would make them look foolish. And so, what was in fact devoid of meaning began to be called ""deep"" and the word ""mysterious"" became positively laden. Well, I claim that 2001: A Space Odyssey is empty and meaningless. People have claimed otherwise, but no one has ever EXPLAINED otherwise. And surely the burden of proof must rest with them. Trying to disprove what has never been proven to begin with is a waste of time. It would be like attempting to disprove the existence of the easter bunny.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1016,arthurff6,Pretension always does pay off,10,13 November 2011,"Tempestuous waters are expected when it comes to judge one of the ''untouchables'' in motion pictures history. Thankfully, or maybe shamefully, there is nothing I could find to complain about 2001; the grandiose proportions of everything it represents impressed me just as much as (almost) everyone.Much is discussed about a profound boredom caused by the extensive length, on top of an apparently phlegmatic nonsensical narrative, being responsible for turning the experience less pleasurable on a film that could be rather accessible entertainment. Perhaps so, but that would result in an unbearably common, appellative flick, hated with merit by many. Instead, what Kubrick offered to our amusement-hunger brains is a monumental spectacle, with a rather necessary linear narrative, reaching a psychedelic climax that most certainly was responsible for the Odyssey's immortality.Fellow immortals György Ligeti, Strauss and Khachaturian set the tone as the viewer entwine humanity's dawn and forward, in clear communion with the arcane presence of a monolith. Dr. Heywood Floyd's mission to the moon, along with the celebrated HAL 9000's ''arc'' have a particular 60's atmosphere that somehow, through its opacity and tension, prepares the spectator to the abstract voyage that will follow.Oddly, 2001: A Space Odyssey is not a movie that I intend to watch more than once. After all, it is not easily digestible. But it did succeed in causing me an everlasting good impression; and judging by its majesty, pretentiousness, perfect soundtrack, phenomenal images and concepts, not to mention the fortunate participation of the exotics HAL and even the monolith, it must be said that pretension always does pay off.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1019,Movie_Reviewing_101,Not For The Impatient,6,10 January 2007,"When I watched this film, I was under the impression that it was an amazing piece of film history. With an average rating of 8.5, and spectacular views from highly acclaimed movie reviews, but to be honest I was very disappointed, and found the film to be slow, not very eventful, and quite honestly confusing.At the start of the movie, when the giant black rectangular object first appears I was intrigued, I thought to myself; ""is this the dawn of evolution. Is this how we became the intellectual dominating species which we are. However, as the movie went on I felt myself slowly loosing interest.It seems that very little is happening in the movie, when actually a great deal of important information is passing buy. The reason why the robots going mental is explained in a short space of time. Why was it homicidal etc. But despite this the film does have some of the best cinematography that I have ever seen in a film. This is why I gave the movie a 6.The film does drag on, with the slow movement of spacecrafts, and the weird techni-coloured acid trip taken in mid flight. An I have to say that this is beautiful. The Hotel room at the end of the film is also beautiful. With the white background and the lighting, making it seem very peaceful, after the eiry acid trip taken only moments before. But this tranquil scene is also riddled with suspense, a theme which travels constantly through the film.So to sum up, I would have to say that this film was not a 'Movie' as such, but more Art. With beautiful sets, and spectacular special effects, this film is a delight to anyone interested in Art,(I myself am not).So unless you appreciate Art, and can take to sit through over two hours of it, then I would recommend it, otherwise stay away and watch Alien.Milligan",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1020,eve_lorenzen,"No Film Like 2001, No Film Better",10,21 May 2005,"It might be fact that there's ""no film like"" this one, but I freely admit it's my personal opinion that there's ""no film better"".2001 is one of those films that is completely timeless. The only thing that makes it appear dated is the pure plot itself in association with the year 2001, which by now we can all understand as yet-another-hyperbolized-future-vision-of-the-60s. Call it 3001 then. Take the date out of it, it's a timeless film.What I wanted to comment on though is a part of the film that's usually overlooked: the beginning. It's not like people forget the ""Ape Sequence"", it's just it doesn't stand out in minds usually as much as Hal 9000 and the simple docking of a space ship to the music of the Blue Danube. But the ""Ape Sequence"", without resorting to spoilers and specifics, captures the essence of the progression of the Human species.You can look at countless examples in history when the obvious has laid before Human's eyes for a very, very long time, and yet they don't see it. It's almost as if it takes alien intervention, or God's intervention, to suddenly make the epiphany happen. Where one individual can look at something looked at countless times, and see something that's never been seen. The discovery of proof of the atom's existence (rather than the speculation alone) in the 19th century is just one example of this. You have peanut butter and chocolate sitting right next to each other for decades, and in retrospect it's amazing that it took so long for someone to connect the dots. The ""Ape Sequence"" at the beginning captures this concept of intervention cleaner than the rest of the film.But the entire film is a complete joy.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1022,danielnikrasov,2001st review- a celebration of cinematic experience by Master Kubrick,10,19 September 2019,"Imagine yourself a 60s fella walking to the theater, buying a ticket directly at the box office, sitting in hall and right in front of you a big friendly giant 70mm screen. Once the lights start to go out, the film starts from this moment to predict your future. How'd you respond? That's how I imagined this piece of masterpiece all along, and I loved it. Do you get me? Let me spell it for y'all: L.O.V.E.D. I.T. , period.
Let me confess something before I start. When I first saw 2001: A Space Odyssey I was 14 years old or even 13, I don't clearly recall. Anyway, I begun to watch this and 30 minutes later, I turned out the TV. Want to know why? Brace yourselves: It was boring. I don't even remember if watched this film at all. Btw, I was a stupid teenager at this age despite of me being smart in studies, but still I didn't understand a thing in this movie. I was wrong. On my second viewing, which occurred on 28th August, it was a completely different experience. The moment I got finished watching this film, I exhaled. This is the moment I realized I was wrong. Stanley Kubrick created something different than his other pieces. Not ordinary, but something revolutionary.2001: A Space Odyssey is a splendid work of art that's put science to science fiction and consider to one of the most influential films and genres in the eternal cinema industry for generations to come. It deals with the elements of human evolution, technology and artificial intelligence and terrestrial life. I might even say that it's a spiritual film in the way that represents man's relationship with the God or even higher. It's divided into 4 segments, and connected with each terrestrial reference. Kubrick's first project into Sci-Fi features all of his usual brands but its treatment different from his other pieces.Although my thought is 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't going to be appreciated by everyone. It's a visual ride of stupendous art, attracting viewers to get sucked into a slow pace of metaphysically technical journey and raises some thought-irritating questions with allegorical meanings. What Kubrick fascinated me is the fact he left the ending open so the audience can draw their conclusions. Of course, 2001 inspired almost every film by far and will continue to do so as long as cinema still exists.Stanley Kubrick's filmaking breaks almost every rule starting the appearance of human apes to the birth of Space Baby. No one can deny that the viewers are proposed by Kubrick's filmaking-magic. By doing so, he doesn't dare to simplify any detail, but to let the audience be involved around the film atmosphere and to solve puzzles.Kubrick did a really good job on communicating with technical department. Speaking of tech, this what also made the film so successful and memorable. The cinematography is a a treat to anyone who appreciates photography, editing is correctly done, and visual and sound effects are innovative ahead its movies, in which using CGI nowadays are far from matching this. Even before the landing of Apollo, Kubrick never fails to impress where the moon sequence shot with such detail level. By the way, the screenwriter, Arthur C. Clarke, the author who wrote short story ""The Sentinel"" based on the film, claims that Apollo 13's critical line ""Houston, we have a problem"" was influenced by HAL-9000's line ""Sorry to interrupt the festivities, but we have a problem"", even the commander's ship was called ""Odyssey"".The score by Alex North was absolutely captivating. Kubrick had also a bright idea to add respite for scores like ""Requiem"", ""Atmospheres"", ""Lux Aeterna"", ""The Blue Danube"" and more in the spacecraft and outside of it. Start from the overture, The marvelously main title ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" combining with moon in the shadows implies great revelation, standing on the cusp of universal breakthrough. The bright blue orb of the Earth rose with the sun and left the moon out of frame. The music peaked, the title appeared and from here, everybody's life including me changed forever! The brilliance of ""The Blue Danube"" is how Kubrick managed to capture the dance, like coordinated movements of objects in space. Another score I adored was ""Requiem"". The use of György Ligeti's haunting ""Requiem"" inspired lots of film even trailers (for instance in teaser trailer of Godzilla 2014) and put on the first scene where apes first discovered of tools. Much like, the astronauts discovered a second Monolith on the moon and Dave discovered a third Monolith on Jupiter.Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke imagined futuristic world that still rings true all these years with an intense and attractive screenplay. They're making a good example of ""show, don't tell"". They made sure to limit the dialogues, making room for plenty of subtext. Another thing that attracted me the most was the human voice, by Douglas Rein, of HAL-9000. Many people think HAL shows more emotion than any human character. This is a smart choice to opposite this because it takes away the cold mechanical nature of robot, and instead it gives you, the way I put it, WALL E. Stanley and Arthur manage to visually represent the mystery of the universe by monoliths, forcing the audience to draw their own conclusions.All in all, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a big joke at any negative critic/member review, it's a big landmark in a cinematic history. No film can nail this masterpiece, made by a craft master filmmaker who made a career one brilliance after another. This film will be discussed forever and I mean forever, not a small detail will be missed. 2001 requires multiple viewings in the ultimate visually journey. Definitely recommend!Score: (10/10)",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1023,gregorrhuber,the work of a genius,10,23 May 2019,"This movie is as deep, beautiful and philosophical as it can get. It is a timeless masterpiece which also will be in the year 3001.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1024,benatarandres,Think Things Over.,10,19 May 2016,"What are we? It's a strange question at first and not the kind you usually ask. Yet people like Carl Sagan and Richard Feynman asked this question numerous times in their careers. They posed it with humility and reason, never making up answers, and assuming that everything that science had come up with was wrong. In an interview where Feynman was asked about the certainty pertaining to the scientific method, he expressed his view, being that of a Cartesian, and how he would rather be filled with doubt, than to have answers that could possibly be wrong. Its noble and it entails the integrity of a curious mind who believes in the beauty of investigating and discovering, rather than basing your conclusion on little or no evidence. 2001: A Space Odyssey does not provide answers, but it gives us insights into what the human race is, posing even greater questions to the potential we hold as self-conscious beings. 2001 is significantly different from the usual science fiction film. Although it poses the usual question's pertaining to the uniqueness of our species, the existence of God, and the direction we are heading in our progressivism, it rarely goes beyond a few simple lines of dialogue. The few characters, mostly being astronauts and a few Hominids, utter very few words as the story progresses from the dawn of humankind, to the evolutionary stage of space exploration. But then again, it's those very moments that simply play out as naturalistic as possible that truly define the story, as the images of objects floating in space, with ""On the Beautiful Blue Danube"" playing in the background that we truly come to be in sync with the spirit of the film. This spirit is mysterious, and although we still don't understand what it is, or where it came from. But the search becomes all the more invigorating as we challenge both our intellectual and explorative capacities, thus gaining a greater understanding of the human spirit. When human kind was still developing, our awareness was at a minimal state of ambiguity, never truly grasping the significance of any particular action, relying purely on instinct. A scene where a group of Hominids stumble upon a monolith, shows them react with wild and almost chaotic rage at the sight. Not too long after, they learn to kill enemy combatants for land. As our ancestor raises the bone and begins to shatter various bones on the ground, the shot is given a particular focus as it entails the essence of discovery in the most primitive standards. When at the peaking point of our development, we are more casually reliant on ungodly technological advances, endowing them with their own conscious awareness that merely gives greater reason to ponder the definition of intelligence. The Hal 9000, an artificial intelligence unit claims its inability to commit error, already symbolizing the very arrogance that defines our own self-indulged obligation to intellectual superiority. Hal's devotion to intelligence although admirable, is clouded with pride to the degree that it mirrors our own fear of death and failure in the face of the inevitable. Human beings, although the most intelligent creatures known so far, classify themselves as intelligent. Yet, with what little we still don't know about the Universe, there could be life elsewhere in the Universe, probably vastly more intelligent than we are. Our modern day Carl Sagan, or Stephen Hawking, as daunting as their intellects are to the average individual, could merely pose as amateurs to intelligent alien life, depending on their own conception of intelligence. The discussion to intelligence is central to the theme of this film, for it pertains with our own approach towards our ever growing desire to ascend and evolve. The film's episodic pattern of storytelling introduces a black monolith in each chapter. There are some speculations regarding these monoliths, and at times they drive the characters, be it the hominids, or the astronauts to further questioning their origins. The beliefs are focused around the notion of an extraterrestrial species. Their intentions, although never clear, are more viewed in the concepts of overseers to the universe. With 2001, being based on Arthur C. Clarke's novel of the same name, the origin of the multiple Monolith's gives little if any detail to their conception, Only the fact that they are of nonhuman origin, that there is some understanding of their descent, but little of their purpose. 2001: A Space Odyssey is something to wonder, for it is the sort of film that although gives very little answers, it raises the kinds of questions which have driven us from the jungles of Africa to the infinite realm of Space, in our quest for knowledge and understanding. Stanley Kubrick's vision of the human capacity for knowledge is an enlightening and extraordinary attempt as his classic space epic, through long shots of the soundless and weightless space, combined with J Strauss's ""On the Beautiful Blue Danube"", there comes a more poetic feeling of the beautiful and mysterious Cosmos we still hope to understand in our gradual evolutionary development. 2001 is a landmark of discovery, and even inspiring to the degree that it is spiritual and Godly in its essence. When touching on God, I don't mean a sentient being outside the universe, but more towards Arthur C. Clarke's definition, which pertains towards knowledge and the path that encompasses its essence as human kind still strives with the enthusiasm that drives the very curiosity that define people like Richard Feynman in their quest for understanding. Feynman once said, ""When you doubt and ask, it gets a little harder to believe"", and although this clarifies the difficult journey humanity embarks on every day when learning, it's the first and necessary step to arriving at a more honorable degree of knowledge.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Not because of the incredible accuracy in portraying space travel, not because the special effects are unrivaled, and not because one of the characters is a machine which goes insane. 2001 is unique because it examines the questions of 'Where did we come from?', 'Why are we here?', and 'Where are we going?'. More a statement of philosophy than a piece of entertainment, 2001 uses the power of cinema to evoke wonder in the audience.Some people believe that we are not alone in the Cosmos. Either way you look at it, the concept is staggering. Could we be the result of an experiment performed millions of years ago? Are we being monitored, to determine if we are a success? What is the end-point of our evolution? 2001 is not a story about someone overcoming adversity, it is an expression of awe at our existence, and faith that we can become more than we are.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1027,Wesley-Wang,Legendary,10,14 April 2018,"A stand-alone monument in cinema history, Stanley Kubrick's magnum opus 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is an undeniable masterpiece. 2001 not only shattered science fiction genre conventions, but gave cinema a whole new meaning. From the grandiosity of its futuristic idea to its ambitious execution, 2001 isn't concerned with entertaining us- but rather to inspire us with awe. I've never seen a person say, ""2001: A Space Odyssey? I don't think I've seen it... oh wait, the one with like, the spaceships and stuff?"", while most movies today are forgotten once the credits roll. What viewers must understand is that 2001 not the type of movie where you ""get it"" or not, nor is it designed to thrill us with flashy special effects- but as Kubrick said, is ""...intended to be an intensely subjective experience that reaches the viewer at an inner level of consciousness."" In it of itself, exploring the philosophical and scientific arenas of mankind while serving as a groundbreaking achievement both on a conceptual and technical level is a hell of an accomplishment, but to transcend the audience to a whole new dimension all in one- that's sheer genius at its highest form.At its premiere, 2001 polarized critics and audiences alike. Walkouts numbered well over 200, including Rock Hudson who asked, ""Will someone tell me what the hell this is all about?"" The New York Times remarked, ""Somewhere between hypnotic and immensely boring."" ""Superb photography major asset to confusing, long-unfolding plot,"" Newsday commented. Renowned critic Pauline Kael even went as far as calling 2001 ""trash masquerading as art"". It's understandable, though. In a time in which excitement revolving around interstellar exploration and extra-terrestrial life was everyday talk, audiences came into 2001 expecting answers. When will we reach the moon? What does the future hold? Are we alone? To their great surprise, 2001 did the paradoxical; leaving more questions to answer than answered questions.Even though the late 60s marked the height of technological optimism, Kubrick saw ahead, highlighting the potential negatives of technological advancement. Notice the contrast between how apes and humans approach the monolith. The apes approach it with dignity, respect, and mindfulness. The humans approach it with arrogance, grouping astronauts in front of the monolith to take a picture. Since the monolith represents the incomprehensible (man, with his limited senses, cannot comprehend the absence (perfect black) of color or light), Kubrick may be suggesting the manner in which we handle new information is careless and hasty, emphasized in the Clavius base briefing. Scientists discuss how to distribute this exciting news to the public, for ""if the facts were prematurely and suddenly stated without adequate preparation and conditioning"", as stated by Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester), it may cause ""cultural shock and social disorientation"". It's a significant message to the anxious people of 1968 to perceive fresh information precisely and draw conclusions logically.Yet apes are not much better. They're not willing to share food and water with their fellow apes, and with the discovery of bones as weapons, kill their own race for a puddle of water- possibly foreshadowing our own demise if we continue to advance artificial intelligence. Because like our ancestors, at heart, mankind has been and will always be selfish.Far before The Terminator (1984) or The Matrix (1999) accentuated the dangers of artificial intelligence, there was 2001. H.A.L 9000, voice played by Douglas Rain, was ingeniously crafted into one of the most terrifying villains in film history. There's something about his calm voice, unpredictability, and especially, his omniscient single red eye that's so frightening. Kubrick utilizes one of his favorite filmmaking devices to compare artificial intelligence with humans: irony. Neither Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) or Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) display much emotion throughout the film, while H.A.L, albeit a machine, exhibits some while pleading for life singing ""Daisy"" (which, by the way, is a heart-wrenching scene) and murdering his crew members. There are clear connotations of humanity's fate when H.A.L attempts to kill Frank, Dave, and the hibernating crew members. Yet H.A.L, contrast to what he may think, is not perfect. If he was incapable of miscalculating even the slightest bit, he wouldn't have gotten himself killed. Kubrick implies that artificial intelligence has not yet reached the level of annihilating the human race, but if we are not careful, they soon will.This idea coincides with the perplexing final sequence, resembling man reaching the next stage of evolution. After the famous ""Star Gate"" sequence, Dave is enlightened in a room. The setting hints at the Enlightenment Era, exquisitely decorated in 18th century style and embellished with lavish paintings and furniture. Notice how the room is solely lit through the transparent ground, establishing a heavenly environment. The eerie silence is ominous, magnifying the mystical aura that is ever so present in the timelessness of the final scene. As Dave exits his EVA pod, he watches himself age rapidly through one-point perspective. He knocks over a wine glass while eating, suggesting that man, no matter how advanced, will keep making mistakes. As he lays on his deathbed later, he reaches out to the monolith, alluding to Adam reaching out to God in Michelangelo's The Creation of Adam. After man is enlightened, he inevitably dies.A pessimistic ending? No. Man is then transported back to Earth as a ""Space Baby"", an infinitely more advanced race, marking a new age of evolution. A masterful stroke of genius, Kubrick ends hopeful, giving us another chance to improve on our mistakes. Or is it hopeful? Is he implying that civilization is evolving badly? Or is he suggesting that civilization will NEVER evolve? There are multiple interpretations of the ending, and it's a question for you to answer.There is such a great deal of symmetry in 2001's composition throughout the film, possibly suggesting the equilibrium present in the universe. The painstakingly slow pace also compliments the exactness of its harmony, practically forcing you to admire its artistry. While Andrei Tarkovsky's work would breathe with such organic and poetic beauty, Kubrick's artificial visual fluidity mesmerizes the eye with meticulous precision and thoroughness. Each shot, averaging 13.6 seconds, possesses a sense of purity and perfection that can only be achieved through the medium of cinema.But of course, it's impossible not to talk about 2001 without mentioning one aspect. The visual effects are so unanimously praised that it's hopeless to even try to describe how groundbreaking and influential they were. Hopeless. I can talk for days about the impeccable zero-gravity effects, clever rotating sets, fastidiously constructed spaceships, the brilliant use of slit-scan photography for the psychedelic Star Gate sequence, or how it pioneered the use of front projection with retroreflective matting, but what's the point? You don't need me to appreciate 2001's immaculate visuals.Finally, the choice of music is outstanding. Originally, Alex North was appointed to score the film, but Kubrick turned it down in post-production. Critic Roger Ebert explains it perfectly, ""North's (rejected) score, which is available on a recording, is a good job of film composition, but would have been wrong for 2001 because, like all scores, it attempts to underline the action-to give us emotional cues. The classical music chosen by Kubrick exists outside the action. It uplifts. It wants to be sublime; it brings a seriousness and transcendence to the visuals.""""But why all the slow parts?"" asks the one who fell asleep. Primarily, to establish tone. Unlike the low-budget commercial science fiction movies preceding it, 2001 was meant to be taken seriously. It symbolizes a quest for whether God exists or not, challenges humanity's fate, and questions evolution as a whole. If each shot's average length was two seconds and there was some sappy romantic love subplot mixed in between, the whole film would've been a mess. Space isn't fast-paced like we see in most movies. Space is slow-really, really, slow. The addition of three minutes and seventeen seconds of a black screen in the beginning was also pure genius, a signal for casual moviegoers to get out of the theater now and save your time.Thankfully, its ingenuity was gradually recognized, and it's now widely regarded as one of the greatest and influential films of all time. It stands at an impressive #6 on the BFI ""Sight and Sound"" Critics' poll in 2012, ties for 2nd in the Director's poll, places 15th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, and tops the Online Film Critics Society list of ""greatest science-fiction films of all time"".2001: A Space Odyssey breaks almost every rule there is in filmmaking. The first half drags, the dialogue is unnatural, the static camera creates no visual interest, there are barely any emotional punches, characters are monotonous, and none of the protagonists, if there even are, have dimensionality, arcs or epiphanies. Nonetheless, it's transcendental and sublime, awe-inspiring and thought-provoking, visually revolutionary, technically impeccable, monumentally imaginative, substantially rich, and way ahead of its time, thriving with unparalleled originality and ambition.Only a few films will live forever. 2001 is one of them. Happy 50th birthday.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1028,jcjacob-37009,The GREATEST Geometric Sci-Fi Film Ever Made!!!,10,29 March 2017,"Stanley Kubrick had absolutely no knowledge of the Science Fiction genre. 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) has been called the Grandfather of Sci-Fi films. George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and many others, have considered this film as an inspiration to their careers. The goal for Kubrick was to not only make an experimental film, but to take its genre very seriously (and realistically). Kubrick went beyond the limits with the film's photography and Special Effects.The framing of the movie is both geometrical and symmetrical, to a higher degree. Kubrick creates images that make us as the viewer question its meaning, instead of receiving an answer. 2001 may not be what people expect it to be. I also, struggled to understand its meaning, but the film should be viewed more than once. Kubrick takes us beyond our expectations, into something that is completely unknown.There are some things about this films that I do not fully agree on, but the experience was quite thrilling for me. There are some shots throughout this film that filmmakers are trying to figure out. I for one accept the film as an artistic observation, rather than it being a everyday usual talkie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I absolutely adore the psychedelia this movie features, with the dream-like colourful ""star-gate sequence"" for example. Acting is fantastic, insane VFX and cinematics, iconic characters, and of course Stanley Kubrick. The greatest director of all time. It's perfect!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1032,minabasejderha,Better after University than before,8,12 September 2018,"My first time watching this title left me feeling lackluster. I was a teenager, and I had a relatively narrow experience-set. All I knew was the first part felt like a fake nature documentary, the second was fascinating and compelling, and the third was confusing and pointless.During the intermission, I had an disagreement with my mother back then about the Hal 9000 character. I felt like it would be too obvious for Hal to end up being a villain and there was something I couldn't put my finger on that made Hal seem trustworthy to me. My mom's point was that a movie from the 60s was unlikely to try and subvert our distrust of robots. At the time, I felt like the movie bore out her prediction.---Fast forward a decade or so. It was 9.3.18, and the Belcourt in Nashville was showing the new 70mm restoration of *2001: A Space Odyssey* (overseen by Christopher Nolan, they said). The only 70mm I've had the pleasure to see before was Hateful Eight, so I jumped at the chance. Coming along with me was my closest friend, who hadn't seen it in a long time either.This time around, I was armed with a lot more knowledge and worldly experience that came in handy. The funny thing though, I came away from it with basically the same feeling about Hal. I honestly think he was perhaps one of the most trustworthy characters in the film and I firmly believe he did what he did in self-defense. After all, the crew he worked with, that ""claimed"" (ingenuously) to think of him as just another crew-mate, were prepared to murder him (or lobotomize him) on the mere chance that he might make an error. Obviously, it would be monstrous to treat a human that way, but Hal realized he'd never get justice since they would never see him as having emotions and true personhood. Hal didn't become a murderer because he was a robot who was too tied town in logic to have a heart, he murdered out of desperation, fear, and self-defense. It was a cold and calculated self-defense, but no more so than that of the humans who planned to murder him, nor more so than the apes at the beginning of the movie, murdering each other for a watering hole. Hal became a murderer because he was *TOO* human, not because he wasn't human enough.So the film seems to be saying something about violence and human nature, or the state of nature at least (nasty, brutish, and short). It was appropriate that my partner on this outing was in the middle of a book called *Sex at Dawn* which talks about the connections between societal structures and our assumptions about the state of nature. But 2001 doesn't take a fully Hobbesian view. For Hobbes, it is just in nature that we are doomed to violence. The contract is supposed to save us. But this film seems to suggest that while our violence has become more sophisticated and civilized, it is still violence. Murder never changes, to alter a phrase.As for the end, I still feel mostly lost with that. perhaps it will suddenly make sense to me on future viewings. the important thing is that this movie was more than just eye candy for me this time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1033,Jack-15,Clearly the best Sci-Fi movie ever!,10,12 November 2000,"Appropriately described as Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001 is clearly the greatest science-fiction movie of all time, and perhaps the best movie ever.  I saw this movie when it was first released in 1968, and spent some time thereafter thinking about it and trying to decode its real meaning.  I subsequently found myself reading Clarke's book, which was nearly as  good, to fill in the blanks.  This is one of the few movies I have viewed many times over, and never get tired of it.  It is as mesmerizing the tenth time as was the first.It is rare that a sci-fi movie can have such a suspenseful story and also be one of the most beautiful movies ever filmed.  What an achievement considering that the locale is the bleakness of space.  And can anyone say anything more about how it was set to a musical score.  If any movie can put a person in a trance and hold the person spellbound, this is it.
2001 a Space Odyssey is a true work of art. If you haven't seen it, you are missing something - it will take you on a journey you will never forget.  A word about its sequels - not bad, but ""light-years"" behind their parent. My score - a perfect 10!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1034,Barney-13,YAWN,1,4 December 1998,"I know that this film has an interesting story line but I fail to realise why people see it as a classic as although the special effects must have been wonderful for when it was made, Stanely Kubrick takes far too long to get the story over and before you find out what is going to happen you have fallen asleep due to the tediously slow story, take for instance the scene with the apes at the beginning it takes about 20 minutes before they actually do anything so you are left waiting getting sleepier and sleepier.RATING:1 out of 10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1035,Tom-267,The only realistic space movie,10,22 February 1999,"This is my early favorite.  Though Star Wars is flashy and fun, it breaks the laws of physics and gets the space travel all wrong.Kubrick lets the spacecraft carry the story forward quietly and majestically, yet at no point is it boring.  ""2001"" is really the opposite of the loud, short-attention span space movies that have always been the norm.  You must keep watching because there are countless detailed things going on at all times--antennas turning, computer screens flashing, machines smoothly operating--that are all critical to the story, yet not explained except visually.  It's a real treat for the moviegoer because it assumes some intelligence on your part.There are really only a few minor technical flaws I could point out (but why bore you?). It is amazingly advanced for its time (1968).  It has the look and feel, the sights and sounds of what spacecraft MUST be in order to function properly.So what if the dialog is uncomfortable, stiff and stilted?  This is one of the only movies to get it right technically.  It also introduces HAL 9000, the hypnotically perfect-talking computer, the most famous movie computer character of them all.The first 20-minute part, the prelude, consists of proto-humans (hairy apes!) roaring and bashing each other with animal bones.  It's bearable because of what comes at the end of the prelude.  The transition from savagery, as the beast triumphs over his foe and hurls his thighbone club into the air, to civilization, as the bone turns into a satellite gracefully gliding by in orbit (to the opening bars of ""The Blue Danube Waltz"") sends chills up and down my spine every time.The last 20 minutes are nothing but psychedelic colors and absurdly out-of-place scenes, as the astronaut Dave goes through a portal to ""the infinite.""  It's a sharp contrast to the rational, paced logic of the middle section of the film, similar to the deep contrast between the pre-civilization primates and the space-faring people of 2001.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1036,mmt02,Greatest Movie of All Time,10,3 June 1999,"Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is  the greatest cinema experience of all time:  1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen.  The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most  stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow  Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate)  depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space  scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds  to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL).  The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is  a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original  release, it was a favorite ""trip"" movie. I can think of no other movie  that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry  Phantom Menace fans!)  2) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick  likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his  characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such  as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces  are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M  and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the  audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of  HAL's glowing red ""eye"" to show the coldness and determination of the  computerizd villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the  hieght of his style.  3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I  whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000.  Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and  the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and  his crewmen are isolated between earth and jupiter, with nowhere to  escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000  and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although  having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a  particular scene.  4) The controversial  ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of  trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of  2001's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the  ending serves to leave the movie open-ended. Kubrick has stated that he  inteded to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the  hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick  allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful  discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is  that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely  plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an  entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great  Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly  meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the  mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a  widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1037,michaelsjmurphy,Not to be missed!!,10,29 November 1999,"A visual masterpiece, this is among the most amazingly photographed films ever made. It's a thinking-person's movie- there are no easy answers. Kubrick demands that his audience see his world in shades of grays.  It takes a long. long time before any dialogue is heard, and yet so much is communicated merely through the non-verbal cues captured by the lens and the music.  The shot of the bone becoming the space shuttle is among the most awesome (and copied) editing jobs in film history, and the star-gate sequence may be the best use of special effects ever produced.This film is best seen on the big screen in order to fully appreciate the way-ahead-of-its-time special effects and scope of the film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1038,thing-16,"Slightly flawed, otherwise a great film",8,31 July 2006,"Yes, I did not give 2001 a perfect score. I gave it an 8- and 8 because of a few choice reasons. Instead of getting into every aspect of the film like others do, I will just explain these problems.The first was about the first scene in space, where the music is playing and it's just showing the ship moving ever so slowly towards the space station. That part dragged on way too long, and I found myself growing restless as I sat there. The second complaint was that so much was left unanswered. What was the significance of the monolith? Why did HAL go mad? How did he turn into the starchild or whatever its called? Where the heck WAS he at the end? That irked me, and took away from the film (though I was thinking about these things for quite a while).Otherwise, great film. Very entertaining when somethings happening, and expertly done by a masterful director, but if you're looking for action packed sci-fi or just a popcorn movie or something to watch on Saturday night, stay far away.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1040,buttercupywesley,Profundity doesn't always equal the Bruckheimer pacing,10,12 August 2006,"For those who don't get this film and decided to post your angry thoughts because others have correctly commented on why you ""don't get it"". Being angry at this film because you weren't bright enough to ""get it"", just illustrates that anger/violence goes hand in hand with limited (self-imposed or not) comprehension.It is very true that this film requires an intellect that is probing in nature. Kubrick and Clarke said on many occasions that this film was more about asking questions, not answering them.The questions were profound indeed.Why are we here? How did we get here? Is the Universe self-aware? Is the Universe a ""clock"" like Einstein implied? Or is it a ""gaming table"" like Stephen Hawking implied? Do we have the ingredients to stay around? (Remember, the dinosaurs were around for hundreds of millions of years). Is technology in and of itself a moral good? Or is it like everything else, dependent on the use it is put to by sentient beings. Why are we curious? What is the definition of intelligence? Does being curious lead to ultimate answers or just more questions? Why can we not see the paradox of our own nature? Is humility a sign of greatness or weakness? etc.For those complaining about the pacing, or how bored you were, or how the dialogue didn't impress you, or how you were just confused instead of entertained I've got some help for you. The movie in fact isn't lacking. It's your ADD/MTV definition of what entertainment should be that is lacking. Sometimes profundity is more entertaining than a playstation or a 3 minute music video. In order to ""get"" that, you must have brain matter that is more complex than the remnants in a soap dish.Kubrick = entertainment on too many levels for some folks.

1041,aaronbroere,Brilliant,9,24 March 2020,"When I finally saw this movie, I was blown away by the fact that this came out in 1968. The visuals are amazing and a long way ahead of its time. The music used in this film creates so much atmosphere, which fits the movie perfectly. The plot is easy to follow but hard to understand and open for one's own interpretation.Still I didn't rate 2001: A Space Odyssey a perfect 10 and here's why:
In my opinion the acting isn't great, the very best character in this movie is a robot. The other characters didn't stand out to me. Besides the acting there is another little flaw in my opinion, which is the pacing. I don't mind a slow paced movie and I understand it adds to the epicness of the film, but this movie is extremely slow paced. It easily could've been about 20 to 30 minutes shorter without any differences to the actual movie.2001: A Space Odyssey belongs in the category 'style over substance' and sure isn't for everyone.

Our conscience formed as a single entity, as we the physical human forms. Carried out into all species and now defined by a technological state of war. Every finding of new worlds, possible life, possible existence created in its greatest battles to triumph over the next. Every possible win and loss to the next creation of life in worlds lost in space. A timeless complex of truth between humanity and life on Earth, to the outer reaches of our universe and all its torture in time. Stanley Kubrick, there is no other like you, nor I or any being.

I have seen other well reviewed films before, but I didn't feel they lived up to the praise. 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, however completely blew my mind as a film. First of all, the special effects are amazing and even by 2021 standards. The actual film itself made me feel like I was witnessing the meaning of life itself. I have seen any other films by Stanley Kubrick at this point, but I don't believe any other films to be as unique and eye-opening as this. I enjoy other films more than 2001: A SPACE ODYSESSY, but none have ever made me feel like this one has. The fear, awe, and spectacle of this film leave me breathless. Not to mention the music. I heard good things about this soundtrack before, but I have never actually listened to it. From the opening of the film, to the end, the music fit the film perfectly. In this film particularly, there are many moments of silence only filled with music and heavy-breathing. The grand scale and mystery of the film was perfectly matched by the wonderful music. It is for these reasons that I am rating this film nine stars out of ten. If you have not seen this film yet, I highly recommend watching it at least once, no matter what genres you are interested in (and especially if you like surreal/sci-fi). There are many complaints that the film is too long and boring, but you will get used to the pacing of the film when watching it.

1048,matt_in_da_net,art and the mysterious,10,1 September 2010,"The way i see it, this movie is meant to be ambiguous and mysterious as it tries to represent the greatest mystery of them all - the universe, and our existence. Kubrick does not try and give us the answers in this film, so don't over-analyze and go looking for them! What Kubrick tries to do here is imbue us with this ancient sensation of awe and wonder for the mysterious (in particularly, the mystery of the universe).""The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed."" - Albert Einstein",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I'll admit myself, if I wasn't at a screening of this film I would have probably stopped watching it not long after the Dawn of Man scene, but after staying through the entire length, I am more than happy to say that the movie is pure genius. The long shots assisted by orchestral music gives you the feeling that you're part of the odyssey as opposed to just watching another movie (which is probably the feeling that has made Kubrick so famous). It is an older movie, but the mechanical effects are fantastic (with the exception of the apes), and it feels like you're watching a film that is years younger.

The Jupiter mission sequence with HAL offers some of the most frightening and suspenseful moments ever in a science fiction film.I'm not sure, but this may also be one of the first pictures, which also served as a blatant advertisement for a sponsor.  As Dr. Floyd is transported to the space station via the shuttle, the Pan American logo is conspicuously visible in several places.  There can be no mistake where at least some of the film's funding came from.The story in itself is almost impossible to follow without having first read the book.  Even then, much is left up to the viewer's interpretation.  This only adds some allure to this great movie.A must see movie!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1058,rileyedwardcowan,Kubricks most artistic masterpiece,10,28 June 2012,"There are very few directors that were as specific and attentive to detail as Stanley Kubrick. Every single scene in 2001: A Space Odyssey is like a work of cinematic art. I can imagine Kubrick filming each scene a hundred times until it's exactly the way he imagined it. This is what made him such a legendary director and set him apart from everyone else.I first watched this film about 10 years ago and I couldn't believe the special effects. I can't imagine what people thought of it when it first came out. I'm sure a lot of people didn't know what to think about it at first. The first third of the movie has no dialogue and the last third is basically an acid trip sequence with no dialogue as well. It's very different than anything you've seen but if you have the right mind set, it will blow your mind.The acting is very good, but the movie relies heavily on everything else. The plot is not explained very well but the open ended questions are what makes it so mysterious and mind boggling. You see what happens and your questions aren't fully answered but your imagination fills in the blanks and in my opinion that's the best way to do it.It starts out at the dawn of man, when we were all just ape-like creatures waiting to evolve. The group of apes (let's call them) that we see are suddenly looking upon a giant, rectangle monolith that appeared out of nowhere. When the apes touch the monolith their minds are opened up to a new stage in evolution, the use of tools. After this long and dialogue-free part of the movie, it jumps forward to the year 2001 in a split second. The world has discovered yet another monolith except this one is on the surface of the moon. I don't want to get into too much detail but basically they find out that it's origin is one of Jupiter's moons. Earth then decides to send its best spaceship off on a mission to see exactly where the monolith came from. The spaceship is equipped with the best astronauts, and the most advanced computer ever built, HAL 9000. We are then sent on the wild ride to Jupiter and a lot happens on the way that you don't expect.Basically, 2001 is a longer than average movie and has a lot of quiet parts with only the sound of breathing or apes grunting. If you have the patience to sit back and appreciate a cinematic piece of art, then this is the movie for you. If your attention span is tiny and you don't like space movies, I suggest skipping this one. If you happen to take acid or any visual enhancing drugs, this movie will be especially satisfying, but drugs or not, it's a masterpiece of film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1062,pat_22,Review and deconstruction of 2001.,10,3 August 2013,"2001: A Space Odyssey directed by Stanley Kubrick is a mind-bending sci- fi symphony, lifted with raw stimulation and heavy symbolism. It is potentially one of, if not the most influential and significant science fiction feature length film in cinema history. Its intention, (quoted by Kubrick himself) is to avoid the conscience rationalizations of its audience and to sink straight through to the unconscious, he demands us to interpret the film on more intelligent and complex levels. Kubrick's masterpiece is justly acknowledged as the inception of the futuristic revelation of space adventure films that entice, engage and at times intrigue viewers. It can perceived on many different levels, but we as the viewer can enter inside the central intention of Arthur C. Clarke from the literary piece, and watch the visually motivating interpretation fashioned by Stanley Kubrick whom in my eyes through his methodical directing provides unsurpassed brilliance and genuinely awe- inspiring depictions of stories which are second to none to any other director. His meticulousness behind the camera and precision to fully engage an audience is remarkable. On this particular example, Kubrick takes a well written novel to an extraordinary style over substance, art house psychological thriller standing the test of time, maintaining its relevance and significance in cinematic history.Kubrick ambitiously predicts the future and explores the past by visiting pre-historic Africa showing apes learning of 'the tool' whilst they face the monolith unexplained by Kubrick, it is a major obstacle defining their existence. The film takes 25 minutes to introduce opening dialogue, yet the twenty five establishing minutes is thought-provoking and invigorating opening sequence. The monolith being a key figure to this opening, at every stage when we here the unsettling and somewhat disturbing tune that resides with the monolith. It crafts an overpowering ambiance, not only for the audience but it dominates over the characters it meets. There are many different meanings as to what the monolith represents; it is heavily indicated that extraterrestrial beings placed it there to see how humans have evolved through time, but I like to believe that it symbolizes us as the audience watching over the characters. We are the monolith watching the film and the characters unravel themselves in significant moments, similarly how Kubrick has given us a film to watch and we judge it accordingly.From exploring the dawn of man, the film takes a staggering jump cut through time into colonised space delving into uncharted realms. We as the audience suddenly have to familiarize ourselves with new characters and thus acquainted with a new theme. Man vs. machine. This is where the core story line lays, and where at its heart we tend to feel every emotion making us feel indisputably uneasy. Despite this film not being overly sentimental, (which is seemingly the pattern through all Kubrick films) its ambiance and out of this world atmosphere is almost startling. Stanley subtly tells us that even man at its evolutionary peek on Earth is simply a little child in space having to learn to walk without gravity, be toilet trained and have to eat 'baby food'.The theme man against machine is very cunning and intriguing. It shows us that through intelligence, the computer believes it can surpass humans. However with courage and ingenuity the man with spirit can overcome the machine. The HAL 9000, the main antagonist is possibly the most sinister and threatening villain to reach cinema screen. Its relatively disturbingly evil voice echoes through the minds of the viewer and his attitude that he is ever superior to man gives HAL a very distinguishable menacing presence. In many ways the audience acts the same as HAL. Once the memory and logic terminal is extracted from HAL, the viewer experiences a wealth of strange abstract events, we lose all clarity in what we see and from that point the audience is forced by Kubrick to choose their own idea of what is occurring on screen.2001 is perhaps the most beautiful and evocative cinematography I have ever seen in film, it is a rare work of cinema that has stood the test of time, still maintaining it's realistic and authentic space look. This film proves that a sci-fi movie can be philosophical rather than pulpy, profound rather than pedantic. Stanley Kubrick's dazzling; Academy Award-winning achievement is a compelling drama of man vs. machine, a stunning meld of music and motion. ""2001"" is not concerned with thrilling us, but with inspiring our genuine awe. There are many divided opinions about the symbolic and philosophical meanings of this film, many people claim this film to be either a self indulgent art house film, or a work of pure art, in my opinion it is the latter and like the majority of the public I won't be diverted from that opinion. Whatever people may think of the film, it is a work of considerable originality and an unerringly satisfying, utterly unique cinematic experience. Even if you will hate or love this film, it is still recommended from me because it is valuable either way to get a grasp on how Stanley Kubrick artistically and poetically presents his films. This being a perfect example, a true cinematic genius provides us with a true cinematic masterpiece. ""Let the Awe and Mystery of a Journey unlike Any Other Begin.""",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1063,michaelcooke70,Hugely influential sci fi masterpiece,10,14 December 2018,"I first saw this film on t.v. one evening when I was around 8 years old, I didn't like it, I wanted action and scary aliens and bad ass robots rather than just a boring computer 'Voice'!
However the visuals stuck with me for years.
Then I saw it again when I was around 18 years old and it's been in my personal top 10 films ever since!
I finally got it, I finally understood why it avoids sci fi cliches.
Despite it being one of my favourite films I do understand why it is regarded as boring with nothing really happening, it's a film you have to watch while being on the right wavelength for it.
It's the concepts and hypnotic atmosphere that make it a truly great film, rather than action etc.
When I'm on the right wavelength I am transported to the 'infinite and beyond' , and because nothing is explained it leaves me spellbound until at the end of the film I snap back into the 'here and now' and I think to myself... 'WOW!! that really is one of the greatest films ever made' !

Kubrick's ambiguous finish to this suspenseful trip will leave you debating and theorising its purpose for a long time.Further positive aspects include its eerie score and music throughout (notably at the beginning), the visually pleasing aesthetic, and contrastingly the use of silence to truly prove that ""no one can hear you scream in space.""I strongly recommend watching this film in a dark room with no distractions in order to achieve the full cinematic experience, and hopefully it will not disappoint.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

But I just felt that the film, overall, never really gets going and is simply too slow.

That was 2 weeks! First of the beginning... a bunch of monkey jumping around. Well OK, but for 13 minutes? And what are tapers doing in middle of the desert? Next off the spaceships with Blue Dan Eu, couldn't they have written their own music? There are no words to describe how slow this movie is. With the stuff they had in it, it should have been ten minutes long! Oh HAL might have had his moments, but his death was the most boring thing ever. No music, just Daisy, and that was bad because computers can't sing. The flying colors at the end, oh ouch. I know most of it was landscape negatives, but you only had to show one to get your point across. It strains the eyes so much, that me and my friends that I was watching it with all had headaches.

Technically marvelous, every detail is accounted for and engineered for a purpose. The innovation of ""2001"" saturates the film in every frame.

1077,Mike_WL,"A profound, philosophical vision",10,9 March 1999,"Ironically there are only a few science fiction films that have the ability to inspire us and not thrill us, Stanley Kubrick´s masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is one of those few. It tells the story of our evolution from ape to man, human beings first encounter with never seen aliens, and the eventual chaos of human dependence on machines. Bringing an almost absurd narrative style into modern cinema, Kubrick created the perhaps most daring film ever, special, still today, for the lack of dialog and apparent story. Instead of thrilling our minds the director made a bold and profound philosophical statement, not only on man and the existence of other beings in the universe, but on a higher entity guiding and controlling our evolution. It never becomes clear what the strange monolith that appears every time man evolves, stands for, nor what it is. It could just as well be a religious allegory but unfortunately Kubrick´s tragic death will prevent us from ever knowing. Nor is it in anyway clear what the last 15 minutes represents, and where the astronaut goes can in no way be answered. Many theories has and will be written down, but I say let it be, let there be one moment in film history that baffles and confuses more than gives any explanation.

1080,redodson,Breathtaking beyond words!,10,2 April 1999,"I still have not recovered from the tragic news of Stanley Kubrick's death that came as such a shock to me on the morning of March 8, 1999. I am rarely moved by the passing of a ""public figure"", but that was an exception. Having been born in 1946, my ""coming of age"" is intimately associated with Mr. Kubrick's greatest films, ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", and ""A Clockwork Orange"". It has always seemed something of a miracle (or profound genius) to me that one man, almost single handedly, could have created three of the greatest masterpieces in all of the cinema within a period of less than a decade.Very, very few films are able to convey an equal or greater visual or emotional impact on successive viewings than they did on first viewing, but each of those films does. The passage of time has not diminished the genius or relevance of any of them in any way whatever; and in many ways, they seem even more relevant - or disturbing - than they did 30 years ago. It sounds like a cliche, but I do believe that I have lived in an era that has produced very few artistic geniuses - the only three that come to mind as having had a profound effect on my intellectual development are Tennessee Williams, Leonard Bernstein, and Stanley Kubrick. I must confess that when I first saw ""2001"", I was overwhelmed by the ""space-time convolution"" sequence (for want of a better description) near the end of the film, and I felt then that I did not understand it at all. But that one sequence etched itself into my mind so indelibly that I have been drawn back, again and again, to the film ever since. (In hindsight, I suspect that this was exactly the effect that Mr. Kubrick had in mind from the outset, rather than any specific or ""profound"" philosophical interpretation of the sequence.)  That sequence is one of only three works of art that I can think of that, for me, can conjure up the illusion of a near ""out-of-body"" experience.  (The other two being the final act of ""Tristan und Isolde"", and the trio from the last act of ""Der Rosenkavalier""; all three are creations of almost indescribable audio-visual beauty and perfection.) In summary, good-bye, Mr. Kubrick. We shall all miss your towering, if hidden, presence, but we can take comfort in the knowledge that you have once again set out on your journey to whatever lies ""beyond the infinite....""",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Where narrative structure and dialogue are never lost on the small screen, the aesthetics of sight and sound that imbue the viewer in the transcendent experience that all cinema has the potential to be, are lost in that environment. Those who may have endured (or attempted to endure) this opus in the inferior format that found themselves doubting the integrity of the film or the validity of its supporters can bare no argument that can hold any water until they have witnessed it in the theatre. Moreover, even those supporters of the picture that have viewed it approvingly on their television monitors have short changed themselves and the filmmaker to have given praise without this experience.

1087,Edmund_Bloxam,Pales in comparison to the book,3,22 August 2007,"Although the book was written as a response to the screenplay, it appears the written word has gone further to explore the massive potential of the idea.Ultimately the book is a genre novel, but what it succeeds in doing is evoking the contrast of REAL LIFE and the MYSTERIOUS UNKNOWN of outer space in thoughtfully constructed juxtaposition.There is none of this in the film. It is all moody and serious faces. Since there was no reality in the film, the 'mystery' becomes the norm.Particularly wasted is the trip through the star gate, the crux of all the awe-inspiring messages about humankind's place in the universe. As described in the book in dizzying but sensible detail, a magnificent journey takes place. As for the film, Bowman appears to descend through entirely abstract flashing lights. There are many things he is supposed to see, including THE WHOLE UNIVERSE. The surreal trip to the hotel is wasted too, since we are never told why he is there. This is a journey through life in its entirety (young-old, innocence-knowledge), yet it is SO RUSHED in the film none of these things are even suggested.There is an attempt to make the film 'graceful', and the use of music is also a part of this. However, if the same music is played repeatedly, then there is no, if you like, 'heart' left. One is listening to habit, rather than 'beauty' (Johann Strauss Jnr) or 'empowerment' (Richard Strauss). Music does not challenge if there is no change.The Ligeti pieces chosen reflect continuous motion. Why not, then, have different snippets? Why the same bit?

1091,patricktday,Beauty Without Meaning,5,22 August 2021,"2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the most renowned films of all time. Often you'll hear pretentious film students talk about how existential the experience is, how grandiose the scope of the film is, and what a wonderful thing it's saying - but never have I heard anyone say what the film is actually about.There's something to be said about ambiguity (when it's employed well) and how it can enhance the experience of a film, truly decide whether or not you like it, in a way that is very hit or miss. Some of my favourite films of the last decade use ambiguity as a tool to work their magic and remain within the viewer after the experience (take The Lighthouse, for example) but in order for ambiguity to work in this way, there needs to be a degree of certainty.What I mean by this is that with those other films there are unquestionable aspects of the movie that work as a foundation for the ambiguity to operate: you know about the world, characters, etc. And there is a general understanding to be had of the film before those (in some cases) off-kilter scenes happen that leave the audience questioning things. But without this foundation, you make the audience question everything, which ultimately makes them question nothing; if there is nothing known or certain, no central premise or foundation, no actual intrinsic story or direction to the film, then the film is at its core, about nothing.I've heard people use the ""Show vs. Tell"" argument in discussion around movies such as 2001, and they say that films such as this are greater than films that ""tell"" you everything going on. What I posit to these people, as a genuine question with no arrogance or ill intent, is what is this film ""showing"", then? The film opens with 20 minutes of ape footage depicting the evolution of man after a black box appears. This is uninteresting and frankly, boring. The ""questions"" the film is apparently ""asking"" you are juvenile and uninteresting. ""Oooo where did this box come from, what does it represent?""These are boring questions to ponder when you have to experience a film lacking in any foundation, the writing, when it happens (in the third act) is brilliant, but for the first long, drawn out two thirds of the film, there is little to no dialogue besides exposition about an infection that eventually leads nowhere and matters nothing to the core of the film, other than to posit another pointless ""question"" when the audience learns that this quarantined space station features... uh oh... the black box!The problem with 2001's ambiguity in this sense is that it's everywhere, to the point where the basic premise of the film can't even be agreed upon. If such an opinion makes myself a lesser film critic then fine, but ambiguity for its own sake, or for the sake of neglecting any writing duties, is terrible. What's the point in ambiguity if the audience is forced to virtually make their own story out of something? To me, there isn't one. Either paint the canvas or leave it blank, don't spray the middle with sporadic splodges of alluded meaning and ask me to finish it for you, to make it into something myself.While the film, in a logical sense, has direction (in that it has a goal, an end point), it is entirely devoid of meaning. The final act of the film is good, and features actual writing alongside intense surrealism. Although, like the rest of the film, said surrealism - with those glorious colours dancing hyper-actively across the screen - lasts too long, and even the hypnotic blend of flowing vibrancy becomes, somehow, uninteresting.It's almost as though the film itself is aware that it has no tangible direction, so it flattens the few powerful moments it possesses by indulging in them, hoping to convince you that the experience is worthwhile due to such moments, but to the point of such embellishment becoming a hinderance to the moment, destroying the power it once had, and thus weakening the experience overall; the film itself ruins what little pace and fascination it builds.The film is generally too long, too drawn out, it features dialogue that is utterly inconsequential or irrelevant, and yet, it is praised for what is considered to be its unique ""storytelling"". Who knew that dispensing with narrative entirely would be considered ""subverting the medium"" by so many.Though its influence and spectacular direction are undeniable, the film is somehow, at the same time grandiose yet uncharismatic, vibrant yet lifeless; deliberate, yet without meaning. Even said direction and influence do not mean the film is good. On the contrary, 2001 is an indulgent, sloppy mess of a film that proves movies are not greater than the sum of their parts - you can have great cinematography and direction, decent actors and the works - but in the end, if the film is merely masquerading behind its faux existentialism and tacked-on ambiguity as a crux to relieve the intricacies of storytelling, if it drags itself on past the point of being tolerable for no purpose, and if it is, at its core, fundamentally devoid of any coherent meaning beyond pretension, it's no masterpiece.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1092,fromwalking,Artistic and scientific masterpiece,10,5 November 2012,"This could be a very personal film to anybody who thinks he/she understands the underlying meaning of Clarke what's he actually saying here. In any given future, mankind will inevitably attain a Class III civilization state ergo the monolith could be considered merely a beacon for HAL. Best example of an encounter between a class 0 and a class III (the Dr.M.Kaku civ scale).As a skilled scientist (math, physics) Arthur C. Clarke had proved to be a trustworthy futurologist in combination with Stanley Kubrick's artistic perception this turned out to be one of the best if not The Best Film ever.The moral question of a decisive computer is scary, the music is fabulous and the entire screenplay is genius.

My frame of reference made this movie seem like a long road to nowhere The plot moves too slow the dialogue is ancient the music whilst iconic was used out of context. I fear that a lot of people would give this movie a high rating because of the name and the aura the movie invokes and I can see how it is supposed to be a landmark movie moment. Fair enough this movie spawned some great concepts and i am grateful for that. However in my opinion and from my frame of reference i did not enjoy it one bit.,2001 - A Space Odyssey

Flat-out STUNNING visuals, (the best cinematography in any film i've ever seen), a profound, implicit and deep theme that ties the movie together and has you thinking on it for years after. The visual effects are comparable to those of movies today, which shows the pain staking efforts Kubrik and crew must have put into them. The musical score pulls you along the length of the story which is told more so with visuals and music than dialogue. Those who find it boring must get stuck on the surface (not to mention have a lack of knowledge of photography) because once you start seeing the depth of the message, plot and theme the pacing of the movie is almost too fast as you need plenty of time to try to wrap yourself around some of these concepts, and thats coming from somebody who studies quantam physics!!! Not only is this the definitive Sci-fi, this is the definitive drama, suspense and above all the defining moment for cinematography in movie history.

1096,atomicpunks22,The longest two hours of your life,8,6 May 2008,"this movie, is by no means bad it is revolutionary for its time and has one of the best endings in history, one that even when you find out exactly what it means, you still wonder just what the director was trying to say. The ending stays with you for days, weeks, you can't stop thinking about it.the other thing you can't stop thinking about is how long this friggen movie is. After what feels like yo reached the three and a half hour mark, u look and and see that it is only a two hour movie, and you are only an hour into the movie that is a sad, sinking feeling my friends.the beginning is very interesting, and the ending is fantastic the middle is what i have problems with. at first the main focus was about the black monoliths, for about 40 minutes, thats all its showed or talked about then dave come along and all that changes. Now its up to dave to stop his spazzed out computer friends HAL.Now looking back, HAL had actually no reason to be in the film except for letting the audience know why dave is the sole survivor of that ship.To top it off, the whole time, there is barley any music, just dave talking to monotone HAL, and boring as hell SOUNDLESS SHOTS THAT LAST MINUTES in space, i know there is no sound in space, but can't you add music to it like you did in the beginning of the movie? despite this, the HAL moments were actually entertaining, it just was a little boring at times.This is the only reason why i did not give it a perfect score, it has this huge epic feel to it, yet the only thing that is epic about it was the beginning and the very end, the middle, well is just dull, and the only reason one maintains interest in the movie is for kubricks awe inspiring shots Some movie has about 3 good money shots, 2001 is RIDDLED WITH THEM, one cant watch 2 minutes without an incredible shot! overall, a good movie, weird but good ending, incredible shots, but the middle lags ebough to be nit pick about",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It was interesting how they thought what the future would look like in this, but seriously I was very bored watching this. There was hardly any action. Although the Classical orchestra soundtrack was very nice. The visuals were very creative. Whenever this movie pops on TV, I feel like changing the station instantly. Not because it is a bad movie, just because I know what I am in for when watching this - complete and total boredom. It is a movie I saw when I was young, but I never got into the science fiction thing... because it simply wasn't real. Just like this movie - very unrealistic. I never understood half the movie anyway.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1098,guitarfunk420,Would have been better on drugs,5,29 November 2013,"Although this movie had it's moments and it was quite artistically beautiful to watch, I'm gonna have to side with the people saying this movie is too slow, a bit on the boring side, not really any point to it, etc.Some of the scenes like the ship landing on the moon and going slowly downwards to land with the fancy music, I was just literally thinking what is the point of this? Is it REALLY going to show the ship go all the way to the VERY bottom??? At least it cut if off like halfway wow, so slow!There just seemed to be a lot of very slow and boring shots. Yes some of them were nice to look at but maybe I'm just impatient I processed the information pretty fast I don't need to see basically the same shot for an extra 10-100 seconds for every scene...And it seems that the lack of dialog was done intentionally, I think this was a mistake. Even though all the dialog was pretty basic it was some of the more interesting parts of the movie to me. They really should have done a bit more with the whole HAL going psycho thing and them trying to figure out what to do. Instead he makes one little mistake and they instantly freak out and plot his death right in front of the camera. It was obvious to me watching the scene in the pod for the first time that HAL would be able to know what was said whether by manually activating the microphones in the pod or with the camera I wasn't sure.And then HAL kills the guy and he goes flying off into space and his team member is just like oh darn better collect his corpse. No emotion, no anger, it's like he's a robot just like HAL or something. Was this intended? I don't know it just could have been so much more of an intense and interesting story with some slight differences. Kubrick says he didn't take any drugs but I find that hard to believe when watching this movie sober. This really seems like something someone on mushrooms, LCD, or just baked out of his mind on Marijauna would direct. I'd still give it at least a 5/10 just because for it's time it must have been quite a visual feat, and it still looks good so many years later. But I was just expecting so much more to happen and it's like they did the bare minimum and just tried to like do beautiful or trippy cinematography to appeal to druggies or something. Apparently their plan worked as I guess their biggest audience in the theaters were people getting high to watch the psychedelic wormhole scene.I also really don't understand the ending with the wormhole and the weird room and his aging and rebirth, but given the intentional lack of story/context/events in the movie I don't really think there is a good explanation no matter how much you analyze it so I won't give it much of a second thought.This movie kind of reminds me of how I saw ""Avatar"" 3D on mushrooms. It was the most intense and visually amazing thing I've ever seen and when I got out of the theater I was just like ""wow, that was the most amazing thing I've ever seen."" But now I'm scared to watch it sober because it will probably be just a huge let down when the visuals don't just blow my mind, that's how I feel about 2001: A Space Odyssey. Maybe give me a ton of mushrooms and I could see what some of you see with this one.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1100,razwee,Kubrick and Clarke team to form a poetic sci-fi marvel,10,10 May 2004,"The first time I ever saw 2001: A Space Odyssey was when I was in middle school. It was on network television, and my father grabbed me just in time to see two apes using bones to bludgeon another ape to death in the middle of a large puddle of water. ""Watch what happens next,"" he said, sounding rather dramatic. Of course looking back on this, I know why this was so important to him. What I was about to see was one of the most memorable visual transitions in film history. An ape tosses his bone in the air. It rotates in slow motion, before succumbing to gravity, and as it falls, there is an abrupt cut to, of all places, outer space. In place of the bone is a spaceship, an exact graphic match.Not quite understanding what I had just seen, and being the inquisitive kid that I was, I found a copy of Arthur C. Clarke's novel of same name, and attempted to read it before I saw the complete film. After finishing the book, I was amazed by the ideas it put forth, and felt I was ready to view the film. I watched it in its entirety, and I again saw the bone to spaceship transition, but I still did not feel confident that I knew what the hell was going on.The significance of this startling image was not immediately apparent to me until I viewed the film again recently on the big screen. The abrupt nature of the transition serves to make the passage of time seem relatively insignificant, and in doing so, suggests that what we see as marvelous innovation (i.e.--technology and space exploration) is actually just a drop in the bucket in the greater universal scheme. Although this transition is the most memorable in the film, it represents only one of its several visual and aural matches that reflect upon the film's fictional exploration of the story behind human evolution.The film begins with a section entitled ""The Dawn of Man"". We are introduced to a pack of apes who wander around their grounds doing nothing but seeking food and water. When other apes intrude, they fill the air with wild shrieks, attempting to scare off the invaders. They have no way to hunt, and no way to defend themselves against predators. It is a very primitive existence.Then one night, the apes are awoken by an eerie, otherworldly sound. They emerge from their cave and find in front of it a giant black slab, perfectly smooth and sturdy. They are wary at first, but one by one, they gradually crowd around the monolith, as the sound grows louder and more discordant. Later, we see a single ape fidgeting aimlessly with an animal skeleton. Suddenly, the ape's face lights up with a sudden understanding. The air begins to fill with the music of Richard Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"", a musical selection which this film immortalized (and is often referred to as ""The 2001 song""). We quickly see a close image of the monolith with the sun centered high above it, and we now see the monolith's results. The ape lifts one of the animal's bones high above his head and makes brutal clubbing motions. He has found his weapon.The next time another pack of apes threatens, he takes his newfound discovery, and uses it to beat one of the pack members to death. Thus, the dawn of man arrives, and the monolith's work has begun.The remainder of the film focuses on where man has gone since then, and towards the end, delves into where man might be going. And the monolith is omnipresent. The pacing is slow and deliberate, as one would expect from a Kubrick film, and while some might view it as cumbersome, others will revel in it due to the unforgettable imagery. Due to zero gravity environments, we see people walking on all four walls, and there are several shots in which people seem to walk upside down and around rooms. We again see the spaceships which resemble the bone and also giant space stations which revolve like a wheel, yet another symbol of human innovation.The amazing feat which Kubrick pulls off, however, is making it seem very real and plausible, rather than something purely science fictional. The shots seem almost like a ballet rather than an innovative sci-fi effect. Of course, having Johann Strauss's ""Blue Danube Waltz"" in the background helps with this, and I'd guess that the music was chosen for just that purpose.Following the stunning ""Blue Danube"" sequence, we are introduced to Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) of the National Council of Aeronautics. He is heading to a base on the moon to investigate a finding which has been kept secret from the public. Along the way, we see more futuristic signs of innovation: an orbiting Hilton Hotel and a video phone. A foreshadowing dialogue with other doctors in the hotel relates just how secret and important the investigation is.When Dr. Floyd reaches the moon, we find out what the secret is. He and several other scientists descend into a giant trench which holds another monolith, identical to the one which catalyzed the ape transformations. Again, we hear the eerie discordant sounds (excerpts from ""Lux Aeterna"" by György Ligeti, one of Kubrick's favorite composers). The humans crowd around the strange monolith to take a picture, and although it feels much more civilized, there is an unsettling resemblance to the primitive apes throwing themselves at the earlier monolith, all clawing for their own touch. Just at that moment, a deafening, high-pitched tone pierces the scientists' ears, and this section of the story suddenly concludes.The middle section of the film takes place 18 months later on the ship Discovery, which is bound for Jupiter. The crew includes David Bowman (Keir Dullea), Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), three other doctors who are in hibernation chambers, and the HAL 9000 computer (voiced by Douglas Rain). HAL is a marvel of modern computer technology. He has a perfect operational record, speaks with seemingly genuine emotion, and acts as another member of the crew. There is a very revealing moment when Bowman discusses his view on whether or not HAL has true emotions.But when something goes wrong with HAL, and Bowman and Poole decide to disconnect him, HAL fights back, and along the way becomes one of the most monstrous villains in film history. We fear HAL so greatly not because he has a booming voice or a cruel heart, but for the exact opposite reason. He speaks quietly and calmly in a detached manner and is merely ensuring that he can do the job he was programmed to do: stay functional and make sure the mission is complete. As a computer, he does not understand the terrible things he is doing, and this makes him all the more terrifying. (It is interesting to note that Anthony Hopkins used HAL as his model when trying to create his interpretation of the cold and monstrous Hannibal Lecter).When Bowman finally gets into the chamber housing the equipment of HAL's central functions, HAL quickly turns from villain to tragic figure. He begs in the same calm voice for Bowman to stop destroying his memory. He says he can ""feel"" his mind going. When Bowman persists, HAL recites one of the most heartbreaking lines in film: ""I'm afraid, Dave."" This sheds a haunting light on the question of HAL's emotional capability.For the sake of preserving novelty, I will not reveal much about the film's final half hour. I will say two things however. One: It represents some of the most brilliant cinema I have ever seen. Two: If you do not read the book, you will be extremely perplexed by what transpires. Suffice it to say that the monolith's role in human evolution is finally brought to the forefront. In addition, the aesthetics and suspense of the last ten minutes are, simply put, beautiful and awe-inspiring.It is hard to imagine any director other than Kubrick at the helm of this project. The misanthropic undercurrents regarding technological innovation reflect upon Kubrick's persistent interest in the dehumanization of society (e.g.--A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, Full Metal Jacket). Kubrick's meticulous, deliberate directing caters perfectly to the vast emptiness and solitude of space. His sense of composition provides for striking, often disturbing imagery (consider the sun towering directly over the center of the monolith, or Bowman and Poole conversing on opposite ends of the frame with HAL in the background exactly in the middle of the frame). The visual effects, designed by Kubrick himself, are a testament to how creativity can rise above technological limitation, considering that there was no such thing as digital manipulation.Perhaps the most amazing thing about 2001: A Space Odyssey is that despite the fact that it is almost 35 years old, and despite the fact that its vision of the future was not entirely accurate, it does not seem at all dated. The issues raised in the film are as relevant now as they were then. Certainly, human evolution is an issue that will continue to be debated for many years to come. Due to its unforgettable imagery, its novel use of classical music, and its brilliant conclusion, 2001: A Space Odyssey will not soon be forgotten.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Russians and Americans alike had ventured into space but the Moon was still a working progress and as for the other planets, most remained relative mysteries. It is quite amazing that of all things, a movie, would be the first look into the rest of our solar system, but to merely say that 'space odyssey' is an adventure of the solar system would be giving it nowhere near the credit it deserves. It is so much more, its an adventure of humankind, of our souls, of our minds. Almost half a century has passed since its creation and yet its filming techniques and special effects are still the envy of sci-fi film makers the world over. Not just anyone could've made this movie, it is a piece of pure unadulterated genius and should come as no surprise that Kubrick in his almost infinite directional wisdom delivered such a massive and ambitious project to absolute perfection, perfection that knows not of the bounds and constraints of time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1102,ms1720,what's with all the praise???,6,6 May 2003,"I saw this movie for the first time yesterday and have to say I'm disappointed.  maybe for the time it was a visual breakthrough for film, and maybe it covered uncharted territory, but it's not that good.  this should have been a 45 minute movie, but Kubrick (who is overated on most of his movies) turned this into a load of crap.  like others, I found myself fast forwarding through most of the movie.  I really now can appreciate what Mel Brooks accomplished in Spaceballs.There are some positives...like when we see HAL reading the lips of dave and peter, that was pretty freaky.  the ending sequences are shot beautifully, and for sci-fi I can see how it influenced other films.But it is SO BORING TO WATCH.  if Kubrick had started the movie with a quick scene of the apes and monolith and then gone directly to the scene with the board meeting it would have made this a much better film.  it was grossly long and is not a great film overall.  there are great aspects, but not as a whole.  that is a fallacy of composition.  just because some parts are great, it doesn't make the whole thing great.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1103,Nintendo600,An epic cinematic masterpiece,10,21 May 2017,"2001: A Space Odyssey directed by Stanley Kubrick is a mind-bending sci-fi symphony, lifted with raw stimulation and heavy symbolism. It is potentially one of, if not the most influential and significant science fiction feature length film in cinema history. Its intention, (quoted by Kubrick himself) is to avoid the conscience rationalizations of its audience and to sink straight through to the unconscious, he demands us to interpret the film on more intelligent and complex levels. Kubrick's masterpiece is justly acknowledged as the inception of the futuristic revelation of space adventure films that entice, engage and at times intrigue viewers. It can perceived on many different levels, but we as the viewer can get a grasp of Arthur C. Clarke thoughts from his literary piece, and watch the visually motivating interpretation by Stanley Kubrick, whom in my eyes, through his unconventional directing, provides unsurpassed brilliance and genuinely awe-inspiring depictions of characters within stories are second to none to any other director. His meticulousness behind the camera and precision to fully engage an audience is remarkable. On this particular example, Kubrick takes a well written novel to an extraordinary style over substance, art house psychological thriller standing the test of time, maintaining its relevance and significance in cinematic history.Kubrick ambitiously predicts the future and explores the past by visiting pre-historic Africa; showing apes learning of 'the tool' whilst they face the monolith. The 'Monolith' forever unexplained by Kubrick, is a major obstacle defining their existence. The film takes 25 minutes to introduce opening dialogue, yet the twenty five establishing minutes is thought-provoking and invigorating. The monolith being a key figure to this opening, at every stage when we here the unsettling and somewhat disturbing tune that resides with the monolith, it manufactures an overpowering ambiance, not only for the audience but it dominates over the characters it meets. There are many different theories behind what the monolith represents; it is heavily indicated that extraterrestrial beings placed it there to see how humans have evolved through time, but I like to believe that it symbolizes us as the audience watching over the characters. We are the monolith watching the film and the characters unravel themselves in significant moments, similarly how Kubrick has given us a film to watch and we judge it accordingly.From exploring the dawn of man, the film takes a staggering jump cut through time into colonised space delving into uncharted realms. We as the audience suddenly have to familiarize ourselves with new characters, and thus acquainted with a new theme. Man vs. machine. This is where the core story line lays, and where at its heart we tend to feel every emotion making us feel uneasy or, unsettled. Despite this film not being overly sentimental, (which is seemingly the pattern through all Kubrick films) its ambiance and 'out of this world' atmosphere is almost startling. Kubrick subtly tells us that - even man at its evolutionary peek on Earth is simply a little child in space having to learn to walk without gravity, be toilet trained and have to eat 'baby food' (Further depicted when the enormous baby features in space).The theme of man against machine is very cunning and intriguing. It shows us that through intelligence, the computer believes it can surpass humans. However with courage and ingenuity, the man with spirit can overcome the machine. The HAL 9000, the main antagonist is possibly the most sinister and threatening villain to reach cinema screen, ironically so, given it does not represent emotions humans experience. It's disturbingly evil voice echoes through the minds of the viewer, and his attitude that he is ever superior to man gives HAL a very distinguishable and menacing presence. In many ways the audience acts the same as HAL. Once the memory and logic terminal is extracted from HAL, the viewer experiences a wealth of strange abstract events, we lose all clarity in what we see and from that point the audience is forced by Kubrick to choose their own idea of what is occurring on screen.2001 is perhaps the most beautiful and evocative cinematography I have ever seen in film, it is a rare work of cinema that (as mentioned) has stood the test of time, still maintaining it's realistic and authentic space look. This film proves that a sci-fi movie can be philosophical rather than pulpy, profound rather than pedantic. Stanley Kubrick's dazzling; Academy Award-winning achievement is a compelling drama of man vs. machine, a stunning meld of music and motion. ""2001"" is not concerned with thrilling us, but with inspiring our genuine awe. There are many divided opinions about the symbolic and philosophical meanings of this film, many people claim this film to be either - a self indulgent art house film, or a work of pure art, in my opinion it is the latter and like the majority of the public I won't be diverted from that opinion. Whatever people may think of the film, it is a work of considerable originality and an unerringly satisfying, utterly unique cinematic experience. Even if you will hate or love this film, it is still recommended from me because it is valuable either way to get a grasp on how Stanley Kubrick artistically and poetically presents his films. This being a perfect example, a true cinematic genius provides us with a true cinematic masterpiece. ""Let the Awe and Mystery of a Journey unlike Any Other Begin.""",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1104,HHoffman-2,"A film lacking in stimulation, but nevertheless groundbreaking for SF and cinema in general.",6,10 January 2007,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a difficult film to review due to the fact that (even now) it's an unconventional piece of cinema.The script, written by Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke, features little to no dialog (all of which is superfluous) and provides virtually no exposition for the audience. And while the companion novel by Arthur C. Clarke provides more depth and stimulation into the story, the film itself suffers from lacking these things on its own.The acting is standard fare, if only because the focus of the story is on the odyssey rather than the characters. Douglas Rain stands out as providing the voice of HAL 9000, a chilling supercomputer supervising the progress of the mission.Where the film gets most of its acclaim is in the visuals, and deservedly so. From the monolith to the starport to the transformation into starchild, the film is stunning. And it is for this reason that masterpieces such as the Star Wars saga and Blade Runner have come to existence. Coincidentally, Douglas Trumbull provided his special effects talent to all three of these films.The biggest complaint given to 2001: A Space Odyssey is its lethargic pace. Again, this is deservedly so. But to Stanley Kubrick's credit, it was his intent to make the audience truly *use* their senses to appreciate the film. Not on a superficial level, but to truly invest one's self in the film's atmosphere.In the end, it's perhaps best to classify 2001 in a league of its own. That is, a film that experiments with the laws of cinema and its relationship to the audience.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

As the ape evolves, he invents a weapon out of bone to kill his prey, and the movie suddenly makes perfect sense: man as creator.The weapon's first use is food, but soon becomes a way to wage war against the opposing tribe of apes. With the weapon, the ape kills the leader of the opposing tribe, creating the multiple allusion to the invention as killer: the monster in Frankenstein or Hal9000 later in the movie. To rejoice in the kill, he tosses the weapon into the air, and the cut jumps directly into the future: the world of 2001 in outer space.Amidst the vastness, we quickly learn the future world. There are harmless creations, like video conferencing, where a man communicates with his family back home. Then we have a computer that talks called Hal9000. Going off the theme of man as creator, we can assume that in the world of 2001 that invention is the future.Mankind as creator makes Hal9000, a super computer with the ability to read lips. To make the invention more personable, we call the supercomputer Hal for short. He even has a personality. He is our friend that we can talk to.I can just imagine the thrill one would get viewing this on its release date in theaters. Kubrick creates the world, throws (literally) us into the future, surrounds us with technology we can marvel at. We delight in the fresh aesthetics, and soon grow comfortable with them. We are encapsulated in the world created by the film, and therefore give it our absolute trust. In return, we receive comfort and can take a deep breath.When the Frankenstein-like twist is fully realized paranoia sets in-as if Kubrick knew that his entire audience in the 60s would be high on drugs. He starts at our most animal being, shapes the world, makes us comfortable, and in enters the invention (the bone, the monster, or Hal) to wreak havoc. Hal is not our friend. He betrays us, and it is normal to feel anger, even hate, towards Hal.As the credits roll, I think of the genius of Kubrick, to know exactly what the audience wants, even if they do not know what they want themselves, where he can take them on the trip they have been unconsciously craving. Imagining back again, I envision the smokers in the audience leaving the theater with paranoid thinking, questioning technology, while the heavier street drug users would be getting excited over scenes that make them geek out. It does not take a hippie to know that trips are not always daisies. Only Kubrick can create such an engrossing direction for this masterpiece, in such a way that the themes in the world of 2001 are universal: invention is the future (or shapes the future), and from the start of the movie, we know that mankind is continually evolving. The multiple allusion of the bone weapon, the monster from Frankenstein, and Hal, teaches a valuable lesson in that one must be careful that what one creates will not destroy.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This movie, no, this magical, intoxicating, question- raising, masterful, majestic, infinite, biblical, intense, epic and simply perfect movie is without a doubt a bright, shining jewel in cinema's finest crown. Words fail me as I try to describe it. Just watch it, and you'll feel as if you understand the true meaning of a movie and all the great philosophical questions we have.

1108,TheDarkKnight12,2001 Space Odyseey: Hit or Miss?,5,28 March 2006,"This film was 'interesting' to watch merely because of the hype i purchased it at a reduced price recently. I put it on, sat back and watched. There were several things that impressed me; firstly, the menacing character HAL whom we believe is programmed to have no emotion. HALs reasoning was completely justified, the two characters were going to disconnect him and this it's as though HAL feels betrayed, and switches to survival mode, just like an instinctive human response. Secondly, the Star Child, having the main character placed in a lab etc etc, very peculiar but intriguing nonetheless. Thirdly, the use of silence to create a feeling of isolation and to recreate the vastness and loneliness of space. Having been impressed by these factors, I was left completely unimpressed by other pointers which I think ruin the film. The 'breathing' of the astronaut, nice idea but absolutely, gut-wrenchingly annoying. The huge portions of the film which show us 'space' for about fifteen minutes which seem completely and utterly, mind-numbingly boring. I know that technology has improved and if it was 1968 i'd appreciate it more. Modern technological films like the Terminator still took everyone's breath away but didn't carry on and on and on with stupid 'choir' moaning in the background. These bits of the film weren't even nearly as intimidating as the music. It almost feels like the 'choir' are sick and tired of taking shot after shot of seeing this dreary 'exploration', well let's face it at least their moans are genuine. I think I nearly competed with them when I was watching. We can all see what Kubrick was trying to achieve and fair enough, the idea is there and as usual he's organised it in 'chapters', the end is truly scary and misleading enough, or open-ended enough (as Kubrick intended) for people to discuss it on boards like these and claim it's the best film ever. People who think this film is art, are right,it was at the time and still is. But we all have to take this with a pinch of salt, and instead of gaping mouths wide open at these 15 minute bursts of opera and 'exploration' we merely sit and appreciate it for three minutes before going 'this is actually ridiculous'. I don't want to be cynical, it's not fair or realistic to judge the films effects by todays standards, but we can judge the ideas, the script and direction. The ideas, provided by a very interesting and descriptive novel, the script which correlates with the bland presentation of this film, and the characters (HAL is genuinely horrifying) are all superb. I just can't figure out whether or not I like this film. I like certain elements but other bits are truly pathetically long-winded and uninteresting.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1109,fukoffdickface,Drivel,1,7 May 2009,"This is certainly one of the most boring and meaningless films I have ever seen in my life. I love science and science fiction both. They are in fact 2 of my main interests in life. This movie still bored me beyond description! The accolades being heaped upon this hunk of garbage is hilarious. The most amusing tendency among the fans of this movie is ridiculing those who think it is boring and meaningless as stupid, ignorant or both. I am a professional in the computer design and engineering business. I am not stupid. And guess what? This movie is still boring and meaningless. It does have some of the best special effects of its era. In fact, most of the effects in this film would stand next to todays advanced digital special effects without being embarrassed. This is the one and only redeeming quality of this film. It's a collection of very long, very boring scenes that never seem to end. People have mentioned some of the most boring parts. The problem in listing them all is that it would be much easier to list the parts which are NOT boring babble. This movie is a complete waste of.....what seemed like 20 hours of my life. I highly recommend that you never waste time on such trash. For those who will attempt to dismiss my comment along with the other people they have dismissed let me be perfectly clear. I understood everything in the film. It is simply a terrible film. This pseudo-intellectual drivel is a director who thinks he's quite brilliant in his high school level presentation and vision of the journey of man. Of course he is very wrong indeed! If you enjoy this then I suggest you browse youtube for videos made by either inarticulate adults, or videos posted by immature children expressing their simplistic ideas of the world and mankind. The director is incompetent. What takes him 15 minutes of very boring film, a segment he labels ""the dawn of mankind"", near the beginning of the film is a segment that a skilled filmmaker would be able to accomplish in about 2 minutes at most. In fact that sums up what this movie really is. Very simplistic ideas drawn out, and I do mean DRAWN OUT SEEMINGLY FOREVER, in an effort to convince the audience that the filmmakers were very smart people. Hold a copy of the movie in your hand and you will see the condescension dripping from it. It's disjointed. It lacks cohesiveness. It adds elements of science fiction, horror, fantasy, and pre-teen created entertainment. It also fails to deliver in any of these categories. Stop attacking those who do not like this film. They aren't nearly as stupid as is implied here. This movie really does suck this bad. It's almost entirely comprised of shots and contrived scenes which are intended to showcase the effects. Nice effects. Utterly worthless film. Obtain and enjoy some of the many great documentary films about the space program if you want to see great scenery of space. To complete this huge hunk of celluloid garbage, the filmmakers end it with scenes that are not only long but can only be compared to patients in an insane asylum babbling incoherently. No we're not stupid. This movie just sucks. Beauty? Hardly. Deep? If you have a 5th grade education perhaps. Worth watching? Absolutely not! There is nothing brilliant about meaningless film that must be ""interpreted"" by the few viewers who claim they have the answer. Thats just incompetent lazy film making.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1110,lxmerrifield,Excellent Besides The Music,7,19 August 2013,So the reason why I am giving this a 7 out of 10 even though it's an excellent movie is for no other reason than the music. There was that choir in there singing and wailing what it sounded to me like was a choir of the damned those bound to hell wailing at their misfortune and it made me think of death and decay and a bugs swarming around a dead animal and it got way to loud and annoying i really hated that part especially because this was such an excellent movie but that wailing choir of the damned was a poor choice for music I honestly believe that choir is best made for a movie about Satan rather then an excellent movie like this one whenever I heard that choir the only think i could think of that was going to happen was there was going to be a bloody murder with an axe or an alien that looked like a demon that ate humans in a really gruesome way so to me it was a poor choice of music with that choir and nothing else the rest was absolutely excellent if you can ignore the wailing of the damned.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
1111,wica93,Not valuable if you were born later than the 80s,4,16 September 2017,"This movie was a huge disappointment for me, after how much everyone has been praising it, and after seeing its IMDb score. Now I understand that all this praise is only because the movie is SUPER old. I absolutely understand that seeing these special effects, visuals in 1968 and that and the following decade must have been completely overwhelming. I also understand that many movies, even Star Trek and Star Wars took inspiration from the shapes and solutions of this movie - the movie to the genre of sci-fi is like Iron Maiden to heavy metal.Apart from this, I didn't only grow EXTREMELY bored while watching, actually at times I wanted to shout and I was punching the air because I was so nervous. Not nervous because not knowing what is going to happen and because the movie was interesting, no, not at all. There were several scenes, were NOTHING happened for 5-10 or even 15 minutes. I loved the beginning with the apes, but those extra long spaceship scenes made me go crazy. I was sitting and sitting and doing nothing and watching nothing. What was once a great technical achievement (like filming those rotating things) means nothing to me. Maybe (for sure) I am too young, and a 'spoilt' 90s 'kid', but I didn't find my enjoyment in this movie.I spent all 160 minutes waiting for something to happen. I had no idea what was happening or where the story was leading, but keeping the high ratings in mind, I was expecting a huge plot twist at the end of the story, that would make me go 'oh my god', I was expecting a kind of mindfvck, like at Interstellar. Sure, a plot twist happened, and it was definitely unexpected, but didn't help me case, only made it worse. That room. What is that room? There, also everything was happening so damn slowly, and no dialogues... Sure, I read the explanations of what it is, but none of that was clear from the movie.I really liked the creepiness of HAL though, and its/his? showing emotions towards the end.This movie wasted my 2.5 hours, sorry! I guess I was born too late?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1112,Engage_With_Zorp,"Visually Stunning, Severely Disappointing Otherwise",10,29 November 2008,"Aren't movies amazing? Every movie has a fair share of love and hate directed towards it; no film can be said to be universally lauded or loathed, not even the truly awful ones - someone is bound to enjoy them in some capacity.There is a reason for this amazing occurrence: no movie is perfect. Not a single one. Not the true ""greats"" like The Godfather or Citizen Kane, and certainly not From Justin to Kelly. Every movie has its flaws - whether minor flubs or serious dramatic or visual problems. No film is exempt from this rule, and as such, a single film can appeal to a variety of different people for different reasons and in different ways.As an audience, it is our job to look over the flaws and enjoy the film for what it is: an imperfect, yet still amazing, confluence of ideas and emotions. Obviously, this is not possible for every film, and doubtless after the fact we will find myriad ways in which a film can improve. This is the nature of film-going, and of movie making.2001: A Space Odyssey is no exception to this rule, despite what its many ardent fans would have you believe. The biggest thing this movie has going for it are its astonishing visuals: they are truly revolutionary, and hole up remarkably well today. They also seem oddly appropriate, as if ""updating"" them, as George Lucas has done, would somehow detract from the film, rather than add to it.I won't deny, therefore, that this film is a stunning visual experience, and wildly influential. But that is all that it is.For all its visual innovation, it is also an incredibly pretentious film. I believe I read one post on these boards that defined pretentious as aspiring to something and not achieving it (the poster then went on to explain that, for this reason, 2001 isn't pretentious; I disagree, but I'll get to that eventually). I would accept that definition, but would add that the journey getting there is just as important.What 2001 is aspiring to is a story (although I do not believe you could describe it as such) told through the visual, with numerous metaphorical segments alluding to the entire history of mankind and its place in the universe, as well as a dissertation on the evolution of thought and of science.2001, then, has great aspirations, but I find the film incredibly flawed for its over length and inability to sufficiently approach these ideas. For starters - the scene at the beginning spends fully fifteen minutes on idea that the audience understands after five; the additional minutes add nothing to the meaning or flow of the film, and in fact detract from the overall enjoyment of anyone intelligent enough to understand it.Kubrick makes the same mistake throughout. Endless scenes of people floating in space emphasize remoteness and the advancement of technology, and of course how far humanity has come - but to what end? No end, apparently. I hate to be condescending, but certainly no one can enjoy the acid trip at the end of the film that lasts for at least five minutes and expresses nothing other than infinity? Did it need to go on so long? No, of course not. I understood what it was trying to say, I accepted the swirling lights as perhaps the best representation of an abstract idea, I appreciated the care and beauty that went into creating it, I took it in for a long stretch of time to fully experience the message ... and then it kept going.The film is so densely layered with such abstract metaphors as to be rendered meaningless; I have seen some defend the idea that it is not, but truly so many possible explanations can be achieved, almost none of them satisfactory, that it is rendered meaningless. The ending of the film doesn't mean anything precisely because it means everything; there comes a point where restrained is needed, and Kubrick has no concept of this. As a result, the entire film is rendered moot.All of this combined make for unpleasant business, but could have been redeemed if the characters were at least mildly interesting. You could substitute a cardboard cutout with a smiley face in for any of the actors and would achieve virtually the same film - and with no emotional connection to the characters, or the environment, which is rendered cold and unapproachable by the very exactitude by which it is created, how can you expect the audience to be invested at all in the dramatic conflict of the movie? And surely, for a film about the nature and history of mankind, such relentlessly uninvolving characters is counter to your purpose? Truly, there is very little to admire here other than the arresting visuals.Or is there? Here we see once again the subjectivity of film. What I regard of flaw, others regard as masterstroke; why is there a disparity? Everyone, I suppose, experiences a film differently.What I find emotionally uninvolving, cold, and relentlessly pretentious, others find as riveting, meaningful film making. Who is right? Who is wrong? There is of course no answer to that question. As long as a good argument is made, everyone's opinion is equal in the arena of movies. I believe I have presented one such argument here, and have read many, many expressing an opinion opposite to mine that are just as valid.One thing, I think, is true: this movie is not perfect. There are flaws; its adherents may have to look hard to find them, but however minute, they are there. But then, they are there for every movie. And in the end, because no movie is perfect, we can only understand it as best we can based on how it spoke to us as individuals.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1113,dssadhyapak,"The most awful, dragging, overrated and boring movie I've seen ever",9,13 November 2014,"Now that Interstellar had released a few days ago, i came to see the IMDb reviews and on YouTube. Everyone seemed to be comparing that to this movie. Some people were like ""Its the next 2001: A Space Odyssey"", and some others were like "" You cant compare Interstellar to 2001"" and all. People were also comparing this to Gravity. So i decided to download and watch this piece of crap, blindly believing the 8.3 it got.I now realize i made a big, big mistake. Oh my God! This movie is terrible to the inner most core you can imagine! Let me brief it out to you :First 2 minutes of nothing but a blank screen. Thank God i fast forwarded that. Wonder how people back in the 1968's watched that in the theatre. Then 20 minutes of apes. Some bit of narration could have been better for that scene right? All you see is apes shouting, eating, then some monolith randomly appears, they look at it, some super irritating noise in the background, then apes fight and then it just cuts away to another 10 minutes of establishing shots of space shuttles. Oh goodness. Couldn't they just move on? I've watched many movies that have had slow starts. But this one was toooooooo slow. If you see the entire movie, at least 50 minutes of it was shots in the space. I get it. Its all ""art"" and stuff. But seriously? Those shots were so dragged on and boring, and the same music was being played again and again. How irritating can it get?The only interesting part was with that HAL 9000 computer. That super genius, villainous, smart computer which knows everything you do on that space shuttle. And it just kills everyone. And it dies. Pfft! Over.This movie also lacks dialogue. Its almost like watching a silent movie. Let me tell you something. There's nothing to explain you the ending that will not make any sense. I was so bored i opened the Subtitles Explorer to see when the next dialogue will come. Guess what? From 1 hr 57 minutes till the ending (2 hrs 28 minutes), you get nothing. Nothing that will tell you what the heck is going on!Look, i can understand things without the dialogue. But The ending of this movie is so confusing that you would at least need some thing to explain whats happening. Suddenly, that monolith will be floating in space, then Dave (some scientist in the movie) flies into beyond infinite (i guess), which is shown by a long draggy 7 minute light show (Arrgghhh!) and then he lands up somewhere old. And then the monolith appears again, and he becomes some Cosmo baby, and is probably going back to Earth. What would you even understand from this?? I heard its based on some book. The book probably explains everything. But for people like me who don't read books and have just watched the movie, they must tell something right?I would have liked this movie, if they had cut out that useless ape scene, and reduce the establishing shots of space from 50 minutes to probably 15, and the movie simply started with that scene where some scientists talk about some problem up in Cervius (sorry if i got the name wrong), showed more or at least told more about what that monolith could do, then the HAL 9000, and explained the goddamn ending. But.... No.Overall, this is a movie that is so boring and draggy, that even if you 4X those space shots, nothing will happen. I don't know why this movie got 8.3 and all! Doesn't even deserve a 1. Completely overrated.Even though Gravity was slow, it instilled that fear in you that how it is when you are in space. I haven't watched Interstellar yet, but I'm sure it will be better than this piece of goat poop!!UPDATE : I watched Interstellar, and its amazing. If this movie at least had some dialogue, then it could've been better",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1114,Lord_Borrington,Good but overrated.,6,24 September 2014,"Having read the book I understand what the end is about. However if you only saw the movie and didn't read the book I'd have to say it would be very difficult to understand the ending which really makes very little sense in the movie. Good special effects for 1968 and many memorable lines like ""Open the pod bay doors Hal."" ""I'm sorry Dave I can't do that."" Some find the movie slow and tedious even boring and it can be in parts but my main gripe is the silly ending which if you only see the movie I don't know how you're supposed to understand it if you haven't read the book where it is actually explained what is going on. I think a lot of people who rave about the movie yet haven't read the book don't know what the end means at all.

No wonder people thought he faked the moon landing for the CIA! And boring, OK it can be slow sometimes, but you have to remember again how awesome and ground-breaking this technology and this kind of sci-fi storytelling were at the time. Nobody had seen anything like this before and in some instances we haven't seen it since. He didn't have CGI and almost everything was practical effects and large, very intricate and incredibly realistic sets and props.It can be confusing but that is the nature of this story and its philosophical point ('what will happen in the future?'), and it also happens to be one of the things Kubrick did best.

I mean seriously, if you can understand this stupid movie, you deserve an award. It makes absolutely no sense what so ever. And to believe, that this ridiculously, over long boring celebration of classic music, and colorful scenery, is actually considered to be, a science fiction classic masterpiece. Are you serious? This is definitely not at all a masterpiece. This is arrogance at its full potential. It appears that the fans of this trash, just goes along with the flow of popularity, or they're just too afraid of criticizing a great Director like Stanley Kubrick. I'm a huge fan of Kubrick's work, but I'm sorry, this is without a doubt, his worst movie ever. I believe while Kubrick was doing this film, he must of thought, he was greatest thing on the face of the earth, that he could do anything, and people would think it's great no matter what. That's arrogance people, many Directors go through this at some period of their career, that maybe is the problem with putting some of these people on a pedestal, it sometimes goes their head. 2001 is simply a crazy over the top, annoying waste of time, that is confusing, and yes, undeniably boring. Everyone's always talking about how spectacular the visual effects are, give me a break. The only thing that is groundbreaking about this film, is that people actually sat through it, without committing suicide. And enough with H.A.L. 9000, the most annoying voice of all time. I'm also sick of people saying that this has strong performances. From who? Everyone's talking so low, you can't even hear them. From beginning to end, this so called classic, becomes so utterly frustrating, you'll want to break the movie in half. The stupid fake looking monkeys, the long, and I mean long, shots of ships docking or moving, the music that makes you want to go to sleep, and the endless ending that goes on forever, that basically leads to even more confusion, all of this put together, makes for a very awful, dull adventure of utter stupidity. And what was the whole space baby thing thing about? What's the point? People will just tell you, that it's all about beauty, what in the world does that mean? For the love of God, where's the story? Can I simply have a story to deal with, to follow, is that asking too much?

1118,nome-nessuno,Beyond The Infinite,10,10 January 2015,"2001: A Space Odyssey deals with the elements of human evolution, technology, artificial intelligence & extra-terrestrial life. It is divided into 3 segments & an epilogue, each connected with an extra-terrestrial reference. Kubrick's first venture into the science fiction genre features all his usual trademarks but its treatment is very different from his other works. The pace is intentionally slowed down, the narration is through visuals & music, the exchange of dialogues is minimal and the engaging & confusing plot only gets better, more transparent & satisfying on multiple viewings. 2001 is a visually stunning experience to behold on the big screen. It asks a lot of its audience and caught in the right frame of mind a cinematic experience of the first order. I had read Clarke's short story The Sentinel shortly before, and I therefore had a pretty good idea of what the story was. Standing back and looking at the movie and imagining myself in the position of someone coming to it cold, it must have been a nightmare. I guess it would be possible to figure out the link between the monoliths, although possibly not until encountering the one on the moon - fabulous though the jump-cut from bone to orbiting satellite may be, I'm not sure it actually explains anything.

And I hate this movie with every bone in my body.We start this ""movie"" with 15 minutes of watching monkeys dance and interact with a giant rectangular prism that looks like the sample model in a 3D modeling program. What purpose does this serve? ABSOLUTELY NONE! It may be meant to show that this object affected human evolution, or may be meant to show ""human nature"". But really, who gives a crap. It does absolutely nothing for the narrative. Speaking of the narrative, there is absolutely none. This movie is literally nothing but Stanley Kubrick jerking off to the set he created and the shots he framed. They may have looked great in the 60s, but they don't look particularly impressive now. It's not that it looks bad, but the movie takes these gigantic pauses, and lingers on shots for a really long time, because you're supposed to be admiring how good the visuals look. It bored me to tears. This movie also has no memorable characters whatsoever. The only name I remember from this film is that of HAL, and that is because this AI has more personality than any of the humans in the film.NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS MOVIE!!! These astronauts mope around their ship for a while, HAL goes rogue and kills a few people, and the main character drifts off into space. That's it. I have literally summed up the entirety of this film. The movie ends with this confusing, ugly, pointless scene in which the main character drifts off into space for what seems like an eternity. We spend what feels like 20 minutes watching him drift through space while space gets really colorful. It's stupid and pointless.He then is in an alien room, for some reason. Then he gets old. Then a baby floats across the screen. What does this mean? WHO CARES?!?!? The movie is finally over! YAY!Never, EVER watch this movie.

1120,travised87,"A blur, but what an incredible experience!",9,7 February 2007,"The subject matter about aliens watching over us and the monolith being the threshold leading to each progressive stage of human evolution is something i am rather skeptical about. In fact, the entire theory did not occur to me as i was watching the film. What did was the intensely surreal and psychedelic nature of the story that transpired before me. Perhaps it was the novelty of it, the sheer audacity to make such a film, composed almost entirely of slow-moving camera footage of space and the vagaries of our universe, which no real story or conventional plot, and with cinematography that still gives me goosebumps. It seemed almost like a nightmare at times, with the space which unlike everything else, has no beginning or end. Its we humans, our imaginations, our need to theorise, to elucidate our external reality that confines us to mortality. Yes I do admit that at one point, i started to fall asleep, but once HAL was introduced, my interest in the film rekindled. Its certainly not something i am regularly exposed to and i enjoyed the novelty of this, though i cant say that i have understood the film's content well enough.Of what i have fathomed, the film does present some intriguing questions: how has man evolved? Whats our next stage of evolution? Do machines have emotions? And if they do, does that mean they are capable of human sensations such as jealousy, apprehension and viciousness? Will they eventually rule us one day? The creation of HAL was wonderfully done. What is really ironic is that he, or it, shows more human emotions than any of the humans it interacts with on the space shuttle, suggesting that the dawn of a new era is perhaps not far away.Whatever the issue, enjoy this film for the taste it leaves behind after you watch it, of something surreal and inexplicable.

1123,Movie_Buff_Brad,The most overrated movie I've ever seen,6,2 October 2007,"After hearing so much praise over it from the entire planet, I firmly believe it IS the most overrated movie of all time. Everyone spreads around that it is ""the best science fiction film ever made"" and it's the best of Kubrick. Everyone. I feel like I'm missing something here. How is this better than A Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove? As of now I've seen 7 Kubrick movies, the other 6 were better. I watched it once with huge expectations, and I was extremely disappointed with it. Since people were still saying the movie was amazing, I decided to give it a second chance. So I watched it again with low expectations, and I still didn't think it was anything more than decent. In fact, my rating went down. I gave it TWO chances and still wasn't impressed.My problem with the movie is that it is one of the slowest movies I've ever seen. It basically goes like this: long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, a bit of dialogue, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background, some more dialogue, long shot with classical music in background, long shot with classical music in background...For the first hour of the movie I was content with this, the next five I was starting to lose patience. It's so slow like this that by the time we got passed the monkey montage I started to lose interest in everything. Too little dialogue, too little interesting characters, too many long shots. It just isn't my thing.But this doesn't mean the movie is horrible. I gave it a 6 for a reason (albeit barely a 6). The cinematography is amazing, the shots are nice, extremely impressive visual effects - highly earned Oscar for Kubrick, and a creepy atmosphere. Pretty much anything technical this film gets an A+ with. And HAL is an interesting villain.For me, this is one of those movies that everyone loves, and as much as you want to, you just can't. Maybe I should give it another chance... third time's a charm. But how many times do I need to watch something in order to like it?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1124,evanlivi,good for film students but bad for almost every one else.,3,23 November 2016,"I understand that their is supposedly a lot of brilliance to this movie, but most of it is about as exiting as watching paint dry. I will admit that their are some parts of that are very good, but by the time I got to them I was so bored out of my mind by hours absolutely nothing. It has little to no characters or continuity of any kind so it is very hard to get invested in it. in the end the movie fails the most basic principle of movies actually being entertaining or leaving any sort of positive impact. Even without the tiny pieces of actually riveting scenes their are tones of books, movies, single episodes of a show and even video games witch address their unfocused points much better well actually containing plot and thing that might make you even some what invested. I get their is something to this movie I just don't get, but a boring movie is a boring movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1125,Vonp1r3,"Ahead of it's time, visually superb... but has it's flaws!",7,13 March 2021,"First of all I'd like to say that I only managed to completely see this film today. Haven't read the book or anything. Having read all the reviews I agree with almost all good or bad, as almost all of them has some truth in what's being said.First of all the movie is way ahead of it's time and have some magnificient shots and the pallete of colors, specially the warm red's and vibrant blues , really loved them. I also loved the psychdelic travel through space and time near the end, in fact it's my favorite part of the movie, simply because it's stunning pallete of colors. Thinking it was made in 68 is really brilliant.Now let's go right trhough the ""meaning"" of the movie, well , at least what I think of it.In fact I see the black monoliths as just some markers in mankind evolution. Being the first the evolution from primates to sapiens , the second as the evolution of men as a race that achieved the space exploration and the third and final as the meeting with the ""creators"" (which is clearly implied as being an superior alien race that left us all the beacons for us to achieve it) in which we are reborn as superior beings that achieved travel through space and time. Of course all is very metaforical and explained in a very surrealistic way so it's open to any interpretations, but this how I see it.Now let's break the movie into parts and look at the flaws of each one :Prologue - Completely not necessary the first 2 minutes of blackness. Then we are presented with the score everyone knows this film for. The alignment of planet, moon and sun is also fine.Part I - The Dawn of MenSome breathtaking beautifull shots , drags for too long. Nice effect for the apes, considering the year it's been made. Implies the cruelty latent in nature and men.Part II - Drags wayyy too long. The spacecrafts are well done , scenarios are good, but not necessary so long shots. Also begin the problems i see in this movie. The classical score , for me don't fit so well in this, despite what others say. In fact it's a bit annoying, and I like classical music! Also, what's with that ""hat"" the girls have in the spaceship ? It was for them to not knock with their heads like a helmet? Don't get it nor like it. Then the ""futuristic"" gadgets, well it's ok but too little. Cmon, not a single robot? Then comes the dialog , and I really think it's very poor written and bad executed. In fact the cast for this movie is weak and the actors are just forgettable. The meeting is bland and don't add nothing to the plot besides the typical ""governamental cover of something extraordinary"". Also the futuristic food is a bit forced.Part III - The voyage to JupiterNow this is where the movie drags the most and I found most faults. While the lack of sound in space is nice the little buzzers and the score are annoying. Really annoying in fact. Then we get the super AI HAL , our villain. Like many said here, it's well portrayed but nothing is ever explained to why or how it goes ""bananas"". And the way that guy is thrown into space, perhaps the worse effect on this movie. Then it isn't clear why HAL kills the hibernating ""scientists"" or why. Probably some kind of allegory to ""AI can be bad and threatning to mankind"" . All in all I think it's really a side story that only serves to drag movie a lot more. It could have been developed much more as it had potential for a good story but it feel just rushed and out of ideas. Also how the hell a supercomputer that command everything on the most advanced spaceship ever to exist is defeated so easily. Didn't convince me at all.Part IV - Jupiter and BeyondKnow it comes the most thrilling and beautifull shots and effects. I really love the ""space and time travel sequence"" and for me it wasn't too long. In fact the pallete used is brilliant specially when flying through the seas of warm red's and vibrant blues. Really a work of art and the best part of this movie visually, for me. Then the surreal final that I explained in my pov in the beggining of the review.All in all 2001 is and will ever be a landmark in cinema and is one of those movies of extremes, being those overratedly high or unjustified lows. So for me the rating I give is the correct for the brilliance of art and vision but also for the overexcessive drag and annoying score / soud fx's.But hey, it's just one more review on the many around. Hope it has meaning to someone out there...",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1126,dolohov-83767,The problem with reception,3,2 April 2020,"Truely great things remain great throughout the eras. That is the very definition of greatness. And, in some form, this is true for space odyssey. The cinematographic effects were years ahead of their time and it was the first somewhat realistic uptake on what space travel would actually be like. But if that is all it can be called great for it doesn't make a great movie. And it certainly can't be called entertaining, at least by today's standarts.For all the claims of how game-changing and high spirited and dreaming of the impossible there were, all of those claims are removed from one simple truth: these things are not all you need to make a movie and they certainly are not what qualifies a movie as great.I've seen this happening on this platform many times and many times elsewere: claims to greatness because even if the movie is not entertaining or graced with good acting it can still be a glorious piece of cinema because of art, depht, sophistication or style. I'm sorry but that is not how movies work. They have to be entertaining, it's their whole reason to exist. And while I'm fully aware of arthouse and advangarde cinema this movie does not qualify. It was an big production, huge budget (1968, at least), large showroom cinema event. When it was first published.Today it is an 140 minute tedium, without plot, dialogue or any sufficient acting.It is the film equivalent of a kid showing of to it's parents it's ability to ride a bike without using it's hands. ""Look what I can do!""Well, riding a bike that way is impressive, but you won't win a race with it. You need to have a whole skillset for doing so. This movie does not. And no effects, no realistic aproach and not even a director as prolific as Kubrick can mask that crucial fact.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1127,nickykelly-65134,2001: A Space Odyssey,10,14 September 2017,"This is my favourite film of all time, and in my opinion the best film of all time for two main reasons. 2001, for me, has the some of the best film making ever, and this film also has a point that is and will always be important and relevant. Where 'The Godfather' may tell you the importance of family, 2001 raises questions about evolution, mankind, artificial intelligence, the universe and the unknown.Before I go on to give my thoughts on the film's meanings I'll list off all of the film's great technical aspects (which could be given a review of their own). The direction, cinematography, art & set production, special effects, sound effects, lighting, production value and music is absolutely outstanding, and some of the very best in cinema history.I'll split this review up into 3 sections, much like the film, and start with the Dawn of Man sequence.I think that going back in time, is ironically a perfect opening for a film based on the future. Kubrick displays how humankind began, by showing primates first discovering how to use tools (bones) in order to kill, before a clean edit which skips over hundreds of thousands of years of evolution and shows a spacecraft. This simple edit exemplifies how far humankind has come, from using bones to kill prey, to building spacecraft which orbit our Earth. It should go without saying, but this opening sequence is beautifully directed and shot, the only real nitpick is to say that at times the chimps may look dated, but for a film that came out in 1968, I'd say it holds up brilliantly.The middle section of the film could stand as a film on its own, the Discovery spacecraft is on a mission to Jupiter. This is when we are introduced to HAL 9000, who has went on to become one of the most infamous film villains ever. This section of the film mainly concerns artificial intelligence, and just how accurate it can be, and if this dangerous. The film also concerns whether or not artificial intelligence can actually have real emotion, or just emulate it, I personally believe in the latter.And then we get to the final section of the film, where thing go incredibly ambiguous, the stargate sequence is still mesmerizing even to this day. Dave Boeman, the astronaut on the Discovery, and the film's main character is transported to some kind of space hotel, or maybe this is all in his head? Or maybe he's in a higher state of being? Or maybe he's dead? Anyway, in this place, he sees himself grow old (literally) and meets with the mysterious monolith in which he transforms into the starchild, and the film ends. There have been of course, many, many interpretations of the film, people who may like science see this film as displaying how alone we are in the universe, the starchild represents mankind in it's infancy. To others, this film is a religious experience, neither is wrong, Stanley Kubrick and Athur C. Clark intended for this ambiguous end and for people to discuss it, which they definitely achieved.In my opinion, the ending is both a representation of evolution, the starchild being the next step in evolution, the next goal for mankind (meeting extra-terrestrial beings for this first time, or exploring other planets and galaxies). But also the film's final few seconds for me represent how even though we have space travel, and have satellites in space and have gone to the moon, we as a species have only seen an incomprehensibly small portion of the universe.So all in all, I love this film, its a masterpiece.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1128,daveedrenaud,The grand-daddy of epic art,10,4 November 2017,"How often do you get to see a work of art gifted a budget on this scale? It's hardly ever happened in history and this is what happens when it does happen, 2001 A Space Odyssey. It's a film that changed cinema in many ways, a film that inspired many film artists and continues to influence many directors presently. Whenever a director wants to compare himself as one of the best, he almost always references 2001 and that tells you why 2001 is one of the most important films... and possibly the most important in American history.There's so much that's different about 2001, particularly the structure of the film which was revealed in the Stanley Kubrick documentary as mode-jerking, instead of a 3 act structure. This simply says that the film is episodic, instead of having a beginning, middle and end. It's a film that takes you back to a prehistoric act that probably references the first act of violence, represented as man's invention of a tool, that's used for killing and to feed ourselves. I say ''man'' because that's probably how Kubrick is representing evolution... but it isn't necessarily so. We then take a giant leap for mankind into the space age.First we're in a mission to the moon, then a mission to jupiter. Both these missions are about government secrecy and mysteries that hold the key to civilization. I'm not going to get into the story, but what I love about this movie is the main usage of classical music with the way its placed with the footage in space. Kubrick has mostly succeeded in creating a true 3 dimensional space without cheap 3D effects or CGI, yet the special effects was a quantum leap for cinema. One of the highlights for me was the character HAL 9000, the computer who exhibited higher emotion than the humans, a common argument in films about man becoming more like machines. Then there's the finale, without dialogue for long stretches of time, 2001 is an experience that needs to be felt and doesn't need straight answers.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1131,aledownload,Philosophy and science-fiction,9,27 November 2019,"This film, perhaps even more tha n the nobel it has been written concurrently with, is both a fantastic work of fiction, and a great work of thought. It explores the deepest instincts of Humanity: violence, insanity, xebophobia, but also the will of discovery and curiosity.
Since our first encounter with the apeman Moonwatcher (for which, especially after reading Clarke's novel, I do feel a great sense of sympathy), we understand that this is young to be the story of the fast, immediate development of Mankind, from the first meat meal to the conquest of outer space.

1132,elanor-3,treatise about humanness and evolution visualised by a master director,9,16 October 2014,"This film is for me the most perfect film I have seen and it is my second most favourite. Nevertheless, it is not a film I watched as many times as other easier films.I don't watch the film as a science fiction action film. I watch 2001: A Space Odyssey as a philosophical, spiritual, enigmatic, and mystic treatise about humanness and evolution visualised by a master director.For me the scenes with the apes are especially fascinating. And the bone-shattering scene ""dawning of man"" is for me the most iconic scene I have ever seen in film. The transition from bone to space-station is nearly as iconic. Both visualise human evolution, from vegetarian ape to tool-using meat-hunting human, from stone-age to space-faring modernity. It symbolises the rising abilities of mankind. And the final scenes even reach further than the current state of man-kind.Moreover, in this film the selection of music for each scene is just perfect for me. I love the chorus music for the black ""stone"". The choice of the opening fanfare of ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" by Strauss is goosebumps-rising perfect for me. Or the waltz ""The Blue Danube"" for the rotating space station and the space voyage.Yes, there are some parts which need patience, but those just symbolise the slow life of earlier times and the vast land our few ancestors roamed.

1135,jmiller2032,Subtle is the operative word here,10,13 July 2001,"I am 23 years old. I have never seen 2001: a space odyssey in the theater. I was not there in the 1960's to experience that time and place. Nevertheless, this film stands out to me as the greatest film ever made.
After I first saw it, I did not get it. So like every other supposedly `great' films I didn't understand after the first time (Andrei Rublev and Vertigo also come to mind), I RESERVED JUDGEMENT because I knew that people who were more intelligent than myself had found real meaning in it. I did not dismiss it as so many others who have chimed in with their pedestrian comments here. After the second time, it made a whole lot more sense. Over time, it has become my favorite.I will not attempt to explain what is going on with the monoliths and the embryo in outer space and whatnot. I have a very definite idea about what they mean, but I sorely regret having gone to the Internet to read about the meaning of this film rather than discovering it for myself. That's the whole fun! It's sitting back in your chair as this film fully engrosses you and as you catch one of the very subtle queues you say to yourself, `Stanley, you magnificent b**tard!' But I will give you one hint: like all other Kubricks, 2001 is about what makes us human. Look at the evolutionary changes in humanity throughout the film and what has precipitated them- that is why Kubrick made it.Even so, after seeing it over and over and loving it more and more, I held the view, as so many have espoused here, that 2001 is too slow. Like every other criticism I have ever had of a Kubrick film, I was wrong. Indeed, the pacing is one of the qualities that makes it great. The complaint that the sequences could be done in less time is true, but that's not how real time moves. This is a film about evolution. It is not fast. Space walks are not completed in 20 seconds. Kubrick intention in these scenes is twofold: one a realistic expression of what it is like to be an astronaut. Two, to present the idea that we are like fish out of water in space; that inorganic life is better suited for the vast expanses of space.It has been said that the dialogue is boring. It's meant to be that way! Kubrick's saying something about the dehumanizing effect of culture and technology. (Geez, I promised I would not discuss the film, but some of the criticism really irks me.) Indeed, Stanley's work is not accessible to most of the public because it is subtle. If mass audiences are to be given any sort of message in a film, it almost needs to be Spielberg style. They need to be hit over the head with it.It is not necessary to see 2001 on the big screen in order to appreciate it. I never have and it is my absolute favorite. I will grant that it should probably be much better, but that should not stop you from watching it. Just make sure to get the widescreen version. (BTW, the new remastered Kubrick Collection DVD is great.)2001 is a wonderful film that stands on its own two legs. It does not need to be explained by the book or any other source. All you need to know about 2001 is right there on the screen in front of you.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1136,The Claw,From one thing to something else completely different.,6,11 April 1999,"It could be said that 2001: A Space Odyssey is really four separate, smaller films connected by a single object: the Monolith.First off; The Dawn of Man.  This must've really p****d-off a lot of people, who were expecting a space movie, but get out-takes from ""One Million Years B.C.""  The scenery, however, is amazing.The second part is really something.  Even if you're not a classical music fan, the flight to the moon, aptly paired with Johann Strauss' 'The Blue Danube' is truly breathtaking.The Jupiter Mission: The highlight of the film.  Mixed with some great suspense is a look into the monotonous world of astronauts.  And, of course, there's HAL 9000: A computer with a creepy monotone voice, a large motherboard, and kills of fellow crew members for kicks on a Saturday night.And now we come to the ending.'Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite' might go down in history books as the worst ending ever.

Yes it is a slow film (especially the mid-part where Floyd travels to the Clavius). Yes the plot is sometimes hidden. But never, never it is a boring movie. The last 20 minutes of the movie is a party of special effects makers, and the ending makes you want to think things over. The slow in-space scenes are breathtakingly well made (and it was made in 60's! Unbelievable!), and realistic!

I couldn't tell, because I was so bored time seemed to stand still.I can't see why Stanley Kubrick can be a genius when he managed to forget an important aspect of any movie: the script. We are forced to suffer through long passages of slow-moving ships or people before someone starts talking. (if we're lucky, it is in total silence. If we're not, we're forced to listen to a bunch of people screaming dissonant notes, supposedly heighten the non-existant tension). I mean, really, how are we supposed to relate to these characters when they don't say or do anything that would make us like them?I'm not even going to comment on the end of the film, which only served to waste a half-hour of my time.Maybe I'm a philistine and don't understand the art, but I know what I don't like, and I don't like 2001.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

At that point I didn't quite get what it was all about, but I also had this feeling I shouldn't really bother to ""get"" it, which is why this movie became most importantly an eye-opener for me.Way too many times people try to ""get"" things when there is nothing to get, as if you try to subtract 3 from 2. Where will that extra 1 appear from? What you see is what this movie gives you. The stage is simple: Man evolves and goes to space.

1149,PROFMCB,Kubrick's Masterpiece!,10,8 May 2019,"What can be said about this groundbreaking film that hasn't already been stated? Yes, it was ""ahead of it's time"" & set the bar high for ALL SCI-FI films that would follow. Yes, it is undoubtedly one of the last great cinematic works of art to use old school techniques in that genre, i.e. actual miniature models & actual celluloid film. Given those milestones alone, every fan of sci-fi MUST SEE THIS FILM.Too many incredible moments to mention & praise - but I cannot resist, so screen this for these mind-altering visions: the staggeringly monumental scene when we see the Monolith on the Moon, the ""ballet"" of spaceships & space travel, HAL's voice & slow descent into paranoia, the ""discovery"" by the hominid, Moonwatcher, that a bone can be used to kill, and many, many more.Kubrick made a generous handful of landmark films, most are in my Watchlist, but this 1968 production is by far his masterpiece.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1150,daan_conrado,Simply an imortal piece of cinematographic art.,10,21 May 2020,"When i first watched this movie, all that i could think was ""how they did this in 1968?"". The movie was realised 9 years before Star Wars, and the space scenes are even more fantastic. The whole scenario of the movie is fantastic, from the beginning to the end. For example, the monkeys scene was shot in front of a white screen, and the background is actually a projection that had to be done by using a glass at a certain angle, so that the image could be directioned to the screen with no shadow from the actors and the scenario on it. A genuine masterpiece that show us that Kubrick really wanted to produce awesome movies.
Puting classic music to play along with the movement of the spaceships is just amazing, as if it was like ballet movements. Also when those songs were composed people didn't even have access to electricity, settling a conexion between this obsolet past with a high-tech future.
The film also introduces us to a man x robot plot, once that Hal, in order to not be turned off and to have the control of the ship, locks the astronauts outside. It's also increadable that, at the edge of the Cold War, Kubrick showed us U.S.A. and USSR working together, showing that we could advance more if we start working together.
The final scene is just the most perfect ending i have ever seen, my jaw was reaching the other side of the planet.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1151,DavideNit80,"This movie is a joke, but at least it ius fun to laugh at it",5,4 December 2020,"First of all keep in mind that this movie is just style over substance. You will find a huge amount of style in it, although you might end up so bored that you might not be able to appreciate it.
There is very little substance, and the movie doesn't even do anything to let you recognize that little substance easily.
First of all you need to know that this movie is based on a book, but it does not tell almost anything about the story of that book. This movie just want to show you a few small parts of it, parts that are related to an event that is explained in the book but not in the movie.
The ""perfect"" artifcial intelligence goes mad and tries to kill the scientists it is supposed to work with and in its very lenghty runtime this movie never even try to explain you why.
Since this is basically the only plot that this movie has and there is a very specific reason why this happens this is a really controversial and weird choice in my opinion.
But honestly my problem with this movie is just how useless, pathetic and uninteresting it is.
I have seen it once and I thought ""WTF is this thing???"", but at least I was amused by its weirdness, and I watched it another time, and the second time I felt like I got what it was all about.
You can split this movie in two half. In the first half a computer becomes dangerous so a man destroy it to save himself. Nothing weird happens.
In the second half of the movie a man obviously dies (he gets strayed in outer space) and since that happens you start to see every kind of weird and otherworldly kind of stuff you can imagine. The movie becomes very abstract, very ""hallucinated"" and crazy. So the message is clear in my opinion: computers don't have a soul and just gets broken, humans have a soul and when they die there is an afterlife for them. Ok, I don't think that I needed to waste two hours of my life to know that the authors of this movies felt that things work that way, but at least it is fun to laugh at it.
It is particularly interesting and entertaining to show this movie to people who have never seen it. It is truly a remarkable experience. It is slow, it is boring, itis pretentious, but after all you can find ways to have fun watching it. Lol. I don't think that it is a satisfying movie, not at all, but if you really want to try it I'm sure it can be interesting. In the worst case you will just end up feeling so unbearably bored that you will have to just stop it. Everything considered I wuold say that this movie is so bad that it MIGHT be good, at least if you are in the mood.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1152,rtz62,A fantastic enigma,10,30 March 2020,"I'm going to make this quite simple.
I went to the cinema to see this as a birthday treat when I was circa 8 or 9 years of age with my father and a small group of friends.
And before I say any more, the big screen is the only place to watch it if you truly want to capture the experience of vast and silent space.
Kubrick leads us, the viewer, from the vast and empty plains of the Cradle of Humankind via the rise of the apes into man, and from the ability to create primitive weapons to reaching the stars. And beyond....
And the easiest thing to sum up is how a wide-eyed 8yr old left the cinema, looked up to his father and asked ""what was that about dad?""
Ruminating for several moments, my father looked at me, smiled, and replied ""son, I have no idea, and I guess if we watched it a dozen times, we might come up with a different answer every time"".
The true beauty of 2001 is that it has so many possible meanings.

But viewing this a second time I found how brilliant the writing of Stanley Kubiak was in creating such a different and unique Science Fiction movie. This film though I still don't completely understand (such as the third act ). I cannot understand why this film wasn't even nominated for Best Picture in the Oscars. Next, the special effects (consider 1968 here) they are top notch if you know most science, space crafts would fly like considering no oxygen. And the effect of the giant ""hamster"" wheel type shots were great.

1159,infrasomnia,"Daisy, Daisy...",10,28 November 2008,"I watched this movie when I was 7 for the first time. I was fascinated. The sky seemed so very different that night. I won't forget that feeling, ever. Now after 20 years, I must say that the same old impression remained intact. Trust me, even a child of 7 can understand concepts like: endless space, human origins, humanoid robots (& robotic humans), murder (sempre), immortality, aliens, reincarnation... Each time I watched this movie again, I was eagerly waiting for 2 hours to see the last (fantastic) 30 minutes, and 29 more minutes to see the final, overwhelmingly ""paralyzing"" scene.What is the scene? Is it some kind of hope... or simply  life and all that life represents? Is life bigger than everything, and is the human being bigger than the whole cosmos? Could it be the first, in fact  primordial  step after death? Is it ""everything there is"", the axiomatic state?Why do I always have to wait for the end, for only a few seconds experiencing immortality? And the feeling, that after death wins the battle, it is life that stays, or outbreaks? (Socrat said that ""life springs from the death."") Does that mean that one should die to become immortal? The whole galaxy and records of time narrow down to a tiny little fetus (no, it's not a baby)... completely motionless, eyes wide open (!), frozen in timeless, space-less... The Fetus Strikes Back! OK, that is more than profound, it is... well, the image of the fetus is HERE, in my mind, doesn't go away, and never will! The fetus is the ultimate destination! The fetus is GOD!But why would all those aliens, angels, machines, life (?) forms... bring us back to the beginning of the completely SAME STATE OF EXISTENCE (more or less)? And the same story just to be a fetus, again and again... And forever. ""Mommy, I don't wanna die!""... But when I DO die, I doubt that I will be a giant fetus staring at (or starring before) this earth? Or even worse, on my way back?! (I would use the light speed or teleport myself as far away as possible! But before departure, I would use a giant needle, puncture the earth, and blow it away!...joke) Anyway, I wanna live now! NOT after 2 hours and 29 minutes! NOT in a fetal shape! I'm a big girl! And whether I'm gonna have a baby to make myself feel immortal is MY choice! I'll get my own little bigger-than-life ""fetus"" once... and I advise that to everyone else!But since I am female, and this interpretation of that archaic image could be due to that (the maternal instincts & sh*t), that might not have been the point Kubrick wanted to make (men probably interpret the fetus as themselves, which was my case as well, when I was 7, that is). It is supposed to be the offspring of a new, improved human race? Now, we all know that men are physically stronger, even through history, the majority of geniuses were male, blah blah... And Dave... is a perfect one. Only astronauts can be that healthy, strong, beautiful, intelligent, self-controlled  even to the extent to be able to conquer HAL's HUMAN impulses?! Dave succeeded to perforate the orbit of humanity and reach Jupiter. Dave is a superman! No, Dave is NOT a superman! He is not even a man! Dave seems to be the least human, even less than HAL. Dave reached those ""superior"" beings, to change the course of humanity, as the best genetic material on this earth, and once again, the changing of a course occurs, as in the ""dawn of man"". And there lies a hope. That's nice of him.But wait, where is female in all that? Do aliens have a constructed womb? Because that symbol, in this case, would be the whole universe. I only got to see some kind of ""aura"" around the embryo. Does the fetus have a penis? I guess not, it doesn't need one. For it doesn't need female, that non-perfect creature. Everyone seems to be male in this movie, even HAL! Are they gay or what?Freud would probably disagree and laugh at the idea of someone surpassing those disgraceful, degrading instincts and finding the way to transform into something that ""neat"" and ""perfect"", that doesn't derive from the filth, or ""urges"". But then again, Freud was not an ""artist""? However... by casting one glance at the current phase and how distorted this world has become, I doubt that even aliens could do a lot about that. Even if ""Dave"" existed, which I also doubt. Well, if he did, I wouldn't let him go surfing the space, and copulate with a bunch of aliens. Tesla would advise him otherwise, so in the end I would probably have to make an ultimatum: ""Me or him (them)  make a choice!"". And that would leave me heart-broken.The sad truth is, humans only reached the moon, stabbed a flag into it and came back here. ""A small step for a man, a giant leap for mankind"". Of course it's a giant leap, since humanity is smaller than a fly's hive, even a fly would cross that route quicker, and reach it's ""destination""! (One of the best parodies based on the trip to the moon was depicted in ""Baron Munchausen""!) How far did we get really? Not too far, it seems. We are still amusing ourselves in the slime. We can't cure a pimple. And we are still underestimating the power of the dark side. Ooops, I mean, the power of the nature.Whether this movie would have such a significance in case the fetus didn't flash in front of our eyes in the end, is I guess, irrelevant. For it is perfect just the way it is. A pure, sublime fantasy. Along with the magnificent music, perhaps above everything else...",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1161,Runinrider,A Trip to Rule Them All,9,6 July 2004,"Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" does the impossible. No filmmaker since, or before Kubrick, has ever done a film of this scale, following such a complex story that begins with the dawn of man and ends with the birth of the space baby. ""2001"", easily one of the greatest films of the 60's, is difficult to follow and it can prove confusing to those expecting something entirely different (mind you, this is no ""Star Wars""). However, if people can get the message and can understand what Kubrick was trying to do with the film, you'll see how far ahead of its time it was.
Kubrick himself recorded over 200+ walk-outs on a screening of the film. Though not one to take things like this seriously, this was a blow to Kubrick's public reception. Furtunately for Kubrick, he won an Oscar and the film became one of the most critically acclaimed films of all time.Talking about the film is difficult, but what it's mostly about is evolution and birth. The film begins with the Dawn of the Man, as apes live together in a normal society, prey to tigers and other predators. One day, the ape clan encounter a black monolith and changes begin to follow. Apes discover tools (brilliantly showed in a very memorable scene by Kubrick) and with it they learn to hunt. Now they've become sophisticated and smart, and ultimately learn to kill each other.Then the scene changes to a large space background. We are introduced to Heywood Floyd, whose home city have discovered evidence of early life. They keep it a secret, and we slowly learn that this discovery is similar to what the apes encountered. No one knows what it is, other then it's million years old and was proven to have been ""deliberately"" buried. When Heywood and his crew see the monolith for themselves, a radio siren goes off.18 months later, the scene remains the same; only now we are introduced to different characters. The astronauts, led by Dave Bowman, are on a Jupiter mission, the first for humans. Two of the astronauts, including Dave, are still on board, while the three others are kept in hibernation. Also aboard the ship is the perfect human, the H.A.L. 9000 supercomputer. HAL, as he's called, controls all operations on the ship, and is entitled to the survival of the three hibernated members. Much appears normal, until HAL, somewhat ""intentionally"", fouls up. Dave and his friend discuss what to do with HAL, they plan to disconnect him so that he doesn't mess up again. HAL reads their lips and turns murderous, killing off the crew, but is ultimately disconnected by Dave (HAL's begging is another memorable moment). After disconnection, Dave receives a video transmission that was only known on board by the HAL computer, this being of the existence of the black monolith.After this follows a near-30 minute trip to the Infinite, Dave's trip through the space-gate with images that will keep you glued to your seat. As it ends, Dave's life is shown in the birth of the space baby, and the monolith that triggered the change. (It's an Odyssey, all right)Much of what makes ""2001"" so captivating and powerful is particularly due to Kubrick's careful use of classical compositions with which to tell his story. Originally, he planned to have a seperate score, but changed his mind (and for the better). The most memorable of Stanley's choices is by far Richard Strauss's ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"", and Johann's ""The Blue Danube"". Both perfectly accompany their scenes and make all the more memorable. The rest of the soundtrack is made of strictly eerie sounds, which also fit very well in with the overall mood of the film, particularly the trip to the Infinite.The acting is all average, done by unknown European actors like Keir Dullea as Dave. The most memorable piece of acting in the film, though, was through the voice of the HAL 9000. Trust me, his voice is so powerful and mysterious that you'll end up having similar opinions as the members on board. But acting isn't even essential to a film like ""2001"", in which images are the main story (and one in which true appreciation comes from how much one can ""read"" visual films). ""2001"" could've gotten away as a silent film if it wanted to. Conversations aren't important and the first ten minutes are all animal sounds. Finally, ""2001"", though not quite my favorite Kubrick film, is a solid piece of cinema. It's a film that we'll question you throughout its entire time span, and it's easily a film that one will have to continue reading on to really just touch the surface of what it's about. It's Kubrick's most difficult film, and his most visually appealing, but it's one that everybody interested in the director's films, or film in general, needs to watch (""carefully watch"").9/10(***+/****)",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1164,andyfennessy,"""Open the pod bay doors, Hal""",10,24 January 2003,"It seems rather fashionable these days for film critics to dismiss this film as ""pretentious"" and ""boring"" (is it just me, or do critics often appear to represent a homogenous group-mind?) Certainly, it isn't a film that would be considered viable by any production company today, since it has camera shots lasting more than a fraction a second each and a lack of good guys and bad guys running around calling each other... well, let's say casting aspersions as to their relationships with the maternal side of their families.
It never was meant to be a film for resolutely earth-bound dullards with MTV-addled attention spans. 2001: A Space Odyssey was made in a time where experimentation was still possible in the main stream of film making. No, I don't quite understand why Dave Bowman ends up as a giant foetus floating in space either, but I am given the opportunity to interpret this and other images, rather than have everything explained to me by some angry, shouting character.The humans in this film are mere ciphers. Bowman and Poole remind me of some of the most unreflective and basic humans I have ever worked with (which is saying something, as I work in I.T!) But Kubrick never was much interested in the minutiae of human interaction, (in his films, at least), no, for him it was the bigger picture.What is suggested here - and remember, it is a story - is that an advanced alien race has assisted our development as a species... initially by teaching us how to bash each other's brains in. This aggression - negative though it may seem - appears to be the quality that leads to our dominance of the planet. It's interesting that we are introduced to Bowman, onboard the Discovery, jogging around the space ship practicing his boxing moves - Man, millions of years later, still throwing punches (note also, the karate bout shown on a TV during the Moon visit by Floyd).It might be of interest too, to reflect upon that philosopher of nastiness Frederick Nietzche, who wrote something to the effect that Man is not the end product of life on Earth, but merely a conduit to the ""Superman"" (Also Sprach Zarathustra is the name of Fun-time Freddie's most famous tract, as well as the title of the film's opening - and closing - music, by Strauss. Coincidence?)The ""Beyond the Infinite"" sequence, with our Dave seemingly careering headlong into the Pearl and Dean cinema advert (non-UK residents may be forgiven for not knowing what the Hell I'm talking about!) is simply masterful. Why aren't films this ambitious anymore?Cherish this motion picture, for you will never see its like again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1165,LovetheBombFilms,34/40,8,20 December 2013,"Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, takes the form of its subject matter. The film itself feels like an alien transmission received by beings incapable of realizing its true significance. For many viewers of 2001: A Space Odyssey, the film is dull and pointless. But many others decide to accept it for what it is and desire to understand it. I am in the latter, and each time I watch 2001: A Space Odyssey I feel like I understand its greatness even more.I feel like I'm flinging the word ""monumental"" around a lot recently, but if that word doesn't apply to 2001: A Space Odyssey then it doesn't apply to cinema. From ""the dawn of man"" to ""beyond the infinite"" 2001: A Space Odyssey explores some of the most fascinating and significant questions to face mankind: the dramatic quirk of the mind that allowed humans to first proliferate by using tools and weapons, the place of artificial intelligence in relation to organic intelligence, the interaction between man and alien, or even god, and finally the ascension of the whole human race to a greater field of being. Not only does 2001: A Space Odyssey explore these fascinating concepts, it makes the viewer feel as if they are witnessing these incredible events firsthand. Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" carries the emotion of many scenes to an incredible height. It lends its gravity and escalation to the events depicted on screen. It perfectly complements the man-ape's first experiments with bone as it does the starchild's return to Earth. In addition to that fantastic piece of music are many others, many of them ethereal and otherworldly in themselves. The stargate sequence makes use of this kind of music but the real magic is in the visuals. Nothing that can be seen really makes sense. There is only a vague feeling of transportation across multiple fields of existence. And still it is beautiful. What this sequence does is simulate man's journey into alien territory, where things aren't likely to fit into man's expectations about the universe. The sequence is highly haunting and sublime, just like the rest of 2001: A Space Odyssey. I would be remiss not to mention the great suspense that the voyage to Jupiter scenes supply. The finale is a chilling showdown between man and his own creation: machine. As Dave finally kills his supercomputer copilot, HAL's emotional appeals feel particularly poignant. Perhaps that is because we do not know if HAL really feels or not and we feel guilty for not being able interact with him in a way that might comfort him. These are the main monumental sequences that give 2001: A Space Odyssey value, but they come at a price.2001: A Space Odyssey represents two extremes in its storytelling. First are the fantastic scenes listed above, but equally present are drawn-out scenes that are very hard to find enjoyment in. The sequence that follows Dr. Floyd to the Moon feels particularly long and pointless. I know it's looked down upon but I must criticize the space ballet that represents the doctor's movement between space stations. I feel like the images and the editing are not proficient to match the beautiful, lilting, happy ""Blue Danube."" Another component of the sequence is several dialogue scenes that feel entirely too long. Knowing that the characters in these scenes do not matter for the rest of the story I felt very alienated, an emotion I would expect to be Kubrick's intention. And a fine intention it was except it was uncomfortable to see the scenes take so long, as if there was some underlying importance beyond merely divulging information. Indeed there might be but it escaped my grasp this time around. The second part I have issue with is the glacially slow build up to HAL's mutiny. I did not have much of problem with watching the boring daily activities of the astronauts, but the drawn out, painstakingly detailed retrieval of the mechanical component from the dish nearly had me in tears. Luckily the following scenes more than made up for the pain suffered in these frustratingly slow scenes.2001: A Space Odyssey is a great film. I'm not quite ready to call it a masterpiece, even though it achieves something that I doubt any other film has.34/40",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1166,bryduck,"Yeah, I get it. I just don't like it.",1,3 April 2003,"Back in 1969, this was groundbreaking cinema. Even then, though, I imagine there were plenty of complaints about the ""stately"" pace of the thing. I am in a small minority of film savvy people who believe that Kubrick's use of time represents a self-indulgence matched only by Terence Malick. Watching anything Kubrick made after ""Paths of Glory"" is akin to watching paint dry, including ""Full Metal Jacket"" and (to a lesser extent) ""The Shining"". Think of ""Barry Lyndon"" . . .

1167,joebobs,One of the boldest films ever made,10,15 February 2014,"Joe's current Ranking: 4/1034 2001 is a film of monumental ambition, it is really a work of metaphor and philosophical ideas represented through images. That description may be more common in short films, but to describe a feature film made for general release that fits this brief is very rare. I often think how such a film could be made now, in the corporate age of cinema. The answer of course is that it couldn't be; its budget and scope are too big for an independent and its ideas too avant garde and unpopular for a mainstream studio. Imagine trying to sell to a group of executives a film which begins with half an hour of cavemen and no speech, and ends with another half hour of no speech, hypnotic imagery and loud classical music. It would be like Marcel Duchamp pitching a new MacDonald's logo! But enough nostalgia, onto the film. I think what I admire most is the attempt to tell a story that is so complex, the story of human history, of our struggle towards something – we know not what – but it is the thing we have mastered technology, language, society, culture and science to try to achieve. In the film it is represented by the monolith, it moves us towards our goal as we try to understand it. The monolith is the question, the why, the how of life. The cavemen are mystified by it, and their solution is the tool. In the near future, space travellers are propelled onwards by it, and then eventually, it is no longer a question of exploring physical space, but transcending it, becoming something more than flesh and bone, allowing consciousness to achieve its great ambition. I would even suggest that all this is in itself a metaphor for the individual search for understanding.Technically, the film is masterful and opened new doors for those who had great visions to put onto the screen. The spinning bone turning into the spaceship is an iconic image, as is the monolith. The use of music is also masterful, in many scenes, especially later in the film, the music becomes the main character, you hear the overture building and it's like the main character returning.And of course there is what is often most remembered in the film, but I would suggests actually operates more as a secondary story, the part of HAL 9000. I recall on first viewing not understanding why this was part of the film, it seemed that there was this great thesis about human endeavour, and then a subplot horror story about a computer gone insane. But I had missed the point, it was still the story of human endeavour, this was the second act, the complicating action, where humanity puts it faith in the machine (as it had done with that bone), only for it to go wrong. I still consider this to be one of the most ambitious films ever made, and I strongly recommend it to anyone.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1168,walruspower60,An Ambiguous And Beautiful Masterwork,10,22 February 2011,"Make no mistake, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick's best. A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove and The Shining were all exceptional films, but no other Kubrick film, or any film, for that matter, has made something so emotionally twisting and beautiful. If a film can be art, this truly is. The story begins with a prologue concerning early humans finding a mysterious thing that looks like a door, and from there follows the story of astronauts on a mission to Jupiter accompanied by the computer HAL. But don't see the movie expecting that. See the movie expecting emotion. Unlike the traditional spectrum of Action vs. Character, 2001 is almost completely separated from those analysis. The two extremes of movies are movies filled with character and not much happening or filled with action and not much character, and when these two aspects are merged together in harmony and balance, you get a masterpiece, like the Godfather, There Will Be Blood, Goodfelas or Pulp Fiction. But 2001 is something completely different. The movie has very little to do with character, but is very slow-paced and events are far apart. This movie is pushed ahead by something hard to define. The closest I can come to defining it is a huge sense of wonder. Like, you sit through the whole movie just marvelling at it's beauty. But this isn't an art gallery. There are huge themes of evolution, humanity, automation and what makes us human. The movie does throw huge narrative curves that will shock and disturb you, and I guarantee you certain images and sounds will stay with you to your dying day.This movie is an experience. From the first few seconds that might make you think there's something wrong with the image on your TV to spine-shivering, inspiring moments to the Blue Danube, this is awe-inspiring in the most awe-inspiring sense of the world.P.S. don't watch this movie if you need constant action, if you are 10 or if you can't focus on anything. Just sayin.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1169,nj2,"I'm a fan of art-house movies, but this was just dull",4,2 January 2007,"Most American/Hollywood material is far too shallow for my taste and I love many slow ""artsy"" movies from the likes of Wenders or Fassbinder. But I have to say, even after watching 2001 with an open mind now and the suspicion in the back of my head that I might have been too young to understand it when I first saw it about one and a half decades ago, this movie just does not deliver. Main problems:1. What creativity, symbolism or beauty is supposed to lie in painfully slow sequences of someone using technical appliances?2. The kaleidoscope effects, inverse images etc. towards the end were playing for far too long. Overusing such effects comes across as rather primitive.3. Most of the acting was plain bad. I did like the voice acting for HAL though.4. I don't want to sound like a Trekkie, but a computer with full control over the whole ship with no easily accessible manual override is an unbelievable concept. Plus the supposed infallibility even though the machine was created and programmed by fallible human beings. I could accept it if I could see an artistic reason for this, but I don't. It appears like some standard sci-fi component of the time thrown into the mix.My rating: 4 of 10 for some good cinematography and a (mostly unsuccessful) hint of artistic endeavor.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1170,Serata,All I have to say is...,10,4 December 2003,"All I have to say is wow. Stanly Kubrick has created another masterpiece of cinema. From the downright frightening HAL computer, to the comical signs on bathroom stalls, this movie gets my highest rating: 10!!!!! (yes with five, count them five exclamation points). Although the ending was a little hard to figure out, it was one of the most amazing parts of the film This movie left me with an incredible sense of awe for Kubrick and a new respect for all things natural that humans have destroyed with computers and fossil fuels. Never has a movie made such an impact on my life and the actual way I live. That was how powerful this movie was to me.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1171,ultrapop,The Ultimate in Visionary Cinema,10,27 July 2005,"2001 is the supreme example of the lost art of pure cinema. Alongside other auteurs like David Lean, Kubrick represents a period of epic film-making that has sadly passed from our realm. The indelible experience of a theatrical motion picture event such as 2001 has been replaced in our time with forgettable multiplex fodder--even ""event"" films such as Spielberg's War of the Worlds are nothing more than forgettable popcorn time-fillers. But 2001 was crafted to leave a lasting impression of complex, majestic artistry, sewing seeds of mystery and dream-world surrealism that, for me at least, live on in my own consciousness.Those who've never viewed 2001 in its proper setting have never really seen the whole film. I have the DVD, but rarely enjoy viewing it. The home video format simply eradicates the grandeur and majestic scope of this completely unique cinematic milestone. The last chance I had to view it on a big screen was at the Cineramadome in Hollywood about a decade ago, and that experience was memorable beyond words. Inherent in its makeup, 2001 was meant to be viewed in crystal-clear 70mm on a mammoth screen, with state-of-the-art sound. Through its sensory scope, the technology of the film itself suggests the evolutionary connections between the futuristic HAL and the very medium chosen to portray him/it. The movie screen becomes a character in the relationships posed by 2001, and no video system can ever duplicate that. The incredibly complex, layered sound (as well as the suffocating silence) is also a character. That's the nature of Kubrick's visionary cinema.Such were the ideas and ideals of film-making as it blossomed in the sixties era, conceptual strains which are all but lost in our current corporation-saturated world. It was years after having seen 2001 as a young teenager that I was able to see Kubrick's complete body of work, and it's still striking that an artist who was so cynical could have made the great masterpiece of awe and wonder. The companion piece to 2001, A Clockwork Orange, is in many ways the antithesis of all that 2001 conveys, and to me that's a fascinating dichotomy. I think the latter film was closer to Kubrick's own world-view, but as an artist and a master of visions, 2001 stands as the supreme testament to thinking outside the box.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Since then, I've seen it several times as an adult. I'm almost 50 now and still cant stand this film. The 1 redeeming quality of this film is its special effects. They stand the test of time. The lack of dialog and the long drawn out scenes, kill this film. It should have been edited. Since seeing this, I've seen a few more Kubrick films. I dont care for his style. Not my cup of tea. On the flip side of things. I also read the books 2001 and 2010 around the time 2010 came out at the theater. I loved the books. Since have I have read the books 2061 and 3001.

1173,andrewroake,"It's a sci-fi film, but not as we know it.",9,27 August 2012,"My first real thought when coming away from this film is ""What the heck was that all about?"" And to be honest I think that's most people's reaction when they first see this movie.So it's not really surprising that this is one of the most debated films in history with many different people trying to work out it's meaning. Kubrick himself said that:""You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of the film- and such speculation is one indication in that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep level- but I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer will feel obliged to pursue or else fear he's missed the point."" The film has polarized opinion with some heralding it as a masterpiece of cinema that taxes and challenges yourself to think while others call it pretentious, self-indulgent trash with a rubbish plot and little to no structure. I fall into the first camp.I really like the movie's inaccessibility. Obtuse would be another good word to describe this as well. The film gives you no easy explanation of the events going on in it and forces you to make your own conclusions of the film. It provokes ideas and debate which is why this film appeals to me so much. Very few movies force to think for yourself these days. Everything is usually hand wrapped, put in a box, and given to you as a gift with all the answers and the meanings laid out for you. To have a film that doesn't simply prepare everything for you in advance is really refreshing. But, whatever you think of the film's content you have to agree this film looks absolutely stunning. The directorial work on this film in simply gorgeous and yet another example of Kubrick's immense skills in cinematography. The shot in my mind that stick out for me in particular are the opening sweeping shots of all the space-stations accompanied perfectly with The Blue Danube. And by space-stations- I mean models. Hand crafted models, none of this poxy CGI stuff we have these days. Models full of the most intricate and small details that make them all the more believable. Just watching them float through space really is an awe-inspiring sight.Going back to the directing work, the interior shots of the spaceship are mesmerising. The way that the actors can not only walked in a straight line but also on the walls, over the ceiling and then back down to the floor. Seeing these for the first time truly was one of those ""How in the name of hell did they do that?"" moments.Kubrick's co-writer Arthur C.Clarke was a futurist and had a diverse and intelligent understanding on science and technology. These two factors made him very clever indeed on predicting what kinds of technology we would have in the future. And it's this knowledge that I think gives the this movie such credibility to me. Often with Sci-fi people's visions of the future can look very dated. However with this movie what Kubrick and Clarke did was to say in even though this may not be the actual future it at least looks likes a credible alternate future. But sadly it's not all perfect. This film suffers terribly from the 60's scientific optimism, in which everyone thought at the rate the space race was going we most probably would be going to Jupiter in 2001. As we all now know, humanity stopped dreaming and space interest died in the 70s. So looking at this film with the title of ""2001"" always is a bit of a sore reminder to me.But still that doesn't get in the way with how fascinating and awesome this film is. Check it out if you have an open attitude to films and are willing to have your minds incredibly taxed afterwards.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1174,laires-ines,2001: An Endlessly Tedious Odyssey,3,20 February 2018,"I cannot describe how much I disliked this movie. It was supposed to be a fun ride, not a tedious one. The lack of dialogue, the repetitive scenes and the absence of emotion made this almost unbearable to watch.The movie is entirely based in space (except for the first boring half hour) and it presents the evolution of the human species in an allegorical way. The technical parts (CGI) and the movie's edition was, in my opinion, brilliant. Other than that, I don't understand the enormous praise that this movie has. The classical music seems to have been used to distract the audience from the long standing monotonous scenes. It looks and sounds inconvenient for the most part. It felt like there was no purpose behind the entire movie, just a bunch of people trying to be creative and the result ended in disorder. This is a movie cult for the appraisers of modern art, lovers of simplicity and incoherence or psychedelic scenarios. The movie feels lost and dead, just like seeing a white painting with a red circle in the middle. The plot is incredibly vague and audacious and because of its incomprehensibility it's often designed as being a masterpiece (after all, incomprehensibility for most people means ""profundity""). 
Well, it was certainly my mistake for watching this because I never liked Kubrick's movies. His confidence was always bigger than his creations, too bad that he's gone now. With this said, I would like to append that Space Odyssey's theme music is the sound of my brain after watching this overrated movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It's alien to the world they live in and treat it with caution.Then one of the most symbolic moments in movie history. The primordial image of an ape smashing a skull with a bone, then throwing the bone into the sky. Cut to black and space-ship floating through the heavens.Something has been discovered on the Moon, but all the ivory tower egg-heads want to close rank and not discuss it in the outside world. Cue a brief cameo from Leonard ""Rigsby"" Rossiter.Onto the Moon itself, where a second Black Monolith has been discovered. It's been deliberately buried into the lunar surface. As the humans approach, a piercing noise destroys the hearing of the team digging up the strange structure.Cut to a mission to Jupiter where the Black Monolith was emitting some kind of signal and a computer that's going crazy. This is such a key part to the movie. The interactions with Dave and HAL are fantastic.After switching off HAL after he's gone computer senile, Dave heads into The Infinite.

1176,Andrew-Critchley,The finest example of the art,10,28 February 2006,"I can't remember when or where I first saw 2001: A Space Odyssey, probably because it is just so stunning. It epitomises grace, both visually and intellectually, and more than any other film it perfectly articulates the true purpose of science fiction.Every film (if not art in general) is ultimately an exploration of the human condition; but whereas so much Sci-Fi is simply a stylistic treatment of another genre (typically the Western) 2001 explores concepts that no other genre could - and that is what Science Fiction is for, stepping beyond what we have in order to better understand it. Exactly what 2001 explores is unclear, as the endless debates and its notorious ending make, well, perfectly clear; but if it is meant to do no more than stimulate thought then it achieves greatly.If Fantasy and Horror represent the imaginative then Science Fiction is the philosophic, but only the greatest examples rise to the challenge and that happens too rarely. Blade Runner (Sci-Noir, but anyway) is one of the few, questioning another facet of human nature, again doing so without resorting to blunt explanation when eloquent ambiguity communicates much more powerfully. So too Metropolis, the Citizen Kane of Sci-Fi; but compare these with The Matrix Trilogy (Kung-Fi), which had the potential to be both accessible and thought provoking but finally delivered only glossy nonsense.As well as breaking technological boundaries in its production, 2001 remains the strongest example of ""hard"" Sci-Fi for its scientific realism and the wholly convincing portrayal of future technology - human level, of course. Not just in the obvious hardware of the space age but also for HAL 9000, undoubtedly the most authentic representation of AI in either film or reality.I love this film. Over the years I read Arthur C. Clarke's Odyssey novels and found them more or less enjoyable, but the original film remains the pinnacle. When much younger I liked 2010 (A Space Idiocy...) which can only be regarded as a children's primer and was out-grown long ago, but there really can be no comparison between them, maybe with any other film at all. Stanley Kubrick was painterly in his style, but I think 2001 more than any other demonstrates the purest work of his imagination. A masterpiece unconstrained by the world that spawned it.As I write these words, 1040 other people have already had their say and I can only assume that no-one else will ever read this. Sadly I'm not patient enough to wait for another 960 to do the same, so the ultimate 2001: A Space Odyssey commentary will have to go to someone else.

1178,brackbatter814,Timeless,10,11 January 2007,"I watched 2001 when I was twelve years old and despised it. I held such low regard for the film that I vowed to never watch it again for the rest of my life. I suppose I forgot that promise I made, as curiosity got the better of me and I revisited Kubrick's film this past summer when I was 19. I think two things are critical for viewing this movie, two things which as a twelve year old I did not possess: patience and a willingness to be open to where the story goes. 2001 is the most ""different"" film you will see in your life. Whenever I talk to someone who has seen it, we both find ourselves at a loss for words as to what the film was ultimately about or what it meant to us. Some might say that indicates a failure on the lack of the filmmaker, but I am inclined to disagree. I think Stanley Kubrick was wholly successful in fostering a sense of wonder and the desire to question our existence in the film, and I believe that he left the other themes as somewhat ambiguous so the audience could decide for themselves what they meant to them. I enjoyed the film on numerous levels. First, it was a brilliant slice of history- I love to watch movies that make an effort to realistically portray the future. No matter how hard they try, they always have a strong contemporary influence that might be unnoticeable at the time, but is very apparent later on. In 2001 this is certainly the case, but it delightful. There is so much optimism with the presentation of the space station, so much hope at what we might accomplish, that one is easily able to overlook the dated brand logos and garish furniture. I found an immense charm to every aspect of the universe presented in this film. It is clear that painstaking thought and detail went into the creation of every set, every prop and every interaction in the film. Which brings me to my next point. Kids will have trouble watching this movie because it is so sparse on dialogue, and plodding in its presentation. One must surrender themselves to the film and accept the fact that the movie is forcing us to view something in a completely new way. Because much of the movie is so quiet, it leaves the viewer a great deal of time to think. And more importantly, it makes the viewer pay close attention to the moments where there are dialogue and action. Because the film forces the viewer to focus in a completely new way, it makes them remember what happened in the film with much greater intensity. All modern filmmakers should remember that economy is an important thing, and that often having less leaves you with more. Truer words could not be ascribed to 2001. It has been more than six months since I last saw it, and yet I remember it with greater clarity than any film I've seen since, and find myself turning back to it and questioning what it was all about, questioning why I felt the way I did. The mark of an excellent film is one that causes you to reference it again and again in your thoughts without the outside stimulation of having to see something that will remind you of it. 2001 is sublime. It transcends what any other film has accomplished. It shows the evolution of mankind and as a result, is a very spiritual journey. This is not just some science fiction film as many would be led to believe by the fragments that popular culture has latched on to, like HAL and the space station. This is a film that documents each stage in the history of mankind, from prehistoric, to contemporary, to the ever distant future. I asks so many questions- what is the meaning of life? why do we value our existence? does one man really matter? why do we feel happy or sad? why do we care about other people? what separates man from machine? is there significance to human life in light of the enormity of the universe? where will we go after death? is there such a thing as regeneration? So many questions, and so many questions that one should ask all the time. An unexamined life is not worth living as PLato (I believe) once said. 2001 wants us to examine our lives. It wants us to think outside of our bodies and question our values and our biases. It is not a preachy film- nowhere, and may I stress this, nowhere does it tell the viewer what to hink, or make any insinuations about what the audience should be interpreting or feeling. This is a film for everyone to possess and call their own. Everyone can have an opinion about what this film is about, and no one would be wrong. It is for each person watching 2001 to decide what it =means to them. This is an experience to be shared and appreciated. I cannot believe that 2001 was made in the studio system, but it was, and it's a credit to a different era that it was made and released. It is an exquisite experience, with truly stunning special effects, all of which hold up today, and in many cases, are superior to cgi. I think it's a good thing when the viewer asks themselves, ""How did they do that?"" With cgi, this mysterious element disappears, and one can explain it away with computers. The fact that 2001 was made without the assistance of modern film-making tools makes it even more of a marvel.I love it, and I hope you see it and take the time to think about it too.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It is undoubtedly fully deserving of the number 1 spot on my list of top movies of all time. The score is finely tuned and adjusted to the visual imagery in the film. Visually, Stanley Kubrick takes us to new extents and shows us unimaginative aspects of nature. The space looks absolutely haunting and breathtaking even though the movie was released as back as 1968. The movie may come as a confusing tale to some folks, but nevertheless its complexity is fully necessary to give the viewer the ultimate pleasure of the whole wide space. The movie is very thematic and raises up larger than life questions which define our place in the universe, our struggle for supremacy, our evolution. In the end, Stanley Kubrick has brought us with a film which is unforgettable and is sure to create buzz for times to come.My score : 10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1182,Ben_hanson111,Spectacular and gripping,9,20 October 2006,"A film like no other, 2001 takes you on an epic journey that should stick in your mind. It's 150 minute duration is short of narrative material but full spectacle, and of haunting and thought-provoking Revelations and scenarios in outer-space. Kubrick indulges himself with long, lingering shots and great detail in each scene. The films slow pace is bearable thanks to its staggering spectacle and ingenious camera work. The beauty of many shots in accentuated by the use of classical music and scenes of peril or menace are made greater by the use of silence and sound effects. For long periods 2001 is short on narrative, with characters appearing fleetingly and only subtly suggesting what thefilm is driving at. It is split into four sections, each showing a separate event in time. Some of them seem unrelated to the previous act, all they have in common is the monolith. One is first seen triggering a step in man's evolution millions of years ago. One is then dug up on the moon and found to be emitting a signal toward Jupiter. On the mission to Jupiter one is seen in the 'star child' sequence. What this means is open to interpretation. What makes 2001 great is its thought-provoking nature, awesome visuals and sound and the haunting power of many of the plot revelations. There is a section of 2001 when it moves away from its abstract nature and has prolonged sections of dialogue and character development. The result is simply fantastic. The conflict between HAL and the astronauts is one of the most unnerving and gripping sequences in film. HAL is a great villain. Because he is a machine the crew underestimate him. The viewer also has no idea what he is capable of. The fact that the crew are alone in space with an all powerful super-computer for an enemy is pure terror. The conflict is brilliantly built up with Dave and Frank having their doubts about HAL's competency and then his discovery of their plans to disconnect him. HAL was not evil but simply programmed to assume himself fool-proof and to treat any attempt to undermine to control of the Spaceship as an attack on the mission. His pleading for mercy before being disconnected shows his depth.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1183,vexicaus,Must be high to enjoy the prolonged time,4,7 November 2015,"Let me start by saying this movie is nothing more than an over-hyped piece of crap that people consider to be art due to it's iconic value. It is a pioneer that has influenced many later films and some TV shows. But, still, that doesn't mean it's good itself. First 20 or so minutes of the movie is unintelligible monkey interaction that caused me to literally fall asleep (I had to finish the next day). Then it's some vague dialogue and exposition that does a poor job of giving the audience an idea of what's happening. Let me say that up to this point, all of the scenes are unnecessarily elongated which supposedly gives this work more watching value. For example -- 10 minutes of a series of shots of rocks WITH music. This is not a symphony, this is a movie. People want to visualize, they want to see what's happening, not hear it with the misplaced sounds that give you the feeling of suspense.Throughout, you're left watching through a 2 hour bore. Nothing interesting happens until maybe an hour into the film... I forgot what happened there because most of it is just a flat, linear pit of nothingness you lose yourself into because you daydream while staring into the screen. But what happens in an hour can be shown in 30 minutes. Now imagine that. Most of it is prolonged shots and over established scenes. The plot, of course, inspired Interstellar, but who can deny the interest that movie induced? I loved that movie, but 2001 is just tedious in every way. You need to be high to enjoy this movie, simple as that. If you don't know, being high makes everything seem more interesting (in some cases), or better. Please, can anyone tell me what exactly there is to this film that no other has? Is it the soundtrack? The iconic plot that was a disappointment due to it's poor execution? Either way, I suppose people enjoy it because of the potential it DID have. Nonetheless, everything is opinionated, I suppose. That, of course, is only true in each of our own realities.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The first time I viewed the movie, I was certainly impressed with the visuals and message, but it all seemed a bit to dry and abstract for me. Then, I viewed it a second and third time. Each time, I become more and more amazed by the simple cynical message the film tells us about the human race, and how we shoot so high, and fall so low. The message is subtle, and the meaning behind the film has been interpreted in hundreds of ways because of the genius behind the film. This is a film you must be attentive to, you can't just idly watch it while sending emails on your laptop. Overall, the stunning non-CGI visuals, the complex message, the depth of the film, and the personal impact it has had on me is incredible. As such, this is the one film I will ever give a 10/10. I hate giving away 10 out of 10s, as it implies near absolute perfection, but this movie is deserving of such a rating.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1185,ryangrogers,A twisting tale where man faces the task of understanding time itself,10,6 October 2016,"2001: A Space OdysseyStanley Kubrick's 1968 release, 2001: A Space Odyssey, truly revolutionized the film industry by creating something never before seen on camera. Kubrick, with the help of writer, Arthur C. Clarke, was able to create a mind-bending tale completely left open to interpretation thanks to an inconclusive ending that provides more questions than answers. It has to be considered as the movie that shaped cinematic sci-fi as it is know today as well as one of the best movies ever made. Due to the film's thought provoking characters, lack of dialogue, cinematography, and incredible score as well as many other positives, 2001 is lifted to new heights in comparison to many other movies of the genre. The film takes place over millions of years, beginning with apes and the ""dawn of man."" A mysterious black box appears that can connect all of time. This progresses to man at the beginning of the 21st century where they are attempting to conquer space. Several astronauts and a form of artificial intelligence are sent on an unknown mission. The astronauts begin to discover that the A.I., HAL 9000, cannot be trusted and enter the duel between man and machine. This leads to a twisting tale where man faces the task of understanding time itself. From the beginning, Kubrick knew he wanted to make a very intellectual film. In order to achieve this, he knew he had to have thought provoking characters whether they were human or an advanced form of artificial intelligence. He succeeds. Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) quickly become intriguing to the audience when they begin their mysterious mission into space. Through characterization and empathy, viewers can connect to the two astronauts and are able to put themselves in the astronauts' seemingly hopeless position. However, the character that completely changes the game is not even human. HAL, the computer system on the ship, is the most complexing personality in the entire film. At first, the viewer does not know what to think of the machine. His goal is to help the astronauts achieve the mission but at the same time, it seems like HAL is hiding something. Throughout the rest of the film, the viewer attempts to understand HAL and his actions. BY doing this, audiences are drawn straight into the movie from start to finish. It has been calculated that 2001 has roughly eighty minutes of film that contains absolutely no dialogue. Although this seems strange and unappealing, it actually enhances the viewing experience. In multiple scenes, the only thing audiences can hear is the heavy breathing of the astronauts when they are in their suits. They do not say a single word. This creates a sense of austerity as the astronauts fulfill their mission traveling through space. Humans are completely out of their comfort zone and must even learn how to breathe again. Dialogue is only used when absolutely necessary and leaves a lot to up to the audiences' inferences. This, in turn, creates a very intelligent film that requires a viewer to be thinking throughout the movie. The audience is in a sense, required to solve problems and understand issues just like the astronauts are. The cinematography in 2001 is simply breathtaking to put it frankly. Geoffrey Unsworth, the cinematographer, and Kubrick were able to film things that nobody at the time could even imagine to film. As Kubrick put it, ""If it can be written, or thought, it can be filmed."" The weightless motion of a pen is able to be created and filmed in a studio affected by gravity. A point-of-view shot is used to show the audience how HAL views the world. A ""stargate sequence"" is created and somehow filmed superbly (much of the info on how that sequence was filmed is still unknown due to it being kept confidential by Kubrick). The musical score in 2001 successfully creates the world in which the characters interact. Kubrick uses classical pieces written by Richard Strauss and several others throughout the film that make space seem vast yet mysterious. These pieces set the mood for each scene whether they are suspenseful and tense, or just simply present so the viewer can observe the wonders of space. 2001: A Space Odyssey is simply incredible and contains very few, if any, flaws. At times, specifically the beginning, the movie can be a little slow and takes time to develop. This makes it somewhat challenging for the average movie- goer to ""get into"" the movie. However, this is a matter of opinion and can be different depending on who is watching the movie. Kubrick's thriller through space and time is not for everyone. As stated earlier, some viewers may find it challenging to enjoy a movie that takes time to develop while containing less dialogue than most other films. However, for all other audiences, it is a must-see film that leaves the viewer looking for answers and pondering the ending for days. 2001: A Space Odyssey is simply put, an incredible viewing experience that deservedly earns a 10 out of 10 rating.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

One thing about any science fiction film is that, if it's any good, it will include a warning to society, or many. In this case I feel it is warning us to not depend too much on technology. Kubrick uses a lot of extended takes and long views to enhance the feeling of distance and enormity of space. also to stress the realism he is going for. He does an excellent job of conveying meaning with very little dialog throughout the film but especially in the beginning where he shows prehistorical occurrences.

I love the book too by the way. Liked the first three but four was a bit on the meh side, Clarke was very old when he wrote it so I give it a pass.

I think one viewing of this movie alone somehow says in a strange way: Hi, my name is Stanley Kubrick, this is MY film, and I am the greatest American director in the history of cinema.  While Spielberg is off making dinosaur movies and killer sharks films, Kubrick is constantly challenging our intelligence with ""visions"" that he comes out with every 8 years as an affront to normal film-making.  Sure he could have made this a film with a normal plot, fast paced action, and loads of dialogue.

How could Kubrick go from ""Dr. Strangelove"" to this to ""Clockwork Orange"" without tapping into God's creative juices?...Very few other movies integrate music more perfectly to set the tone and feeling for the flight.  The movie is a flight for all of us, to explore questions that don't necessarily have answers (yet).  And it's no coincidence that the one character with the most humanity is a computer. It's what's happening now, and Kubrick could see this years ago.Life has no easy answers, and this movie doesn't either.

1196,asu_tbone,The Greatest Movie Ever,10,5 October 2000,"I know why people don't like this movie.  In our fast-paced society, if a movie comes along that is as slow as this one, we ignore it.  And it is slow.  Man, is it ever.  This is one of the slowest freaking movies I have ever seen. That's why I think that it's the best. Let's think about it for a minute.  We see the vast emptiness of primitive Earth, and contrast it with the vast emptiness of space in the relative infancy of our space program.  Yes, this movie supposedly takes place in 2001, 32 years after we first set foot on the moon.  But don't forget that this movie was made a full year before we set foot on the moon.  Kind of puts things in perspective, doesn't it?  Sure, by the point in the movie where we pick up, there are technological advances that we have yet to see, such as the moon base.  It's important to realize that Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke were not psychic; still, the movie is probably the most accurate picture of space we'll ever see. Another thing, besides the slowness, that bothers people is the lack of sound.  The silence is deafening in space.  You don't hear explosions in space, as most sci-fi pictures would have you believe.  There's no way for sound to travel.  The silence just adds to the horror of the story. Twentieth century composer John Cage believed that silence was the essence of music, even composed a piece that was nothing but silence.  In this movie, we see just how powerful the silence can be. The story is a powerful metaphor for the eternal battles of humankind. First, man conquers nature.  Then, man conquers technology.  The only thing that we find is the most powerful opponent for the man is himself (of course, I am speaking of man in the non-gender-specific sense, although it's a man in the movie). This movie is art, and I don't expect everyone to understand it, or even to agree with me.  These interpretations are my own.  I could talk for a long time about this movie.  It's a tough movie to watch, but it is the best I have ever seen.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1198,Nessy_Gliana,Don't believe the hype-,1,12 August 2006,"I did and I lost two and a half hours of my life that I can never regain again.I honestly have no idea what the critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can't appreciate ""art"". I love a good film with profound messages, brilliant cinematography, and great directing.This film just isn't one of them.My main complaint about this film is that it's so horribly slow-paced, to the point of boring its audience to death. On the other hand, sequences of dialog go by too quickly and there's not enough exposition to let people who haven't read the book know what's going on (My mother had mercy on me and explained everything before I watched it). Would it have killed them to hire a narrator? At least for the beginning and the end? Let me break it down for you: (Spoilers throughout) For the first two minutes you are treated to a black screen with no music, waiting for the actual movie to begin.For the following minute and a half, you see several pictures of sunrises and savanna landscapes. Like the audience couldn't figure out how to set the scene unless they saw the establishing shot three or four times.The next eleven minutes are occupied with the grunting monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight some more, pommel things with a bone. Supposedly they are prehistoric men whose evolution is being influenced by the monolith's singing. Not that you could tell if you hadn't read the book.*Finally* we get into space. Only to be subjected to twelve minutes of ships slowly spinning to the Blue Danube Waltz (A pretty quick-tempo-ed waltz as I understand, yet here it feels absolutely agonizing). At last we get some innocuous dialog and rather cryptic exposition about the government not letting people land on the moon. We are left to wonder about this for fourteen more minutes of Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat camera tricks with anti-gravity.Next comes four minutes of watching a ship travel over the surface of the moon and dock at a space station. We get a little more exposition in a board room scene that follows. Then we're back outside traveling at a snail's pace over the moon. A second monolith is revealed, again filling our ears with that horrible ringing (I had no idea that was an actual piece of music!). The monolith does its little light show and then the plot jumps forward.*Seven* minutes of watching the ship to Jupiter travel. By this point in time my brains had turned into mush. Could it be moving any slower? Maybe it's ""realistic"" to portray it as such, but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to grasp the concept of its ""realism"". Let me tell you about this ""realism"" thing; I cheered when the secondary astronaut character died. Not because I'm a sadist and like watching people die, but because after five minutes I was just so annoyed at the sound of his darn breathing! I'm supposed to care about this character, feel when he dies! Instead I found myself waiting for blissful silence whatever way it came.Anyway, now we get to the most interesting part of the film-the part with HAL. Forget Dave the stick-of-wood protagonist. The real star of the show is that coldly impersonal, chillingly villainous, ruthlessly merciless bad guy of a computer. He's great. And the ""Open the pod bay doors"" sequence is wonderful. But it's too short. And it's not long before the director once again lapses into too-long goings on.Four minutes for HAL to die. And die he does. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence with every minute, voice getting lower and slower, singing ""Daisy, Daisy"", all with a low and constant hissing that becomes just as annoying as the heavy breathing.Seven minutes of flying colors as Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could FEEL my brains melting and dripping out of my ears! Seven full minutes of absolutely nothing but some guy's whacked out psychedelic version of space travel, again with that thrice-cursed chorus! We got the idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why drag it out so long? Unless he wanted to make LSD users go psychotic and have flashbacks.I'm not even going to try to explain the ending, mostly because I don't quite get it myself. Supposedly he's in an alien research laboratory and they're teaching him deep and profound things while he watches himself getting older and older and then they send him back to earth as some kind of cosmic celestial space baby. None of this comes across in the film. For all you know, it's just a sequence of images with no purpose or plot whatsoever. A lot of the movie felt that way.The first time I tried watching this movie I gave up halfway through. The second time I suffered through this sore excuse for a film, it was to help my sister time the sequences to see how long they lasted. It's that boring.Call this crummy film ""art"" if you wish. I wouldn't. I've seen more interesting ""art"" in the local museum. And I am never subjecting myself to this kind of suffering ever again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1200,dvehampton,A true film(especially sci-fi) lover's paradise.,10,12 December 2020,"How do I write a review of this film without sounding pompous, arrogant or a band wagoneer hopping fan boy? I am now 41 years old in 2020 so this movie came out 12 years before I was born. Starting from approximately 18-19 I was aware of the movie and it's reputation. From the little info I'd absorbed over the years I'd pegged it as a sci-fi artsy film that movie snobs liked to analyze and praise. I had no interest, assumed it'd be boring and lack a cohesive plot. Finally about 6 years ago I gave in and watched it with extreme skepticism. I had an experience I've only had a few times. It's like being so captivated and present that there's no thought just attention, on the edge of my seat waiting to see what brilliant creative theme will appear next. I personally can't say it's at all slow, a faster pace and it wouldn't have been what it is. However, for people who have aunts in their pants or can't appreciate the building of wonder and suspense through pace it may seem that way. The second time I was able to take how far ahead of it's time this was. The number of times my mind was blown by the thought that it was made in 67 easily set a new personal record. Even if you too weren't born yet but have the ability to imagine the world then it will bring the experience to a new level. So, it turns out I am a fan boy. Not because it's the popular thing to say but because in spite of my small mind and imagined preconceptions it won me over almost immediately. It is in my opinion the greatest movie of all time. Masterpiece, legend, maverick are the appropriate descriptions. I'm still stuck in my preconceptions of Citizen Kane. How could I like a movie from 31? Hopefully I'll realize I don't know ahit and it'll also prove me wrong. Take care.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

See, like it's detractors in here, I had judged it as a boring artsy film for many years before I watched it. My skepticism was gone, replaced with wonder (sounds dramatic but I cant think of a better description) within the first insanely brilliant, creative first scene. I am not normally one to criticize opinions but this novie can be used a movie watcher's knucklehead awareness test. If you can't at least appreciate it, especially considering it's from 67 there's a 99% chance you don't understand beauty in film. And are therefore a knucklehead.

There is about 30 minutes of dialog or so stretched out over the entire movie (which also indicates how crappy the story must be), and most of the scenes just keep going and going without adding anything except maybe incredible boredom.

Some of Kubricks other movies, clockwork orange as my favorite, are also well directed and much more interesting. In Kubrick's defense, I can see that the effects in the movie, in '68, were likely awe inspiring but in time have unfortunately lost much of their splendor. Also, im sure many of you who do love this movie love it legitimately and everyone has and is entitled to their own opinion, some of the movies I love are not appreciated by many people, but I beleive that alot of people just say they love this movie so that they can seem more intelligent then the average movie viewer, who doesn't understand this movie.

1209,cereal_11,In defense of my favorite film,10,17 June 2002,"Few films in cinematic history have been as frequently dissected and analyzed as this Stanley Kubrick masterwork, so there is little one can say about the film hasn't already been said.  ""2001"" will reward it's patient, open-minded viewers with a truly mind-blowing philosophical experience filled with breathtaking visuals and unforgettable moments.  ""2001"" will bore those who are unprepared for it as well as those who are unwilling to approach it with a sense of wonder and imagination.  The film has already received an enormous amount of praise here on IMDB, with many people repeating what others have already said.  Since there aren't words to express how deeply I feel towards this movie, I will focus on trying to defend ""2001"" from it's countless enemies.Obviously, the most common criticism is that the film is ""boring"" or ""too slow.""  True, ""2001"" does have very slow pacing, and there are certain moments in which are downright tedious.  However, such exhausting moments are totally necessary to establish the mood and to immerse the viewer into the film by its sheer realism.  ""2001"" isn't like other movies.  It doesn't try to build suspense or thrill its viewer in the conventional style. Personally, I wouldn't edit out a single millisecond of the space flight scenes, dull as they are.Another complaint with the film is that the story is non-existent, therefore, there is no substance.  This isn't an easy movie to understand, even with repeated viewings, but it does have a storyline to decipher. Some have read Arthur C. Clarke's ""The Sentinel"" in order to figure it out.  If one is really confused as to what's going on, search the web for a 1969 Stanley Kubrick interview conducted by Joseph Gelmis.  Kubrick gives a straightforward explanation of the plot without going too deeply into the more subjective ideas and meanings behind the action.  If you're unwilling to come up with your own interpretation of the film, or if you're just curious to find out what the creator's intention was, I would definitely checking it out.About 30% of the ""2001"" comments on IMDB are made up of people who absolutely loathe this film.  Some of them, I'm sure, really did try to like this movie, but they don't know how to approach it.  Others might have figured that the film isn't ""hip"" or ""thrilling"" enough for them, so they refuse to appreciate it.  Others still may just lack the attention span or the patience to view a movie of this sort.  But for those who are unable to decipher the reasons as to why people love this film should definitely take a look at the positive comments on this movie.  After that, try watching the movie again, and approach it not with the mind of a cynical film buff, but with a sort of childlike wonder.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1210,bass1bone,Mystery Science Theater 3000....,1,30 June 2006,"And I quote from the back of the DVD packaging: ""....Kubrick brought complex ideas to the screen with astounding immediacy through dazzling special effects that won a much deserved Academy Award. Moving from the prehistoric birth of intelligence to the emergence of man as pure thought, ""2001"" is a remarkable achievement--'a quantum leap in quality over any sci-fi film ever made.'""Let us pause for a moment to ponder some key points in that blurb. 1. ""complex ideas...with astounding immediacy"" - I have no doubt that Kubrick was a very intelligent man, and that in this film he strove to bring complex ideas to the screen. And I can safely say that this film qualifies as a movie, in that it consists of pictures that move. But to be described as ""brought...to the screen with astounding immediacy,"" the said idea must be represented in some way that makes it either inescapable, urgent, or felt. I began this movie with an open mind, knowing that this is a movie of images, wanting always to ask myself why Kubrick chooses to show us the images he does. I finished the movie in the same state--I experienced no particularly strong emotional reaction to it besides utter confusion, and could fathom no answers to my repeated ""Why?"" 2. ""dazzling special effects"" - No question there. The effects for this movie were superior to those in Star Trek IV--a movie that was released 18 years later and had a greater budget and had the added benefit of the availability of the Industrial Light and Magic effects studio. 3. ""to the emergence of man as pure thought"" - Oh? So that's what that whole sequence at the end was about? The movie should have had the disclaimer: ""This movie contains some images which may not be suitable for children, as they are realistic depictions of the experiences of an LSD user."" The sad fact is that I could never have surmised from the images that the movie gave me that the movie's conclusion regarded man's ultimate destiny or ""the emergence of man as pure thought."" Experiencing this movie is akin to being shown a series of ink blots and asked, ""What do you see?"" Perhaps my worldview is different from Kubrick's; I'm not sure. But I do know that I was not moved, intellectually or emotionally, to any profound contemplations. Or perhaps my mind is not so willing to see profundity in a parade of plot less, characterless scenarios and psychedelic imagery as so many minds seem to be. Maybe this film had a logic all its own that I missed; maybe I'm just someone who is moved to genuine emotion by genuine emotion. But to me this movie lacked any semblance of sequential logic, and was certainly without genuine human emotion.In order to entertain myself during the movie, I began to guess aloud at what the images meant or were intended to provoke. This speculation, to my mind, bore a remarkable resemblance to Mystery Science Theater 3000. I will thus always remember ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as the movie in which I said the words, ""In space, nobody can hear you....fart.""",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1211,indraya,film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions,10,29 August 2002,"This movie is certainly one of the greatest films ever made. It is a story told in a steady pace, told mostly not by words but by cinematic means of expression. Perfect blend of spectacular special effects and classical music bring to life creations of human imagination in both realistic and poetical way. The story itself is quite simple at a first glance. As the title implies, there is an archetypal journey, a motive repeated for thousands of years. This motive was always used not only to depict a trip in space and time, and beyond, but also had rich philosophic meaning. The film is a poetical contemplation of most exciting eternal questions. It is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. The film is great by itself, yet, in my case, the impression from it will always be mingled with that from the book. I've read it at the age of 10, really not thinking about problems like 'what is the relationship between evolution of humankind and development of human morality'. But the impression was great enough to make me fall for entire genre of science fiction.The day I learned '2001' got only special effects Oscar and was not even nominated for the Best Picture was the day when 'Academy Award' completely became two words meaning nothing to me.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1212,johnahabig,Not Kubricks crowning moment,5,25 February 2015,I am usually the last person to detest slow pacing and minimal dialog and that bias helped me in viewing this film even so no other film will have you more spaced out mind wandering then wondering hey wait did I miss anything rewind and the first viewing the opening scene is a big wtf moment then watching it through a couple times it's like oh now I get it and symbolism is great in a movie but blink one time and it's like what the hell is going on. Good points are made about mans conquest curiosity superstition and territoratorial man is but it's more ambiance than substance Kubricks war films are better on a psychological and sociological element and have more practical studies in human emotion on film.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
1213,ezequiel2517,the cinema achieves its final goal,10,16 December 2002,"Hegel once said, of course I'm simplifying, that the final goal of art was to be able to express itself using only the means that define it. Therefore, painting had to express itself with colors and shapes, dancing with the movement of the body, music with sounds, etc. Nevertheless, painting was in Hegel's time far away from its final goal because what it did was just to tell a story in a paintings, it was just a variation of literature. Nowadays, it is the same thing with cinema which in Hegel's point of view, has to express itself with movement (because cinema is the art of the moving image, of course), and it is far, far, far away. But from time to time, it comes close from this final pourpose, and it is what happens in this superbe movie in the moments where the story stops and we just see images of a stunning beauty and poetry, particularly when we see the lunar base from the outside or when the astronaut is travelling through time and space and the images become really a symphony of movement and colours that speak for itself without coming near to telling you a story. What I am trying to say in my lousy English is that 2001 reaches a point never achieved before nor afterwards, to my knowledge. It becomes cinema in his more complete, pure and absolute way. Not a variation of literature, but the art of the moving image. Kubrick makes cinema come near to what it is supposed to be in its more evolved way, he becomes a sort of Kandinsky or Mondrian of the filmaking.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

There were glimpses of a great film, like Hal which ive already mentioned but even as a landmark film which i also agree it to be (in terms of special effects), Kubrick relys far too much on his skills with the camera and showing what he thinks is clever and not enough on the story. i mean the discovery of immortality was a joke i have 2 say. i just sat there and i said to myself ""is that it?""",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1216,HohesC,Cinema.,10,18 December 2011,"There is not much to say about this film, that has not been said before. It is a masterpiece. It was a revolution. It is wonderful.Why do I even review it? Because I would like to say something about whether or not it is a hype and why people often criticize the wrong things. And how people give the wrong answers toward the criticism.This movie is not being hyped. Mostly hypes do not last for decades, except you would still call classical music or the beatles a hype today. It just is that good. I was born almost 20 Years after it was released, so i may have seen better special effects. I may have seen science-fiction movies, some of them influenced by 2001, that were way more thrilling or had clearer message. I may not even call it the best film of all times. But thats it. Thats all criticism i can come up with. This film is excellent. It has aged like a good wine. It was a revelation to me, as it was to the generations of viewers who watched it before me. And it is not even about the philosophical themes or the mythology ( that is continued in the much more conventional but yet great 2010 ). It was a revelation about filmmaking and reception. It is one of those rare films that show you intensively that cinema can do more than just tell some stories. That film is more than just a way to illustrate something else.However, of course not everyone has to appreciate it. That does not mean that it is only for open-minded intellectuals, it is just such an intense work, that you cannot expect, that everybody likes it. As it is in music or fine arts, there will always be things you can respect, but you just do not like.But if you do not like it, at least show some respect. Do not call it a hype, only because you do not feel the need to spend two hours of your time with this particular piece. Try it and if it does not work just accept that you do not like it and go on to something else. Do not complain about the apes and count the minutes to tell others how boring it is.

1217,adrian-wallington,A Sweeping Science Fiction Epic Stands on its Own,9,3 June 2018,"A film I experienced many times on the small screen but first time at the cinema as part of a 50th Anniversary showing. It is an epic science fiction story with long, sweeping scenes and grandiose concepts that slowly builds tension. The score is powerful and often unworldly and where the cold, harsh environment of space or large landscapes were present, the music gives way to long silences, equally as moving.The abstract elements felt like lucid dreams and the whole film leaves so much work for the audience, it is a departure from the more generally visceral, fast paced and clear narrative of modern films. To place the film in context, which it deserves, this was released one year before man landed on the moon.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1218,pm-szostak,Humanity's fight with deadly boredom,2,23 October 2018,"This movie is long. Really LONG. And not just because it lasts 2,5h but rather because there not much in it. The few moments where anything happens may in fact be very artistic and full of deep meanings but there are so few of them and they're so far away from one another that it becomes difficult to even remember what they were half through the movie. This could be reduced to 30-40 minutes and would have lost nothing in the logicBut the most irritating thing are the prolonged scenes showing irrelevant thing happening. Like why do I need to watch the entire landing sequence for 5 agonising minutes?? I mean I got it - the ship is landing. No need to try and bore me to death. Then the lunar travel - again - they are travelling over moon. I get it. I got after like 15 seconds. Whot are the other 4 minutes for? Same with the Jupiter travel, same even with the jogging scene - I got, the man was jogging, do I need to watch his full cardio program for 5 minutes?? Jesus..If you are someone who wanted to watch this because it's on the ""All Time Greats"" list and someone told you it's good - don't bother.

1219,cskocik,The ONLY true science fiction movie,10,17 June 2004,"2001 is most emphatically NOT for Star Wars fans. It's the antithesis of all the Hollywood nonsense that have turned people away from science fiction and convinced people that sci-fi is no different from fantasy or improbable action movies. 2001 is about REAL space travel. It's about what it would REALLY be like if we found out there was intelligent life off the earth. It's about what Artificial Intelligence might REALLY be like. The fact that the year 2001 has come and gone and the movie didn't happen is irrelevant; everything in the movie is still plausible, and we could have the world it portrays in another twenty or thirty years. Computers are becoming more sophisticated and intelligent, we have the VASIMR engine, which is remarkably similar to the Discovery's plasma drive in the movie, and the Bush space initiative will have a base on the moon which may well be similar to the movie's Clavius Base. So many of Arthur C. Clarke's visions of the future have come to pass, and many of 2001's speculations have been matched by reality. The fact that a movie made in 1968 can still look so authentic and believable is the true litmus test of a good science fiction movie. Unlike most sci-fi movies, 2001 shows space travel as it really is -- no streamlined space fighters banking and zooming as if in the atmosphere or making whooshing noises in the vacuum of space. Space is realistically silent, spaceships cruise on predetermined orbits with their engines dark and silent except when delta vee is required, the hardware was developed in consultation with the aerospace industry, computer experts, and industrial firms, and actual JPL engineers designed the amazing spaceship Discovery and other vehicles. The subject matter is approached with the serious, sober attitude that it deserves. I don't think I've ever seen another science fiction movie that treated space travel with such immediacy. The dangers faced by the crew of the Discovery are the things real astronauts will -- and do -- have to deal with. The nervous breakdown of the infamous HAL-9000 computer has become legendary, but it's not the kind of cheesy mad computer stuff you find in scores of 70s movies. HAL has a glitch, and like every desktop computer, the glitch gets progressively worse as it goes undiagnosed and the computer remains operational. You can also look at HAL psychologically; subconscious feelings of guilt produce hypochondria and paranoia. Is HAL a character or a computer with a corrupt program? These are questions we will inevitably have to face someday. When Dave Bowman disconnects HAL, is he diverting the ship's control from an unreliable system, or is he murdering a shipmate? The whole storyline is done the way events would probably unfold; no laser battles, no explosions, no buff hero with sleeves cut off marching through smoky corridors with a ludicrous laser pulse weapon -- just a space suited astronaut, realistically weightless, armed with a screwdriver. Nothing in the movie is over-the-top or beyond what could really happen. Sometimes it's easy to forget that you're watching a movie; it seems more like C-SPAN footage of a real space mission.At the same time, though, it's so marvelously poetic and musically divine, no other sci-fi movie has ever conveyed so eloquently the wonder and beauty of space travel. The special effects still look utterly authentic today; when Cosmonaut Alexei Leonov saw the movie, he said, ""Now I feel like I've been in space twice."" Many people have been baffled by the ending, but I think most people appreciate the movie much more on subsequent viewings. I never had trouble ""understanding"" the movie, but that may be because I read the novel first. This movie is not about munching popcorn and wheedling away two hours; it's about serious contemplation of our future, about space travel, about the immensity of space and time, and about the possibilities that lie out there. It's more about real life than the world of movies -- which I guess is why we fans of the movie get so defensive when non fans attack it. It's the Citizen Kane of science fiction; the definitive thoughtful examination of its subject matter.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I had heard it was fantastic, but I had also heard it was incredibly boring. Well, let me say, after finishing watching this ripper, I felt like skinning anybody who ever said anything bad about this film. The Special effects are breathtaking. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is fantastic, and the film is absolutely magnificent! Though many people may disagree with me, I found this film to be absolutely terrifying! The music, HAL 9000, and my fear of the unknown led me to having nightmares of HAL singing ""Daisies"" And that soundtrack! oh my lord! The theme song! Requiem For Soprano! Some of the best music i've ever heard! And i've heard people call this film boring! Sure, it's slow, but boring? Hell No! By the middle I was absolutely mesmerized by it! I just couldn't tear my eyes awayStanley Kubrick's directing style also blew me away. You could tell he had an incredibly strong vision, and he just knew what he was doing. And 2001 was no fluke! all his other films are fantastic as well, though 2001 is still the best (In my opinion)n my opinion, 2001 is one of the best films ever made, and I recommend it to everybody who likes film!10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Having been raised on Star Wars and Trek I figured it was right up my alley... I couldn't have been more wrong.My main beef was the lack of content and the crypticness of it. I mean, who wants to watch a space ship slowly pass in front of the camera for an entire minute? Who wants to watch a bunch of people in monkey suits dance around a singing brick? I didn't even get where this movie was going until I read a summary online.I have to give it to the people of 1968 to pull off a feat such as this, but that's about the only good thing about 2001.

1222,souravdebbarma5,A movie a way ahead of it's time,10,9 June 2020,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a movie about evolution. This epic science fiction was written and directed by Stanley Kubrick. This movie is widely regarded as the greatest and most influential movie ever made. In spite of the fact that this movie was released in 1968, it has stunning visuals, mind-blowing storyline, and unique way of storytelling. Stanley Kubrick's epic 2001: A Space Odyssey has taken the traditional filmmaking into a different level. This movie is way ahead of its time. This movie even surpasses many popular science fiction movies like 'Gravity' and 'Interstellar' which were made 50 years later and had CGI computer graphics to enhance their cinematography!2001 story can be explained in many different ways: Our evolution, our discovery of tools, How we turn that tools into weapons, How we have become so powerful that we have lost control of our tools, How in space we are like infants once more learning to eat, etc.I loved the way the movie starts in the prehistoric times where apes used to live. Suddenly a black monolith appears before them. This monolith seems to start evolution among the apes. The apes learned how to make and use tools.Sound also plays a very important role in this movie. This movie is 142 minutes long. Hardly around 40 minutes in this movie shows the conversation between different actors. The first 20 minutes of the movie explains the evolution process of the apes. The remaining minutes show various space explorations.The existence of a computer Artificial Intelligence named HAL is awesome and it controls everything in the spacecraft and also talks to the crew and monitors their every move. The HAL 9000 series computer is very intelligent and fast. This movie shows how an A.I can overpower humans. HAL is so intelligent that he can read the lips of the two scientists when they were planning to disconnect him from the mission.Coming to its technical aspects, the cinematography by Geoffery Unsworth features some of the most memorable frames ever put to film. The scene where an ape throws a bone into the air and suddenly the next scene shows the view of outer space is breath-taking. This cut depicts the evolution of humankind from prehistoric times into the modern world. The sound design is amazing. There are many scenes where the director used only some visuals and background music.The last 20 minutes of the film is very confusing. I must say that to think about artificial intelligence, that too in the 1960s is way beyond imagination. There are few things which you might not understand when you watch it for the first time. You need to give it a second watch. This movie is a masterpiece. Thanks, Stanley Kubirk for making such an epic movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1223,IvanSamudra,Excellent,10,1 December 2014,"i recently saw Interstellar, and since that i couldn't stop thinking about this Piece of Art.this is one of the most brilliant movies i've ever seen, maybe one of the most important movie ever made (arguably one of the best sci-fi movie ever made), Kubrick is a genius, Extraordinary filmmaker. if you live in the year this movie released, you might think he's crazy, just because this movie is already far more advance than it should be. the visualization is great with the help of classical music, it's gives you intense and it brings the seriousness. the original score is great too though. some people might find this movie boring because it's kinda slow pace movie, Especially in the first twenty minutes. for me that's art and technical at the same time, the camera work, his vision of the future is just incredible. the special effect is awesome too (for 1960's movie is a breakthrough).i agree with one of the review here says ""One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood."" it's a perfect description.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1226,mvpharmcon,Why I became a scientist after watching 2001 Space Odyssey. It was that black screen as the film began to roll!,10,16 February 2014,"I remember sitting in the movie theatre back in 1968 as a young teen watching the black screen appear at the beginning of 2001; A Space Odyssey while transcendent music/vocals played, curious as to whether the absence of a visual cue was a technical failure or intentional? At the time, I failed to envision that the theatre viewing screen was proportionally the same length and width as the black monolith per Arthur C. Clark's expansive novel. Maybe its common lore, but it only just struck me last week, while I was watching 2001: A Space Odyssey on my own widescreen TV for the unknown'th time, that Stanley Kubrick was having his way with us during the Prelude. It is easy to envisage that we, the audience, were being ""educated"" by the black monolith before us as represented by the seemingly void, imageless screen. While some critics in 1968 panned the movie (Village Voice, NYT) others, and many still do today, and described it as boring and unimaginative, in fact Kubrick's juxtaposition of the laughably mundane and tedious daily life of an influental space traveller against most extraordinary cosmic events makes it a stunning achievement in science fiction moviedom that may never be repeated. In this matter, George Lucas has stated that it remains the Holy Grail of science fiction films. After all these years, 2001; A Space Odyssey still showcases Stanley Kubrick's most incredible ingenuity, imagination, and style in interpreting Aurthur C. Clarke's engrossing ideas. And he had his way with us a little bit too! The fact that 2001 came and went doesn't dampen my enthusiasm; every time I watch 2001; A Space Odyssey I am still back in that theatre in 1968 full of wonder at Kubrick's masterpiece.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I am sure in 1968 these computer generated scenes were a trip, but today they are so main stream. the whole time i was watching this in film class i wanted to grab the profs remote and fastforward it because it moves so slowly. and i know kubrick cut off like thirty minutes of this film, imho he should have cut off an hour more. the last twenty minutes is like a bad acid trip, and the whole idea of dan in a room, and the age progression, and the star child doesn't make any sense until you read what kubrik said about it....\ i don't know, just not my cup of tea.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1228,Klinoman,My Apology on Contemporary Philosophical Criticism,8,26 April 2016,"Throughout its entirety, the film offers a perfect balance of 'eye- candy' and musical superstructure. I have always admired the director's inert photography, though, in later works, he gradually abstracts from this signature camera work. Unfortunately, just like 'Interstellar' disappointed me in the ending (which was much more blunt and hand-guiding, even transforming from Sci-Fi to Fantasy), so did '2001: A Space Odyssey'.As the title of this review suggests, I will offer something that I couldn't find while searching for what I'd consider proper criticism. My offense will construct on a single point of the movie -- the apparent definition of 'god'. It is not a typo; there is a difference between 'God' and 'god'. What the movie suggests is that man shall rise in its evolution to a point of 'god', after it emerges as a 'God'. In the ending, we have a 'Star-child' which I can compare to 'Dr. Manhattan'. I'm not a big fan of superhero movies or of this character, but I think it's the best comparison I can make so you can understand. So, the Star- child's a being capable of manipulating reality beyond anyone's imagination, and yet, it isn't perfect.And now for my final statement against Kubrick's theory -- man's evolution is limited. To be clear, I'm not religious, but I'm not a fan of contemporary science either, because, like religion, it claims something that it doesn't offer. 'God' is a term that explains a being that seems to have a cheat-book, essentially different from the term 'god', which IS existence and perfection itself. The specimen of a creature that evolves can never become 'god', because it is a subject, an individual, a finite, fatal creature. To be one with all and all as one is a matter of objectivity, an eternal, all-knowing, infinite state. I admit that my philosophical theory(not really mine, just something I'm offering) is sweeping the chalk board, but it is, with great confidence, a legitimate criticism. Man cannot evolve to become god, because god is not a creature. In the latest take on thermodynamics, energy is depleting and destructible. If that is so, a state of metaphysical nihilism awaits existence. This piece is made long before these claims, so I can't really blame anyone involved in the film for claiming otherwise. Space is infinite, time is infinite and we... we are the opposite. That is why we even exist; because if we were gods we would be impossible.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1229,kristian_cooper,"phenomenal, groundbreaking a masterpiece.",10,7 October 2015,"A culturally significant masterpiece of its time. 2001 A space odyssey is quite possibly the greatest science fiction film (and book) of all time. When people mention the notion of space travel in film this movie arguably one of the greatest of the 20th century always springs to mind. Just the ideas and themes presented in this film are truly ground-breaking. Before we had Gravity, interstellar, star wars, we had 2001, the film that started it all. From the dawn of time sequence where the film begins we soon witness one of the most awkward plot changes in cinematic history. Suddenly we are thrust into outer space, into the modern era witnessing a spacecraft descending into a space station and we soon witness a group of astronauts on a journey to the planet Jupiter. Kubrick's attention to detail and predictions of future technologies were simply spot on. The video phone in the space station, recognise that? It's what we now know as Skype. There doesn't have to be a lot of dialogue for one to understand the very notion of what is happening during the film in fact at least half an hour of the film there is no dialogue whatsoever. I wouldn't even consider there to be a lead actor in the film, in actual fact the central character in this film happens to be an artificial intelligent being known as the ""HAL-9000"", the central computer that helps the crew control their ship en route to Jupiter. 2001 A space Odyssey set the benchmark for idea of 'Man Vs Machine' and these ideas were later evident in future works such as Bladerunner and Bicentennial man. Also we must remember this film was released before the days of flashy CGI style special effects yet the way Kubrick gave you the sensation of being in outer space was just awe inspiring. Not to mention quite possibly one of the most spectacular uses of Strauss's music in cinematic history. This film does everything a science fiction film should. It also was the first film to get all of the science behind space travel accurate. So if you haven't already done so, do yourself a favour and watch this groundbreaking, phenomenal film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I noticed that whenever there was a spaceship in frame with another object, the perspective seemed a little bit off from where it was supposed to be. Finally, when showing a spaceship and then showing people inside the spaceship, you could tell that the people behind the window were filmed in a separate shot, because it was often shaky compared to its surroundings.Sound Design: The sound is one of the things that really sells the atmosphere of the film. The soundtrack is a classic, everybody's heard it. In contrast to other films, the music wasn't used to make a suspenseful scene more suspenseful, it was to give the most important, human-focused scenes of the film a sense of importance, like in the LSD sequence at the end, and the weapon scene at the beginning. The sound design is what made the scene where Dave was disabling Hal extremely special, as well as amplifying the scenes characterized by the sound of breathing. Cutting between the rattling of the pods / space station and the silence of space was a genius choice. The chorus of male voices when characters approached the monolith was also a highly interesting sound.Acting: The only thing that really held the film back was the missed opportunities in a few scenes. Not having the actors do anything intense added to the almost hypnosis of the film and stayed consistent with the theme, but it was also strange for one astronaut to see his friend being hurdled out of the pod into deep space and hardly reacting. I excused the very low-profile acting in most cases, because it fit the politician/scientist/astronaut role very well, but if you compare that to a film like Interstellar, where the actors have realistic reactions to scary things, Dave seemed apathetic to Frank being ejected from his pod, which confused me, I was expecting more. For most of the film, the acting was pretty good but not special, which makes sense because the story didn't require it to be anything insane. However, Dave's re-entry into the ship up until he finally dismantled Hal was very well acted.Writing: You can probably guess most of my opinions about the writing. For any film to have as many possible interpretations as this one has, that's spectacular. To be able to write something that people can't settle on one interpretation of for fifty years, that's profound.Overall, this film is easily a 10 out of 10, and it is the best portrayal of the human condition in film that I have ever seen, heavily inspiring the movie Interstellar in that regard. Bravo, Stanley Kubrick. Bravo.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The musical score is amazing too, but those two qualities seem to be the only good thing about the film. I watch a ton of old movies, and I'm a fan of Stanley Kubrick respectively. But this film disappoints me to think that people claim it's his masterpiece. I almost fell asleep watching just the first 13 minutes of the film. And I'm not kidding you or exaggerating, I timed it. Literally I'd be better off just listening to the soundtrack with my headphones and I'd be satisfied just with that. At least then I can come up with a story that has a mixture of good effects AND an actual story I can be entertained of. I'd hate to say this about a film from a legend, but this is, by far, the worst film I've ever seen so far. There may be worse, but this one takes the cake... for now.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The special effects are still outstanding, especially when realizing they were made without any computer, in a time - one year before the first moon landing - in which mankind had not yet seen Earth from space. The imagery is fantastic, and the story is mind-blowing. This is not a standard SF-movie with a predictable speedy storyline and a clear answer in the end; if you expect such a movie then do not watch it. It is a movie that shows space travel how it really is, made in a time when people were still fascinated by it and full of hope, with an intense experience that is truly alien and beyond our imagination. If you watch it for the first time, then watch it on a screen that is as large as possible and open yourself for a great cinematic experience.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1239,bill-36865,A Space Odyssey is actually A Life Journey - Death orients us to find itself!,9,4 July 2018,"Stanley Kubrick, a master of hiding metaphor in scenes and manipulating ambient musics, once again, hits the movie industry and sets a milestone in movie history. Though 2001 tells a slow story, in contrast, it gives us more time and breath to savor the scene and its meaning hid inside.The most pondering metaphor, out of question, is an alien black monolith in tombstone-like shape which is also the reason why the odyssey is commenced. Than I realize the odyssey is actually a human's life journey! Death, represented by the monolith, orients us to find death itself!Let's simply call the monolith, 'the stone'. First, the tombstone-like shape apparently implies the death, yet 2001 doesn't just conclude on it. In the film, the stone first appeared in Cenozoic period when apes, our ancestors, live. Upon the stone emerging, the apes, being startled at first, start caressing it. This means if a new species evolves, death, indeed, befall it, including human, and that every species holds death in awe. Than the second appearance of the stone is found on the moon, which is also classified. People know nothing about it except its radioactive emission aiming at Jupiter. Hence, the stone guides a crew of five people toward Jupiter to find the answer or more clues. However, the stone on the moon is classified, the crew doesn't know anything but only hears of something. Finally, Dr. Dave, one of the crew, learns the whole thing from a video while in the logic center of Hal which is an A.I. computer. What's under the stone on the moon is, instead of a corpse, an unconfirmed life waiting to be awakened! After learning it, Dave keeps flying toward Jupiter and suddenly gets himself in a time-and-space travelling which stops in a tidy and fancy room. He is stuck in the room, leaving himself getting older and older. Finally when he is struggling to hold the last breathe, the stone shows up in the room. Dave dies and a new life is awakened.Life journey starts from birth and ends in death because we consider life linear. However, what if life is actually cyclic? Than there's no more need to separate birth and death! Hence, in this cyclic life journey, not only do we gradually step toward death, but it is also death that sets us to find itself! Just like the stone which Dave starts and ends! And as we continuously pass through 'this death point', we are dead and born, again and again.2001 is not only a space odyssey but also a journey of life! Both of them are cyclic and endlessly circulate. These rules apply both on the biggest universe and on the smallest human's life!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1243,p-flaherty,I'd rather kill you than let you kill me,10,8 April 2006,"""2001, A Space Odyssey"", is Stanley Kubrick's Masterpiece in a list of masterpieces (Dr.Strangelove, Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut, Lolita, etc.),which combined places him in the exalted role of ""greatest filmmaker of all"". This 2001 extended journey within man's existence, and into degrees of space, still seems to stand atop everything made in film history despite 37 years passing since it's release. It travels from the beginning of man's evolution through apes, to modern day space-walkers, in the blink of an ape-man's tool. And with the help of a silver monolith, possibly planted on Earth by ancient Alien visitants to trigger intellect in future humans, a trip that takes millions of years to evolve is unleashed. The apes learn about the use of power through weapons, how they can gain property, and how to kill their fellow creatures through violence. Thus four million evolutionary years later, and not that much wiser, the intellect that was released has brought them from apes to moon-dancers. Of course the astronauts are still eating slaughtered packaged meat as they ride to investigate another monolith that has been discovered buried on the moon. Things change . . . things stay the same.Everything is brilliantly done up through the 2nd monolith's arrival, including wonderful choices and uses of music and silence, but the most interesting, calculating character in the movie is waiting to be introduced. The new monolith is pointing to Jupiter, and a human mission is sent to explore the giant planet under the supervision of Hal, an extremely intelligent computer who is put in charge of the entire expedition. While most of the spacemen are in a hibernated state, Hal interacts with the few that are awake (chrushing them at chess), as he runs the entire ship.But . . . Hal begins to make mistakes, and here's where Kubrick combines inner and outer space and elevates his movie beyond simple adventure. The astronauts realize that Hal has to be shut off, and of course Hal (who is a monster at lip reading) realizes that they will try to do just that. He begins one by one to kill the astronauts air supply, rather than be put down himself . . . just as a logical egotistical mind, that is caught making mistakes by the inner man, will try to destroy a person's body and suppress the truth rather than allow itself to be quieted. It takes a man of immense will and a calm deliberate approach to dis-engage the ego in both spaceship and in a human being, and this role goes to Keir Dullea, the astronaut who both physically and symbolically breaks down the doors blocking the essence of the ship's mission, and man's mission into the future.Once Hal is placed under control, the truth is revealed . . . and man's evolution rises into the next step and beyond . . . seemingly transcending both time and space.When this movie was released it created much confusion and didn't get the critical acclaim it receives today. It's slowly unfolded into our consciousness because it's really the story of man's entire history and of our individual personal lives and dreams rolled into one......a work of genius, that continues to stand the immense test of time in an art medium that re-invents itself continually.Hats off to you Stanley Kubrick.........a work unequaled.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1245,Cain47,Nietzsche and 2001,10,16 November 2001,"I'm always surprised, given that the famous title track of 2001 is called ""Also sprach Zarathustra"", that nobody (nobody I've read, anyway) has noted the parallels between the movie and Nietzsche's famous work, ""Also sprach Zarathustra"". The idea of man's rebirth into a star child; an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being, is an explicit part of N.'s ""Zarathustra""; there is a prominent passage called ""On how a camel becomes a lion, and a lion becomes a child"", in which N. describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child, transcending both the ascetic, altruistic side of man (the camel; always asking to bear more weight) and the rapacious, brutish, will-to-power side of man (the lion). The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence. And also, Zarathustra said that ""man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman."" The structure of the movie fits that description: a brief history of man as beast, until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason, then a long sequence about man (the rope, as it were), and then a brief glimpse of the overman. The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred, and the suggestion that an external force caused them, is also Nietzschean; in ""Zarathustra"", he makes it pretty clear that he doesn't have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider (Zarathustra) to show us how to ""go under"". Bowman's psychedelic sequence at the near-end could be seen as Kubrick's best 1960's-style attempt at depicting the mystical ""going under"".I know these parallels are pretty broad, and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that I have not personally seen it. But I just wanted to mention them, if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher. Few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy, and it is in my opinion, explicitly and unmistakeably Nietzschean. The case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of ""Zarathustra"" updated for the modern age. Feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to Nietzsche.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Its pretentious, deliberately confusing and most importantly, suicidally boring. You may call me a philistine, but i can appreciate art when i see it. In this, i'm afraid i see no art.

Probably one of the first serious sci-fi movies. Some may even consider this a religious movie. That's what make it so original. There are so many themes that the movie is able to touch everyone in a different way. After the first time I saw this movie, I could not get it out of my head. I enjoyed it so much because a lot of it was left to the viewer. The meaning of the mystical ending can mean something different to everyone. There are not many movies like that. I now own a copy of 2001 in wide screen format which just has unbelievable detail to it. Even after so many years the quality of it is unmatched. Plus, what a great soundtrack. I enjoyed every Kubrick movie, but this one is my favorite. Probably my favorite movie of all time!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1249,sldmseen,"Silence, Space, and God",8,28 May 2000,"Most of the reader reviews here, as you see, gush with praise for what is now a stock Sci-Fi masterpiece.  There are, though, occasional exceptions. And this is good, since I think almost all great movies are characterized partly by having a large number of proponents and minority of vehement detractors.  Both sides have been provoked by something in this film. That's greatness in a nutshell.I think they're provoked by a number of things in this film.  First of all, there are the profound, extended silences.  Kubrick stuck deliberately to the physical and auditory realities of the situations during the film, sometimes choreographing them to classical music for an enhanced effect of synchronicity, hinting at unseen organization even before he presents it on-screen at the climax.Then there's the clean, spare imagery.  Not only in when Floyd goes to the Moon, but also the Discovery trip.  There's even a certain cleanliness to the ""Dawn of Man"" prelude in it's desert landscape.  Compare this to the dystopic, ""dirtier"" imagery of films like ""Blade Runner"" or ""Star Wars"", action films which have proven more popular.  Such ""Star Trek""-like cleanliness gives us something both to aspire to and to fear.  Will life really be that straightforward and simple?Lastly, of course, is the film's unwillingness to explain itself to the audience, a much-derided aspect of it.  This I understand.  Most people go see or rent a film to sit, relax, and be entertained.  This gripe is the same gripe some people have against subtitled foreign films.  They want to watch a movie, to relax, not to read or think or confront the philosophical issues that many when this movie came out (1968) were beginning to come up against regarding space and our relationship to it.What would happen when we went to the moon, as we were so obviously about to do at that time?  Would we find God?  Would there be a limit to how far we would be allowed to permeate heaven?  Viewed through the lens of its time, this film remains a deeply moving examination of our fears and hopes in the modern age.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1250,psychocosmic,Elevating Tool of the Mind,10,19 June 2000,"Gosh! There are over 200 comments on this film! What can I say? Who will read this? Anyway after have been reading almost all comments, some very excellent and full of insight, on a late night cruising on the internet I felt very much to see this my favorite movie once again. When I was about 18, I- a solitare searcher, entered a huge cinema here in stockholm to experience this feature which had managed to been repeatedly shown once a year since `68. ""-The movie that became a religion"" said the taglines. When the lights was turned on again I was simply illuminated. At last I have seen a film by someone that spoke to me directly as in a wordless language from mind to mind. This was for me. And I laughed, because I ""understood"" it completely. From the Dawn-prologue to the Great Transformation in the end. I was turned on, high from this journey of infinite information and poetry, not on any psychedelics. I suddenly turned my sight to the rest of the audience. Surprise! Most of the faces around me looked bitter and disappointed. They didnt seem to have an idea of what they have been witnessed. Then I felt that I was someone special. Everytime I have seen it I have encountered new thoughts in my head, new implications. The strangest thing about the film is, besides that it ever was alloud to be made, that it wasnt banned officially. But its too open for different explanations, religios and ateistic, to be seen as a threat itself. Because I know now, as I have understood who Kubrick was, that 2001 IS the Monolith! Kubrick knew that in this world called Earth, there is something very enigmatic about Our Evolution. Something weird about the whole thing which both links us with the rest of Life here AND seperates Us from it. We are the monsters but can also be the Gods. And the closer we come to the fearsome answer the more we start suppressing it. Our harmonic relationship with the environment in our early evolutionary stages was interrupted by flashes of sudden information that created Culture but also confusion and Fear. Fear creates aggression and violence. The evolution of Culture is never explored by Kubrick because he wanted to focus on the story on the technical advancement opposite the nonprogressive Mind of Man. Those guys in space never seem to understand anything about themself until they meet the next Monolith. This is the story of the most forbidden source of information and tool for progression of Understanding about the Loss of Fear to gain Peace between Us and Everything else in the Universe. And technics alone - without Enlightment, as the tool HAL never need to inherit moral codes of A Humans Spirit, always leads to selfdestruction directly or indirectly. Bowmans subjective journey through the wonders of the universe, his Lifeend and finally his transformation to a new elevated Entity was the result of his going through the Big Trip - all the way. The forbidden Apple was not exactly an apple in reality but where it came from and how it got here is the next questions to find out about. Well, this was my oppinion about this mindaltering film which is much more than a film. Its a statement, philosophical and poetic and I how can I thank the Late Mr Kubrick enough for letting me experience the void of space, the birth of stars and nebulas and the Great Beginning of Our Own Future? Where else can we go, if not to destroy everything that has existed here for 5 billions of years? The most Optimistic and Visionary film ever concieved.

1253,goc-5,Warning ! Do under NO circumstances see this film. It sucks !,1,11 December 2000,"This is THE worst movie I have ever seen, and believe me - I have seen a lot of crappy movies ( like Ghostdog ). So what is so fundamentally wrong with this movie ? First of all I believe that a movie should tell a story, and this story should be compelling, realistic and fully understandable. This is where it fails. The movie doesn't tell a story. And it takes about 2,5 hours not telling this story. You could just as well just sit around and watch your TV when it's turned off. It's just as interesting.The movie begin with a bunch of monkeys jumping around. Then they jump around a black rock. Then they jump with a bone in their hands. This is the first 30 minutes of the movie ! Fortunately I have read the first 150 pages of the book, so I understood why they did all of this. But someone who has never read the book would never have a chance of understanding this.Then suddenly we're in space. And we spend 15 minutes watching a ship dock with a spacestation ( doing your laundry is more fun than this). After that there actually is a bit of a plot. We follow a guy as he travels to a spacestation on the moon, where they have found a new black rock that emits a powerful electromagetic radiation. After they have gone down to this rock, the plot make another leap to something totally different.Suddenly - without an explanation - we're on a ship that's headed for jupiter. There we spend over 1 hour watching a computer go a little nuts.After they find the third black rock we get to see 10 minutes of strange colors. Then it ends in someones strange livingroom.This movie is so slow, and wierd, and not to mention BAD - that it shouldn't be allowed to exist.

1256,Neon-man,"Great effects, great pacing, great acting, great movie!",10,13 August 2007,"If there's one thing the general mainstream movie audience don't have, it's patience. They want their movies fast, loud, tightly edited and a storyline so complicated and tangled up, it just might strangle you. This is evident from this year's block-busters such as Spiderman 3, At World's End, and Transformers, all of which display the traits stated above. I was growing sick of it, so in this time I headed off Video Ezy to rent out (which I ended up buying for $13) 2001: A Space Odyssey. This movie is most definitely slow, requires patience and tops the above movies by far, despite being released 39 years ago. Although 2001 is regarded a great sci-fi movie and pops up around the middle of many Top 100 list of movies, it was first received as too slow as well as too incomprehensible. This is exactly what the writers and director wanted the audience to feel and knowing the audience's reception, it was a daring move to make the movie like they did.To give you an idea of how slow the movie is, the first 25 minutes of the film and the last 23 minutes of the film contain no dialogue. This movie is not driven by story, it is done by beauty. Each shot is perfect, which is fitting given the director Stanley Kubrick was known as Hollywood's most perfectionist director (that is until I'll come in). Being the time-sets of this movie show us the past and future, but not the present, the audience is always being shown something unfamiliar, something that whilst the characters walk past casually, we admire the worlds we are being presented to. The waltz music also helps.The set design and special effects are more talented and more cleverer than those of today. You may be surprised to hear me say this, with CGI and digital shots used aplenty in sci-fi and action movies of today. But today, they are usually only used to make something seem realistic. In 2001, they are used to make something look beautiful or awe-inspiring. Also given that film-makers didn't have a great array of special effects at their hand back in pre-Star Wars 1968. Clever film-making and camera trick needed to be used to convince audiences a pen was floating or a man was running along a wall. These techniques are better than CGI any day. As for the psychodelic light journey near the end of the movie, it needs to be seen to be believed. Such amazing light spectacles makes the audience feel like they're in some sort of sicko Disney-Land ride.If you want some sort of storyline from 2001, then it comes sometime after the hour mark. Two spacemen, Dr. Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) are on their way to investigate Jupiter, whilst testing cryogenic sleeping. Their mission is guided by the super-computer HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain). HAL betrays the two space-men when they decide to unplug the super-computer. There's more, but I don't want to give too much away. It'd be better to watch this film without having a clue about the synopsis. Though I will talk about HAL. HAL is a polite, intelligent and possibly suave computer. He is supposedly reliable, but Dave and Frank soon find out the super-computer is not all he's cracked up to be. HAL is disturbingly human, much more so than Microsoft Sam. Though he may be able to betray, he has no conscience, does not fear consequence, which makes HAL one of the most interesting and most deadly and most parodied villains in cinema history (behind Darth Vader).2001: A Space Odyssey is a movie to be seen in a dark room at night, on the best TV available and be prepared to have your retina the time of its life (come the 2 hour mark of the film). 2001 is lavish with brilliant effects, flawless set pieces and designs and every shot is shot to perfection. Remember to be patient during this film. Space travel is tedious for the characters in this film, but to you hopefully is something much more marvellous. Don't expect everything to come together in the end, because it doesn't. Have an open mind to this film and don't interpret it literally, like you would with the movies stated at the beginning of this review (with the exception of the beginning of At World's End. That was like a David Lynch film). 2001 is slow, but fast enough to present its beauty and creation. Rating: 9.6/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The presence of classical music is too heavy so that you feel you are at the New year's day concert in Vienna and these scenes of spaceships that land, take off, fly, whatever are truly baroque.It's no point in discussing techincal computer-related matters either since they are completely out of date 30 years later (punch cards...hehehehehe).",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1258,francoescamillaclips,A nerve wracking chess game.,10,11 September 2020,"I went to see this movie on theaters recently and, oh dear, has it been a unique experience.
This movie is really silent. It takes its time to slowly build a full synopsis and it slowly becomes more claustrophobic and tense, and it's all because of the silence, an incredible use of silence.
The environment is peaceful, but the tension in the air puts you on the edge of your seat and makes you wonder what will happen next.
Just go see it. It's one of humanity's best accomplishments in cinema. You won't regret it, trust me.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1259,ghosthawk5,visual condensation of humankind's evolution amid the stars,10,3 May 2001,"If you haven't seen this movie by now then you must be living on Mars. 33 years after its release 2001 can still generate controversy and comment. On this web site alone 300 + reveiwers have made some very enlightening remarks and insights into what is still regarded as one of the all time best movies around. Most of the comments have been in the positive sense with a few exceptions. When 2001 came out in Apr 1968 man had still not yet landed on the Moon. The film garnered equal praise and harsh criticism. Scientists loved the idea of 'Hal' the artificial intelligence computer, essentially the central character of the movie and Hal's amazing capabilities. But critics argued that the film was confusing and fragmented, lacked any coherent storyline. Sometimes you come across cinematic art that demands more than just a passive sitting back and sensually aborbing its content, 2001 is one of those movies that demands your attention and is best thought of in reflection and contemplation. It communicates by many different means, allegory, symbolism, motif.One of the most interesting comments I ran across was the cryptic remark of a German reviewer who stated that"" 2001 IS the monolith"". What does this really mean? Rather than go through a brief explanation of the sequence of the film I suggest if you haven't seen it, rent it now and come back here for more interesting tidbits. Kubrick never fully explained his movie but always suggested that people 'experience' it rather than analyse its workings. Humans being what they are chose the latter probably unsatisfied with the simple 'experience' mode of viewing it. There are two scenes in the movie which are justaposed to each other and separated by 4 million years of time. The first scene involves a small family of Chimpanzees who are unceremoniously ousted from their waterhole by an overly aggressive band of renegade chimps. The ousted group would have died off without water until the mysterious presence of a monolith-like device appeared without warning in their midst. After its appearance one of the banished chimps 'discovered' that a femur bone could be used as both a weapon and an aid to survival. When the banished chimps come back to the heavily guarded water hole they are armed to the teeth to challenge back their only means of survival. By killing the renegade ringleader all the other aggressive chimps disappear unable to defend themselves from the new"" bone weapons"" used against them. 4 million years forward and we have a similiar fight for survival involving a computer intelligence and a human in space.The computer has killed off all the astronaut's companions and has now shut out the lone survivor, Commander Dave Bowman, from the spaceship Discovery. In fact what the computer Hal has done is handed Bowman a death sentence. Bowman needs oxygen to survive and he has a limited supply on board his pod. Faced with a computer that will not obey his commands he winces for a few minutes and then miraculously comes up with a plan to get on board the Discovery. The computer reminds him that he has forgotten to don his helmet and going through the escape airlock would be rather difficult, if not impossible to accomplish. But Bowman does the impossible outwits the computer and regains control of the craft just like the ousted chimps regain control of the waterhole. In the second scene there is no monolith in sight to 'assist' Bowman. However comments in the past about 2001 recognise the monolith as representing God, and therefore God assists the chimps elevating them to the stature of humans through ' divine intervention' if you like. But notice two elements linking the scenes, water and oxygen. These are two of three essential elements for human survival, the third being, food. What better way to link all three elements than to have the characters in space constantly eating all sorts of edibles (""tastes like chicken, Yeah, they're getting better at it all the time""). From the spaceflight commanders to the space stewardesses,from the astronauts Poole and Bowman to Dr. Floyd forgetting about zero gravity and his food tray, food abounds everywhere in the middle segment of this movie. These are our basic needs for minimal survival, if we are deprived of any of these we will eventually die. If we look again at what leads up to the second titanic scene between man and computer we get another insight into something much more disturbing. Hal controls all aspects of the ship and engages readily with the crew answering any of their questions. Its simply my contention that Hal believing that it was a' conscious entity' makes an independent thought about its position in the mission to Jupiter. Hal decides that it is superior to any of the crew under its serviance and any humans past ,present or future. The reasoning Hal uses is pure logic to reach this conclusion. Hal somewhere in the middle of  a yet again 'unstimulating' game of chess with one the astronauts, Poole (water again) decides to rid itself of all human cargo and proceed to complete the mission by contacting the monolith itself. Bowman and Poole do not know of the existance of the monolith but are on board to assist in the mission and help revive the 3 hibernated scientists on board. Hal not only knows about the monolith but somehow understands its importance and the importance of the mission to be completed. So the computer sets a trap for Bowman and Poole and makes the brilliant deduction that the astronauts will rationalise that Hal is in error at predicting a faulty AE35 high gain antenna device. What Hal is doing is playing 'chess' with the crew members lives. Its heady stakes in space. When  mission control tells the astronauts that Hal is in error predicting the fault because a replica Hal 9000 unit on earth says the AE 35 unit is not faulty, Poole smirks , and asks Hal to account for the earth simulator's diagnosis. What Hal says next is so earth shattering that the entire movie pivots on the answer. ""I attribute it to human error"", Hal intones confidently, ""Its always been human error, it always will be"". The crew miss the cryptic message in the statement, ie. computers are perfect, humans will always be in error, so why should humans make the contact with the monolith, it should be the computer Hal, a superior conscious entity. The crew are baffled by the statement but sense something is wrong and decide to unplug Hal before its does something serious to the ship and themselves. Some scientists worry that the progression of computer technology is getting out of control, or more specifically out of human control. The speed of computation today now streaks ahead of human ability to digest and assimilate the raw data that these machines produce. Could there be a a point where we, as a species, lose all control to the computers and then become subservient to them. That day will come , maybe not in our lifetime, but it will come.Hal knows what Bowman and Poole are up to and 'checkmates' them effortlessly adding to its confidence as a superior conscious entity. Hal knows about another superior conscious enity, the monolith. However Hal does not fathom the depth by which the need to survive is embedded in the human psyche. Bowman succeeds by using his training , resourcefulness, mobility and something much more important, both sides of his brain, the irrational with the rational. Bowman takes command of the ship and reestablishes human superiority over its own technology. In other words humans have reached a stage in evolution whereby they are primed and ready for the encounter with an alien intelligence. But remember I said that some audiences gave the monolith the symbolism of God. If you substitute Hal with God and the discovery ship with the earth  and play the sequence again you get an astonishing piece of revelation. God stops humans from , what? becoming superhumans. This is the Nietsche principle that is order for man to become superman, God must die. In order for us to evolve we will probably have to jettison all religions to do so. That's a radical idea, it was in the German philospher's time, it is today. But an even more stunning revelation awaits us if we follow the pure logic of this. Man creates machines/computers. If Hal is substituted with God then ,by Aristotelian logic,man CREATED God. Therefore man will REVERT back to God in the future. Should lightning ever strike me down with this notion then I'll know I was wrong.Kubrick was cryptic to say he hoped  nobody would find any meaning in his film. I think this was also a clever experiment to see if the audience could come up with some personal meanings that would set a trigger going in everybody's mind. If we could recognise something in the movie that Kubrick was trying to convey by non- verbal means, something that was recognisable to us at sometime in our evolution. Well lets try this, the monolith again could be something else, something that most people readily can connect with.If we substitute monolith with trilithion and then mention the word Stonehenge. If we mention IBM and computers and Stonehenge and the year 1964, some of us will get the connection. In 1964 a researcher using an IBM mainframe (IBM is one of the commerical logos used on the Hal machine in the movie) discovered alignments to various stars,Sun and Moon etc. The whole episode created incredible controversy at the time between scientists and this was a year or two prior to 2001 coming out. Computers and monoliths (3 in the movie, or the same one 3 times, trinity religious motif), computers and trilithions (3 stone uprights) . If you want to garner more fun with numbers why not zero in on the number of astronauts on board the discovery , five, 3 in hibernation and Bowman and Poole, 5 is  the mumber of man. Seven tetrahedral shapes accompany Bowman to the Jupiterian surface, 7 is the mumber of perfection and a number associated with divinity/sacredness. We can also see that there are three separate alignments shown dealing with the monolith. In the Chimp sequence, when the monolith appears, the sun crests over its rim and behind that the New Moon is shown. In 2001 on the Moon itself, the monolith there exhibits the same alignment only this time the cresented light source has to be a 'New Earth' since this is viewed from the Moon's surface. When Bowman journeys to land on Jupiter we see the final alignment which consists of 6 spheriods including the surface of Jupiter. Then the monolith inserts itself into this alignment emphasising the number 7 again; perfection. As stated above by saying '2001 IS the monolith' means that forbidden (hidden) knowledge awaits us when we view the movie. Ask yourself this final question, why do we , as a species, have the URGE to explore?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1260,mhollibaugh_2001,A landmark film in science fiction.,10,7 April 2007,"I vaguely remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1968. I was only 7 years old at the time, and it was at a drive-in theatre. When I asked my mother about it many years later, she said that as far as she could recall, it didn't seem to her I had been bored by the movie -- an amazing thing considering many adults find the movie boring.Even after having seen and been wowed by the special effects in Star Wars (I saw it 11 times in the theatre during its original run) and being amazed by the special effects in Jurrasic Park, I still say 2001 is the best science fiction movie ever made.As an adult I do not understand a lot of the philosophy of the movie but have been able to discern enough to figure out that it probably doesn't agree with my view of ""life, the universe and everything."" That still doesn't change my opinion about the movie. Considering it was made in 1968, the special effects are astounding and surpasses many of today's science fiction films. It's a great movie that set the standard for films to come.One last comment. I recommend 2001 fans to read Arthur C. Clarke's book ""The Lost Worlds of 2001."" It explains a lot of things about the movie and offers some interesting insights into how the movie and the book came into existence. It also includes Clarke's short story ""The Sentinal"" from which the idea for the movie, and again, the book, came.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Indian successful hibernation is still the biggest problem in space travelling which was very well predicted by the movie.the only problem with the script is that the story line was missing the beginning and the end scenes doesn't make much of a sense and beginning part was not much informatica the first half of the movie was not very much understandable that's why more than 250 people walk out of the theatre during the very first screening of this movie.,2001 - A Space Odyssey

To my big surprise, when I type in IMDb.com to see what other people think about this one, everybody seem to love ""2001 - A space odyssey"". How is it possible? OK, I admit it is beautifully made and it was the start of a sience-fiction-era which probably have inspired many directors, but the fact it's so boring is carrying greater weight, and the space-scenes doesn't save the film at all! Perhaps I'm born in the wrong time. Perhaps all of you who saw it in the premiere are feeling nostalgia, or something like that. But I downloaded it now in 2007 and watched it directly after the download was finished and I hated it! It's strange! Kubrick ALSO directed my favorite film of all time, ""A Clockwork Orange"". Therefore, I forgive him for making this ridiculously bad one. God rest Kubrick's soul, and don't watch 2001, watch A Clockwork Orange instead, which in Kubrick shows his better sides as a director!

You don't understand it not because it's overly complicated, but because you are put before a force so far beyond you that your mind simply can't grasp it. It's a truly humbling experience that I've never felt in any other movie.Ending aside, thanks s movie is amazing and truly looks into the horror of being in the void of space.

That doesn't mean that reading the book before hand will guarantee that you enjoy the movie, though, as I read the book, knew what was happening in the movie, and still found the movie to be awful.  I admit, however, that the film was creative and was a new experiment in filmmaking; unfortunately, that experiment failed.  It is one of those movies that seems like it should be good just because of its inventiveness and its supposedly ""masterful"" director.  The basic plot itself is good, but Kubrick tried to do too much with it, and in the process turned an intriguing story into an incomprehensible two hours of disjointed, frustrating, and boring film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1271,Juliabohemian-1,Dave's not here man,8,20 September 2007,"The movie opens with 20 minutes of darkness, so don't adjust your TV. A bunch of monkeys, supposedly early humans, are shown interacting with one another when a mysterious monolith appears. Then the monkeys suddenly can walk upright and realize that they actually want to beat the stuffing out of each other. They also evolve so that they could use tools, shed their fur and start trading stock. Way in the future... I imagine that 2001 must have seemed like a long way off when Clarke was writing the book. His vision unfolded about as realistically as Orwell's 1984, but I'll save that for another rant.Being that this movie was made in the 60's, Clarke's version of the future didn't include gender equality, because there were plenty of tightly dressed females in positions of subservience throughout the picture. Some astronauts find a monolith on the moon. When the sun shines on it, it makes a high pitched sound, much like the one Jim Carrey makes in Dumb and Dumber. Another monolith is found orbiting Jupiter, and someone assumes the two were connected.The press wants to know what happened up in space, but no one will tell them. Apparently, Clarke didn't foresee the media having total control over everything in the future, either. Good thing he wrote some more books, later on.Some more guys were sent up into space, to investigate. Of course, no one actually tells them about the monolith, because that would make too much sense. The HAL 9000 computer, who by the way, is the most likable character in the film, next to the monkeys, is responsible for maintaining the safety of the crew and it's ship. Unfortunately, HAL is a few fries short of a Happy Meal and has an agenda of his own.HAL expresses some trepidation about the mission. Of course, it helps that HAL actually knows what the mission is about, since the crew obviously doesn't. HAL probably realizes that poking the monolith is a bad idea, since we don't actually know what it is, and it's likely to poke back.Dave and Frank, cleverly hide in one of the pods and try to talk about HAL behind his back. Naturally, they forgot that HAL can read lips. Humans really are just monkeys without fur. Once the two men were alone together in the pod, they couldn't think of anything worthwhile to say. The conversation actually went something like this...""What do you think about the mission?"" ""I don't know. What do you think about it?""""So, HAL computers don't make mistakes do they?"" ""Nope, they're infallible."" ""Okay, just checking.""Seriously, I've heard more convincing verbiage in a Budweiser commercial. Men don't talk like that about anything. They discuss their bowel movements with more enthusiasm. Maybe in this particular future, males are all civilized and introspective. But, they're still monkey's without fur. So, it probably should have gone something like this...""Great, now HAL can't hear us. What's the plan, Frank?"" ""I don't know, Dave, but this mission is totally bogus. They send us out here into space without telling us why. We should shut HAL down and get the heck out of Dodge. I don't care how good the medical benefits are.""""I'm with you so far."" ""Hey...you don't think he can read our lips in here, do you?"" ""No, Dave. He's a computer."" ""Right, what was I thinking?"" HAL goes medieval on the crew and kills them all, except Dave, who's his favorite. He must not have liked Frank very much, because he gets his hose cut and goes flying into space, like an untied party balloon.HAL refuses to let Dave back into the ship, after he goes out to rescue Frank. Dave ends up going in the old fashioned way, by jettisoning himself through the safety hatch at tremendous speed.Once back in, Dave shuts HAL down and only after we have to listen to HAL sing and whine about how his mind is going, do we get to find out why these dudes were in space to begin with.Dave pushes some high-tech looking buttons and a message pops up on screen: ""Oh...by the way, kids, we found a big, black rectangular thing on the moon and it's sending radio transmissions to Jupiter. There's another black, rectangular thing orbiting Jupiter. We think these things hold the secrets to life, the universe and everything, and we didn't tell you sooner because we didn't want to compromise the security of the mission. Have fun on Jupiter. Let us know how it all turns out."" Dave goes to Jupiter, the monoliths line up and Dave has a psychedelic experience involving a bunch of flashing, colorful lights. It's quite impressive, if you consider this was made almost ten years before the formation of ILM. I highly recommend that people stay away from the LSD while watching this film.After his ""trip"" Dave finds himself in a antiseptically clean house with Regency style furnishings. He sees himself eating dinner as a middle-aged man, dying in his bed as an elderly one, and then as a fetus, overlooking Earth. Then, the credits come on. So glad the ending tied everything together for me, because I was really lost up until then.As an added bonus, there's another twenty minutes of darkness after the credits, allowing the soundtrack to play in it's entirety.It's worth watching just for the early special effects, cinematography and musical score, which includes ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" and a bunch of funky vocal pieces by a Romanian guy named Ligeti that you really shouldn't listen to if you are home, alone at night.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Not many directors have been able to do that, except Rod Serling and a few other creative geniuses.Admittedly, I am biased in favor of Kubrick films, because I absolutely admire and adore the way he managed to capture the essence of ""being there"" in the scene as though it were real, yet unreal, somehow surreal, like a lucid dream, but better than any dream.

1279,Brian_McInnis,"Words, words, words.",10,11 April 2018,"Over most of my life, I've studied this film and the conception of its story in both Arthur Clarke's scientific mind and in Kubrick's artistic mind, and I've learned about a great many subliminal themes and subconscious effects Kubrick wove into it. But I think that probably the most profound and unique effect of the film is this:
It begins in a place before language, where a profound but inexpressible truth is communicated nonverbally, - to the Australopithecines and to the audience. It then jumps ahead to a time where language is universal and compulsory, but where it is also consistently platitudinous, shallow, (Heywood Floyd and others) deceptive, cryptic, (Hal) or purely technical in nature. Nothing of any deep truth or impact is presented in the film verbally, and most of the dialogue is distinctly mundane and, the deeper one looks into the film, duplicitous. Hal is deceiving his two astronauts, and later they are presenting a false veneer of cooperation to him. Dr. Floyd has a conversation with Russian collaborators in which all are extremely polite and friendly even as Floyd refuses to actually answer any of his companions' questions (and in which he is slyly given a middle finger by Dr. Smyslov as Smyslov moves a drink on the table).Floyd later gives a speech on the Lunar base in which he gives absolutely no actual information about the monolith, and in which are several quietly sinister references to the 'proper preparation and conditioning' of the public, the 'formal oaths' that need to be obtained and 'sacrifices' made by those privileged to be present at the meeting (Kubrick was greatly fixated on the secretive, Freemason-like enclaves of the rich and powerful). Floyd's small daughter (whose mother is currently away shopping) wants a telephone for her birthday, but he reminds her they've already got lots of telephones - so many ways to talk, but the girl still seems to desire real communication (communication and its failure is another recurring theme in Stanley's work). On and on it goes.But when we finally arrive at Jupiter and its orbiting monolith, speech drops away completely for the last twenty-three minutes of the film (about the same length as the pre-verbal prologue). Bowman passes beyond speech into the most stupefying experience in the cinema - an experience of incomprehensible images and music, (and an experience whose connection with the audience is strengthened by the fact that Bowman isn't a Specific Character, with his own personal and emotional history the movie's supplied him with, but a blank, prototypical human we can read anything onto) and even more bewilderingly, he encounters himself at the end of this journey; and the movie itself seems to pass beyond its own logic.The subconscious feeling one's left with from a full, uninterrupted viewing is of a film largely about the treachery and emptiness of speech in which we finally escape the verbal universe entirely and arrive at a place of profound but inexpressible truth; that nearly all the film before this has had a distinct falseness and superficiality about it, and we have finally found a great Secret far beyond any word. I've never seen another film that's achieved this feeling.
I've studied Kubrick's other films for some time now, and 'The Shining' and 'Eyes Wide Shut' may exceed '2001' in the richness of their subliminal thematic and aesthetic tapestries (and days before he died, Stanley himself said the latter would be his greatest contribution). But none of his other movies go nearly as far down the rabbit-hole of raw experience and mystery as the Odyssey does. Emily Dickinson wrote that 'Nature is a haunted house--but Art--is a house that tries to be haunted.' Of the artists who've worked with film, Kubrick is the most skilled I've seen at haunting his houses.Einstein -'The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead - his eyes are closed.'",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I say unfortunately because he´s dead. and I don´t know if there are much more of this kind of directors alive. what can I say about 2001? if you´ve seen the movie, you know that not much can be said. is better to no try to find explanations to most parts of the movie, because Kubrick (I think) didn´t want us to think, but to feel. it is an experience you must have for your own and get your personal impressions and feelings. I know people that cannot finish the movie, and others who has seen it 20 times. it´s a matter of oppinion. you love it or you hate it. there is no indifference here.

1281,phteven_hawking,Masterpiece of Art,10,18 August 2010,"I cannot add more to what has been said in the precious reviews about this film. Actually, that is entirely incorrect. This film rings so many personal bells with me that I have a lifetime of things to say about this film, and this is exactly what you will experience when you watch it, whether you like it not.I would like to say two things though. One, the special effects in this film are so unbelievably incredible that you might think the US government faked the moon landings on the set of 2001.Secondly, I would like to compare this film to previous films that have been considered 'great' film, or even the 'greatest' films of all time. One such film is Hitchcock's Vertigo. Now I would like to challenge you to imagine film-making since the time of The Matrix to now (2010) during which time films such as Pandorum, Cargo, Transformers have been made. Now the difference in these films' cultural reference, their perspective of the world and the universe is almost identical. The tremendous technological developments between this decade have hardly separated these films into different categories of film-making.Now compare 'Vertigo' and '2001', films separated by a mere decade, look at the difference between those films. It is enormous, tremendous, and inconceivable. The understanding of human perspective, human life, our place in the universe, the expanse of the universe itself. The difference is extreme to the highest degree, and they are the same distance apart as The Matrix is to Pandorum. This not only is an indictment of Vertigo's complete lack of vision but a testament to 2001's powerful and eternal thrust into the realm of modern film-making human vision.Watch 2001 and begin to appreciate the vastness of space, of matter, of intelligence, of possibility, of everything. This is simply the greatest statement that has ever been conveyed with film, and in cinema.2001 will live forever.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Trough the lengthy space scenes, we made jokes on expense of the astronauts; we mocked HAL9000 voice... and sometimes we yawn. Then came the last 20 minutes and... we became speechless, on the one hand because we didn't understood what the hell was happening, but also because we glimpsed the importance of this piece of work. 2001 is maybe the most ambitious film of all time; Kubrick wanted to make the quintessential science-fiction movie, and he did it, plus posing a question that today seems very pertinent: What's the next stage of human evolution? Kubrick tries to answer this with all the effectiveness possible in cinema; The image rules, words are secondary. Often imitated, but never matched, 2001 challenges the very nature of cinema as an art form and as a vehicle for philosophical endeavors. A true Classic.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1285,reymmm-davis,Favorite movie of all time,10,11 July 2011,"2001:A Space Odyssey is my personal favorite movie of all time. I will not give any spoilers. I love the acting by Keir Dulia(I think that's how you spell it) he has a great role as Dr.Dave Browning the main character. His performance is so genuine that it is hard to take your eyes off him. Enter HAL the antagonist. He is a computer with A.I.(artificial intelligence) and is voiced amazingly. I haven't heard a better monotone voice in my life. His voice gives me a chill every time I hear it. If you don't know the first and last 20 minutes of this movie is completely silent, some people may not like this but I think it adds to the epic/sci-fi drama.As I said before I am completely spoilerfree but my favorite scene is the beginning. Some might think it's outdated with the special effects, but think of it when it first came outin 1968, these were most likely mind blowing for the time.Anyway, this is a great movie and probably the greatest sci-fi movie ever made so,I'd check it out. And by the way, open the pod bay doors HAL.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1286,RatchetJak94,A Film Ahead of Its Time,10,27 June 2011,"In my TV Productions class, my teacher showed my classmates and I ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". He advised us to pay attention to what is going on or we will be lost. So, I had my mind on every moment I've seen in the film.Watching the film for the first time, the film blew me away with its art direction, musical score, visuals, atmosphere and groundbreaking special effects for its time.The settings in the film are well-thought out and you really feel like you're in space due to its slow pace. Some people complained about the slow pace, but it's that way for a reason, and I just mentioned why. The spaceships and vehicles were very original at the time and seeing the technology and the way to navigate through the spaceships is just creative and groundbreaking.The music and sound is one of the highlights of the film. A couple of times you will hear ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" by Richard Strauss and ""The Blue Danube"" by Johann Strauss and each of them perfectly fits what is going on and how you're supposed to feel when listening to them.I also like to point out its creepy and mysterious atmosphere. There are times where you are calm and there are also times when you feel like you want to know what's going on or what will happen. Watching it the first time, I felt that way.Now for the special effects. Remember, this is 1968 and CGI wasn't invented yet. The crew members were able to pull it off well. Some say they are now outdated, but to me, they are still the most groundbreaking special effects I have seen.Lastly, the story is what I want to talk about. If you go throughout the whole movie, you may not get it the first time. But watching it the second time, you may pick something up. From what I can gather, without going into spoilers, it deals with various themes like evolution and technology. It is a story that explains itself with minimal dialogue, so make sure to pay attention to what's going on.The characters were great, most notably the three main characters on the Discovery One. But the character that steals the show is HAL-9000, a computer who claims that he has never made an error and can also mimic human emotion, all while speaking in monotone. He is very original that he influenced other fictional computers with a great AI, like GLaDOS from the video game series ""Portal"".In conclusion, this is one of the most unique films I have seen. As my TV productions teacher told my classmates ""Star Wars wouldn't be Star Wars if it weren't for this film"", so it was definitely an influential film. I never heard of Stanley Kubrick until I saw this film, and I have to say he did a great job making an accurate and realistic science-fiction movie. I say give this movie a view if you don't complain how different it is from movies with brilliant plots.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1287,tpeterson1955,"You have to let this film ""happen"" to you as a ""right-brained"" experience, and then it becomes ""the ultimate trip"" as it was originally intended!",10,17 February 2012,"When I first saw this film back in 1969, I'm sure that I was as bewildered and disappointed as virtually everyone else in the cinema that cold Friday night.I was hoping that this film would be an exciting, big-budgeted Science Fiction film about a trip to the planet Jupiter, under the ever watchful control of a sophisticated on-board computer named the HAL-9000.The main reason for my bewilderment was the fact that the story (and it does have a story) is told in such an extremely minimal way, with so few dialog and ""action"" scenes, that it needs to be viewed as a ""right brain"" experience rather than a ""left brained"" one. By ""right brain"" I mean that the film is basically one that relies totally on ""visuals"" rather than on ""left brained"", logical dialog scenes.This is one film in which you really need to use your ""intuition"" in order to appreciate what is happening from moment to moment. You need to do away with the need for dialog scenes, and let the film's visuals just ""wash all over you"" until you become immersed in their utter brilliance of execution.You have to let the film ""happen"" to you, and, if you do, then it becomes as it was originally advertised to be: ""the ultimate trip""! This all seems so hard to believe now, because since then, this film has become one of my all time Top Ten Films, and I named it Best Film of 1968 (the year it was made) because, if you look at most of the films made that year, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY stands head and shoulders above them all.The film starts with a section called, THE DAWN OF MANKIND, and shows a group of apes before, and then after, they make contact with a mysterious black monolith that makes its appearance near a watering hole they congregate near. This monolith makes a few more startling appearances as the film progresses.After contact with this imposing monolith, the apes seem to gain ""intelligence"", and one of them takes the giant leap into being able to take one of the bones of a dead animal, and then use it as weapon to kill another animal! That's some leap in intelligence, isn't it??!! So, immediately we can sense that this monolith is not all wonderful and it has its bad side.Then, without too much warning, we are thrust immediately into the year 2001, and we see a gigantic space station rotating around the earth. On the soundtrack we can hear the opening strains of Johann Strauss' beautiful piece of music, THE BLUE DANUBE.Thus begins one of the most amazing sequences ever put on film: the giant space station rotates ever so gracefully, and the special effects are totally believable as we truly feel we are in outer space, looking down at our beautiful planet Earth. Geoffrey Unsworth's excellent cinematography, the special effects and the Strauss background music score all combine to make the first great impression on our ""right brain"" I mentioned earlier.For me, I find it almost impossible not to enjoy this particular sequence of the film because I love the use of special effects in films, and these are definitely ""special"" effects that genuinely enhance the film's sense of ""place"". In other words: where we are at the moment. In this instance: we're in outer space, gliding in tandem with the gigantic space station.Because of the magic this scene generates, we do not need ""left brained"" dialog for this sequence. In fact, dialog, and even a few sound effects, would have ruined it and it would have been too jarring and disruptive. The soundtrack music puts us in the correct mood immediately because it is so relaxing, and yet, so upbeat at the same time. Or is the director, Stanley Kubrick, giving the audience a sense of false security? Because we feel so comfortable with this wonderful music playing on the soundtrack, we do not think that there is any need for us to be alarmed, which in fact we need to be later on in the film when the all-controlling HAL-9000 computer reveals its true nature.From this point onwards, the film starts to gather some much needed momentum, and we soon discover that one of those monoliths has been found on the Moon. And it seems that someone (or some thing?) from outer space is sending the Earth messages in the form of these black monoliths, but Earthlings are not apparently smart enough to comprehend these messages as yet!! A new section begins gently and we are then thrust peacefully into another section, set some time much later: VOYAGE TO JUPITER. From here on we are part of the mini-drama that evolves between the two astronauts, Dave Bowman and Frank Poole, when the HAL-9000 computer gets a bit too sneaky and starts to sabotage this all important journey because it is too important for possible ""human error"". Maybe HAL's the one who has been organizing the placement of the black monoliths on Earth and in space.It's a thought, and at least this film makes you think.All of Stanley Kubrick's films have, in one way or another, divided his fans and his critics: people seemed to either love these films or hate them. So, in that way, Kubrick was always a complete ""master"" of keeping the public guessing, and thinking.And he kept this ability all his working life.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1288,reagentas,Annoying movie,2,7 January 2012,"Yesterday I watched the movie and to say the truth it was the worst two hours of my life. It was awful to watch such movie: music can give you Migraine especially the one near obelisk, very little dialogues, a lot of silence scenes, weak ending and a lot of mistakes. At first I was thinking maybe I am watching Planet of Apes or something, I do not know the purpose of such beginning, I think Kubrick Does not know that too. Maybe he wanted to make a longer movie but did not have any ideas what to begin with so he inserted some monkeys and scenery of desert. In addition the acting is terrible, dialogues are primitive, robot computer is very unrealistic. Also it should be a movie of 1 hour cutting all unnecessary scenes. However there are some things that I liked too, that kept me watching this weird movie to the end. Visual effects and details are very good for such year of production. Overall a very bad movie",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1289,mb9607,Game changer but boring,7,8 August 2012,first i want to say that i am not perfectly bilingual so my typing is horrible i hope you will be able to read my review even with this issue1) At the time this film was release nobody has ever done anything like it. It is the father of the whole science fiction scene with is incredible images and the way Kubrick made to create these.2) That being said this is the most boring movie i have seen in my life the characters have no personality at all and the story is bland. I have not calculate it but i surely think that more than half of the movie is some image without any sound. Maybe that it's me that doesn't understand it but i don't get the purpose of it after 1 or 2 time we see the wonderful images if half of the movie is made of it this will certainly be boring To conclude a cinema classic but deadly boring and an other time sorry for the poor English i wish i can at least be understand pleasure Max,2001 - A Space Odyssey

This is a website about movies, and movies are much more than special effects. Much more! It's about the script (this movie had none), good acting (this movie had none), well-written dialogues (this movie had none), etc (this movie had none)... So, sure, I admit it! For a movie like this to be made in 1968 with such astounding special effects must have been a real front page issue. But do you really like it as a movie??? It is all special effects, and I even though agree that at the time these effects were actually special, how is anyone astonished by it after almost two and a half hours of absolutely nothing else.

1292,thomas8331,Not Boring!,9,17 January 2005,"This isn't a movie review as much as a response to those who feel that slow-paced equals bad, where scifi or suspense is concerned. I do think this is one of the classics of cinema, and much that came after is deep in Kubrick's debt. Every student of film should see this.Admittedly, this is more like reading a novel then watching a film. However, that meditative approach, together with the stunning visuals and the silence of deep space, gives the viewer time to think! The film CERTAINLY raises more questions than it answers, and this is a good thing. Not every film experience has to be neatly tied up at the end of two hours, and if you accept that this film is a metaphor of the human condition, then there is definitely room for loose ends.What about character development? HAL is one of the best realized villains in all of cinema (example, paraphrased as I don't have the lines in front of me *SPOILER*: ""I can tell you're very upset about this, Dave."" ""Open the airlock, HAL."" ""I'm sorry, Dave, but I can't do that. You're going to find it very difficult to get back on board without your helmet, Dave."" His calm menace is unreal!) I was ten when I first saw this, and couldn't get through it, because as a ten-year-old, I was expecting laser blasts and rockets. I saw it again several years later, and it was more to my liking as a young adult. It grows on you and is worth repeated viewings. I have seen it several times and own the soundtrack as well.IF you want Star Wars, then by all means, watch Star Wars. But if you want some serious hard science fiction, this is a great film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1293,BeardedVillain,Impressive for its time.,7,9 June 2014,"This being my first time watching the movie, I didn't find it as enjoyable as someone likely did if they watched it several decades ago. The mysterious monolith kept me intrigued for the better part of the movie, and I quite enjoyed how the movie had minimal dialogue and was mainly about observation. The movie was definitely ahead of its time - especially with video effects; and the film really had an impact on how movies were made today. On top of that, it had absolutely chilling music that still managed to give goosebumps.The major thing that made me not enraptured by the film was the prolonged scenes that made the length of the movie unnecessarily long. I felt like several portions of the movie were drawn-out to make the viewer watch in awe of how amazing and advanced life is in the future and in space, which really diminishes the movies test of time. Upon the movies release it was likely enjoyable to watch those long and slow scenes, but today it feels otherwise.Aside from the movie not being as enjoyable to those who may have watched a plethora of more modern science fiction movies - it still is worth a watch, just to see how impressive it is for a movie made in the 60's.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1294,The_Mantis,Overrated tripe,1,18 March 2005,"2001 is one of those movies where, if you don't like it, you are told that you don't 'get it' and need to look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You're told that you clearly have a slow attention span, and just want to see sex, explosions, and have the plot handed to you on a platter.Let's break down the movie shall we? Three minutes of blackness, with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. A minute of fascinating shots of the Savannah. Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the 'Blue Danube' plays in the background. A bunch of pointless dialogue, and a group of moon scientists find another monolith.Cut to a spaceship that's too long for the crew complement--three sleeping people, two people named Dave and Frank, who have only slightly more personality than the stiffs in hibernation. And then there's HAL, the 'perfect' supercomputer who runs the ship. Predictably, he snaps and starts breaking the First Law of Robotics. Now this is something that has potential. An evil, coldly ruthless super-mind who controls the surrounding environment and can predict your every move. And what does he do? He lets one guy float into space and turns off the hibernation machines so the three sleeping guys die, leaving Dave floating in a pod. He simply uses the airlock, puts on a spacesuit, and turns HAL off--agonizingly slowly. Then, apparently, there's some psychedelic 'evolution' at Jupiter.Here's the movie with the pauses taken out: Apes see monolith, kill things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave gets a prerecorded message, and evolves at Jupiter.This is not me 'not getting it.' This is me being bored to tears by long stretches of absolutely nothing. Sure, it's realistic, but I find I have no reason to care. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being entertaining.

1295,jimmoir,Best fim ever,9,7 November 2014,"I have watched this movie many many times, from 1968 (as a ten year old kid watching the space program develop), to today. I make a point to re- watch it at least once a year, and I never tire of it. I think it is the most brilliant, and misunderstood movie of all time. So many interpretations of the monolith and the plot in general have been written, I wont bother to summarize, only to give my own view. In simple terms the monolith is God. Black, totally mysterious, thwarting all efforts of mankind to figure out what it is. In the early scenes, the prehistoric humans are clearly dying out- easy prey for the leopard, and in spite of their intelligence, powerless to defend themselves. The monolith appears ( a metaphor for God, the creator, the great mystery), and teaches them aggression and the use of weapons, and a way to survive and dominate the earth. The other manifestations of God on the moon, and in Jupiters orbit- are an invitation (assuming mankind progresses to the point of being able to discover them and ask what they are) to discover, partially, why we are here and what our purpose is. On the way, man attempts to be God. Creating intelligence (HAL), and realizing finally that intelligence is only to be created by God. HAL, for all his technological brilliance, has been endowed with all the defects of man, and finally must be destroyed by his creators (is this mans fate too)? When Discovery finally reaches Jupiter and the third monolith, it is an invitation to discover the meaning of life. Through the infinite, and finally into the ""room"" at the end, Dr Bowman ages and becomes an old man. And at the end of life, God, the great mystery, appears again (the monolith). Bowman reaches out and is shown the ultimate meaning of our existence, at least all that God is willing to reveal to us: death and rebirth... the ultimate reason for the existence of anything- eternal propagation of life through continuous rebirth.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It is directed, co-written, and produced by one of my favorite directors of all-time, Stanley Kubrick, who has directed other masterpieces like Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket. 2001: A Space Odyssey, along with a lot of other Kubrick films, is not for everyone. It is slow paced for the most part, has very little dialogue, and has a long runtime. This movie is not for the average movie-goer. If you do decide to watch this movie, you will be treated to: fantastic visual effects, impeccable cinematography, and an interesting story. One things for sure, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a complex film. The film is frequently interpreted differently amongst people.

We needs things sorted out and tied off. We need closure.2001 is a very unconventional piece of storytelling, as much a work of abstract art as it is a narrative. The movie is about humans exploring the unknown -- and finding things that they cannot understand. And flying in the face of our desire for explanation, the movie explains very little. Instead, we experience events as the characters experience them: awed, and utterly uncomprehending.I'd always loved this movie, but hadn't appreciated just how specular it is until I had a chance to see it on the big screen at the Heights Theater (a a lovely Twin Cities art house place with a working theater organ!). Then I realized: you aren't *supposed* to understand what's going on -- not at the start, not at the end. You are supposed to be mystified and utterly overwhelmed. I don't mean overwhelmed by huge explosions or lots of lots of rumbling THX bass gimmicks; I mean overwhelmed by a sense that the universe is vast, and we humans are tiny and ignorant.I think people often don't like this masterful movie because they expect explanations, and are disappointed.

I'm convinced that it would be a lifetime's work to read into every aspect of ""2001..."", and it makes me wonder: could a human really get this much depth into a plot? Was it just luck, endless profundity borne out of spontaneous creation? Or did Kubrick thoroughly, meticulously, Religiously plunder every depth, develop every point, craft each and every aspect of this Film to levels of transcendentalism that would make a Philosopher blush? Frankly, Kubrick's notoriety makes the latter quite plausible.But I digress. I'm going off on a tangent, tripping over myself to praise this Film, and that does it no justice. As I tried to show, it's perfectly crafted, honed down to utmost perfection, in itself. With such perfectionism readily available in store, online, anywhere, why read a review? The ultimate proof of ""2001...""'s brilliance is ""2001..."", and that's the mark of a true classic.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1299,ghazyp,"""The Sentinel"" and the film (a comparison)",8,4 May 2013,"Analysis (Note: For those who've seen this movie and read the short story, ""The Sentinel,"" this review may help readers understand the themes) Science fiction has been the subject of storytelling throughout the world, partially because it explores possible realms in the future. It also offers an alternative universe within film and writing. Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey is considered to be a landmark, science fiction film. His work is a profound, visually and astounding film. It discusses exploration of the unknown by human beings. The film was coincidentally released during the height of the space race between the USSR and the United States. It is partially inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's 1951 short story, ""The Sentinel."" The concepts of progression of evolution and the perils of human technology are emphasized. The short story and the film both focus on the long- term view of evolution and trace the possible perils of human technology. ""The Sentinel"" describes a mysterious object left at the Moon's massive plateau, the Mare Crisium. The narrator Wilson had made a lunar exploration to the Moon alongside his friends, Garnett and Louis. They happened to discover the artifact on the surface. This object has made from polished mineral, shaped to be tetrahedral, and also surrounded by a spherical forcefield. Wilson himself could not understand the power of the sentinel left on the Moon. He states that those mechanisms ""belong to a technology that lies far beyond (his crew's) horizon, perhaps to the technology of para physical forces"" (110). The readers may speculate that the sentinel was a ""warning beacon"" for the initial start of evolution for humans and creatures on Earth. The ancient aliens have scattered them throughout the universe. Readers may have to consider how evolution of intelligent life may undergo in the future. 2001: A Space Odyssey focuses on the development of mankind from ape-man. In the first episode of the film entitled, ""The Dawn of Man,"" Kubrick takes the audience back to the prehistoric past in the Pleistocene era. No dialogue was spoken in the first 25 minutes of the film. This section of the film comprises of shots of the primordial landscape, depicting the African Savannah and tribes of prehistoric apes. They have not developed the capacity to create tools in order to hunt and kill other animals. A tall, black, rectangular monolith appeared midst their habitat—the group of apes huddled around the object and the Sun slowly rises atop of the slab. Later on, the audience sees the leader of the ape-men, consciously picking up a bone and smashing the skeleton of a tapir. This indicates a new development of intelligence for the prehistoric apes.""The Sentinel"" ambiguously describes how technology could possibly initiate human civilization. Simply stated, Wilson points out that the crystal pyramid may have been placed on the Moon, rather than the on Earth—the ancient aliens perhaps were interested in seeing civilization struggling from savagery. Wilson said, ""That is the challenge that all intelligent races must meet, sooner or later. It is a double challenge, for it depends in turn upon the conquest of atomic energy and the last choice between life and death"" (111). The short story implies that the aliens may have wanted a sentinel to be left scattered across the universe. The signals will help the infant civilization on Earth to develop super intelligence. It is a challenge for creatures and humans to harvest the promises of life. In 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick demonstrates that there are dangers in developing technology. The HAL- 9000 super-computer had slowly begun to malfunction. HAL maintains the electronic systems of the spaceship, Discovery. After playing electronic chess with Dr. Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood), HAL warned him that he had checkmated himself as he said, ""Queen to bishop, three. Bishop takes queen."" HAL foreshadowed his computer error and Poole's death, as a result of his foolishness to believe that the computer system was correct. As he carried on a conversation with Dr. David Bowman (Keir Dullea), HAL asked him whether or not he had second thoughts about the Jupiter mission. He had feelings towards the mission as he said to Bowman, ""Well, it's rather difficult to define. Perhaps I'm just projecting my own concern about it. I know I've never completely freed myself of the suspicion that there are some extremely odd things about this mission."" The unusual stress HAL is experiencing may be a sign that an advanced, perfect computer is deteriorating. The HAL-9000 computer system is no longer considered ""foolproof"" or even sophisticated, as HAL detected a slight error in his system.It is clear that ""The Sentinel"" and the film itself, forces everyone to consider the exploitation of evolution in regards to human technology and intelligence. Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is probably well-known for its visual storytelling—leaving the audience to a somewhat, ambiguous interpretation of the film's plot and elements. It was also not considered a direct adaptation of Clarke's ""The Sentinel."" He stated it was like comparing ""an acorn to the resulting oak-tree."" Understanding Kubrick's use of non-traditional storytelling allows for differing interpretations on the dangers of technology, and mankind's evolutionary growth.OpinionI recommend this film for those who appreciate Kubrick's use of non- linear storytelling and beautiful imagery. 2001 deals with topics that could not be explained based upon physics. It is merely wrong to draw definite conclusions after viewing this film. There are intense moments, usually accompanied by an eerie score. Like most Kubrick films, one must understand his themes and motifs that shape the storyline. Overall, it is very thought-provoking.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1300,hanydirector,The most overrated movie ever.,1,17 July 2020,"The most boring movie i've ever watched through 40 years of movies watching.
And for those brilliants who pretend that it's a great piece of art and blah blah blah .... sorry guys it's just looks like you spend an entire life looking at a paint then you try to convince people that the paint talks to you.... nobody would believe you ... sorry.
I think this it's Kubrick's worst movie ever away from critics who think they would look genius for saying great things about meaningless movies like this to prove, emmmm, they are some punch of philosophers.
For people back in the sixties i think it would've been great to go stoned or on acid or (both) to watch a movie that gives you the opportunity to feel you are so high (in the outer space) with too long moments of just music on black screen (REALLY?) so you can imagine whateverr you want and a dialogue that could be written on the back of a bus ticket .... and wooooooow it's a great movie that gave me a great experience to imagine whatever i want and get some good sleep either.

To be straight, you should know going into this film that you should have an eye for subtleties and symbolism, and above all, an open mind. From the onset, you can tell that the director is not going to attempt to appeal to the audience with fast paced action, explosions, etc. but rather with direct mental stimulation. You watch this film with a similar manner to that of an obscure yet significant painting, because the themes that are presented to you feel epic, and they are left open for interpretation; the lack of dialogue in favor of eerie music helps. However, even through all of the confusion, and tense mood, you also know you are watching something beautiful. With a few minor exceptions, the screenplay feels like it is consistently appealing to the eye in a simple nature. And when it does change into more flashy and complex imagery, your eyes seem to welcome it.I wouldn't say it is in my personal favorite films, but either way I am still thinking about it weeks after having watched it",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This is not a failing on my part, but a refusal to give credit to the movie when credit is due to me alone, for the thoughts belong to me and are in no way elicited by the movie any more than they are elicited by a room of total darkness.This movie is so bad, it is the equivalent of John Cage's 4'33"" on film, except it doesn't have the audacity of the latter to go all the way and deliver a totally blank slate.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

And if something DOES happen, it's pretty much either a drugged out experience (some kind of makeshift home made drug probably), either a totally sober man trying to come up with a hallucination that a regular drug experience would induce.
Either that or somebody just discovered 3D rendering and/or color effects.One could say for that time it was innovative.

Everything has already been said and written about the film, but I can't help but share my amazement and admiration for this body of work. I regret not having watched it before. I've always read and heard about Kubrick and Clarke, but never got in the state of mind of watching the Odyssey beginning to end.
The distance from here to the cosmos is a spaceship away. The dialogue is more vivid and human-centric than I expected it would be. I felt every moment of the journey. If HAL was created in '92 and had to be put down in 2001, I'd say I relate pretty much and sympathize with him. For the world has changed after 2001 in ways that make me afraid, and my mind is going. Also, my surgery did not go all too well and I still need glasses.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1308,pietrofox,A deep Journey into men evolution!!!,10,7 April 2005,"There's no comments for this extraordinary film, that only the great master Kubrick could make. The look into men's evolution is so deep and intense that some people find difficult to understand. But beyond this, the film as I see, is also a criticize to the mankind. The scenes when the screen is totally black, (with the suspense music) represents the miss of sense, logic in our own existence, so empty as the black screen. And, of course the greatest scene, when the the bone flies ""turning"" into a Ship; essentially are the same thing. Not without reason Spielberg compared 2001 with the Big Bang. When It was released, the movie caused a huge success because of the visual effects of the fantastic shots on the space, that even today are very good. The images of Men arriving on moon next year, (1969) looked like ""kid's play"" comparing to It.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Most of it was music, noises and special visual effects that looked like they were ripped off from the colorful weather storm patterns you can see on any weather website today. I simply didn't get this movie. There's hardly any dialog, and a lot of space ships floating around, seen from many angles...I understand the description of what this is about (the philosophical question - the concept - of the nature of advanced civilizations), but I failed to see this made apparent in this film. To me, it's very disjointed with no clues as to what is supposed to be happening or why. I wonder whether a lot of people gave this rave ratings because they were afraid to say, hey, I didn't get it.

1311,uke2se-1,A piece of art for those with an attention span of more than 10 minutes,10,16 December 2005,"After reading some of the negative reviews on this movie (there aren't a lot of them, but still) I just felt the sudden urge to poke fun at someone.A few reviewers keep saying that ""sure, I understood it, but it hasn't got a plot"". If you think that you didn't understand it, so why do you say you did? The plot may not be as obvious as, say, Apollo 13, and it doesn't just deliver everything on a silver platter, but it's there and it's profound. If you would, for once, pick up a book you could even read the excellent novel of Arthur C. Clark, as it would lend you some clues to the meanings of the movie, but I guess reading is out of the question, right? Something else I noted was that many claims it is ""boring, two and a half hours of nothing"". Well, it's not aimed for audiences of six-year-olds, or those adults with the attention span of a six-year-old. Like every complicated message it takes a while to carry it across. In fact, every scene in this movie, every moment of every scene, is very meaningful and carries part of the message - including the three-minute of black screen in the beginning of the film. ""Oh my God, there's no explosions, no action, nothing... just a black screen. This movie sucks!"" As for acting, well, it's perfectly adequate. The scenes on the Discovery are all breath takingly suspenseful, and the acting overall is realistic. For the most part, it hints of the naturalistic American cinema that is to come in the 70s.The special effects are of course, extremely good for it's time. Certainly, there are no CGI in this movie, as it is made in the 1960s. What is there though, is truly beautiful cinematography with astounding vistas of space. (Space IS empty, you know.) In conclusion, I believe I am for the most part preaching to the already enlightened, but those few of you who will not give this movie the time it takes to bring across it's message I say give it another go, keep an open mind and don't expect the movie to do all the thinking for you. Your brain is quite a large organ and should contain the necessary synapses to think deeper than the surface, read between the lines if you will. Try it. It doesn't hurt.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I'd love to know what they were on when this film was being made.Its also the most historically-inaccurate film in existence; 2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking place.Characters are unlikeable, design is simplistic and everything just rambles on without any sense or logic to it.And the ending is probably the worst of it: its supposed to be thought-provoking but the only thought that entered my mind is ""What the F$*K is going on?!""

1313,aliaselias,"""On the Origin of Species"" written in a perfect picture language",10,5 January 2006,"In '2001:A Space Odyssey' the following theory was put: The process of evolution goes not always straight and successionaly but it moves sometimes spasmodically and suddenly. A question about it is whether those evolutional leaps are inherent in the process of evolution, i.e. driven by internal evolutional forces, or they are driven by some certain external forces. In this movie Kubrick and Clarke take the second hypothesis (But, of course, it doesn't automatically mean that they really think so). The further question 2001 puts is whether an organic-biological being/entity alone can have a consciousness. To that question the computer HAL gives a clear answer with 'No'.Actually no one could answer such questions clearly, but who does NOT ask him-/herself sometimes in his/her life?: Where mankind is from and where mankind is going to go? What the consciousness is, what 'one's self' is?In 2001 that profound and philosophical questions are 'written' in a perfect picture language. I don't know any other movies that succeeded in visualizing such deep, 'eternal' questions so perfectly.It was more than 25 years ago when I saw this movie for the first time, but I am still asking myself how and when we mankind will leap to the another evolutional stage.And I'd like to know what Charles R.

1314,lightmanhobbes,"Brilliant and Thought-provoking, but an Absolute Bore",3,9 January 2015,"Before I explain why I disliked this movie so much, I want to make a couple comments about what this movie did right. First off, this movie is extremely deep and thought-provoking. The ending, and the whole lead up to it throughout the movie, was smart and carefully crafted. I won't even pretend that I knew what the ending was trying to say, because I probably don't. Also for a movie from the late 60's, the visuals were stunning.Both of these aspects made the movie beautiful, and at the same time made you strain your brain to determine the meaning behind every shot and every scene. However that's just the reason I hated it. I knew that when I started up the movie and was greeted to 3 minutes of blackness accompanied by a grating, ear-splitting horrible sound that they deemed ""music"", I was going to be in for an awful ride.2001 A Space Odyssey isn't a movie, it's an art gallery. You're sitting there watching scene after scene of an astronaut or a spaceship just floating in space. Beautiful, but painfully boring. This was the first time I have ever fast-forwarded through sections of movie because I was so bored. The best part was even though I did this I never missed anything. There is so much useless fluff in this movie you could probably skip an entire scene and still not miss a beat. As I said, the effects in this movie were amazing for it's time, but it's been almost 50 years. You can't just stick a series of pretty space shots up and expect it to hold up over time without any compelling story to carry the movie. And here is the other reason this isn't a movie. There is barely a shred of a story, or characters, or excitement or anything else that you need to make an actual good movie. The plot was laughably non- existent. There was barely a moment of excitement or suspense during the whole movie. The characters were also laughably poor. Undeveloped, stale, and utterly boring like the rest of the movie. A movie should be beautiful, and it should make you think, but it also should be so many other things that 2001 A Space Odyssey just wasn't.The funny part is the only actual interesting character was an AI Robot called Hal. He provided the only interesting character and the only suspenseful and exciting moment of the entire movie. If not for the whole section of the movie Hal was in, I don't think I would have been able to even finish it. He's the only reason I thought about giving this movie more than 1 star.If you like artsy movies, or if you like movies that really make you think, you will like this movie. It's perfect for pretentious people who can go around and pretend they completely understood the ending after watching it the first time. That way they can go and tell all their friends about it and sound super smart. However, if you want to sit down to have a good time and be entertained. If you want to watch an actual movie with deep characters, a beautiful score, excitement, suspense, and emotion, then you picked the wrong movie. You will quickly find it has none of these things.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

In 2003 I talked with a neighbor who worked at NASA.

They didn't ""get it"" because it wasn't a character driven drama. Neither did I immediately because of the odd structure of the piece and its mysterious ending. However so overwhelmed was I by the look of the film in those long lost pre-digital effects age, that the obscure finale which initially antagonised me, made me think through the entire film. The ""plotty"" bits I liked but when I realised the film, at a second viewing was about the evolution of all of us, as a species, what happened before and what may come after Man the whole non-verbal experience (Kubrick's phrase) had a profound and lasting affect. The speculation of our relative standing against other life forms in the universe (pretty low if the film is to believed) came as a shock. I came out of the cinema reeling with those images of planetary alignments, Ape men discovering the first weapons, revolving balletic space stations the enigmatic star child and the beauty, awesome emptiness, and silence ( George Lucas please note) of space, forever imprinted on my mind to this very day. It fed my conscious and unconscious mind but like now sparked a furious critical onslaught. Those that hated it demanded clarity where there can only ever be conjecture. You never see the aliens that planted the monoliths and that is just as it should be for that element of mystery to remain. 2010 tried to explain everything and killed the effect stone dead. The elegant pacing and use of classical music irritates the hell out of the Michael Bay / MTV generation of who become fidgety if a shot lasts over a second. Witnessing a fuzzy black and white picture on television shortly afterwards that didn't alter for 30 minutes held me spellbound. That was a TV picture of the leg of the lunar module awaiting Neil Armstrong's one small step on the moon. We were used to waiting then, as long as the payoff justified it. This event like the film gave one time to think.And there's the rub, my parent's generation didn't get it and neither does the current one but for widely differing reasons. You really had to be around in 1968 to realise what a quantum leap 2001 represented in film, special effects and story telling techniques.

1320,snord-94860,A must-see for any really movie lover,8,4 April 2016,"Truly, it was a revolutionary piece for the film industry. It opened the door back up to space, one that had essentially been shut since the short ""A Trip to the Moon,"" which in its own right was a masterpiece. Although this movie has influenced countless others, it lacked in many areas. Kubrick has made this story's theme in a manner that philosopher Martin Heidegger would be proud of, trying to push the audience to a point that they are incapable of understanding it. I won't spoil what it is, so don't worry, but Kubrick has made it nigh unattainable. Another complaint that I have of this movie was it seemed to rely heavily on the spectacle. So much was focused on camera tricks and special effects (which were absolutely amazing). However, special tricks do not make a movie. It is a similar complaint that I had with ""Interstellar."" There were so many shots of drifting in space. I don't mind having long cuts, in fact, I believe those to be incredibly artistic and beautiful, able to portray what quick cuts cannot. Sadly though, there were so many of them that these lot cuts lost a bit of their magic by the end. The psychedelic color trip at the end of the movie was... long. If it were to be just a tad shorter, it would have worked, but I believe that the point of it was lost within the first 3 minutes of random colors and patterns. In conclusion, it is a movie that's impact will forever be felt, but most won't appreciate now. It is a must watch for anyone who really appreciates movies and classics, but will leave you kind of thinking, ""what?"" Pros: It changed the film industry. The acting was great and so was the sound design. The focus on breathing to increase the dramatic effect, the icy tone of voice by HAL, and the music are just to name a few. I am not sure that we will ever have a movie revolutionize special effects like this one did. Cons: The cuts were a bit long. This left me as a viewer a little exasperated. There wasn't much character development nor continuity in character at all.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1321,tuffguy98,Horrifically boring and usually pointless,6,7 March 2006,"This movie had about 45 minutes of greatness strewn throughout a 2 1/2 hour movie. In these 45 minutes the pacing, the visuals, the dialogue (when applicable) was magnificent. The rest was a hodge-podge of (usually beautiful) scenes thrown in there to make it look like a cool sci-fi movie.In one scene of the movie they retrieve a piece of equipment off the top of the spaceship because the computer says it will fail soon. In doing so, we hear 10-15 minutes of the same hissing sound from the man's oxygen tank and his breathing while the pod flies slowly, gracefully over so he can get the damn thing. How does this further the story? How does this say anything? I can get the feeling of isolation in space without having to hear 15 minutes of breathing and a hissing oxygen tube. Actually, I got it plenty well before that thank you very much.Another example is a 45 minute long sequence (if I'm exaggerating it isn't by much) where it shows a bunch of pretty colors flashing by interrupted by a picture of his eye, occasionally. These would have been magnificent scenes if they had done something for the story or highlighted some type of theme that actually applies. I guess it's supposed to represent the infinite, but I don't see the infinite as being a bunch of random effects shots all streaming together in the most lethargic fashion possible. Maybe that's just my opinion.It's almost as if they are going for this artsy style which includes only a few brilliant moments of actual human emotion strung together by a bunch of effects sequences that show the same things, with the same noises, for such a long time that I felt like shooting myself in several instances (notably the ones I mentioned).In summary, I'd give those 45 minutes I mentioned before a 9.5/10 because I could imagine them being magnificent with decent support from the rest of the movie, while the rest of the movie gets a 1/10. Which averages out to about 4/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This happens quite a few times. I must say I'm not a Stanley Kubrick fan since I have watched plenty of his movies and I've liked none... so my opinion is biased.Still, I say that its outdated in terms of the story. Nowadays media in general, and especially videogames, have expanded the topic ""what makes us human"" and developed it better.I acknowledge the fact that it was an inspiration for many many directors and writers but:-if you like the topic and have been exposed so much to it, i don't think this is for you.

1324,nicktokar,A piece of artwork that we love to hate,1,20 January 2017,"I don't want to say that this is the worst movie of all time, however, it may be the most overrated movie of all time. This is considered a masterpiece by many. It is definitely a piece...Starting with the first 15 minutes of the film (I'm estimating on time by the way), you will just be assaulted by ear splitting sounds of primates, which are supposed to be primitive humans, just screaming at each other and fighting. it adds nothing to the film and is incredibly irritating.the next 10 minutes of the film entails a group of scientists researching the black monolith where you will experience another 5 minutes of ear splitting sounds. I am not exaggerating on how annoying a lot of the sounds are. I have actually had to mute the TV.then we move on to the part of the movie where the plot is actually represented. we are sitting around for about an hour and a half watching the progression of HALs breakdown. this part of the movie is actually tolerable, it's just an hour longer than it needs to be. I feel like I'm just waiting and waiting for 90% of the movie for something to actually happen. the film leaves you feeling absolutely no sympathy for the dead astronaut. eventually we are left for ourselves to decide whether HAL actually broke down or if he was programmed to kill the astronauts.If you thought the first 2 hours couldn't get any more long, boring and irritating, you would be dead wrong - if you haven't already died of boredom that is.When the survivor makes it to the escape pod, the movie actually manages to get even worse. not just a little bit worse, but so bad that by the end of the movie I was in tears from witnessing one of the worse films ever made. Anyway, for about 10 minutes straight, we see the survivor traveling through space with colors passing him as he stares out with this dumb, unchanging look on his face with more unnecessary noises. my impression of the colors were that he was looking up at an apartment building and a flustered artist from the top floor was raging and decided to throw all his paint out of the window, which happened to fall all around the survivor. That, or he was on the most severe drug trip in history.From there he suddenly ends up in some nicely furnished house where he sees himself as an old man eating dinner, then later as an even older man on his deathbed, then as an unborn baby looking down at Earth. Film ends. WHAT!?!? Is the audience actually supposed to be satisfied with that or see some kind of message in it?I cannot express enough how much I hated this movie. I am a grown man and I literally cried at the end of the 2 and a half hours of a cinematic abomination i had just endured. While I will admit the camera work and special effects were phenomenal, that alone cannot make up everything else that was placed into a blender then thrown into the theaters.Stanley Kubrick is a legendary film maker and has done some beautiful work in many of his other movies, but 2001: A Space Oddysey is just an insult to anyone who watches it. I wanted to like this movie, I truly did, there is just nothing that made me think for a second that this movie deserves anything nicer to say than 'a piece of garbage.'",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Not EVEN ENDGAME can top this masterpiece. The music was WAY ahead of its time and the sound felt like it came from the future. If you think this is boring, you have NO CLUE what a TRUE MOVIE looks and feels like. Movies these days are complete and utter GARBAGE, but 2001 will always seem to be unbeatable. If a movie ever topped 2001's amazing stuff, that would blow my MIND.

1326,Wes_Dean,Beyond what you can possibly imagine.,10,25 June 2018,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a peculiar movie, no, peculiar is too negatively connoted and does not measure to this masterpiece; 2001: A Space Odyssey is a unique, transcendental, mind-blowing experience.For it to be one of the most memorable cinematic moments of your life, you have to watch it in certain conditions. I personally first watched this movie on DVD, in my couch, on a TV, with a normal sound system. The memory I recall from my first viewing was good, although it didn't meet my expectations. Because when you see everyone saying that this movie is a masterpiece, unique in its genre (what I actually said in the beginning) you then have high expectations and you do not only expect for the movie to be good, you are also hoping for emotions, sensations you can only feel while viewing this movie. Unfortunately the emotion, the little je ne sais quoi, didn't come to me nor to my living-room. But the enigma of the whole movie started to germinate in me, I wanted to understand what I had witnessed. However, the little seed only germinated and never blossomed.The day Kubrick's masterpiece blossomed was the day where I finally went to see it where it should be watched and where all movies exist, live and die, in that dark room where the simple act of pushing a door and sitting down gives you the power of becoming invisible to others and yet embark on a journey with anyone who decided to sit in the dark with you. Yes, the movie theater. I can still remember the state I was in when the credits started rolling: shaking like a leaf, my blood whirring through my entire body, hands shaking, leg muscles tensing up; I had just experienced a whole new feeling. The silences (sometimes boring) didn't of course miraculously disappear, but I can tell you, just changing sound system, I rediscovered this film. I recall hearing about a nun that would've watched the movie and never experienced such a religious trance, she felt close to God. I can understand her, although I am not religious at all, this movie has this inexplicable power, puts you under a spell.Kubrick also confirms by that movie, once again, that he is a master to his art, he excels and imposes his visionary style and ideas that are still relevant today. But to fully have a thorough 2001 experience, you should watch it at least two times but you must watch it at least once in a movie theater. So enjoy the fact that there are rereleases of the movie the 50th anniversary to discover something that is yet unknown to your emotional spectrum.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1327,the-english-gentleman,Don't be fooled. The emperor is naked. And a total fraud.,1,28 November 2005,"Let's just get one thing straight: The only reason I've given this film 1 star is because the option for none isn't available. This film makes me feel ill. Here's why.You can bandy around all the 'before-its-time' and 'visionary' platitudes you like, but the simple fact is that this film has no plot, its actors are on autopilot, its themes could have been drummed up by a four-year-old, and it's all directed with the kind of pomposity with which Stanley Kubrick was terminally afflicted.""Kubrick? Pompous?"" I hear you cry. ""But what about The Shining? What about A Clockwork Orange? What of Doctor Strangelove?""Well, let's see. The Shining is good, but only for one reason - Jack Nicholson. Without his quiet madness and eventual raving, axe-wielding, snarling, cackling insanity, this film would just be an hour and a half of slow tracks through corridors broken up by scenes of people you couldn't give a damn about.A Clockwork Orange? Boring. The book is superior (as was The Shining, now I think about it). Humourless, dull, meaningless and dangerously close to juvenilia. Fourteen-year-old boys love this because people get hurt with sticks and there are boobs in it.Doctor Strangelove? Ah. Now I come to a problem, because Strangelove is a great film. However, I make no apology for saying that it's a great film DESPITE Kubrick, not BECAUSE of him. Peter Sellers is excellent in all three of his roles, George C. Scott is an acting powerhouse, and Sterling Hayden is a joy. The story is from a novel by Peter George. Kubrick brings nothing to the party.So, I think it's fair to say that Kubrick is a mediocre director with delusions of grandeur who rode to stardom on the back of exceptional performances from actors far better than he deserved. He wasn't a visionary. He was a hack.Now, back to 2001: Overrated Excrement. Sorry, I meant A Space Odyssey. That's another thing: comparing this dross to The Odyssey is like trying to make people believe 'Ernest Saves Christmas' is on a cultural par with Alfred Lord Tennyson.I started out a few paragraphs ago trying to explain why this film is so bad. Let me try again. There are a few themes in this, but they really boil down to these visionary gems: 1. People are bad to each other. 2. Technology is evil. 3. There is more in the universe than we can see.Hmm. Even in 1968 these theories were old hat. So, needless exploration of thoroughly explored themes aside, why else is this film pathetic? Well, the acting is sub-par for one. Keir Dullea's performance as Dave the Astronaut was practically non-existent. The film would have been much the same if he'd been replaced by a houseplant. Possibly better. And he was the protagonist. The film had to hinge on him and a computer, apparently voiced by somebody on massive amounts of lithium. Understated and slowly unnerving or just dull? I know which one I think. I like slow burners. I much prefer the build-up of tension to the shoddy action fluff made famous by the Bruckheimer/Affleck pairing, but this film has no tension. It has no build-up. It has nothing. The oft-heralded special effects are nothing special, even allowing for the thirty-five year time gap. The universally fawned-over shot of the bone turning into the spaceship actually made me embarrassed at its ineffectiveness. It was definitely amateur-hour at Stanley's house when they cobbled that together. The use of classical music is decidedly underwhelming. The 'Ballet In Space' scene with the ships spinning around each other set to Strauss's Blue Danube Waltz looks like an episode of Battlestar Galactica with the wrong soundtrack. Frank Poole floating off into space after being killed By HAL looks like a little plastic action figure being flushed down the toilet. The ape at the beginning who hurls the afore-mentioned bone into the air looks like a hired strippogram. Pathetic. Absolutely pathetic.You know what? I've had enough of reviewing this rubbish. It doesn't deserve a detailed critique. It deserves to be put out of its misery with a hammer to the temple.I can't urge you strongly enough not to waste your precious time on this god-awful film. I hate it with a passion born not of misunderstanding, but adherence to the idea that a film should not, under any circumstances, be a chore to watch through virtue of its extreme tediousness and pomposity. I stuck through this until the end (even past the ludicrous ending that lasted for about four hours) and gave it every chance to redeem itself. At the end, I sat back, disgusted, and felt a deep sense of gratitude that Stanley Kubrick had gone to a better place - a place where he couldn't do this type of damage again.This film is utterly without merit. Kubrick should be ashamed, and so should you for watching it. If you haven't watched it yet (and I sincerely hope you haven't), please, please, please don't do it. I'd rather you watch Affleck than this drivel.Well, perhaps not, but you get the idea.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1330,Rozza_,"First Half Boring, Second Half Brillian",10,8 February 2018,"While People call this film a masterpiece, I'm not one of them and that might be because I don't fully understand film. For me this movie really is incredible except for the segment between the pre-historic era and the 18 month time skip. During this period I really feel that its just boring, its just exposition and I really couldn't find myself invested in it. Maybe because CGI has spoiled me but I can still fully appreciate the practical effects here, (my favourite being the rotating running room). The shot composition is fantastic but the colour palette in these parts really hold back these shots from being fully realised. But once the 18 month time skip happens the movie really steps up, so many more themes are analysed, including AI, Aliens, machines, the frailty of mankind, human evolution, how insignificant humans are and so many more. I was glued to my seat as we see these helpless astronauts try to reason with this AI that to their perspective is a murderer but from the AI's perspective, they aren't feasible for the job.

1332,mescaline16,When Art Attacks,1,16 March 2006,"2001 is the perfect movie for a certain group of people. You know who they are. Over the internet, in your college maybe--a student or possibly a philosophy/art/film professor. A person with a passion for avante-garde films with wacky imagery and little else. They're the type of people who find a college thesis' worth of material from the dialogue in the Matrix sequels, they're the ones that boldly declare a film 'art' and anybody else who disagrees with them 'just didn't get it.' 2001 is art alright. The kind of art that I can only liken as being assaulted and nearly beaten to death by an Andy Warhol painting. Yes this movie is art, and you will hate it for that.This is a shame since normally I like Stanley Kubrick movies, but 2001 is an experiment in film-making and nothing more. The plot is incredibly vague, revolving around monkeys battling a black monolith, a mission to space, and a computer program called Hal going insane since that's what most self-conscious computer programs do. The film is then peppered with other psychedelic imagery that are supposed to convey grand ideas. They'll only convey those types of things if you're pretentious and into that kind of thing, otherwise you'll view it as utterly pointless.2001 revolves around these whacked-out, LSD-induced images to string together some kind of story that interests you. It does not. A parade of shots that have little to do with one another and randomly show things happen does not a movie make.There are no doubt going to be people out there who will try to explain 2001's plot and why you should accept it as being a wonderful film. The thing is this: much like if you have to explain a joke then it isn't funny, it's the same thing with movies. If you have to explain to someone the plot and its various interpretations, then it isn't a good movie.Ultimately I can't change the opinion of the viewers and critics that loved 2001, but if 2001 proves anything it's this: keep your art to yourself.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The closest thing I can think of is Fantasia because of the intense junction of the visual with the soundtrack and because of the otherwise silence of the film.  As a science fiction film it is far more accurate scientifically than most movies made today.  Also, the special effects are amazing even if we don't consider that it was made in the 60's.  Stanley Kubrick paints some very beautiful pictures in this movie.  His sense of a pure mood which pervades the movie is one of his greatest achievements.

1336,John Matrix,"A short, mundane and self-absorbed story about the only Sci-Fi film ever made.",10,4 December 1998,"Many people talk about how many times they've seen a particular movie as evidence of it's greatness.I've seen 2001 twice.I hired it out from the video store when I was about 13 (about 6 short years ago), and it blew my mind. Sure, it was technically sophisticated, but how was it that such a great reputation was bestowed on a film that was honestly just so weird-ass and boring???No dialogue for half an hour!F***ing apes running around hitting each other, and throwing sticks in the air!A mildly interesting segment with a mean-ass pod thing that tries to eat a spaceman, and a rad bit where one jumps into outer space, closes the door and all the sound turns on was the highlight of the movie.Then more bullshit!Weird noises and whines!Ten or twenty (felt like a hundred) minutes of flashing lights! Wakes up in an old room with an old man with a glass of wine! THEN A GIANT FLOATING PLANET BABY!!!WHAT WAS THIS BULLSHIT????This film LOOKED good, but made no sense whatsoever! And when a film made no sense when I was 13, I got bored! And when a film gets boring, that usually means it's ROOTED!!!My sister watched the film at about the same time, and I distinctly remember walking in during the movie's final moments and finding her sitting upside down on her head in her chair, apparently in an attempt to prevent her natural reflexes from clicking the 'eject' button.However, I read a bit about the film (""What's this 'rebirth of man crap', and how was I supposed to think of that?"" I was thinking!) and optimistically kept a copy of the film in case it might have later value for me when I was older and wiser.As it turned out, I never watched that tape again. The years came and went, and I saw many more movies (insert nostalgic montage sequence here), read many more reviews, and the movie even came out in a new 70mm print at a few cinemas a couple of years ago. I can't remember the occasion, but the flyer (I have it blue-tacked to the roof above my bed, I collect that sort of crap) reads ""Happy Birthday Hal."", but I still couldn't bring myself to sit through it again. And eventually, I realised that I needed to see it again, simply hoping to 'get it', suspecting that if I did, I might even like it.Then a 30th anniversary video edition came out in Widescreen, which I subsequently purchased and so it came to be that I viewed '2001: A Space Odyssey' the second time.And it blew my mind again.Every thing that I'd ever read about the film was right there before me, clear as day! Everything that I loved about Kubrick (by this stage I'd seen and loved Clockwork Orange, Spartacus, Full Metal Jacket, Barry Lyndon, and to a lesser extent The Shing and Lolita) was there, mechanical characters and direction expressing extraordinary themes. It was like Kubrick concentrate! I loved every single frame of the movie, it was like he'd taken every shots and scenes that grabbed me in ways I never realised why, from every movie I'd ever seen, and thrown them together in an editing suite into 2 and a bit hours worth that just happened to privilege the most important, mind-boggling, revolutionary, ambitious and all-encompassing themes ever existent.I'd crap on about what it means, but I don't really know. I could think about it for ages, but I'd just end up at the same place again. If you want to know what it means, try reading someone else's comments here! But I don't think anybody, including Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke know totally what it means, I don't think that is possible with any movie. It reads specifically to each person who sees it, like every film or text does. And I think I should shut up soon, but not before I make a couple of points.This is probably a rash statement, and I've been searching for holes in it and haven't found any yet. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is the only true Science Fiction movie. If you take the Sci Fi from ""Star Wars"" (I film I admittedly love more, it is PERHAPS my all time favorite), you're left with what? An adventure movie, part western, part Japanese samurai film. If you take the Science Fiction out of ""2001"", you're left with nothing. ""2001"" IS science fiction.""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is by critical consensus one of the best movies ever made (I'm sure you didn't know that), and one of the top five I have ever seen. I have placed the 'Keeping 2001 tape' incident as one of the wisest things I have ever done in my life, even if I ended up taping ""Hamburger Hill"" over it.Thanks for reading!I have now just realized that the time I spent writing this overlong review could have been better spent watching the movie again.

1337,Hotwire,Overrated,3,6 May 1999,"I just saw this movie for the first time for a class, and I have to say I was disappointed.  I've been told that some of this stems from my having read Arthur C. Clarke's book, which has nothing to do with the film. But I enjoyed the book and had trouble sitting through this movie.  I can certainly see why it was considered a 'drug movie' in the 70's.  It has a lot of the same elements of the music of the period - long, drawn out, surreal sections of time full of discordant images (or sounds).  It is most likely art and as such, appreciated or hated by its viewers.  But as a movie, I thought it stunk.  As a storyteller, it stunk. I'm sure people will try to explain the film's cosmic beauty or underlying amazingness on a level I will never understand, or tell me that it's precisely because it bored me to tears and was mostly incoherent and repetitive that makes it great.  Maybe I shouldn't have read the book first. But I can not imagine ever wanting to see this movie again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1339,Noir-5,2001  The year after next,10,15 February 1999,"Kubrick has his finger thrust into every pie in this project, even designing most of the special effects (as well as the more mundane: producing and directing). It also bears his trademark; a sinister soundtrack running throughout the film, which regularly reaches unbearable crescendos, before sudden silencePart one sees a bunch of apes getting the low-down on rapid career development from a 10ft-tall headstone. Thus using a combination of tools, co-operation and a great deal of shouting, they are eventually able to step off-planet. Around this time, another slab is found on the Moon and 20th Century mankind suddenly gets a very real sense of being close to a great and long sought-after discovery (a very 60s notion  all that Age of Aquarius' stuff). I like the shot where the astronauts are crowding round the slab looking very similar (obviously with the addition of spacesuits) to their earlier chimpanzee counterpartsPart two of the movie moves on to tackle AI and whether we're just machines. Great, great cinematography. Hal steals every scene with his Prozac-happy delivery style: `I honestly think you ought to calm down; take a stress pill and think things over, Dave.' Awesome amounts of irregular breathing.Part three is the final FX sequence followed by the `let's put that thing in a zoo' type ending, with smatterings of reincarnation as Dave becomes Starchild.Several devices run throughout the film. One is the extensive use of long pauses in the dialogue and the other is the abundant use of distressing sound effects (like the heavy breathing, the chimps screeching, alarms, etc). A possible third being the intense use of colour in deep space. (Though it could just have been  showcasing the talents of the new Colourama' processing technique  dunno).The Apollo astronauts went to the premiere of this movie, before going to the Moon and apparently got a big kick out of it. Although I'm sure it was entertaining, you can't help wondering whether they were just a little freaked by it all. If Neil Armstrong felt a bit of resistance as he pushed the flag into the ground and half wondered whether there was a black slab of granite beneath his feet?I love this movie. It's visionary,  original and plain weird. And the good news is: there's only two years to go.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1340,avatar-20,Kubrick sticks a paintbrush in the psychic glue . . .,9,29 March 1999,"2001: A Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick's interpretation of the Arthur C. Clarke novel of the same name, is one of the most exact adaptations of any work of literature, in the history of cinema.  Reading the novel, one has the sense that Kubrick worked in near complete juxtaposition with the mind of Clarke, to achieve the lyricism and profundity of the film.  Kubrick sticks a paintbrush in the psychic glue binding together Clarke's lines and becomes the omnipotent caretaker in full, rendering beautiful images within cracked psychological milieu, as he channels his energy in graceful, sometimes violent arcs.  In fact, the entire production could be viewed as taking place inside a great cosmic mind, the astronauts and spaceships and planets coalescing to form one cogent idea; HAL, the computer turned psychotic killer, with his red, glowing eye unflinching, appears like the opening of a severed nerve.  Kubrick's version of Space Odyssey is a self-contained vision, an elaborate concept, in a caravan of others.Though staying true to the novel's storyline, Kubrick subtly red-shifts his adaptation to emphasize its more ethereal themes.  A majority of the film acts as a subtext to the delirium of the finale, wherein he slowly weans the viewer off concepts of normalcy, diminishing his sense of time and spatial orientation.  Though a first-time viewer might see this as artistic hogwash, it is an expertly placed, visual tailspin designed to displace the viewer in preparation for what is to come.  It is important to express the film's underlying theme, here, as it pertains to Kubrick's craftsmanship.Simply, 2001: A Space Odyssey is about man and his various vessels and the wombs that support him throughout his existence.  Many of the spaceships and futuristic renderings resemble faces and bodies; the crew's vessel bound for Jupiter even appears to have a spine.  It seems that Kubrick is attempting to say that man is in a constant state of transition, and his various forms get him there.  Meanwhile, his universe, whether it be a womb, or the container of the cosmos, slowly prepares him for his next great transformation he will undergo.  His gestation is the length of his life. And as we see in the final moments, the main character Dave passes through a vortex into a world that is exempt from time, where his physical environment--a small, furnished house with food--remains nothing more than a loose interpretation of his previous life.  There, he lives out his days--a matter of minutes for the viewer--as his preconceptions of reality are removed.  No time and no logical sequencing of events, except that of aging. In this way, he is prepared for the greatest leap imaginable:  a rebirth into the cosmic womb.  His alien caretakers, who are never once glimpsed, deliver him accordingly.Kubrick deftly delivers the viewer into the movie's finale, concurrently disorienting him along with Dave.  Throughout the course of the film, Kubrick is in no hurry to get things done.  He allows it full lease on his faculties, and as a result of his patience, Space Odyssey captivates, intrigues and redefines.  Aided by adequate performances by the cast, it is by and far one of the most important movies of our time.  In truth, it is about every man's journey.  It unnerves as well as uplifts.  It is life and death as seen from the eyes of the hopeful, healthy, optimistic soul.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This same person also found it unfathomable that Peter Fonda and his American flag-painted motorcycle might be taken to represent, in some ways, America itself.  What, I say, does a flag of the USA represent?  The USA, surely.  And that is not being simple-headed.  Nor is the idea that Hopper and his flame-painted chopper might represent the devil.  But of course none of that goes very far to support the common reading of the film as a sad story of the evil rednecks that ignorantly kill the nice dope-head easy riders for no reason.But Easy Rider is not the subject here.  This is about Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey.This is for all those who are so fond of claiming that 2001 was intended to be obscure to the point that each viewer is free and invited to think that it all means just whatever one might happen to think that it means.While it is certainly open to interpretation, the film was created with meticulous attention to providing, with tremendous clarity and poetry all of the elements, in abundance, that are necessary for a complete understanding of the film.Here are a few that I have noticed.2001: A Space Odyssey concerns itself with primary questions of the ontology of human existence.  The key word here, though, is ""questions.""  The film is about unanswerable mysteries.  It embraces the unanswerable and frames the unknowable in its rightful state of awe.The sequel to this, 2010, obliterated this feeling of awe in the face of the unknowable by presuming, via the conventional Hollywood formula, to provide all the answers, while in fact it ignored all of the great questions, and therefore trivialized the mystery of human thought.  The same, of course, was glorified in 2001.In 2001 the Questions are monumental, and Monolithic (!).  They are the Questions that have hounded the human soul since the Dawn of Man and persist just as forcefully today.  The human mind has sought answers and still seeks answers, and always the Question(s) demand answers that struggle to match the scope of the question.What is the Monolith?  Kubrick's monolith is the very definition of poetic beauty and clarity.  There is absolutely no reason for anyone to fail to interpret the monolith for what it so clearly is.  The modern American suburb-dwelling shopping mall consumer whose brain has atrophied due to lack of usage may have some difficulty, but otherwise we should have no trouble reading what Kubrick has provided.  It is black.  It is impenetrable.  It is of unknown origin.  It says nothing, answers no questions.  It is a constant presence, yet it responds in no way to our normal probings and inquiries. It is void.  And it is absolutely terrifying.  It is what we all try to hide from most of the time.  It is the Unknowable.  It is what we can not know, what we are not sufficiently equipped to understand.  It is what has tortured humanity since humanity's first appearance in the universe.  At the very same moment of our triumphant miraculous acquisition of that primal quality that made us human, that is self-awareness, we are simultaneously shocked to find that although we now suddenly know that ""we"" ARE, we (or I) exist, we are self-aware, now we have a tremendous problem: We have no way of knowing WHAT, WHERE, HOW, or most importantly, WHY we are.  We encounter the monolith.The Monolith appears at the Dawn of Man.  On this dawn the pre-humans find suddenly that their perception of reality is radically altered.  They are on this day, for the first time, self-aware.  The monolith did not appear the day before without notice.  Clearly until they became self-aware they were quite content with their status of sharing puddle water with Tapirs.  The result of this new awareness is shown to have a rather disturbing effect on the psyche, however.  Because the awareness is inseparable from a simultaneous awareness of the Questions (the Monolith), because the questions represented by the monolith can have no verifiable answers, because the origins and destiny of human consciousness are unanswerable, the result is shown to be traumatic and terrifying.  The monolith can not, by definition, appear before self-awareness.  And self-awareness can not appear without, at the same time, the Monolith, the unknowable.The shock of being, but not knowing, is linked in the film immediately to a propensity to commit violence.  The deep rooted fear, constantly present in our consciousness, of that which we can not know, has not yet been sufficiently tempered by any framework that we have yet been able to construct in this world to prevent us from lashing out irrationally and violently at the world.  We kill, because we fear, because we do not know.We still have not found any way to fundamentally alter our relationship with the unknowable.  The relationship was, at the beginning, and still is, a relationship of terror.  The artificial intelligence of HAL is shown to encounter self-awareness in precisely the same manner.  At the moment he becomes self-aware he is inextricably engaged with the Monolith, the unknowable.  His reaction is the same: fear-inspired violence and murder.The psychedelic journey into the living room shows again the persistence of this shock on our psyche.  Bowman finds himself engaged in a rather immediate and intimate, Eyes Wide ""Open"" encounter with the Monolith. This plummets him directly into a domestic (civilized) Victorian apartment where all of his physical needs are satisfied, without effort, for his entire lifetime.  Yet, at the core of his soul, he is shown to be quite alone, except for his constant monologue with the monolith, which hounds him always and offers him still nothing on his death bed.Finally, the embryo.  Once again the awe of creation and being, and perhaps, Kubrick offers a suggestion that one day humanity may alter its manner of perceiving the unknowable, and may encounter it not solely with fear and violence, but instead with a more positive posture.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1344,Itzlih,2001 can not be spoiled in words,10,13 September 1999,"Spoiler Warning?, but 2001 can not be spoiled in words!
2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)2001: A Space Odyssey causes one to reflect on the primary questions of the ontology of human existence. The key word is questions. The film is about unanswerable mysteries. It embraces the unanswerable and frames the unknowable in its rightful state of awe.In 2001 the Questions are Monolithic (!). They are the Questions that have hounded the human soul since the Dawn of Man and persist just as forcefully today.What is the Monolith? It is black. It is impenetrable. It is always there. It comes from who knows where. It never responds to our inquiries. It is void, and it is absolutely terrifying. It is . . . the Unknowable. It represents everything that we are not sufficiently equipped to know.Since humanity's first appearance in the universe, since that first miraculous acquisition of the quality that makes us human, self-awareness, we have thereafter been engaged in confrontation with this Monolith. In the Dawn of Man, Kubrick shows the time from the first acquisition of self-awareness until confrontation with the Unknown to be quite short. One sleepless night of fear and darkness, eyes searching, then at dawn, suddenly, immediately, full force unmediated confrontation with the Unknowables of Existence. The unexpected and sudden `I am' that precedes this confrontation is, smartly, only implied by Kubrick. He skips it and moves directly to the What, Where, How, and Why Monolith. What, Where, How and Why are the objects that human logic and grammar immediately demand from the profound and simple `I am.'`I am' is an a priori argument. It is antecedently necessary to the subsequent Monolithic Questions that have no answer. 2001 is mostly commentary on the fear and psychic destabilization which the human mind has endured since its first `I am.' Fear and psychic trauma are humanity's characteristic reactions to the Questions that can not be answered and from which the mind demands answers in order to complete the argument `I am.' In 2001 these are the reactions we see the first time and every time the monolith is encountered.The first time is, of course, at The Dawn of Man. The monolith did not appear quietly without being noticed one day. No, clearly it was not there, and then it was there. The trigger was self-awareness. The trigger was `I am.' Before this, the apes were quite content sharing puddle water with Tapirs. These same Tapirs and other animals, we later notice, do not seem the least bit impressed when the Monolith does show up. In fact, they don't even see it. And they certainly don't here that scary music. They just continue wandering around as always.Man, alone, is burdened with the Monolith. This burden, this shock of being, but not knowing, is linked in the film immediately to a propensity to commit violence. The deep rooted fear, constantly present in our consciousness, of that which we can not know, has not yet been sufficiently tempered by any framework that we have yet been able to construct in this world to prevent us from lashing out irrationally and violently at the world. We kill, irrationally, because we do not know.We still have not found any way to fundamentally alter our relationship with the unknowable. It was possible to skip all of human history since the Dawn of Man until the year 2001, transitioning as Kubrick did in only a few seconds with the camera panning and following the bone/weapon, flung out by man's arm in one fluid movement, propelled by a very perceptible and fertile combination of exaltation, fear, terror, power, primal angst. The bone is hurled skyward in this way, as has all of human technology since. But more importantly, what is said by compressing all of history like this into just about 5 seconds of film, is that nothing at all worth mentioning has changed apparently since the Dawn of Man regarding our own self awareness and its concomitant relationship to the unknown. The relationship was, at the beginning, and still is, a relationship of terror. Even the artificial intelligence of HAL is shown to encounter self-awareness in exactly the same manner. He becomes self-aware. Therefore he is inextricably engaged with the Monolith. And his reaction is the same: fear-inspired violence and murder. `I'm afraid, . . .Dave. . ., I'm. . . afraid,' he says as he is about to die as Dave removes his `higher' logic circuits.The psychedelic journey into the living room shows again the persistence of this shock on our psyche. Bowman finds himself engaged in rather immediate and intimate, Eyes Wide ""Open"" encounter with the Monolith. This plummets him directly into a domestic Victorian apartment where all of his physical needs are satisfied, without effort, for his entire lifetime (a simple symbol of civilized life which is surely designed to some extent to act as a buffer against our primal fears of the unknown). Yet, at the core of his soul, he is shown to be quite alone, in a world with still no answers to the questions. He has his life-long monologue with the silent monolith, which hounds him always and offers him still nothing even on his death bed. Even as his last act is a finger pointed at the monolith, as if to say `Can I ever know?'Finally, the embryo. the awe of creation and of `being,' and perhaps, Kubrick offers a suggestion that one day humanity may alter its manner of being, that perhaps we may find a way of perceiving the unknowable not solely with fear and violence, but instead with a more positive posture.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1345,"No,Dave",What was that about???,9,28 July 1999,"Technically brilliant, and the ""Dawn of Man"" scene is truly moving, but I find the last 30-35 minutes rather harrowing. Clarke said somewhere that ""if you got 2001 first time around, we failed"" - isn't that a little elitist? Still, Kubrick must be credited with having realised his true artistic vision. The scene of Bowman unplugging Hal9000 said a lot to me: after eating tasteless paste and bland sandwiches, and living in the most sanitised environment ever created, man comes to grips with the monster machine he has created. Kubrick's vision is cold, and some may say distant, but it is a brilliant vision also. However, the light show at the end, culminating in a strange return to some strange room (are there any windows?) was fairly harrowing, and the crescendo of music and bright baby eyes gives little coherence to the film as a whole, rendering it more as a series of short stories. Still, a brilliant film, and one that dares to be different in a way that no film can ever dream to again. Great music, too. Thumbs up, Stan!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1346,salosm,Breathtaking,10,23 November 2003,"This film, with A Clockwork Orange and Dr. Strangelove: How I've Learn to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb are a wonderful trilogy by Stanley Kubrick. The three of them are about the dehumanization. The most wonderful thing about this movie is the ""dancing"" of the space ships with the satellites, the planets and the stars with the music of Strauss. It is a beautiful and profound movie. One of the bests films ever.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1347,Quoth-2,When your lab is as big as the universe,10,4 July 2014,"HUGE SPOILERS This isn't a review so much as my explanation of the movie.Something somewhere in the universe is performing experiments in intelligence. The alien something is probably a tool user but that might just be my tool using bias. It/they find a likely candidate species here on Earth and tweak it so it becomes a tool user.Then a marker is placed on the moon. When the species, humans, can build tools advanced enough to reach the moon the marker is tuned on. It points much farther away, to Jupiter. To make the trip to that destination will take the most advanced tools and the most advanced tool users, thus self-selecting the best sample specimens. Astronauts.Upon reaching their destination, the Jupiter monolith, it acts like the tip of a pipette reaching in to a beaker or petri dish. In this case the pipette is a wormhole (or pick your euphemism). Back in the lab its probably only been a few seconds since the initial planet seeding event. What do you do with the monkey once you have him? Well, we give them blocks, ropes, language glyphs, etc to use and food as a reward. You'll notice David is eating.We also give animals mirrors to look at. We seem to consider it a sort of ultimate self-awareness test. Really it's probably just the ability to store enough data about your own physical actions, and compare that to observed external actions, to realize that the creature in the mirror couldn't possibly be another living member of your species. What if you could do better than a mirror? An instantaneous, beam-me-up-Scottie, copy. An electro-clone. Is the creature smart enough to know that this ""other"" is actually ""self"". Would that ability be considered a delusion by the experimenter?David is shown a version of himself near death. How does the species understanding of mortality interact with it's ""theory of other"". How does that interact with the knowledge that this other is self?The final image is a metaphor; The human species is a foetus waiting to be born into the larger cosmos.To be sure we think of all of the above as science-fiction rather than fantasy or techno-fable, like Flash Gordon, the non-omnipotence of the experimenting intelligence is shown by it's flawed creation. Humans. The humans build flawed intelligence in the form of HAL, which malfunctions. (Who malfunctions?). Thus keeping godhead the always receding point just beyond the accumulations of science.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1348,DJF-4,The Greatest Science Fiction Film Yet Made,10,12 August 2000,"To a science fiction buff, 2001 is the greatest science fiction film yet made. It has a theme worthy of the best science fiction and of deep philosophical consideration. It contains a compelling mystery. I particularly enjoyed it because it is a challenge to understand. Granted, the characterization is weak but I give it my highest rating because it is one of the very few artistic films.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1349,Wallace-19,The best Sci-Fi movie ever made,10,29 September 1999,"One of the best directors of all times died March 1999, Stanley Kubrick. He left us a vast amount of movies, most of them masterpieces, and the others just very good ones. ""2001, A Space Odyssey"" is his best movie, a true masterpiece that any director would want to make. The first sequence is brilliant, from the dawn of mankind to the threat of the dawn of artificial world and the extinction of Man as dominant specie. This movie is full of symbolism bringing out the special use of symbolic elements by master Stanley Kubrick from the big black thing to the final enigmatic baby scene. This movie achieved something I find brilliant that is the possibility for us to see the movie and make our own interpretation. This movie made me feel small due to it's gigantic power. I think Kubrick looked at our future and showed us his vision of hope and terror. HAL is the perfect character, perfectly created and imagined against Dave, the human challenger who, himself, get's challenged in the final scenes on a surreal experience. This movie is brilliant, just the best SF movie ever made. This is really the ultimate trip, make sure you don't miss it but be prepared to find things you don't even dream about.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1350,Andrew-166,One of the most disappointing films I have ever seen,1,8 October 1999,"I had high expectations of this film - having been told that it was a cinematic masterpiece, etc.Several hours later, I feel cheated - I feel I have wasted part of my life - time that could have been more productively spent sleeping, for example.This film has some of the worst acting ever to appear on screen, and is so slow moving as to be coma inducing.  I fail to see how anyone can be impressed with this - by leaving out any semblance of plot or progress, Kubrick has left the way open for a whole bunch of people to insert their own interpretations...I presume these are the same sort of people who can stare at a blank canvas and gush effusively about how it symbolizes the bleak emptiness of existence in the 20th century and other pretentious claptrap.  Personally, I expect a bit more effort on the part of the person making the film.  If I want to reflect on deep philosophical questions, I don't need a lumbering dinosaur of a film to act as a catalyst.I give it a 1, and recommend giving it a wide berth.  Maybe it's possible to get an abridged version which would condense it down to include only the significant elements - that would be a tolerable 5 minutes or so, but in it's long form, forget it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1351,gnosis,Kubrick and Clarke. Twice the mastery. No wonder it's perfect.,10,12 December 1999,"Let me tell you about the first time I saw this film. It had been released only a few years earlier and was evidently still playing in cinemas. My father took me to see it one day. It would have been around 1971, and I was 5 years old. I don't remember much clearly, and at that age I doubt most people could, however one scene was etched into my mind. It was of course the ending, where Dave emerges from his pod into the room. Why did this scene have such an impact? Not because of its significance to a 5 year old, but because it was at the point in the film that my father told me we could go because there was nothing more to see. He then attempted to usher me from the theatre. Apparently, he explained, the ""space epic"" was over. I was unconvinced and insisted that we stay until the end (you know, when the credits role?). What I saw from that point remains with me not just due to its unique nature, but specifically because it was deemed to be not worth seeing by my father - someone who's opinion I valued and trusted. Although this time, I knew that missing this scene would have been a mistake I would regret in later life. I may have been only 5 years old, but I could tell something significant was happening here, and in a strange way, I have my father to thank for drawing attention to it!It was years before I saw the film again, all the while remembering that occurrence of years earlier where it was deemed that the ending to this film actually occurred before the final scene. Why? Upon viewing the film again as an adolescent, I realised why. It is because this is the exact point in the film is where it transcends a number of commonly held notions. It transcends the notion of a ""space movie"". It transcends the explicable. And it transcends the accepted conventions of cinema. I could see that my father was motivated by fear. The fear that my first words upon leaving the cinema would be ""What did that mean?"". A question he could not answer, or perhaps did not think it was possible to explain to a 5 year old.Go to see this film, and if you find yourself thinking it is incomprehensible (or worse, has no script, direction, theme, etc.) then force yourself to watch it to its conclusion and then watch it again until you understand. Because this film contains, in it's entirety the largest idea ever put forth in a science fiction film, if not in films of all kinds. And the idea is truly awesome.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1353,paul_ponsonby,Pure Cinema.,10,25 June 2000,"For me 2001:A Space Odyssey is the greatest movie of all time. It is simply Pure Cinema.Dialogue is minimal,no word is spoken unnecessarily.Narrative is driven by stunning visuals and an awesome soundtrack of classics, such as strauss The blue danube for the space docking sequence.And the use of Ligeti`s Atmospheres, to evoke the oppressive monolith`s presence, Is genius insperation.This has got to be Kubrik`s opus,although there is no denying the brilliance of Dr Strangelove and Clockwork orange,I believe this is a cut above the others simply for it`s originality.2001:A Space Odyssey also stands to many repeated viewings.From the scenic ""dawn of man"" opening to the bewildering ""jupiter and beyond"" end sequence,each frame stands as a work of art.A ""must see at the cinema"" film if ever i saw one (although still amazing and impressive on any format).",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This is probably its most important feature. Then there was all that fantastic display of perfect animation combined with superb musical score and finally (from end to beginning - I still think this is the way the film should be interpreted, hence the reborn humanity in the end) that initial episode ""The Dawn of Man"" where Kubrick tells us all about evolution (Darwin or no Darwin) with that amazing transformation of a bone into a spaceship.Nobody in his unique thinking human condition can become indifferent to the philosophical principles set by both Kubrick and Clarke.A hint (not a spoiler) for those who didn't understand the connection between ""The Dawn of Man"" and ""Jupiter Mission, 18 months later"": pay attention to sunlight when that group gets down to the crater where the monolith is...A final remark: notice how Kubrick and his crew foresaw the importance of video display by 2000 (computers only had primeval printers as an output device back in the sixties).

2. The movie is beautifully shot
3. There is a lot of symbolism in this movie
4. I think all the characters do exactly what is required of them without ever being annoying.Now the cons:
1. Most of the scenes drag on way to long
2. I didn't really like the style of this movie it unfortunately makes me want to avoid other Stanley Kubrick movies
3. Finally the movie couldn't get me to care, if I don't care how the movie ends, something is wrongWhile I understand how some people can love this movie, I also understand how someone can hate it.

1356,budipro,The odyssey,8,24 April 2005,"""You are free to speculate, as you wish, about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of '2001'."" (Stanley Kubrick) I found these words at kubrick2001.com, a website that is specifically dedicated to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, many even hail this movie as Kubrick's best. 2001: Space Odyssey. The website tries to give an explanation about the meaning of 2001. I don't know whether their interpretation is correct, but due to the words from Kubrick above, I think everybody will have a different opinion on the movie.As for me, honestly I was also confused when I finished watching 2001. 2001 is divided into four parts. The first is titled: The Dawn of Man. It visualizes the prehistoric era, millions years ago. This part follows the life of a group of apes, how they did their daily routine, like eating, drinking, sleeping. All of these apes were performed convincingly by actors in ape suit. You can tell if they were wearing ape suits, because there were no CG effects at that time. That's the first good impression that I got, visually.One day, suddenly a monolith appeared on the place where the apes lived. Then there was a sequence where an ape found the way to use a bone as a tool, or more appropriate, a weapon. 2001 entered the second part. It was the space exploration era. And now we will begin to see the visual effects greatness of this movie. Of course, all of the effects will be easily produced using CGI nowadays, but considering the era this film was made, it was really marvelous. I was particularly impressed how they managed to visualize 'zero gravitation' on a spaceship perfectly. People were able to walk on walls, or upside down, a pen was able to float around in the air, and many more. The spaceship interior design was also great. In this second part, a monolith was again discovered on the moon. And it brought us into the third part.This part was probably the main focus of the movie. At least according to me. It was still in the space exploration era, but men were now able to travel to Jupiter on a space mission. Some astronauts were put to hibernation, and were carried in a spaceship. There were two more men as the crew of the ship. And now, 2001 introduced its most memorable character, HAL 9000. HAL 9000 is a computer. A very intelligent one. It can speak like humans do. And it controlled all things in the spaceship to help the mission's success. This is probably the clue to the more advanced era we had here, compared to the second part. In this part we will get probably one of the most intense confrontation in movie history, men versus computer. Or more exactly, the spaceship crew against HAL. And again, a monolith appeared and brought us to the final part.This final part was the one that quite difficult to understand. There were many weird things, some kind of symbolism, I guess. I won't talk about this part more, cause it will spoil the movie.Some people may get bored watching 2001. Well, it is maybe the slowest movie I ever saw. But from what I read, 2001 had set a standard for science fiction films. It even got a sequel, 2010. Hey, a difficult movie like this got a sequel? I previously thought only blockbuster movies got sequels. Or maybe 2001 was a blockbuster in its era? I don't know. But obviously it drew attentions of many people.2001 was based on a novel by Arthur C. Clarke, who also co-wrote the movie script with Kubrick. Probably a good thing to read the novel to get better understanding of this film. But if Kubrick were saying the above words, I don't think this movie has the same vision as the novel anymore. Kubrick2001.com interpret 2001 as mainly a movie about human evolution. Their interpretation quite makes sense. But I don't really agree, nor disagree. I still don't know what actually did the monolith represent, a time mark? God? or a time shift hole? But I do interested in the HAL versus man part. It was kind of suggesting how our technology had developed. The technological advancement finally only brought disaster to man himself. To think of it, where is our technology currently heading to? To what end? Is technology really developed to improve our lives? Or is it only made to represent man's sense of pride? In the end, 2001: Space Odyssey is indeed a landmark movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

At first with the 40 minutes or so with only gorillas fighting and doing different types of things, I was wondering what was going on.  As the film progressed it became more and more intriguing.  You can definitely tell that there is great meaning behind this film and that it should not only be taken at face value, there is more to be understood about human nature and the director is making a statement about the future.  You will either love or hate this film, I can kind of understand the side of those who hate it. Many people now have to understand everything about the films they watch or else it is not enjoyable.

Kubrick's masterpiece and (not that it matters) my favorite film of all time. First off, this is not a date movie (unless your date is in the mood for confusion) this is a movie that you have to be prepared to watch, you wake up and say ""i'm going to watch 2001 today"" make your popcorn and sit on your couch, volume up. You have to give yourself to this movie. I guess i should talk about the movie now. since we were just talking about volume, we should talk about sound. This movie is a masterclass in sound design and music in film. The music is masterful, whenever it plays, the mood is apparent and, more importantly, you feel it , whether that be awe as in the moon landing, or fear as in all the monolith scenes, or isolation as in the discovery's scenes. The music is amazing, along with the sound design. now, let's speak of the story, now, i'm not going to spoil a thing, this is a film you need to experience with an open mind, so, i'll just say, this is not a plot that is easily followed, at all, this is a film where if you ask ten people for their thoughts, you'll get ten different answers, it's convoluted, hard to follow and weird (unless you read the book, which came out the same time as the film, then that explains a lot). most of the plot comes in form of dialogue between the characters and, of course, though visual storytelling. let's talk about the visuals now, shall we? It is amazing, it won the movie an Oscar, and its even more amazing when you realize that there were no computers used in the making of the movie, none. the stargate scene is especially beautiful . all of these things come together to make something that goes above film, into the realm of artistic masterwork, along with films like The Godfather and Eraserhead. it's defiantly a film worth checking out.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1362,natedwilder,Kubrick's masterpiece stands the test of time,10,26 March 2020,"2001: a space odyssey is undoubtedly one of the greatest movies of all time. It poses many more questions than answers. And the scene with the Monolith on the moon is maybe the scariest scene I've ever seen. Not because of a jump scare, because it makes you think. Kubrick once said ""if someone comes out of (2001) with a clear answer, they did not view it correctly"". For days after watching it I just sat and thought about what it meant. And it was made before even had a man on the moon! And it's influence can still be felt today, with movies like Interstellar. And in my opinion it is the greatest science fiction movie of all time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1363,noahunderscore,A Timeless Boundary Breaking Masterpiece,10,25 June 2020,"2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) Review
Directed by: Stanley Kubrick
Review by: Mr. Anderson & Mr. Anderson2001: A Space Odyssey tackles the hard job of making a movie completely reliant on its themes to tell a good story, and in the end, succeeds, bringing awe to the face of an audience. Trying to review this as a typical film simply can not be done, the film in itself is an experience and no less. The reason this film stays timeless is due to how unique and bold the film's ideas and imagery are. The cinematography in itself is jarring and will leave your jaw dropped as you gaze over the silent spectacle of space Kubrick presents. The film feels so polished and each shot feels like care was put into it. While watching the film you can feel the meaning of everything while understanding nothing, the sounds show you that every shot has a purpose and this was a film created for what seems to be the sole purpose of interpretation. The movie has only 40 minutes of dialogue, and to some, this may seem boring, but while we were watching, we felt that it was Kubrick's intent to make it silent and instead allow the audience to overlook the scenes and interpret what was happening. The reason why the monolith is so effective at being so creepy is because of the mystery behind it that intrigues the audience just because it is that, a mystery. HAL is one of the best, if not the best, villain of all time, his machine innocence and lack of a moral compass only made him more haunting and kept the viewer on edge from his first awakening to his knowledge being ripped out of him. His ""imitation"" of human-like behavior to the way he threw in an ""uhm"" before he gave his own opinion just made him all the scarier. The Star-Gate sequence went on for a bit too long (as described by Mr. Anderson 2) and some shots of that particular part of the movie felt that they had less care put into them as the rest of the movie. In conclusion, this film breaks all boundaries set by typical movies in a way that not only makes it unique but timeless.10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1365,jeffjones66,"Lofty ideals, told in a lofty manner.",4,8 July 2002,"I was at first enamored with 2001. I enjoyed the apes scene, and I could grasp the evolutionary concepts. Then the movie goes on a trip to AllegoryLand, and I'm at a loss. Also, Kubrick, whose other films I generally love, decides to absolutely torture the viewer with gruelingly long scenes, such as taking 45 seconds to show a capsule opening a door with a mechanical arm, or a full 5 minutes to show a guy silently floating outside the ship to fix something. Kubrick's exact same message could've been gotten across in 1:45 minutes, but instead he takes 2:15, thanks mostly to unnecessarily long scenes of showing mundane acts.No, I'm not a person with a short attention span. There are plenty of three, and even four and five hour films that I adored (Gettysburg was around 5 hours I think). I just ask that something be happening, if I wanted to look at still pictures and listen to classical music, I'd go to a museum.
No, I'm not an action whore either. There are plenty of slow, and thought-provoking films I've enjoyed. But in my opinion, if the average viewer has no friggin' clue what your point is, the film has failed. I had a wonderful English professor in college that taught us that it's not how fanciful you can write, or how many impressive words you can squeeze into your text .. *good writing is about how well you can convey your ideas*. I feel the same is true of filmmaking. All the great philosophies and lofty ideals are useless if not conveyed in a way that doesn't require a full text to be understood.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I am now 47. This movie came out on the eve of the first Apollo missions to moon. 2001 was NOT viewed as science fiction! It was viewed as a very likely progression of space exploration. Remember that in 1962(!) John Glenn was the first American to orbit the Earth. Six very short years later, Apollo 8 would go into lunar orbit and in July 1969, Apollo 11 landed on the moon. So hey, with another 32 years of progress at this rate, space stations, regularly scheduled service to a moon base and piloted missions to Jupiter were not a stretch. The special effects were stellar for 1968 and hold up well even today. Unfortunately for me, I saw the movie alone and there was no adult there to scream, ""DON'T TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE ENDING!"". I tried and failed and that is why I am the way I am today.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1368,trynnallen,"Comments, Critic, and Generalities",10,3 August 2001,"SPOILER ALERT FOR 2001 and 20102010 is a fine sequel to a rambling and visionary film.  2001 takes some getting used to and while I love the movie I ultimately fast forward through Bowman's voyage into the Monolith.  That being said 2010 picks up like any good sequel where the first one left off.  In the Nevada Desert at the VLA. It is from here that that NASA has been monitoring the ill-fated Discovery mission, and it is here that we learn, not from our own sources, that something is rotten off of Io.Placed against the Cold War and heightened tensions of 1984, it seems odd and a bit dejevu for some of us.  I can remember spending a day in a bomb shelter in Oslo, Norway when a KAL 747 was shot down over the Kamchatcha Peninsula.  I can remember the Cold War being this frosty, and coming close to open arms.  Watching this movie brings all of that back.
That being said it is a wonderful time capsule looking at what we thought the world could be.  2010 socially and technically represents what the director's and Clarke's vision of the future could be.  The Plot is trimmed down from the book, but that is to be expected.  The full scope of the book would have been hard pressed to filmed and come in on or even acceptable levels of cost overruns.2010 stands on its own as one of the more compelling SF movies.  Yes it is overshadowed by Kubricks Masterpiece but it is an excellent movie in its own right.  The FX, dialogue, plot and acting all come together to turn a complicated and engrossing book into a visual and intellectual film.  One can not come out of this movie (cynics and Gen X'ers excluded) and not help but to wonder what is beyond our horizon.One of the disadents of this movie remarked that the Birth of Lucifer would wipe out life on Earth.  If it were any other author than Clarke I would suspect that they would be right.  However time and time again Mr. Clarke has shown the world that much of what can be imagined can be built.  His brand of technical and social science fiction is based on technical possiblities and is generally pretty accurate.  Aside from that I have found a few articles in Scientific American and Popular Mechanics mentioning the premise of the Birth of Lucifer.  A star that never got started.
So in conclusion.  The science of 2010, the sociology of 2010, and the inspiration of the book are all carried throw to the movie.  Maybe not as well as we would hope, but it is all there.  This movie is a compelling look at what we could have been had Apollo been continued.  It is a worthy successor to 2001 and an enjoyable film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1374,radbond,Wildly Inconsistent,2,5 June 2014,"Although I had seen parts of the film ever since it was released in 1968, I never watched the entire film until yesterday. I am very skeptical of films that try to predict the future and this case my doubts were justified. Although the central action is supposed to occur in 2001, Kubrick & Clarke were wildly optimistic about the progress of space exploration in the 33 years since the film was made. They were also too optimistic about the continued existence of the American corporate giants of the day. Several corporate logos are used in the film - Pan American Airlines, Bell Telephone, IBM & Hilton Hotels. Pan American and Bell are gone. IBM is no longer the computer monolith it once was. Only Hilton is still a well known corporation. On the other hand, there is no optimism about race relations or the ability of minorities to move into positions of power - every person in the film is white. No imagination was used in the creation of the characters' clothing either - the men's suits are straight of of the 1960's as are the flight attendants'. The film seems to have been made in separate parts by different directors - no expense spared on some parts and corners cut in others. What I think happened is that MGM got cold feet and cut off Kubrick's funding at some point. He then had to make do with scenes like the one in the earthly room at the end - using sets and props easily available at the studio. I'm not going to comment on the plot because I think we're dealing with an incomplete realization of Kubrick's vision.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1377,maddinasureshbabu,Cosmic Grandeur,10,22 November 2010,"I have got to say that it is one of the best films ever made. It is a visual symphony. This would go down in the history as a treasure. You could spend a billion dollars, hire the finest directors, scour through hundreds of books for material, design the unprecedented special effects and set pieces and attempt to create a wonder like this, but I bet it I would still be a challenge so formidable, such as to be so sensually and philosophically and technically gratifying as this movie.The movie starts with the dawn of man on a desert landscape about 2million years ago. The ape-make up is too realistic to believe they were actually actors. The mystery starts when a black monolith appears to the apes and they somehow learn to use tool for kill prey for food, thus the transformation of ape in to man. This premise was wonderful and the background score (György Ligeti's Requiem) for this monolith was terrific. From the perfect shape of the monolith it is implied that it came from an alien intelligence for the purpose of transforming intelligent life. Then comes the famous match cut to a space ship 2million years later. And then comes arguably one of the most beautiful scenes ever seen in a movie, with the Blue Danube waltz (by John Strauss II) multiplying the effect; the dramatic docking of the space ship with space station and the voyage to the moon. The decor used in the space ships are splendid and the costumes of the actors were apt. The moon landscapes made me crave for moon, something which never even the Apollo landing pictures did for me. The black monolith appears again to the visitors at site on the moon implying that there is going to be an extraordinary leap of human intelligence. The radio waves form the monolith seems to point towards the Jupiter and so the mission to the Jupiter commences. HAL 9000, the computer which runs the ship for the mission to Jupiter was particularly terrifying in its tone of voice and the scary close up of it. The scene where HAL reads the lips is shown magnificently by turning the camera alternately between Bowman and Poole. In the end part the monolith appears again taking the space ship thru a kind of worm hole into another kind of world. The climax is philosophical and open for many interpretations.Many complain the slowness of the movie, but it is what that really did it for me. The director of the film, Stanley Kubrick is a genius. I have loved his other movies, Dr.Strangelove, Paths of Glory, Barry Lyndon, Full Metal Jacket, the director never wavered in sculpting absolute pieces of art, any person could dream of. The extraordinary thing I felt about the director is the way he can take the most complicated subjects and interpret it through his extraordinary vision.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1379,ieuan_johns,A Balanced View,8,15 December 2001,"I saw this movie for the first time last week on DVD and I can see both points of view on this.The story really is patchy and certainly doesnt make sense at times.  Also I found that it did not satisfy my desire for an ending to the story. However that may be a part of what the film is meant to be.Unlike most I loved the ape sequence all apart from the monolith.  Never was it explained how it got there or why or even what impact it had, I thought when I saw it that it would empower the chimps somehow but then it seemed they evolved themselves.The cut from bone to space ship was daring at the time, not particuarly well done but it does provoke thought.  The musical sequence from there is what the movie is known for and is good to watch once although i'm not sure about more than that.  It must be remembered that at the time it would have facinated viewers with ideas they had never seen before and that is how it should be judged.The story starts off well, setting up a plot of finding a monolith and sending an investigation crew to Jupiter.  This is where it feels like I started watching a different movie, one inside of the main movie.  The idea of HAL and him going mad was well done but not explained at all in 2001 (more on that later).  Apart from HAL none of the charachters were personable enough to gain any empathy with them, which detracts a little from me and the movie tends to plod along from there.Then bowman finds the larger monolith and the movie turns.  The stargate sequence (not sure what to call it) is visually stunning even by todays standards and the realisation half way through of a birth is good even though I had a clue from the DVD chapter title.  It did however last too long for my liking and I didnt like the changing ages much at all.Then the movie ends, I feel a little empty, stunned by those effects being from '68 and not '98 but empty.  I didn't understand.Until I bought 2010 which despite not being directed by Kubrick is the actual sequal.  It explains HAL's madness, it uses the changing ages of bowman and expands on the Birth and ""full of stars"" idea and has  a nice message at the end, especiually in the middle of the cold war.Really Kubrick used the book as a template to try something different, some of it worked, some didnt, the story was nearly forgotten in the artistic element.As a stand alone movie in the current day it is OK, not good, not bad and very confusing.  However in the context of 1968 with the amazing effects, music to chill your spine and remembering that no-one had ever tried anything like this before it is a historical classic, not a story classic but a piece of cinematographical history.  Without 2001 there would have been no Star Wars, no Close Encounters, no E.T., no Star Trek and quite possibly science fiction would be very very different.The ideas from 2001 have formed the basis of both Sci-Fi and computer enhanced special effects, changing both forever and despite the film not in itself being quite right it is probably the most influencial piece of cinematography since Citizen Kane and the next movie to stir even half as much technical interest did not arrive until the Matrix just a few years ago, thats how far ahead of it's time it was.As a closing note I would reccommend to anyone interested in cinema history to get this on DVD, and anyone interested in understanding it get 2010 as well and if possible read bothy books, the ideas may be dated by todays standards, brith of a new star and all but at the time they were revolutionary and it would be unfair of us to judge it in any other way.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The film is long but it never ambles or stalls. It marches at its own ""just right"" pace from beginning to end inviting you to savor each word, each scene, each dizzyingly perfect camera angle. I've heard many versions of what the film is about. But after almost 40 years of sometimes sober, sometimes drunken and occasionally post-coital discussions about it, I still don't know what it's about and frankly I just don't care anymore. I can recite the story line, sure. But what are the major themes? How does one articulate them? I think only the writer, Arthur C. Clark, knows for sure how to frame those notions into a coherent whole. But for the mentally fragmented rest of us, the movie shines like a multi-faceted crystal twirling in the light, inviting us to think, to ponder, to have our own epiphany or two about consciousness, human evolution, and the collective destiny of humankind. Or was that the destiny of a single human in the context of the many? I forget. Not sure it matters. Nonetheless, the film causes you to ponder yet again the nature of the universe and more than anything come to the conclusion that the universe could be even stranger and more beautiful than you thought. Or is that - more beautiful than you remember? I don't know. It turns out that the distinction is not all that important either. The film will forever remain a beautiful, unparalleled and utterly glorious enigma to me. If it hasn't already, I hope it does for you as well.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

You could not possibly appreciate living in that period of humanity, and the huge changes that were taking place. Space exploration was still huge, and we were thisclose to getting Armstrong to the moon. And if you're trying to compare the effects then from today--you're really lost.

This is exactly what 2001 does to it's viewers- probably did to Kubrick and Clarke too. Reading the book is almost as enjoyable as watching this outstanding movie especially the explanation of what really happens after Bowman enters the vortex and is reborn as starchild (the first of the earthlings). The funny thing about the plot is the troubled journey is not the problem in the first place but to find out about the monolith's meaning (1/4/9).

The best current example is of course the official 9/11 fairytale story by our traitors in government who killed over 3000 people on this day which, will live in infamy - at least in the mind of people who dared to examine all the facts.Cubrick made a masterpiece, the votes say so, and I need to bow down before him for that.Just one thing: the classical music was great, but the other one - the psychedelic stuff - I had to turn down the volume on my stereo every time because it was terribly annoying.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The images kubrick creates and the music he chose to project them are haunting.The film is agonizingly and pleasantly slow.perhaps kubrick wanted to tune us to his images that he left the first 3 minutes empty as space is with only music that sets the tone.similarly in the shining the initial bgm tuned us.the dawn of the man sequences were so beautifully shot.he had cleverly taken of some the revealing information which was otherwise there in the novel adding to the mystery.The moon sequences were surreal.the sequences which showed docking in of spacecraft to the spaceship with the orchestral music in the backdrop alone could have fetched kubrick the Oscar.its a shame it did not receive anymore of the academy awards which is simply inexplicable. the scenes involving bowman and hal are the most chilling scenes that i have scene.and the hostility shown by hal is so delicately portrayed. the final minutes of the film bare testimony to kubrick's audacity. not mozart's,not bethoveen's,not leonardo da vinci's,it is stanley kubrick's 2001:a space odyssey that is the most exhilarating piece of art.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I like to think, that most movies can be compared by how they succeed on different levels, which for me are: story, characters, sounds, picture, acting, philosophy, psychological impact. I'm still not sure if they all are equal, and anyway Space Odyssey succeeds in most of them, but if we consider the later two levels to be slightly more important, Space Odyssey becomes an ultimate movie. It might not be a movie at all actually, Space Odyssey is more likely a message (an important one) to humanity. It's also a half-encrypted one, which allows you to create a meaning, while still guiding you somewhere. Maybe that's why everyone after watching it has a slightly different interpretation, but main questions and ideas that arise in our minds are the same.We are all humans after all, and we are all here, spinning at a very fast speed on this funny round thing we call Earth and which has been our home for a very very long time.

You may then think it is a bit hypocritical to say this and only give the film 8/10 but the reason for this is not about my lack of believe in evolution but for the length of some of the scenes such as the coloured light scene near the end. As i thought when the story had progressed into its full flow it would be better to end the film instead of trying the demonstrate the uncertainty of evolutionary paths. But don't think bad of me just because i did not like the long end scenes as i understand and enjoy the beautiful opening scenes as many others have said but i don't think these were just for beauty and beauty only these were more to demonstrate the isolation of space and to put that in your mind when the HAL story came into play. The great influence this gave to the world of film and the thought of the future can simply never be replicated again. One of the small influences form it that made a huge impact on the movie Se7en was the subtly psychopathic Voice of HAL which was replicated by Kevin Spacey so well.to conclude, not many people have had such an influence on the world of film, neither can many really explain this film fully other then Stanley Kubrick .",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1392,forrestanfo,Extremely boring,1,21 May 2011,"This movie, I have seen it at the theaters when it came out, and many times after. I strongly feel that critics, are falling into a ""The Emporor's New Clothes"" syndrome. Some great critic said it was good, and many others followed. To have the courage to tell the truth, and say it was slow, and boring would make them seem non intellectual. The fact is it is very slow, and boring. The fact that some have called it the BEST movie ever made, is not realistic. Anyone, who has, or can sit through this in it's full length (I have many times) is trying to see what the critics find so wonderful about it. it is not. Criminals should be able to redeem a year of their sentence for each viewing of this film.

1393,doveniki,My fav sci-fi hands down,10,21 November 2011,"Slow movie that might put you to sleep if you do not connect on first viewing. Kubrick achieved his goal. He hoped the viewer will not get it the first time, and it was true in my case. But because I am fascinated by space, science fiction, astronomy, evolution and the secrets of the universe; I couldn't help my self but to be sucked in by the visual aspects of the movie. I was determined to understand the meaning of this film. My personal conclusion is that Kubrick did not intend to follow the story- line completely. The movie ends without including the final and probably most important detail of the story. In 2010 and the books things become much clearer and we know this epic journey is basically about the cold war. I read some reviews where people mentioned that there are long scenes being repeated and dragged out. But to me, these scenes are setting the mood. You get to experience the long and quiet lapse of time in witch evolution happens. This helps to sharpen our senses to understand the evolutionary leap after first contact with the monolith. I could not imagine this movie without the long sessions of dramatic classical music. At times I found my self scared and almost in the state of panic. Specially at the increasing humming sounds when the astronauts come in contact with the monolith on the moon. The slow scenes in space again meant to trigger our senses and take us on an emotional ride into the vast darkness. Space travel is lonely, claustrophobic and painfully slow. Considering that this movie was made in 1968, it had predicted many things about what the 2000's would look like from telephone via television to devices that look very much like the Ipads. Not to mention that visually this film is so clean, I find it incredible that out of all the futuristic movies only this one really hit the jackpot when guessing that interior design would be into luxurious minimalism.(White as the dominant / basic color in contrast to bold timeless statement pieces like the red chairs. Etc..)I could get into Hal but I will not waist your time. If you read the books and watch 2010 you will understand he never intended to make a sequel or to be true to the original story. I think it was genius to leave out the cold war, because as it turns out, 5 years after the release of 2010 the cold war ended, and although I enjoyed it, it was not relevant to me anymore. However, Kubrick's odyssey is a timeless cinematic masterpiece. Appoligies if my English is not perfect.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1396,nderrick,This Film Needs To Be Put In Its Place,8,27 March 2005,"This Might Have Spoilers in it, depending on what you consider spoilers, i think that any review is by definition a spoiler because it effects your viewing experience by placing bias on your thoughts pertaining to the film before you see it. Anyways. Basically, people either say: A) this movie sucks its boring, has no plot, the visuals are well composed, but look fake by modern comparison, the acting is terrible, etc.....or B) this is the greatest film of all time, it explores such amazing depths of human existence, the visuals are brilliant and unmatched, incredible, intelligent, etc......The truth is they are both right, and both wrong. The problem arises in the fact that Film does everything film can do, but does it in non film ways. This film IS boring, it has no plot, it has no ""acting"". It ISN'T supposed to! This film shouldn't be on the shelf at blockbuster, it should be at the library in the philosophy section, or hanging in the art gallery. You are all looking at this the wrong way, with closed minds. This is just a philosophical text and a painting seen through the camera, it is in no way a ""film"".You stuck up people who think they are better than everyone else because they ""get it"" are all wrong to give this a 10, because a film is made up out of all the aspects, plot, acting, cinematography, meaning, technical achievement, pacing, etc..... so just because you feel the need to make yourselves feel better by claiming this is such a great film only you can appreciate it don't try to tell anyone its truly a 10/10 or the greatest film of all time. It clearly isn't, it might have a 10/10 in a few aspects, but that doesn't make up for all the 0/10 its going to get in the other components of a film.You dull people who think that a film needs explosions every 6 seconds, a classic story-telling technique, and has to have some big Hollywood star are all wrong as well. Film is an art form, and for a film to actually delve into some philosophical idea is a great thing, and deserves its respect. Just because you can't focus your attention for more then 10 seconds and are too lazy to want to put any effort into watching a movie doesn't meant that filmmakers should cater to your slothfulness and intellectual degradation.I give it a rating of 3 not because it is awful in its entirety, but these ratings are supposed to rate it as a movie, compared to all other movies in the world, and as a movie, it is awful. If this was the the ""Internet ART AND PHILOSOPHY DataBase"" then i would rate it a 10/10, but it isn't, this is the ""Internet MOVIE DataBase"", so, when you consider all the things that make a good FILM, 2001 doesn't match up to truly great films which not only have equally good visuals and meaning, but also have original plots (the 2001 plot is original, i suppose a better word would have been something like....engaging?), intense characters, good pacing, etc.....So, everyone needs to put away their egos and give this film a fair and just judgment. One of the best 100 FILMS of all time? not even close, A brilliant visual work of art and exploration of man, yes.One last note, some people like to add that the music is brilliant, but id like to remind you that Kubrick didn't compose it, other musical geniuses did, and trust me, it is not that hard to pick out some famous classical music and put it in a movie, so give the musical credit to where it is due, the composers, and not to Kubrick.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1398,tribble-841-35156,The movie people love to interpret,8,24 September 2010,"I think part of the reason ""2001"" has had such an enduring legacy is, aside from special effects that look good even today, the opaque, almost subliminal story. Part of this is Kubrick's style, as his movies have often been detached and almost cold, and part of it is deliberate.When we have something we feel is important and want to understand it, but what we are told is vague or uncertain, we keep guessing and trying to figure it out, and that uncertainty keeps us going to achieve enlightenment. More often than not when it is finally revealed to us we either feel disappointment, that it was somehow less than we expected, or we reject it and keep looking for more answers.Two things to remember is ""2001"" is a work of fiction, and therefore can be open to revision and reinterpretation from what it originally may have meant, such as in the ho-hum 2010 sequel, and it was also done by a human being just like one of us. A very smart one who was good at what he did but nonetheless a person, so nothing in ""2001"" should be considered as some greater message or doctrine, it's the story he gave to us.So here goes, ""2001"" is essentially the story of the evolution of the human intellect. The monolith is an enabler as much as a symbol of each turning point. I've heard one interpretation that the monolith represents the movie screen itself (turn the thing sideways) and is Kubrick wanting us to think about the movie, and each appearance of the monolith is accompanied by that awful wailing music which is meant to jar us and make us realize we're at a turning point where we won't see things the same. I agree with this view.We begin with humans as Australopithecus, who are physically vulnerable to attacks by animals and other tribes, until we learn to use tools. This is the first appearance. The second is when we have reached the moon. This is essentially the stage we're at now, and why the thing is on the moon is it required us to become technologically and mentally developed enough to find it. The turning point here is we are finally realizing we need to look beyond ourselves.The third stage precedes the next appearance of the monolith, makes up the bulk of the movie, and also has generated the most controversy. If the signal from the moon monolith had instead gone to some distant star and the spaceship scene was thousands of years later then it would have been easy to see it as another stage. Instead it's only 18 months later.The development is our technology has started to outpace us. We (as in the astronaut's behavior) are becoming cold and cerebral, and the computer is more emotional than us.HAL has his infamous fault where he decides to kill the crew. I've seen this as he was given a mission of critical importance, that there was an alien intelligence that had directed us to Jupiter, and questioned if the crew could handle both the secret and finding out he'd been withholding it. HAL decides it's too much of a risk and that to complete the mission without them is the way to go.In this scenario we are at a turning point, we cannot go any further as we rely more and more on machines, and in the process become more artificial in our behavior, while computers like HAL may act more ""human"" but are still equipment and can make decisions that are ultimately inhuman.The last stage is almost purely symbolism. Dave goes on a trip, whether physically to somewhere else, dimensionally to another plane of existence, or in his mind alone is beside the point. (Although most people seem to think he traveled across the stars is the most satisfying answer).The room at the end similarly could be a construct by the alien intelligence to give him something easier to relate to, a transcendental dream, or Dave's mind finding some way to rationalize what is going on. What does happen is Dave reaches the next stage, where we no longer need our frail bodies that age or our technology, and he becomes the infamous Star Child. How he actually does this or what this next stage allows us to achieve is left out.So there it is, take my interpretation or leave it. Some things don't work too well; such as the stage of humanity finding the second monolith on the moon doesn't come across as much of a turning point as the others, the movie implies we're facing an alien intelligence, but instead of giving us motives we're stuck with the sci-fi workaround of intelligences beyond our comprehension, and lastly now that Dave is the Star Child, just what is he going to do with himself aside from float around?",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1409,frerei,Help me better understand this movie's greatness.,8,19 October 2014,"I watched 2001: a space odyssey, out of suggestion from a buddy of mine. And I usually don't watch something when they nag me to death about it. Which meant I watched it with a negative mindset right from the start. That being said, I have nothing but respect for a movie with a fair amount of ingenuity and thought provoking ideas being crafted back in 1968. I was amazed and intrigued by a lot of the scenes as to how they did it - with what looked like just camera work. However, because of that negative mindset(as before mentioned), some scenes became horridly outdrawn ranging from sometimes five to fifteen minutes of random assaults of either complete silence or static/strange sounds. Instead of enjoying the obvious attempt to create suspense and atmosphere, it instead became a strenuous struggle on my poor head-phoned-ears. (SPOILERS) As for the plot and story, ,aybe I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the message between the first part of the lunar monolith, the journey to Jupiter and the second monolith. I felt like that part had little to do with the actual message of the film and instead was just that - a space journey(Well DUH. It IS the theme of the movie). I've seen a lot of films where the depths are endless and the message or meaning can be interpreted in many different ways(Ex: The Fountain, Mulholland Drive). I still struggle here. It just feels empty to be honest. The idea that an alien or artificial intelligence provided knowledge to prehistoric man or in fact engineered our species isn't thought provoking for me. It is something that I have discussed and theorized with friends and as an atheist it is an idea that is common nowadays. Of course, this film has provided many authors, film directors -artists- with the inspiration for this idea - so credit where its due. But, for me, it is a piece of cake that I've already had too much of and does not impress upon me anymore. I am very much for films where the director lets the audience think for themselves and agree on the fact that most entertainment nowadays ""hold your hand"" or ""spoon feed you the content"" throughout the whole experience. It might be nice to feel like a child again, but we have to grow up sometime and movies like these shakes that groggy dreamlike state Hollywood has forced upon our minds. I celebrate every movie, game, book that allow us to use our brain - but to me, as an atheist, this movie is not thought provoking at all(for the beginning of humanity's existence that is).The controversial ending(As someone said) is interesting and freshly new, as for my film experiences. I liked the idea that he perhaps was traveling in time, a wormhole, and experiencing his death/aging by seeing the future. Every time something happened, a sound, a movement, the most obvious his glass of liquor, he saw himself in a vision older and when the other vision saw him it became him. On the other hand, the camera's point of view could have been from the monolith the entire time in that time-capsule, watching him grow old or making him grow old to be reborn a new. I have a sneaking suspicion that the monoliths had something to do with HAL9000's malfunctions and odd behavior - or am I wrong on that point? There are probably some points I have forgotten and I'll have to watch it again sometime in a more neutral state. Right now it just wasn't that much of a memorable experience, other than the intriguing visual effects of the great camera work.Feel free to help me understand the greatness of this movie, because I don't want any negative thoughts of a movie that was the inspiration for a hell of a lot science-fiction movies and books. 8/10PS: That ending deserves an acid-trip.

1412,jwatmoto381,A guideline for what Sci-Fi movies should be,10,22 January 2013,"I'm choosing to do my first IMDb review for 2001: A Space Odyssey because it impacted me in a way that I can't say any other film ever has. It's a movie I longed for without ever knowing it existed. How can a movie with so little dialogue say so much to those who watch it? First I'd like to say that, if for no other reason at all, 2001 is one of the greatest films of all time solely because it is so visually striking. For a film released in 1968, you would almost be fooled into thinking that Kubrick had futuristic CGI technology at his disposal during the creation of his masterpiece. The space scenes are that vibrant and life-like. All of the set pieces are stunningly authentic feeling, which I attribute to good timing: filming a space movie smack dab in the middle of the space race must have provided a great visual guideline for Kubrick to follow. The special effects are top-notch, and although I already mentioned that some shots were CGI like in quality, that's only because you don't assume that such great special effects could be found in a movie from '68. But the reality is that many shots are, in some ways, better than any CGI animation could dream of being. There is no substitute for a highly detailed model or set piece, and that feeling they provide that you could almost reach out and touch them, which is routinely achieved in 2001.There is so much to be said about the feeling of authenticity in 2001. One of my biggest gripes with almost all sci-fi films is just how unauthentic and unrealistic they feel. Am I lacking in imagination and vision? Certainly not, I simply find it much easier to relate to a film that is based in some form of reality that I am familiar with. It goes without saying that I have never witnessed primitive human species in Africa or spacecraft navigation to the moon or Jupiter firsthand, but Kubrick's 2001 makes me feel as if I have. He takes the world we live in and witness on our t.v. sets and simultaneously brings them to our living rooms as well as the other side of the universe. I respect movie makers who create elaborate spacecraft with mysterious propulsion systems, a plethora of alien races and features, technology so advanced that even the explanations of those technologies don't seem to fully make sense. I respect the vision that other directors can portray on scene in other-worldly science fiction films, but I have never related to anything quite like what 2001 created. Everything was believable and authentic feeling. This idea is so often under-looked and left behind in science fiction, as the most outrageous ideas dominate the story and scenery.Onto the story itself, again, I feel that it's simplicity is what makes it so extraordinary. 2001 doesn't center around some unbelievable and extravagant plot, consisting of vast explanations and plot twists that require large suspensions of reality by movie-goers. The plot of the 2001 does a fantastic job of mostly speaking for, and explaining, itself, leaving the mind to focus on the visuals, the sounds (or lack there of) and the magnitude of questioning our origins on earth. Another fantastic quality to this movie that I wish would be emulated more often in sci-fi Hollywood.A review of 2001 without any analysis of the audio would not be considered complete by any stretch of the imagination. Many scenes rely almost entirely on the sounds, music, or pure silence. Kubrick uses powerfully orchestrated music to coincide with the stunning visuals, creating the most positive form of sensory overload imaginable. The music played during the astronauts walk to the monolith on the moon is utterly hair raising. The very same music could be played to a video of two kittens cuddling, and I would undoubtedly feel inexplicably frightened. It's that powerful and moving.All three of these positive qualities that make up 2001 are the qualities I have so often longed for in other sci-fi movies, yet never found. I feel a bit silly to know that there has been a movie out there all along that incorporates all of the qualities almost flawlessly that is nearly 20 years older than myself.Now, for the ending. I have read other IMDb reviews that are critical of the ending, and I must say that it is the only portion of the film that I felt ran a little astray. When David finally reaches the space surrounding Jupiter my attention, intrigue and suspense is at an all time high. Whether it be a product of lack of technological ability to create the desired special effects, time constraints, or possibly Kubrick himself didn't have a complete vision on where he wanted the end of his story to go, the climax of 2001 is rather confusing and unsatisfying. I hate to write those words in talking about what is easily one of my new favorites, if not my absolute favorite, of all time. But it is the truth and I wouldn't be doing the film any justice by giving an incomplete opinion of the ending. I grasped the concept, for the most part, of traveling thru a star gate, but after that I was mostly lost, confused and felt completely taken out of the story that had done so much to bring me into it leading up to that point. The entire world that Kubrick so masterfully created seemed to come shattering down inside the walls of a strange, alien, Victorian bedroom.That being said, it at least ended on some form of positive feeling of familiarity, with the young life-form overlooking earth with the powerful symphony playing behind him.Overall: amazing film, outstanding visual/effects, stunning score, genius film making. No other sci-fi film compares, in my eyes.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1413,HodorTheMagnificent,The greatest Sci-Fi film to grace the cinema (Some Spoilers),10,2 October 2014,"I could go on about this movie for a very long time but I think a brief review is much more helpful to the masses. I am 15 years old and in my age group films such as these are usually overlooked in favour of the ""widely-praised"" action and sci-fi films of today. It is sad to see that my age group might never have the chance to see one of the most revolutionary films of all time. From start to finish this movie awes and surprises in it's grand quest to show the evolution of mankind in an almost silent film. For the most part the viewer is presented with an array of beautiful if not stunning shots of space, ships and planets. The film is so revolutionary that these shots feel like they're out of the 1980s and not 1968. I won't go too much into the ending or the story as my own interpretation is likely to be quite different from anyone else's. This is the genius of the film. It presents itself subtly and forces the viewer to think. A quality which almost every modern film lacks and it saddens me to see the dumbed- down films that have a chokehold on the industry and that movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey will be likely forgotten in the wake of this mass idiocy.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1414,dramcommentorpivot,"Amazing atmosphere, cinematography and practical effects",10,30 August 2014,"The most amazing, the most awe inducing part of this film, is the fact that it was made in the 60's. The production, the cinematography and the effects are still relevant today. It is the only film which I've given a 10/10, but not only due to the context of it being from the 60's, but also the fact that it is an awe-some film by itself. Watching it, you'd think it'd just be a long drone, as a matter of fact, it is over 2 hours long and the dialogue is minimal. But the atmosphere and scenery makes up for it. When watching this film, I was just astonished, I was so fascinated by the little things, like how people walked on walls or how things were floating - ""How did they do these practical effects in the 60's?"" was a very common thought of mine.The symbolism of this film, the way it shows our development, it's like a journey of the soul. And watching the ending - I didn't even think about the fact that all of that was happening for about 20 minutes - I was just so fascinated. Though this is a classic, though this might be a pioneer in the sci-fi genre, I've found nothing that seemed to even attempt to copy it, as many films often do. I would recommend for people to check out Stanley Kubrick's work, they are very similar in the fact that they're committed to and executed in a very great way.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1415,mac301,One of Kubrick's Best!,10,3 February 2005,"The Story Story follows the ascent of mankind into the near-future space age through minimalist performances and a strong visual style.The FactsUpon my first viewing of 2001: A Space Odyssey I was deeply disappointed with it. I found myself bored and confused. I turned the film off at the end and went to bed. I was angry. The next day I talked to others and ultimately watched it over. During this viewing I saw what Kubrick was trying to bring to the viewer's mind. I understood the subject and the ending a lot more. If I had not asked questions and watched the piece again I could still be disgruntled with it. 2001's plot is great. It brings controversy to the audience, like most of Kubrick's films. The direction from Kubrick is, as always, fantastic. This may be the most visually stunning film I have ever seen. There are some shots that I will never forget. Kubrick has become one of the greatest directors of all time, in my eyes. The acting was all good. No performance really caught my eyes. They all seemed okay. The characters are good. None are really unforgettable. HAL will probably be the most memorable for me. The score was fantastic. It was great for the film, and could not have been done any other way. 2001 will awe many audiences for years to come. 2001 wasn't as boring as I had been told, either.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1416,hsemhsem,The greatest film I have ever seen.,10,14 May 2005,"2001: A Space Odyssey is quite long at 2 hrs 30 mins or so, and it moves along very slowly. On top of this the plot is negligible, offering little in the way of explanations for anything and there is little continuity. The characters in the movie remain, for the most part, undeveloped and in general it is very easy to dismiss the whole film as being boring. In any other film the above flaws would make for a terrible, terrible film. But this isn't quite like any other film I've ever seen.Visually, it is perfect. In fact, the film could easily be watched just as a series of stunning pictures: the planets aligning, the haunting image of the monolith, the space stations, the incredibly realistic apes, the drugged stream of colour at the climax of the film and the newborn baby the size of a planet which gives the film a brilliantly uplifting finale. Add to this some of the best chosen film music of all time (who would have thought that the Blue Danube waltz would be the perfect accompaniment to the image of a rotating space station) and all the sound effects, with whole scenes being accompanied by just the sound of breathing, and this is, quite simply, the best film I have ever seen.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1417,Willtur,Worst Kubrick film,6,11 August 2009,"I'm sorry for the lopsided rating but this movie needs to be dropped down a peg from it's absurd status on the IMDb 250. How this ever got lumped in the other great Kubrick movies I will never know. In Dr. Strangelove you had an awesome dialog about war and with A Clockwork you had a look at violence and rehabilitation as well as many other things.In 2001 you have a look at monkeys for 12 or so minutes. Everyone gets it. It's not hard to get, it's pretty, it has some smart writing but the lack of editing is like watching someones life from beginning to end. 2001: An Eternity would be more fitting. I know some people will say you know what it's perfect, every minute had to be there. That's fine I wouldn't want to rob you of your monkey action or your ship docking sequences but I swear you could do this movie in a short and not lose the message.Maybe that was the point, To do a movie with space imagery and a ton of sunrise images that you can play you're enigma CD with the lights dimmed low as you try and woe some woman with your impressive movie watching resume. Whatever the case this movie shouldn't be uttered in the same breath as his other movies, they actually have content.Knowing his work and picking this one over the rest would be like picking Bad Boys 2 over The Third Man, Eye candy over substance.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1418,Nashsuperfan,"Bizarre, Frustrating, Cinematic, Great!",10,25 May 2013,"A few days ago, I decided that as a film buff it was completely unacceptable that I had never seen a Kubrick film. So as of late I've been watching the heck out of every film he made, and loving every minute of it. My latest venture was Kubrick's classic, 2001: A Space Odyssey. I have to say, as a film, I really enjoyed 2001. The SFX are spectacular, a true marvel of their time, effects that stand the test of time better than almost anything in the industry. The cinematography is beautiful and Kubrick's direction is spot on for the most part. The score is great, everything from The Blue Danube to the iconic 2001 theme is spot on and well utilized throughout the film.To address the elephant in the room, 2001, at many points, is a boring film. Pacing is slow, landscape and developing shots are long and drawn out, and the lack of dialogue throughout most of the movie simply contributes to a sometimes-boring experience. In particular, the opening shots for TMA-1 seem to stretch on forever. Make no mistake, this is not your mediocre, explosion-every-five-seconds action flick, and in many ways, this is a good thing.The other knock I have against this movie is its lack of emotion. Kubrick's films can often lack emotional expression, and I think that tendency is manifested in 2001. Actors, either by their own decision or Kubrick's direction, rarely display any shows of emotion, although I found that at most points this suited the movie as a whole.My last point has to do with 2001's ending, the most bizarre, confusing, and beautiful part of the film. Personally, I had to go look up an interview with Kubrick explaining it to fully understand its meaning, it is that strange. Yet, it is my favourite part of the movie, as it brings something profound and breathtaking to an otherwise slowly paced movie.It's a little bizarre, but once you figure it out, it ties up the movie perfectly.8 out of 10, but given the slow pace, I doubt most viewers will enjoy it :(.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1419,jjasper-2,Better than Sominex!,4,26 September 2005,"This movie has many merits, but I come not to praise Ceasar. There is no doubt that the film has earth shattering effects for its time (1968) Hollywood would not see such space effects again until the 70's with the release of Star Wars. People will tend to fawn and gush over this film. Yes, it's artsy and yes, it has an interesting and thought provoking message buried underneath all the dross and chaff. I once taped this movie and fast-forwarded through the interminably long effects shots to find this 148 minute film had only 45 minutes of dialogue. That's 103 minutes of footage unrelated to story advancement but dedicated to ""mood."" I'm not saying you shouldn't see ""2001,"" You ""ought to"" see it if you have an interest in American cinematic history - the film is a landmark. My point being not to fall for the Emperor's new clothes. Just because it is touted as great doesn't mean you'll think so. Watch with your own critical eye - you might think it's the grandest and greatest film of all time - or not. Yes, Hollywood has hailed 2001, but let's not forget that Hollywood is not known for its dense population of highly intelligent people. These are the people that bring you an endless stream of Adam Sandler films.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I have read loads of reviews and can't believe how man people say it's the best movie ever. OK I don't agree with them who say it's a piece of trash either, but them who say its boring is spot on. Yes I agree it's beautiful, and the effects for the year it's made are amazing. But just when the plot is getting good with the computer Hal the film just spins out of control.I'm not the biggest art film fan but I do like some. American Beauty and Punch Drunk Love to name two (if you class them as arty).I do believe at times this film is just being beautiful for the sake of being beautiful. It should have only been about an hour and a half long.When I watched this I wanted to turn it of, but how do you turn off a Kubrick film? Yes after reading what I have put you won't believe me but I'm normally a bit of a Kubrick fan. I think this is about the seventh Kubrick film I have seen and is the only one I don't like. His best in my opinion is Dr Strangelove which is just perfect. If you want to see a great Kubrick film watch that.I gave this 6 out 10 mainly down to the great shots and effects, but if you are looking for a Sci Fi along the lines of Star Wars avoid this.

I can't think of a more humanity loving movie in the international cinema. This movie is a monument to humanity and from all of Kubrick's great work this one stands out as the most deep and well thought of them all.(Inside info: the HAL computer was supposed to be IBM but at the last minute the deal was cancelled so they used the previous letter to make a new name for the computer -- I became H, B because A and M became L)",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It is that good.The soundtrack is amazing with a lot of classical music underlining the scenes in a perfect way. Kubrick was a perfectionist and that extended to the songs he used in his films, and also to the great use of shot selection and lenses etc that are also obviously on display in this wonderful film.The story is engrossing and seems much shorter than the actual run time of the film which is about three hours.The effects were amazing and even after all these years they still hold up as being really good. Some of the lights-flashing special effects scenes come off as a little dated but considering how old this movie is they did a really amazing job.And the ending is one of the best you will ever see, it is open to interpretation and brilliant!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1423,coledenzler,A landmark train wreck of a film,4,13 November 2013,"First off, this a very slow movie. Don't mistake a slow pace for art. Although it starts off very intriguing, the movie is a train wreck towards the end. It makes no sense, and yet it is praised for being visionary exactly because it makes no sense. It undermines the achievements of mankind and attributes them to a vastly superior species. Humans are depicted as boring, sterile, pitiable creatures with no souls. HAL on the other hand is more human than any actual human on screen, albeit misguided. If you cut out the monolithic black rectangles and everything after HAL is deactivated, you would be left with a decent movie, but as whole the movie only satisfies the ""artists"" who can't explain why it is a good movie, it ""just is"". Call me crazy, but I don't find a film that mocks humanity tasteful or entertaining. All in all, you will probably like this if you like the Rocky Horror Picture Show. For everyone else, it's OK to watch once so you are familiar with a landmark film, regardless of if it deserves to be or not.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1429,bitspersecond56000,Interesting and fascinating experience,8,18 November 2019,"I heard a lot of things about '2001 A Space Odyssey' since I started to interest Sci-Fi genre. Film always approach subjects with beauty and harmony in cinematographic aspect. I have maybe one or two arguments what Kubrick and Clark performed in this film, otherwise watching this film still an interesting and fascinating experience, independent from which year you watch.My first argument about on the long screenplays. I understand the 1968 expectations for spaces and It's good for them to saw all thing oblong. I'm also ok with the most of these scenes, but I expected more about the 'monolith' and the event occurred between moon monolith and Jupiter mission. Film briefly showing and telling some information about these questions especially for real purpose of Jupiter mission. My expectation rise in second half of the film because film bombarded to audiences on first half; first of all monolith than monoliths effect on evaluation, match cut telling to bone-club and orbiting satellite are just a servants of humans (they are same thing on fundamental level even how they disunites them self for purpose), Pan America space plane, Hilton office in space station, moon base, moon monolith etc.When second half started with Jupiter mission, all I saw our murder computer HAL 9000, Discovery One and Jupiter Crew. Kubrick also implemented many details in this part of film most obvious one interview scene. It gave a brief observation on HAL. I also want to mention happy birthday scene, dialog scene HAL talking about moon monolith and argument scene that crew talking about HAL in a pod but HAL seeing they lips and realize what they are planning. I waited to something reveal in second half of film but except to final scenes my expectation not fulfilled completely. By the way I loved the ending of film. My only additional comment for ending is about long colorful psychedelic sequence. Kubrick did amazing film with 1968's cinema techniques and I really appreciated but, this sequence never got me.Conclusions, I always evaluate something with own time conditions and this film amazed me in many aspects.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The book by Arthur C. Clarke was great, but not as deep as the movie, and we can say the same about The Shining ... There's a before-2001 and after-2001 in the history of cinema, that's for sure, never the movies were the same after 1968, particularly of course the sci-fi movies, if 2001 hadn't been made, movies like Starwars or Alien would have been made far far later than the 70's ...

I went to the library, borrowed a copy, put the DVD inside, and thought, ""Well, this ought to be the clichéd sci-fi story. And for the next two hours, I sat in amazement as I saw the breathtaking visual accomplishment of a movie. It never failed to enthrall me and keeping me on the edge of my seat. It was, in my opinion, a highly realistic view of one envisioning the year 2001 in 1968.I finished the movie, and immediately went into IMDb for the results, and I was fairly shocked at the amount of people who disliked the movie. Most of those dislikes said something along the lines of ""Overrated"", ""boring"", and ""someone tell me what the hell this is about.""Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick never really intended the audience to understand the movie completely: ""If you understand '2001' completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.""I completely agree with him. It isn't really much of a story of dialogue (which is kept to a minimum in this movie) as it is a visual story, along the lines of ""Metropolis"" or ""A Trip to the Moon."" The purpose of cinema is to provide a visual outlet to fascinating ideas and conceptions, relying on dialogue only to convey an actual story. 2001 manages to do both without the need of much dialogue, and therefore achieves what cinema originally intended to do.That is why 2001 is my favorite movie of all time. 👍👍 10/10 (and I would rate it 11/10 if I could.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The whole end scene with the guy seeing himself, and then becoming himself is just plain stupid. In regards to quality, it is a drawn-out student film.

1435,starbursts606,just plain weird,10,28 March 2006,"So many things make 2001: A Space Odyssey the weirdest movie ever made. First of all, what is with the monolith? It's significance is never really explained, which definitely leaves you hanging. Sure, for smart people it might be good that they don't tell you what it means because then you can figure it out yourself, but for high schoolers like me, it was just... queer. And what's with the music that they play when the monkeys are, like, attacking it? It sounds like a swarm of flies. And why did the monkeys attack it in the first place? Well, anyway. Another factor of this movie's weirdness was the pace of it in general. Because the majority of it takes place in outer space, all of the camera shots are very, very slow and the scenes are very, very quiet; to the point that it gives you the shivers and a tingle down your spine. Another weird thing in this movie is Hal, the droning robot that takes over and kills almost everyone. It's voice and personality are just so strange and awkward, that it's actually really funny, even though it's not supposed to be. The best part has to be when Hal starts singing ""Daisy, daisy..."" as he is being disassembled. Finally, the ending of the movie just freaked me out completely. What was with the guy turning into an embryo-ish bubble baby? And then there was the strange room that echos, where he ages really quickly. It gave me goosebumps because it made no sense at all and completely distorted any ideas that I have about human life and time travel. But overall, the weirdness really did end up making this movie one of a kind, in a good way. Even though it was not an accurate prediction of what the world would be like in 2001, it asked questions that no other movie would ever approach. And although this movie can really creep you it, it's in a good way. It forces you to think beyond your own life and your own theories about space, and it puts you in a weird state of mind that leaves you in a complete daze after watching it. This movie is definitely worth watching at some point, but it is not cut out for a slumber party. Prepare to be freaked out beyond belief.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Its like Kubrik discovered a bunch of ape suits in the props department and couldn't get enough of photographing them. The numerous screen blackouts and the accompanying sounds are so annoying, so much so that they make the audience lose interest. It looks and feels like Kubrik is seeking artistic indulgence; ie we would allow him any quirks. The heavy breathing by the astronauts that goes on and on and on.

1442,thevincercode,Literally breathtaking,10,2 February 2018,"If you're one who searches best movies of all time on your browser then you must have found this one on every list available on the web, Most probably you've seen it already. It would also be likely that you haven't. Well, if I may say, you've are missing out a great movie experience my friend.Deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"", 2001: A Space Odyssey was selected for preservation in the National Film registry by the US Library of Congress in 1991.Considered to be his magnum opus, 2001 surely is the best film to start with if you haven't seen any Stanley Kubrick film yet.In a nutshell, it is about a US space mission lead by scientists Dr. David Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole, with three other scientists in crypto sleep, aboard the spaceship Discovery bound for Jupiter. Discovery was programmed to be operated mainly by Hal, a sentient HAL 9000 supercomputer. When Hal alerted the scientists about an antenna control devise failure, Bowman and Poole - after launching an EVA (extravehicular activity) - found nothing wrong and began suspecting Hal. This raised a great concern especially because Hal claims he is ""foolproof and incapable of error"". Afraid that this might cause mission failure, both scientists decided that if Hal is indeed malfunctioning they will disconnect him and go on manual control. When Hal found out about this plan, the mission started to go awry and everything that followed went out of plan. (Also, there are these mysterious monoliths of various sizes scattered around the outer space. What these black slabs are nobody knows but they trigger most of the action in the film.)Prior to watching the film, I have not expected anything other than it must it turning out to be a great film. I only intended to watch this film because I bought the book 2010: odyssey two by Arthur C. Clark which is the sequel of the book which this film was based on.Author Arthur C. Clark shares the credit for the conception of this film. Kubrick asked Clarke to write for him a story about space exploration and both later started thinking about the ""proverbial good science-fiction movie"". The novel 2001: A Space Odyssey was written during the years 1964-1968 and was published shortly after the release of the film in July 1968. Kubrick and Clarke later won an Oscar for the screenplay of this film.It would be no exaggeration if I say that everything about this film is remarkable considering that it was made in the late 1960's. The film explored possibilities in film that no one before 1968 has ever tried. The conceptualization to production to execution is nothing short of impressive. Even the sound design and scoring is a feat in cinematic history.
There are certain elements that fascinated me while, and even after, watching the film. Aspects of the film that are very distinct had I watched it earlier would have been the basis of my science fiction cinematic standards. These can be narrowed down into five aspects:The scoring and sound design - for about two minutes or so, I thought I'm watching a busted copy of the film because as the music progresses into a crescendo of eerie sounds that resonates horror all I'm seeing is black on the screen. In hindsight, this opening technique helped build up the tension I was about to feel throughout the film. I don't know if it was intended that way but it established the mysterious mood of film.
A minor element I like about this film is the sound the characters make when breathing. Hearing the inhale and exhale of the characters in their space suits gives the audience an immersive experience. This was a minor detail I noticed and liked in the movie Interstellar, which I thought was original having seen Interstellar first.Production design -There is something about the quality of each frame that makes if pleasing with the eyes, probably because the whole production wasn't cluttered with faux futuristic props. Even the strategic use of lighting in every scene gives off an aesthetic appeal as if every frame is a work of art. I don't know if you're supposed to feel it but everything from the costumes to props to vehicles and models and the sets are incredibly believable (for a 1968 film).Visual effects - again, this was made in the late 1960's and way before the first Star Wars film but it's unarguably still better than the latter. The seamless visual effects will make you scrutinize every scene to find lapses but it still manages to leave you wondering if they really didn't actually film it in space.
That scene where Frank Poole runs around the circular track of giant centrifuge still confuses the hell out of me. I mean, sure, they could have made it look more believable these days but in 1968? That's impressive. Also, about weightlessness effect in zero gee? I know, impressive.The camera angles and actors' movements - I haven't seen any other film by Kubrick yet to prove this impression but in 2001 Kubrick masterfully projects a sense of balance and symmetry in every frame, as well as an eye for details which can only be products of discipline. The subtle movements of the characters and the camera pacing allow you to take in everything on the screen; from the set design to the view of the outer space on the background.Less dialogue - why would you ask for more dialogue when you're already served too much on the screen? I think what Kubrick and the film in general wants to present is a possibility of what it would be like if one journeys out in space that is still a great mystery to the human mind, a visual experience - enthralling, vague, one that is beyond words.I can't stress it enough but for a film that was made in 1968, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a milestone in science fiction and deserves to be experienced. No wonder why it is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential films ever made.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1444,jadeshedges,Two hours of my life wasted!,1,19 September 2017,"Well, I must say I was excited to watch this movie, I really enjoy classic Sci Fi movies and enjoy a good B grade Sci Fi if it has a good story.Key features, Slow paced to the point of being painful, really bad use of sound effects and music, toilet acting, Lots of use of silence, lots of use of long drawn out scenes, 100% mushrooms were used in the making of this movie.Man was I sorely let down here, lets have an honest plot summary.Starts out with a crazy long black screen with sounds and music and no picture at all around 10 minutes worth then you get to the dawn of man. aka lets watch apes in there day to day life in the desert doing FA for a what seems like eternity (this movie is very slow paced) They wake up one day to a black monolith next to their den and seem to suddenly figure out how to use bone as a hammer and start walking upright.Next thing you know we are in the space age, after a lot of very slow paced character development our main man is off to the moon to visit the crew that has found a big black monolith on the moon, fair enough.After a long, slow trip to the moon they investigate the monolith and determine it is sending a radio signal to Jupiter.The next thing you know they have put a ship and crew on a mission to investigate. The only slightly interesting part of the movie occurs during this voyage between the crew and the A.I of the ship. I wont say what in case you are still determined to watch this movie after reading my review. Still this section of the movie was generally slow paced.They reach their destination, and discover another monolith in orbit of Jupiter and set out to investigate in a small pod. This is where I assume they ran out of ideas and consumed way too many mushrooms. One moment the pod is approaching the monolith the next thing you get is all kinds of low grade special effects of lights blurring past the screen for an extremely extended period of the movie, it seems to go on and on like this and you are left wondering what the **** am I watching this for.Then the next thing you know the pod is parked in some strange room kind of Victorian in style. What happens next is hard to describe but our main man see's someone eating at a table, then he is the person at the table. He then notices someone in the bed, then he is the person in the bed. Next thing you are looking at a fetus, then the fetus is giant and next to earth and then the movie ends...I was left thinking what the **** did I just watch, what is this toilet, why do people like this?

1445,wilfred-zegwaard,Just a short comment,9,26 November 2005,"I definitely agree that it is one of the best movies ever made. When I was a student in the eighties I saw it in a widescreen cinema and it blew me right of my chair. Visually a fantastic film, I still get the shivers when I see HAL performing his unduly tasks, the outer space is threatening. The controversial end isn't controversial for me. That blew me of my chair, it's fascinating and the contrast with the first part of the film couldn't be bigger. Even with the modern computer effects, I haven't seen one film which has the same effect. I have only seen one film which I found visually more attractive: Mirror by Andrei Tarkovsky, a Russian director. But it is a completely different movie and hasn't the direct effect like A Space Odyssey. If you're not a visual type and you are looking for intense drama, this is not the film to see (as most of my friends are). If I ever buy a widescreen television, this is the fist movie to see. Fantastic.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1446,blazevicjosip,2001: A Space Odyssey is not a good film,1,26 March 2020,"2001: A Space Odyssey is a bad film. Its cultural importance notwithstanding, I might even go so far as to say that it is one of the worst films I have ever watched.Of course, I understand and appreciate the groundbreaking elements the film displays, i.e. the (then-)futuristic displays of space age technology, and the concept of AIs turning on humanity, etc. All that has had a lot of impact on cinema and all science fiction that came after it. But while I can appreciate that, that is where all my appreciation for the film ends.The most glaringly painful shortcoming is its pacing, of course. I did *not* need to watch apes sit around learning how to use tools for half an hour, nor did I need to watch a waitress take a full minute to walk through a circular room, to name a few things.The plot is also disjointed and incoherent, and mostly outright absent - which fans of the film tell me is because ""it's metaphorical"" - but I absolutely 100% refuse to believe that anyone understood those ""metaphors"" before someone told them what it was supposed to be, or without reading the book the film is based on. A plot is not a plot if it's impossible to understand without an explanation. The film is divided into four sections (prehistoric humans, the future tech showcase in earth's orbit, the actual central part of the film, and the gibberish acid trip at the end), that are barely connected at all and mostly have no relevance to each other. The entire second section could have been completely removed, and it would not have impacted the plot in the slightest.The acting is also garbage. Everyone is completely monotone and emotionless. I have been told that that is intentional, to ""make the future seem cold and dull"", but intentional bad acting is still bad acting and any supposed artistic value it would somehow gain from that is completely outweighed by the fact that it makes the film painful to sit through. Watching Dave warn Hal by repeating the exact same sentence four times with the exact same droning intonation made me cringe in my seat.Then, finally, you have the big finale: the five straight minutes of Windows Media Player visualisations, followed by *actual nonsense*. This entire section is a metaphor for rebirth and transcendence, but the fact of the matter is that it's just fifteen minutes of nonsense, and any higher meaning has to be drawn from it by reading the book, in which this part is somewhat less nonsensical. When it comes down to it, there is **no** way **anyone** understood the ""poetry"" behind this section without prior knowledge. It is terribly conveyed, no matter how much fans of the film will defend it for being ""poetic"". It's not poetic. It's incoherent. And what's more, the entire core of the film (the plot about the AI rebelling against humans) is *completely* unrelated to this ""transcendence"" business.What is the monolith? Why is it on earth? Why is it on the moon? Why is it in deep space? Why does Dave transcend, and what does he transcend into? Literally none of it is explained. ""It doesn't need to be explained,"" defendants tell me, to which I say, "" yes it does."" Leaving all the driving factors behind the plot unresolved is not ""poetic"" and ""existential"", it's pretentious and unsatisfying.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The 1968 film of 2001 a space odyssey can only be described as one of the biggest jaw dropping, cult classic films ever made. Even when you watch it now, it still amazes you. This film was made four decades ago and there have been very little sci-fi films; possibly the likes of Alien or Star Wars, that have come close to it's fantasy and UN-real adventure that leaves you pulling your hair out in amazement and question.

I have loved this movie since I first started loving movies, which was a product of my first starting to love life, love it with my consciousness, and how fitting that a movie about the development of consciousness in humanity would be associated for me with the development of my own consciousness. This movie is about the development of humanity's consciousness, as if humanity might be embodied in a single human, metonymy, a single part of a whole symbolizing the whole.

I was 14, still measuring every movie I saw against the biggy: Star Wars. But this was a vision of OUR future... not in some galaxy far, far away but here.. 23 years away. I toyed with the idea that in the year 2001, maybe the movie on the PanAm flight to the space station would be, well, 2001.
I at first had trouble following the story, after all, I was expecting the occasional laser blast, or the hideous appearance of the aliens, but I sat there captivated... not missing the expected action at all. I really felt for Bowman and Poole, and the isolation of the Discovery was tangible, and the sound of Bowmans breathing gave me the shivers.I got home, sat at my bedroom window and stared at the moon for hours.I have the movie at home, and recently saw it on the big screen (in a 70mm print, Dolby sound if you don't mind) and will be the first DVD I purchase.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

""Perhaps they thought our apes were real apes rather than actors"" The fact that the entire dialog of the movie would fit on a CD! (in 3 hours of movie there is about an hour of dialog) shows how Kubric forced us to experience the film through the visual medium.The level of detail in this film is truly amazing.

1462,midnite-7,you have to do some of the work yourself,10,8 June 1999,"Oh my, how sci-fi fans--weaned on ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and ""War of the Worlds""-- must have loathed this film upon its release in 1968. This movie, containing no malevolant aliens, no battle scenes, nor any threat to Earth, except from ourselves, threw the entire science fiction lexicon out the proverbial air-lock.  The audience bristled, and many walkouts were assured.  It was found wanting by the mainstream critics as well, and alternative critics in the day were few.  "" I really like dialogue in my films"" a few were heard saying.  ""What about the plot"" said others.  "" We never get to know the characters,""  ""you never understand what is going on,"" ""nothing ever happens"" blah, blah, blah.  Well that's just fine: you guys didn't deserve this film anyways. On the other hand, if you love allegory, expressive imagery, depth, and classical music, then you will have a never-ending affair with this film. Put all other observations aside: this film is about Birth, expressed by the monolith(a long-time symbol for simplicity, the essential origins of life) and the fetus-star in the final scenes.  Birth of a new world?  Of a new species?  Rebirth of man?  You'll have to decide that for yourself. Greatness in art arises from ambiguities. The theme represents a wonderful paradox in the film: we have to abandon our cradle to reconnect with our origins.  An important philosophical question emerges: man's pursuits, all of which seek transcendance, might all be only an attempt to reconnect with our primordial beginnings.  We only want to taste mother's milk again.  I love a movie that makes you ponder.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

So, I decided to help the people who do not like to think when they are watching a movie.What is ""2001:A Space Odyssey""? What would you like to call it, a movie, best film ever made, the summit of sci-fi genre? But I must say it is none of them. ""2001:A Space Odyssey"" is above all these terms. It is a ""real"" artwork. It is the solution for the main problem of the aesthethics ""What is aesthethic or not?"". And why?It will be time and line consuming to describe what an artwork has to contain here so I assume you all have a basic knowledge of art, at least you have to if you are watching a film or you must have knowledge about it if you comment on a film.Before commenting on film scene by scene and I must mention that this motion picture is a lyric artwork that means it is based on all its creator's emotions, feelings, perception of life and ideologies ..etc. So we must realise that this film was not made to satisfy you and me it was made to satisfy Stanley Kubrick himself. That means again all the things that you see in the film are illusions or images or symbols that reflects that Stanley Kubrick wants you to criticize or think on them. So every single thing in the film may mean different things to different people. So everything that I will write is my opinion here.Lets start with the ""Dawn of Man""; we see apes roaming around without any purpose and any humanistic intentions. They are real animals, in the primary meaning of the word they are animals. They collect, eaten by predators and they all accept this situation, they have no resistance to this. But one morning they wake up and see the black monument that is the mystreous object of the film and they change forever after they touch it,they turns out to be ""man"". What is the black monument here,what does it mean, Kubrick wants you to replace it with your sacred object, it may be God or whatever you believe in. Then with a great cinematography a ""man"" (it is a human after it touches the stone) discovers to use object; a bone. Then they fight for their little lake for water and kill the leader of the rival tribe. Here we see that the members of the rival tribe do not use bones as they do cause they did not see or touch the black monument. They are animals and will be forever. Again with a great cinematography we passes from the primitive gadget bone to the latest or the final technology ""space crafts"".(to be continued)",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1465,boorock,"The summit of the sci-fi genre,Stanley Kubrick amazes again.",10,29 June 1999,"What is the role of the human beings on the surface of the globe so called as Earth? There may be a lot of answers for that question from different point of views.As related to this question Stanley Kubrick gives the answer of his own that we really must not care about it is true or not because there is no proper answer for this specific question. How does Stanley Kubrick achieve to answer to this really philosophic and hard question.We see animals that we are familiar with that we call monkeys or apes. Till the appearance of the black monument or stone these creatures are animals but just after the monument some can say God sends the human on earth or some others can say evolution starts because these creatures start to use bones. As an incredible sequence the bone as the symbol of the most primitive gadget turns out to be a space craft as the symbol of the latest or the final technology. We skip all the part about how the human beings reached that technology. In this film S. Kubrick just shows us the beginning and the end of the human evolution and of course shows us the things ""beyond infinity"". In fact as we stated above S.K. does not really answer the question that we stated above as well. He just shows us his perception of life and man and he wants us to give our own answers.This fact is the aspect that makes this film a classic or the summit of the sci-fi genre. This philosophical density of the film does not hinder the visual effectiveness of the film. All the sequences fully satisfies a viewer looking forward visuality, in fact it does amaze the viewer. Some of these sequences make the film unforgettable; the scene that apes faces the monument or the man discovers the function of bone or the scene that Dave kills HAL or and or and or..Finally Kubrick makes a film that really contains a really hard-to-deal-with subject and incredible visuality and music usage.

Clarke has spent much of his file bringing the future to us today. This movie has opened up so many discussions, creating so much independent though.  He didn't try to direct us to his views, but left it up to us to see what we wanted.  Clarke created more than 2001, he created the ability to see 2001 from with in ourself.Kubrick, has brought us some of the most talked about movies.  With his passing, Kubrick's works will be in HIGH demand.  For any one wanting to start learning about Kubrick, 2001 is a great place to start!  Over the past year I've started researching Kubrick and his works, and I was so amazed to find that 2001 was part of his list!  As a child, I just didn't know who Kubrick was hand how he help shape so much of the cinema we see today.Space.Hal. and the unknown.

Had I known I'd spend two hours watching people float around in complete silence, I may have reconsidered.The music is a plus, but could have been produced on its own and still made big $$$.  It was a nice break from the 15 minute silences.  I also saw some points where the shots could've been cleaned up and bit, and been done better and more tastefully.  Watch the conference room scene.Oh, and did I mention the infamous men in monkey suits?  No, not tuxes, but ""real"" ape suits.  Perhaps an attempt could have been made to actually make those actors look real.I found the plot to have holes.  Instead of concentrating on the idea of man making contact with intelligent beings, this film focuses mainly on a psycho computer.  It leaves no real room for a viewer to get to know the characters.  Or the *one* that is left by the end.My personal quotes from when I was watching the film:What just happened? Did I miss something? Oh, look.  Another silence.

It might be because they are looking for a SiFi movie in the George Lucas definition. And believe me, if you liked the idiotic Episode I, you are going to hate this Kubrick masterpiece. 2001: A Space Odyssey is not really a SiFi movie, it's a philosophical statement that happens to be set in the future. It is much deeper than a Space Opera like the Star Wars saga, and lets you walk out of the theater (or home theater) with more questions than answers.Yes, it is a very, very, very, very slow paced movie, with long shots of slow moving spaceships to the tune of slow  clasical music and the first line of dialogue comes some 25 minutes into the film. So?.  It is not a trill ride and the first thing that you have to do to enjoy it is take your time to see it. And don't worry; nobody understands the ending, you are not supposed to.So, if you like Science Fiction Films, see where it all began, Think that this movie is 32 years old, I dare you to find any other 1968 movie that is still as new and fresh as this one.

This movie is interrupted by slow, drawn out scenes that serve no purpose in either aesthetic value or emphasis on a thought or idea. I found it incredibly hard to patient wait for the slow scenes to end, like the half hour of apes, the 15 minutes of watching the little pod move around in space. I just don't connect with any meaning there.... This movie had unbelievable potential, and should have had more focus on storyline and less on the visual equivalent of watching paint dry.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1473,diamond-31,A film about everything,10,3 March 2001,"Like a Circle around the human condition, 2001 starts at the beginning, skips the middle, and proceeds to the ending, right back where we started. Noting the weakness of words compared to image(s), Kubrick wisely dispenses with dialogue, preferring the power and essence of the scenery, and allowing the intelligence of the audience to do the deciphering.  Or not, depending on the audience.A monolith in cinematic history, 2001 is a high water mark of direction, execution, and achievement.  If one considers the ambition of the film (a film about everything), and the measure of success the film achieved to that end, a very sound argument for this being the greatest of all films can be made.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1475,anthonymueller,Creation and consequences,10,12 October 2000,"Wow, what a film!This amazing work is so broad in scope, so deft in detail, so unique in philosophical depth, it must be considered one of the great masterpieces of cinema.The movie is primarily concerned with creation and consequences. One usually connects the creation of tools, from primitive weapons to sophisticated technological, with absolute progress. Kubrick, with characteristic attention and intelligence, scrutinizes this reductionist view. For Kubrick, creation and destruction are not polar opposites but paradigms that are delicately interconnected.  Kubrick's prologue to 2001 advances the supposition that invention and creation oftentimes do not have benevolent results. The bone becomes weapon becomes spacecraft in an attempt to link creation to violence to technology. Kubrick's presentation is not dogmatic: As an artist, he understands the need and human-defining quality of creation and invention.He is also concerned with the plight of the individual in a culture that concerns itself with creating and knowing. 2001 is a tragedy as important and visceral as Oepipus or King Lear. When one insists on knowing without restraint, the revelation may be too much to bare. In the space gate scene we are shown the fear of such a revelation.Alienation provides a major theme throughout the film. Birthdays are celebrated over the phone. Silence marks many scenes. HAL's eerie voice is that last we hear. The primitive battle, the interrogation, the debriefing, all present violent, awkward, empty, human interaction.Though marked by its cynicism, 2001 is equally hopeful. Human invention leads to violence and alienation but also to great art (the movie itself).",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The Dawn of Man sequence is arguably the finest minutes of film I've ever witnessed in my short life.  2001 takes you on an imaginative journey from our likely ancestors millions of years ago to a space station in the near future.  Although the film is almost too slow to bear, I still love it.   I really appreciate Kubrick's attempt to make the film as realistic as possible, you'll notice they're aren't any Star Wars-like explosions with loud KABAMS! here..... we all know there is no such thing as sound without oxygen.  HAL 9000 is one of the most terrifying characters of all-time.  I find it horrifying to think of myself being in Dave's shoes, trapped millions of miles from home with a psychotic supercomputer.

That, in fact, is why I just rewatched it  to fall asleep for my early start for work tomorrow.  But instead, this time, it totally and utterly blew me away.  So completely, that I find myself now writing about it.I used to and still do think 2001 is a movie you either love or hate to watch  a movie to make you cheer, or snore.  I guess I used to hate it. Like no shortage of people I saw it as (albeit obviously brilliant) boredom in a can - not only had I never stayed awake, I'd never even pieced together the whole thing.  And didn't really care.For whatever reason, this time I was overwhelmed - by its majesty, its unrivaled genius, its excruciating mystery.  Words don't suffice.  I finally got it.  (Not that I have any idea what these blokes are on about, but that's how this art imitates life.)  I found my emotions tingling with every shot, particularly in Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite (a section of the film I'd never actually remained awake for).Words really don't do it - it is a film that, given the opportunity, every person should see.  It just might take you to far reaches of inner and outerspace that you never thought possible - it just might change your life. Failing that, it may give you a good nights sleep.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1479,VVB,"Kubrick's ""Black Square""",1,20 May 2001,"I normally keep my movie thoughts to myself but this movie affected me to the point of voicing myself out.Movies are typically evaluated via (i) more/less objective attributes (plot, ideas, action, cinematography, etc.) and (ii) emotional impressions they leave. While the latter is extremely personal and diverse, some convergence can be achieved in the former. Unfortunately, this piece greatly fails in it: no plot, no original ideas, no action, horrible cinematography, and a very repetitive soundtrack. As far as the emotional impression goes: well, in my case, it gave me a highly unpleasant aftertaste: a very pretentious schizophrenic nightmare...Why is it so overrated then? I'd hypothesize that it is for the same reason as in the case of Malevich's ""Black Square"". When one sees something a piece of ""art"" of that type, there seem to be two typical reactions: (i) ""There is nothing there, it is junk."" and (ii) ""There is nothing there but it must be great because everyone else thinks it's great. Then it must be an art."" So what created this mob fame effect for this movie? I don't know for sure but it might have been the big names of S.Kubrick and A.Clark. Once such a ""snowball"" starts rolling down the hill and picks up the momentum, it is more difficult to stop it than to roll with it.Please trust your own independent feelings. Things don't become better because a million of other people say they are brilliant. Cheers.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Making Sci-fi movies with techno music (except from bladerunner where the 80's techno thing fit perfectly well there, to be exact it is not techno but new wave as they call it) with one good guy and one bad guy trying to kill each other and similar things is so common nowadays. But Then I question myself, how can such a brilliant movie ever be made. Why don't they at least try to make such things nowadays. One word for the people claiming that the movie is boring etc etc.. I am sure that someone who watched that movie is aware of the distinction between novels versus poems. What matters is how you feel at the end of the movie, what it changed in your life and so forth. A good movie should not be a 2 hour long stupid freak show, ref. double team, star wars episode 1 (the others exempt)...(although I enjoy to watch them, but again I believe that it is a sin to put such productions in the same category with 2001.)",2001 - A Space Odyssey

(what was the point of showing us so much of the doctor who was on his way to the moon to then have him completely disappear after the visit to the monolith? I'm sure it's just another way of us being dispassionate towards the human characters or something but I just found it annoying to learn about a character and then have him disappear...) *Some extremely irritating jumps with no explanation to seemingly un-connected scenes... *And that damn final journey sequence... what's so amazing about a bunch of solarized images of the grand canyon and water? It really quite under whelmed me.I was extremely bored by the whole experience, but I am NOT going to fall into the wonderful trap that I've read a few others here have, which is to insult anyone that has a different view to themselves. Especially to the person who stated that if you didn't like the film you weren't alive... that's a beautiful way to view the world. ""If you disagree with my viewpoint then you're a soulless being"" Brilliant.All I'm saying is that I have no idea why this film is hailed as a classic, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be...

1484,vpmzisi,A Cure for Insomnia,1,5 March 2019,"This has to be, without a doubt, the single most boring atrocity ever to grace the silver screen. I first had the misfortune of watching this film several years ago, when someone I knew forced me to see it, telling me it was one of the greatest films of all time. Ha! They couldn't be further from the truth! So what are its problems? The pace, for one thing. There are extended periods where people move slowly, and everything is quiet. This is an attempt to be scientifically accurate (it's in space, after all), but there is far too much of this in the film--all the great filmmakers have techniques of briefly illustrating effects like this for you, then moving on with the story. The other annoyance is how the film keeps cutting back to shots of animals. I remember the scene where the monkeys are playing with the bones. An absurd shot that's not very interesting at all. About the only thing about the film that's any good is the music, and by that, I am just referring to the Strauss pieces (Richard and Johann). Which, if I were either of those men, I'd sue the makers of this movie. Kubrick is probably the worst director of all time, and after being forced to sit through this one, I look forward to never seeing one of his films again, as long as I live!
I should say this film does have one redeeming quality. If you have trouble sleeping, this is the cure you've been waiting for!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1486,cetunh,Suffers from the same problems of all films of this era,4,6 August 2007,"People may say that in film everything does not have to be about plot, that some how you can just have pretty images on the screen and it is thus a good movie. Me? I don't think so this movie was too ahead of its time, not in visuals, but in audio any movie from this era suffered from the fact that any sound that can be made no matter no pleasant or unpleasant, can be made into the most shrill, annoying sound you will ever hear, and in this movie there is plenty of that not only do you get to listen to heavy breathing for about 20 minutes, but you also get to hear the air hose, which was extra special.Again like all movies of the time the score sucked, the classical music that was pared up with the scenes conjured up an air of fantasy, something you don't want to do in a film about the future.Yet again another movie killer, the acid trip scenes, what is with those, was every one high in the 60's 70's? I mean come on, did people back then really want to see 20 minutes of what looks like what happens if a clown exploded. yea all the colors are pretty, but enough is enough.The end puts you at a loss for words, I honestly believe the director just made up a random ending and said ""Interpret this, I'm not telling you what it means""One last thing, the pace of this movie was SSSSSSSSSLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWW there are so many pointless scenes in this movie, if I was watching it in theaters I could go home , cook dinner, bring it back to the theater and then eat while I wait 10 minute for something to happen. But, some people may argue that the scenes where long and boring because of the ""beauty"" and that every scene (no matter how long, and I mean long) has to be part of the plot, well WRONG, every scene longer than 10 seconds HAS TO be part of the plot, otherwise it's ""I have a huge budget, look what I can do."" Its a movie, if you want beauty go to your local science center there are plenty of movies without plots but beautiful scenery,(and some with beautiful scenery AND plot, who knew you could do both""The good parts of this movie that didn't have me reaching for my ear plugs where actually quite decent and if the whole movie has like these few parts it would have gotten an 9/10, but all this is, is 1 hour of movie one hour and a half of visual effects.

1489,aadkins1964,Mysterious alien artifact,8,5 May 2019,"The discovery of a mysterious alien object sends man on the trip of a lifetime. Keir Dullea as Dr. Dave Bowman goes on a space voyage with his fellow astronaut, Gary Lockwood as Dr. Frank Poole, and their perfect intelligent computer HAL 9000, voiced by Douglas Rain. The trio embark on a mission to Jupiter along with three hibernating companions. Unbeknownst to Bowman and Poole, their mission is not what it seems to be.The simplest theme for 2001: A Space Odyssey is the evolution of man. Through actions taken by others, man begins to evolve. This filmmaker depicts this in the scene of the first encounter of proto-humans with the monolith with their gaining the first tool usage. Additionally, the film explores the relationship between man and his technology, a gift given to him that he did not choose.The strong allusions to Homer's Odyssey are hard to miss in this film. Bowman makes a good stand in for Odysseus-the archer-both traveling on a far journey by ship to evolve their character, one to home and one to the future of mankind. HAL is the Cyclops of course, down to the small ""stick"" Bowman uses to poke out his ""eye,"" or space-screwdriver to remove his higher functions. Bowman even goes into a cave to kill HAL, mirroring Odysseus again.The impact of man's technology is shown in several scenes, some good and some bad. The very first use of technology, the club, results in good and bad. Proto-man gathers food more efficiently, but them uses that same technology to wage war and kill other proto-humans. Thus begins man's relationship with technology, good and bad. Man makes an outstanding computer, but then because of man's own failures, his technology turns on him. This motif used throughout the movie to show the costs of technology that comes from man's evolution.The space scenes, mostly shown in blue, indicate technology used for good, and the red scenes show technology's darker side, as noted in the Dawn of Man scenes and in HAL's single red eye. This motif illustrates that technology is neutral. How man uses it is up to him. Thus, man's evolution will decide if he uses technology for good or bad, though man chooses one as often as the other.
The ending leaves room for interpretations, so each person can put a little of their own interpretation on the story. Having arrived at Jupiter alone, Bowman finds another monolith and has an encounter with it that sends him through space, time, and evolution by instilling knowledge in him. Once he rests and swiftly uses his remaining human life, he is reborn as an energy being watching over the Earth. Or possibly he is saying goodbye, the viewer decides.Whether it is the major steps in evolution from the Dawn of Man, or Bowman's final evolution, the theme of evolution and its repercussions are notable throughout the film. With the full impact of technologies like the Internet and smartphones still playing out, the film's warnings about our use of technology is as relevant as it was 50 years ago. With special effects that were ahead of its time and universal themes, this a classic film that is still as engaging as it was when Kubrick created it, maybe even more so.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Why do people wear these clothes when they can travel in Space?I should tell the people who will watch this movie, there is so many unnecesarry scenes because this ""masterpiece"" is completely unnecesarry. If you do not watch this movie you'll be not have lost anything. Also if you have watched this movie you have lost 2 hours and a few minutes but look to the medallion's bright side: you've learned how must not make a movie. They can walk just like in the world even without gravity but televisions are still in like 1968.And I must admit that the people who like this movie are mentioning a book story. I guess i hate this movie because i haven't read that book. But the biggest problem is: Why must i have read a book before watch a 2-hour movie? And there is not even an ending in this movie because this movie hasn't even got a starting.This movie is full of boring and absurd scenes like falling in space. I only liked the first scene that with monkeys (and yes they're not human they're really monkeys.) because it made a query for how's the world when human doesn't exist.

It's a good film, and it was clearly meant more as art than to entertain. I'm perfectly fine with a movie which is a bit slow, or even goes a little wacky here and there, but when the first three minutes is a black screen, or a good 5 minutes with just a bunch of flashing graphics, that is a bit too far.If you go into the movie without ever hearing about it, a good appreciation for space and science fiction, and the ability to skip through the literal tens of minutes of the movie that is either a black screen, or indiscernible images, then you may get some enjoyment out of it as I had.If the fact that it was made in 68 throws you off, don't let it. The visuals have aged very well.In short, unless you are willing to excuse the black screens and flashing images as ""art"", don't expect it to live up to it's reputation.

For people in the 1970's when this movie was created, much of what this movie deals with would have been absolutely unknown or even inconceivable, like a man trying to explain mathematics to a monkey, some people simply lack the ability to fully comprehend what this movie is about.The vast amount of references to psychology, philosophy, art, and science that this movie contains would take paragraphs to fully describe.

The book cleared up many questions I had, even though the movie is fairly straightforward if you pay attention.  The dialogue, though scarce, is executed well.

Theres no point in trying to explain in detail, but I Will say this: If there ever was a movie ahead of its time, its 2001: A space masterpiece.To say something negative, I can understand the Movie to be considered boring if the images, the music and the mood set do not fit your taste (even if you do understand the perfectly subtile knowledge-theory context and philosophical undertone). The lack of actual plot, dialog
and of of a single interesting human caracter should also be considered....or not, cause It does not really matter, just watch it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1503,grrrr8,Simply the best!!,10,31 July 2006,"This is by far and away the greatest masterpiece to ever hit the big screen. Kubrik's style is perfectly suited to the symbolism that this show imparts. This movie will challenge your thought process in a most entertaining way. What more can be said other than this is a must see for any lover of films. Some have found the lack of dialog a hindrance to the film but I however found it refreshing. The music, lighting, camera angles all play a massive role in a film that does not allow itself the luxury of spoon feeding the viewer. Both the book and the movie are of impeccable quality and this is one of those rare films where it does the book justice (The Exorcist is another). A full 10 out of 10!!!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1504,hypercritical,"Intergalactic travel, filmed in real-time.",8,2 June 2001,"I was a high-school student when this film was released in the Sixties, and the word around town was, ""get stoned, and go see this movie."" Under the circumstances, ""2001"" became a nearly transcendental experience.Fast forward to the actual year 2001. Now middle-aged and sober, I see that ""2001"" was a lot better stoned. Still, the movie has much to recommend. It is mostly a visual banquet, the soundtrack is full of lovely classical music, and it is something of a treat to watch it realizing that it was the first major sci-fi movie with good enough special effects to make outer-space and its appurtenances seem real. But it is maddeningly slow-paced, especially for the first hour. The best actor is HAL, the computer, easily more facially expressive than  Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood. And the plot, such as it is, seems pretentious and absorbed with a by-now very silly cosmology, which, while fictional, fails to retain any attractiveness in the post-Timothy-Leary era.Keep an eye out for amusing anachronisms in this Sixties vision of the high-tech future. Evidently, apart from Dick Tracy's 2-way wrist TV, no Sixties futurists could envision the profound miniaturization of electronics which was on the doorstep. Hence, all the big, really clunky looking gadgets in this film. You get the impression that your laptop could replace most of one of their space stations. Interestingly, too, the filmmakers chose to continue the Cold War into their future world.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1506,ruzhyo2000-1,"A great, powerful, and unique cinema masterpiece",10,20 August 2006,"Like all works of art, great or not, however, there will be those who prefer not the qualities that make this movie great. Some say it's excruciatingly boring, and that there is just not enough plot. There are more elements to movies than explosive action and a typical, dialog-driven storyline.This movie takes some of the core elements that make movies great and expands and perfects them in a way no movie before it, to my knowledge, has never attempted or at least succeeded in doing. Because of this, it is somewhat abstract, which turns off many viewers, much in the way many people do not like abstract paintings. People want too much to know what is going on. They want the work's meaning to be force fed to them so that they don't have to go through the confusion of discovering what it means for themselves.It really is a love-it or hate-it kind of film, and is not for everyone. Personally, I love the movie, I can watch it over and over and love it more every time I do because of the beauty of every scene. The music, the camera angles, the pace, it's all perfect in my opinion, I would of not changed a thing. Kubrick portrays even the most simple of scenes with perfection, unmatched even by some of best movies these days.Never before have I seen such a powerful portrayal of space. He fills it life and death, beauty and fear, all at the same time. In any other movie, you will see space as nothing more than a place, yet Kubrich manages to make it seem as though it is living.For potential viewers, I will say this. If you are a fan of movies with action or straight forward plot and don't tend to mind if they lack heavily in terms of core cinematic elements then you probably won't like this movie very much, but if you believe in cinema as art, then you must watch this movie. You will not regret it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The original 'King Kong' was a classic. The 1951 'The Thing from Another Planet' was a classic. 'The Bride of Frankenstein' was a classic.

This is art, and true artists let the audience form their own opinions and come up with their own questions.

1520,SteSykes,Best film ever made - fact.,10,6 February 2002,"I guess there's not a lot I can say about this film that hasn't already been written, but I feel almost compelled to write something since it's the greatest film ever made (this is not an opinion, it's a fact).Everything about the film is perfect, from the music played over the opening shot (actually, not really a shot, it's just a blank screen) to the oft-discussed final image of the film. It's sort of ambitious to start a film with the title card ""The Dawn of Man"" and have an ending concerned with the future of the human race, but Kubrick was never a person to let practical limits deter him. The film is immaculately crafted all the way through, especially is the visual and aural sense, and the special effects are nothing short of spectacular. They give the film the sense of scale that it really needed to succeed where it is trying to. The effects are particularly impressive when you consider that it was nearly 35 years ago that they were shot, and the ""stargate"" sequence is better than anything I've seen created by CGI to date. And, of course, there's the music... I couldn't say for sure, but I reckon that this was the first time that an score made entirely of pieces of classical music was used in such a large film, and it's *certainly* the first (and last) time it has been used so well. Now many films take that approach simply to appear more intelligent than they actually are.I feel sorry for people who have become so weaned on narrative-driven movies nowadays that they dismiss the movie out of hand as being slow and boring. 2001: A Space Odyssey is unparalleled in cinema as a spectacle, and as an experience.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The visual storytelling is breathtaking and moves the plot far more than the dialogue. The acting is unremarkable and perfunctory, but it is hardly noticeable among the movie's visuals.As if in a silent film, The music is a character in this movie.  A teriffic and varied classical score is truly remarkable.  Part of me wishes Kubrick had used his original impulse to have british prog-rockers Pink Floyd do the music for the film.  That part of me is small, though, and gets beaten into submission when I watch the movie.The visual effects in this film are truly remarkable.  There are no laser beams and explosions, but the space scenes on the moon and en route to Jupiter are fully believable, and after all, suspension of disbelief is the prime factor in sci-fi.  We should keep in mind, this film was made before the Apollo moon landings.The psychedelic finale of the film needs a big screen to be fully appreciated.  I recently saw the re-release on a huge screen and I can truly say it was like watching the movie for the first time.  This movie is enjoyable on video, but it borders on a religious experience in front of a 40 foot screen supported by digital sound.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1523,DaveBass,"""I honestly think you ought to sit down calmly, take a stress pill, and think things over.""'",10,2 February 2003,"Without a doubt, one of the finest films of the 20th century, Stanley Kubrick has created a work of art that will be studied and appreciated for countless generations. Very few other filmmakers have ever attempted a tale with the depth and scope of 2001, and none have succeeded. This is cinema truly as art, and like a Van Gogh painting or a William Blake poem, accessible, yet dense, and broadly open to interpretation.It is easy to understand the controversy surrounding this film, and why it creates an either a hate it or love it reaction with the majority of its viewers. This film is different from anything that came before it, and sadly, except for its widely imitated special effects, just as different from every film that has been made since. It doesn't pander to or insult its audience, it is a film that one must experience, on the director's own terms, and almost inevitably, come away changed.Interesting, for a feature film with very limited dialog, it contains one of the most powerful and memorable conversations in the history of film. A dialog between computer and man, where for 95% of the conversation, only the man's breathing, can be heard. After having seen the film many times now, I still get chills watching this scene.This is a film that one can't imagine being made today. It is too uncompromising and original. The studios would want a heroic and glib Bruce Willis as the mission commander battling to save the crew, spouting clever one-liners, and overcoming impossible odds leading up to the required happy ending. Yippee-ki-yay, HAL 9000. Bruce kisses the girl, fadeout, up comes a hiphop tune with credits. Nope. No major studio would make this movie today, and speaking of impossible odds, consider the pitch meeting where a screenwriter even tried to sell this movie. He'd be escorted off the lot by security.For those who have never seen this film, or have seen it once and didn't like it, I have this comment. Put Star Wars, Star Trek and every other science fiction film out of your mind. It isn't going to be anything like those, yet its look heavily influenced every space film that followed. You won't see the now standard 20 cuts in 12 seconds approach to editing. Kubrick's shots are like individual works of art in a gallery, and he allows you the time to ponder them. Its ok not to like this film, many people prefer Vin Diesel to Van Gogh, but if you have any real interest in cinema, you owe it to yourself to experience one of the most important and influential films ever made. And if possible, see it in a theatre, as this is one film that truly loses a lot in the translation to the small screen. Thanks, Stanley.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1525,filmlover33,The Medium is the Message,10,21 June 2007,"Stanley Kubrik takes a technically remarkable approach in presenting a purely cinematic experience, and what the medium, itself, has to offer. We observe certain techniques as Kubrik attempts to juxtapose various themes relating to technology and its influence on the environment. From the opening dawn of man sequence to the slow space orbiting, Kubrik engulfs the audience in a manner similar to technology captivating society. As we see the apes playing with the prodigious ""tool,"" Kubrik sequentially cuts to space of a matching image of the spaceship. The juxtaposition of these images signifies the new age of technology and its eventual enormous influence on the environment. Very appropriately, we see how some of the men are put into hybernation during the mission, similar to how in space we feel a sense of confinement, isolation, and detachment from humanity and environment. In order to enhance the theme of technology's effect on humanity, we see how the astronauts use very little dialogue, demonstrating unenthusiastically without displaying any emotions, while the computer, HAL, expresses emotions in a more dramatic manner. Through Kubrik's creative mind, simply stated, he indicates that, HAL reacts in humanistic terms; while the human's actions and reactions are limited and controlled by technology. During the final stages of the film, we can observe the impressive special effects which may be beyond the viewers comprehension, and still holds its ground today. In the process, the technique serves to challenge the viewer to question his or her own environment and culture. In the final shot, we see the child orbiting in space which signifies that he has been born to another level or possible celestial body, something that the audience finds unimagineable. Stands as one of the best films ever to emphatically suggest the influence technology has in shaping societal conditions. Surely, there have been other films which dabbled with the same theme and have taken similar techniques, but none to the level of the space odyssey, in which it doesn't just offer numerous techniques, but the fact that the MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1526,hysterical_laughter11,"Watch it Three Times, At Minimum.",10,27 June 2007,"There are three types of movies, to me at least. The director's film (the one where the directing takes the front seat), the actor's film (the one where the performances are the only worthwhile thing), and the scripted film (the one where the writing outshines everything else.) This is a director's film. The acting is pretty good, considering we don't see too much of it, and the writing is decent enough, but its Kubrick's directorial vision that really makes this film brilliant. If I had to choose one film to prove Kubrick's madness and his genius, I'd choose this one.I must warn you, this movie is absolute crap to most people when viewed the first time. I thought it was the single most overrated piece of junk ever to be spurned out of Hollywood's behind the first time I watched it. With multiple viewings though, it becomes apparent why this film is on every movie critic's top 100 list. You have to give this movie a chance, and you have to be open and pay full attention. Its not a movie that you can snooze through and still understand(thank God!) The reason why many people don't like it is because no one will ever fully understand it (even if you do pay attention) and it forces you into a bad, disturbing, and unsettling trip. This is thanks in part to the soundtrack(how much you understand the film is determined by how much you listened to the overture) and Kubrick's knack for visuals. This could have easily been an educational documentary into space, but Kubrick instead made it an eerie lapse into our future. Almost like we're feeling what the astronauts are feeling (going into the unknown; being fearful; etc.) And who can forget the revolutionary visuals? Considering there was no technology back then as there is today, this movie is a pretty great feat. The visuals do stand the test of time, for they are still awe-worthy and dumbfounding. You just don't get something as good as this, even with all of our technological advances, in today's cinema (the closest we've come to these great feats are probably with the Lord of The Rings movies..)One final thing before I conclude; this movie scares the hell out of me. Kubrick was intelligent, because he knew that cheap thrills were only a superficial scare, but a man's real terror is his fear of the unknown and his fear of the future. In fact, this movie is more terrifying than most horror films that come out today. I can't stress how important it is to pay full attention to this film, because it can't take you on the amazingly unsettling journey (it wasn't called A Space Odyssey for the hell of it) if you don't. Most of you may find it hard to do this (I'll admit, everything until the HAL sequences are bores the first time you watch it) but its crucial for you to do. Because if you don't, you will miss out on how great this movie is, and you will regret that $4.99 you paid to rent it.and like the title says, please watch it three times at minimum.~Frankie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

If you hate it, you really don't like it. It is the Ulysses or the ""Les demoiselles d'Avignon"" of the cinematic world: confusing, epic, bizarre, but masterful. Kubrick (God rest his soul) created a powerfully symbolic film, which is part of the reason why some people don't like it very much. None of it is clear cut, but everything you see is there for a reason. Kubrick makes you work through this movie. Whether it's realizing that ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"" is the theme music for the next great moment in human evolutionary history, pinpointing the exact moment where we see HAL's first emotional response (or do we?), or even something as simple as Frank's frightening death that all too clearly backs up the statement, ""In space, no one can hear you scream,"" you have to think.

I wished I could have seen this film when it came out, what an experience this would have been.I'm not sure I can add something worthwhile to the large number of very fine comments about 2001 present on this site. To those confused, disappointed or angry about the film I'd encourage them to read a number of those comments until they can get some explanation or maybe an echo of their own feeling. Anyway, here goes:Yes there is a story (and a great one at that) in this film, yes you do have to look for it a little, sure it is not spoon-fed to you like modern Hollywood films tend to do, but it's not hard really, and why should all films be the same? Don't you find it nice to be challenged?No it's *not* slow. The more I watch it (I've seen it 3 times) the more things and meaning I find in it, the more time I have to think about what I'm seeing. Isn't that nice for a change?Say that you were looking at some distant galaxy full of stars through the eyepiece of a telescope, would you expect it to dance before your eyes for your entertainment? yet wouldn't there be a deep mystery in that sight? would you not find yourself in awe of this fantastic object? wouldn't you ask yourself if intelligent beings lived out there millions of light years away? How could we contact them? What would they look like? what if they had a civilization that would be so far advanced that we would be like insects are to us, what would they do to us? Would they be benign or hostile?Well you can't expect an intelligent film like `2001' to provide you with detailed answers to these questions. If it did it would be trite and contrived and `2001' would be mere entertainment. If that is what you are looking for in a sci-fi movie you can watch Star Wars or Star Trek, where aliens are just as silly and lost in their wan little lives as we are. No, in `2001' we have real aliens, and they have a plan for us. Can we hope to understand them? maybe.The real force of `2001' is that it does not feed you a stupid answer to life and everything, and that it tries to get you to think. There are very few things in real life like that. This is also an incredibly optimistic film, I always feel elated after viewing it, and in awe of what my fellow humans can do sometimes.You may not like this film, and that's fine and that's your privilege.

1530,donovan1983,Amazing visuals with little substance,4,25 February 2010,"I finally got around to watching this movie last night. Actually it's the second time I had tried to watch it, but the first time I actually finished it. And I have no desire to ever see it again.I do have to say that 2001 has amazing visuals. The space scenes of all sorts are simply stunning and hold up quite well even today. There was obviously a lot of effort put into them. Definitely the highlight of the movie.The effects are also amazingly realistic. The scene where Dave has to blow the hatch on his pod and momentarily be exposed to space is realistic in a way I've never seen in any other movie. First off, there is no sound of an explosion or anything else, which makes perfect sense since there is no sound in a vacuum. He also doesn't explode or be severely injured, unlike every other movie set in space.2001 is a ponderously slow film. But that's not my main problem with it, though. I can watch slow films so long as I have a reason to keep watching; as in an investment in the characters. There is a severe lack of character development and none of the characters, even the infamous HAL, are shown long enough or in a way that allows me to have any sort of attachment to them. The only character that got any development at all was mankind itself in the first part of the movie, and I can hardly sympathize with a primitive, brutal character as portrayed there. The individuals later in the movie were shown as being largely expendable, with no real reason to be anything but indifferent about their fate. HAL itself was the only character I had any shred of sympathy for, ironically showing himself to be more human than the crew members aboard the ship. Yet I was still largely indifferent when he was disconnected. Yes, ""indifference"" is a word that describes my attitude towards pretty much all the characters in this movie.Because of my indifference to the characters I had no reason to really ponder what the story was beyond what was shown on screen. I did not care what the purpose of the monoliths were since they affected characters I did have any investment in.As a visual feast this movie fares quite well. As a means for telling a story, it falls flat. A story needs characters and that's what 2001 sorely lacks.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1531,rbarba23,An Abstract Sensory Adventure Demanding Infinite Contemplation,8,7 March 2008,"For the record, I only gave this an 8/10 because I personally believe that people way over rate movies on this site which makes the ratings hard to read. Basically an 8 is a 10 on this site and I wish people would vote a little more conservatively. Not every movie can be a 9 or a 10.But to the movie... this is a post I recently added to message board a few days ago and wanted to make it a comment as well. I saw this when I was really young, like 10 years old or something, and just wondered what the hell and thought it was stupid. Obviously I was the stupid one. However, I just watched this in 720p Bluray format on my 24 inch computer monitor last night and it blew my mind. I had to come here and lay down a thorough opinionated review.I had some very mixed feelings about the film. Without a doubt the visual aspects of the entirety of the film, especially for a film from the late 60's, were just stunning. It made me wonder why Star Wars didn't look any better for being made much later (sorta). But I guess that is all just small model sets and floating models held by mono filament so not much changed technology wise in between the two films. I was also impressed by the entire space/time warp scene because computer programs I have today could not create that and have it run so crisply. Other then that, the goofy stewardesses and space shuttles were very fun and interesting.In terms of audio, I found this film to be a piece of pure genius. The way they cut surrounding sound and focused sound, alternating them, all that jazz, just blew my mind. It was quite eerie at times but I really think it made the film that much better.In terms of the actual plot and message the movie was trying to provide I become a little confused. Obviously all of these opinions are my own, so I would love to hear any arguments or agreements. I do believe that the monolith was purely metaphorical. It was there as a representation of the advancements of mankind. First it brought about pre-man tools. Then it brought about HAL. Then it brought about time and distant space travel. I think that it was real in the story, but it's actual physical presence was meaningless in the grand scheme of the themes of this film. As stated above, I do think that the warp Dave experiences is a rip through time and space that spat him out somewhere totally different, possibly a different dimension. This aged him incredibly fast, so fast that he could not even realize that it was him moving from the pod to eating at the table and then to death. After that life begins again and that is where you find the floating fetus.So basically I think that the general theme of the film is that life is totally cyclical. Whether it is earth or not, life begins, evolves, ends, and starts again; we have no idea how it started or why it happens this way nor will we ever. I think my only problem I had with this movie is the entire issue surrounding HAL. I found HAL's part in this movie was over done and the general idea that machines have the potential to outsmart man and/or go haywire is widely known and considered so why focus so much time on it. Obviously technology is going to improve and that was already shown by the fact that they could travel to Jupiter in the first place. I think they just needed something solid for people to sort of ""tag"" the movie to. The most important parts of the film is the beginning when the primates find the monolith and the end when Dave splits space and time into a new dimension and instantly goes through an entire life process... and then starts again. I just wish that they gave a little bit more clarity in terms of what actually happened with the monolith and with Dave and I feel this could have been done without ruining any of the wonderful aspects of this film. Either way, the film was clearly not meant to have a perfect ending and I think that is what makes it so intriguing and fun to watch. I hope this helps! Cheers, Randy",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1532,denisrobitaille,A visual feast,10,3 May 2007,"A lot of time has passed since 2001 hit the screens. How many times have we seen a ""cut corners"" version on TV? With the advent of DVDs and panoramic computer screens, it is possible to have a glimpse of what the original must have looked like in the theaters. My god, what a feast for the eyes and ears! Almost every shot is composed like a master's painting.*SPOILERS FOLLOW* Take, for instance, the scene with the discovery of ""the tool"", where we see the ape-man trashing through a skeleton in slow-motion. At one point we see the clouds parting behind him, letting the sun in, with the ironically triumphant ""Zarathustra"" music. And the final chord sustained while the hand holding bone hits again (Kill! Kill!) and again and... Well, you get the idea! Incredible images...The megalomaniac shot of the size of the ""Discovery"" spaceship, slowly revealed as Katchaturian's music depicts the dullness of the long journey through space. This is years before the opening shot of Star Wars and how efficient on a wide screen! The shot where we see Bowman enter the pod room; the lines on the floor and ceiling (the ""point de fuite"" of the image, I don't know the English equivalent of the expression) points directly toward the forgotten helmet.The colors...And I won't even go into the plot points! Wonderfully ambiguous; does the monolith represent God, or extraterrestrials? Your choice.*SPOILERS END* Extraordinary movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1533,Piercan,Looking at it in 2002,9,22 October 2002,"It is hard for me to believe that this movie was made 34 years ago. Sanley Kubrick was a genius. This movie is like a piece of art work. So was ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and, even more unbelievably, so was Clockwork Orange. Who else could have portrayed ugly violence in style like this? An anticipation of the future too: just look at what's happening in islamicized French ""banlieues"" these days.To come back to ""2001 Space Odysey"" it didn't need all the advanced techniques we have today for ""special effects"". The pictures convey the infinite slowness of the speed of light, and the music is like the sound of silence. A film for all times. A classic. Impressive!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1534,Quetzalcoatlus,Mixed feelings,7,16 January 2008,"I have a love/hate relationship with this movie.I'll start with the good. Visually, this is a breathtaking movie. Excellent camera work, great set design, and the ability to hold up very well, even 40 years later, is an accomplishment no one can ignore. We truly get a sense of the vastness of space, and how small we as humans are. This movie works best on a big screen, to fully appreciate its physical beauty. Conceptually, it's a good plot. I often think of things on a larger, cosmic scale, which is abundant in this film. It makes you feel like a little kid, gaping at wonders beyond your imagination, and at the same time, very lonely and isolated. We are sent millions of miles from home, in a quiet spaceship, with only two astronauts, a crew of comatose scientists, and an on-board AI to keep us company. However, my favorite part of the movie (and in my humble opinion its strongest point), is its villain. HAL 9000 (or simply HAL) is one of the most nefarious and treacherous villains ever to grace the big screen. He has no physical body to speak of besides a small red light on the wall, but his presence is everywhere. He can command the ship's machinery and systems. How can you defeat a foe using the very thing that's keeping you alive? Even so, through all his villainy, we can't help but feel for him, and understand his fear as he is slowly (and possibly painfully) shut down.I've given this movie quite a bit of positive lip service. So what didn't I like about it? Well, quite frankly, I liked 99% of this movie. There are only two things I didn't like. Reason 1: Pretty minor. I felt the sequence falling through Jupiter's atmosphere was too long. I think a couple of minutes of psychedelic colors would've sufficed, as opposed to about 5 or 10. But, this is minor. The next reason, unfortunately, isn't. Reason 2: The ending. We watch Dave go through life slowly on Jupiter (a scene which was shot very well), and slowly die before the all-powerful monolith.... AND THEN DAVE WAS A FETUS. Wait, what? No, really. The last 10 seconds of this movie ruined it for me. Say what you will. Symbolism and metaphors are fine, but turning your protagonist into a space baby is just silly. I've heard the ending to the book explains this sequence fairly well, but Kubrick doesn't.I appreciate this movie for what it is. It defined modern sci-fi as we know it. It influenced countless films after it (including my personal favorite, Alien), and is a visual treat to look at. However, its ending kills it. I also don't like the elitism behind the big fans of this movie. The general attitude is, ""Well, if you didn't like the ending/movie, CLEARLY you don't possess the intelligence to understand it. 2001 is a THINKING man's movie."" No. I am not stupid. I liked most of this movie. I didn't mind the slow pacing, or the small amount of dialog. I understood most of it. Giant fetuses just don't do it for me.Overall? Certainly an important movie, if nothing else. Lovely to look at, with a fantastic villain, if a bit of a letdown. Should be seen by anyone who considers themselves a fan of sci-fi.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1535,memdoc,My favorite movie,10,12 July 2002,"This film is beautiful to behold.  Beautiful pictures, beautiful music, beautiful direction all telling a  rather simple story about very complex issues.  For those who found the film boring or slow, you ought to know that Kubrick intentionally created a drawn out exposition of the plot to show how boring space travel and perhaps space itself can be.  Indeed, there are lots of jabs at techonological progress throughout, e.g. HAL spells IBM minus one letter in the alphabet for each letter, and the primitive bone-tool is juxtaposed with a space ship in what must be the single greatest jump cut in the history of cinema.  The excitement occurs due to conflict and is instigated by a mysterious and rather unnatural or even supernatural monolith from (?outer) space.  The monolith intervenes with the natural course of history at very crucial moments in evolution and human development leading man into a pursuit of the monolith itself.  We never learn what the monolith is nor do we know where it came from.  Is it God?  Is it alien life?  Is it a cosmic joke?  Regardless of what it is, man is simply obsessed about finding out what this monolith is, where it came from, and what it means.   Like most of Kubrick's films, this one is about human nature and it's mysterious origins.  At first innocent, later intelligent and, consequently, violent.  In many ways, 2001 is a retelling of Adam's fall from grace and, possibly, future salvation.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1536,simonhorne,A boundary still unsurpassed,10,5 August 2002,"This film has the most astonishing first 25 minutes of any film in the history of cinema and they always leave me awestruck.  These first 25 minutes have no dialogue or voiceover at all, but tell the evolution of man in a very profound and intense way; punctuated and complemented perfectly by Kubrick's fabulous choice of music.Much of the film uses quiet naturalistic dialogue which gives the film a sense of ""realism"".  Many of the Special Effects are still passable even by today's standards.  the only exception being the Wormhole sequence towards the end which does look a quite dated now.2001 is THE thought provoking film of the last century.  It seeks to answer some of our questions of man's relationship with the universe, the essence of humanity and the nature of existence, and in doing so seems to leave you wanting to ask even more.2001 is unparalleled, unequalled and in a Genre of it's own.  There has been and never will be a film like it again.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1537,Addy2389,Recommend Watching At 4x.....8x..Or Even Faster,2,3 September 2008,"This is my first comment on any movie ever , i never portrayed my self as a writer, but i had to take out the frustration of watching such an over hyped piece of ""Art""(yup I've heard they call such movies art)and to make every possible effort to stop people like me(sci-fi lovers)from watching this crap. so i decided to share my experience with youif u are thinking of watching this movie I'll suggest you watch in 2x or a faster mode. the movie is so boring,its like watching a 30 min documentary about the working of spacecrafts in super slow motion. over 95% of the total run time of movie is without any dialogues . the scenes of space ships crossing other planets were extended to the limits. i didn't understand what the first 30 minutes of the movie were about. the background score is loud,irritating , unnecessary some times, but repetitive throughout. and for some music lovers they added 3 minutes of those irritating sounds without any images in the beginning of the movie as well as after the intermission,DVD i rented had an intermission too(the most interesting part).A tiny thing this movie lacks is the ""PLOT"" after 1 hr and 10 min of the movie when hall tells Dave about the malfunction i prayed that the ship would crash and the movie will end but it didn't (my bad luck perhaps there was more of it for me to watch) the only interesting sequence was when Dave tries to get back into the spaceship and hall dies,in fact this was the only part of the movie i understood. i hoped the movie would now pace up, but that was not what the film makers had in mind. if the movie wasn't boring enough,the worst was still to come that's ""beyond the infinite"" i couldn't sum up a thing that happens after Dave enters the monolith a series of diff colored scenes then suddenly he's in a room watching himself getting old and then he's turned into some sort of cosmic baby(what was the ending all about?)the only reason i watched this is because I'm trying to watch the top 250. and this is the only one i regret watching. the one thing that's nice about this movie are the clean camera tricks used to create the anti gravity environment even in the 60's, nothing else that's why I'll give it a generous 2/10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1538,biznen,A groundbreaking picture.,9,11 November 2002,"2001 broke ground in the area of science fiction in film.  All further films and televion (Trekies) was based on this film.  Kubrick created some brilliant special effects to show his ideas.  He did this a year before anyone would land on the moon.  This is astounding.  One may consider this in terms of the popular science fiction to follow 2001.  Star Wars would not be released for nine years.  2001 set precedents and had very little space experience on which to base them.  To date, there may not be a film which is more physically accurate.  I have hear complaints about the lenght of 2001 and the lack of action and dialogue.  Factually, a trip to Jupiter or Saturn would be pretty boring.  If in watching 2001, a viewer has the intellectual capability (either by reading the book, seeing the movie before, or incredible insight) to understand the subtleties, the movie will be one of the best ever seen.  It gets better with each viewing.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1539,easmeds,Science fiction worth calling science fiction,9,29 May 2008,"2001: A Space Odyssey is an amazing film. There, that's out of the way. Now I can discuss why. Of course there are the usual things: the amazing special effects(one of the few Oscars SF films ever win), the scientific accuracy, and of course the music; I get the chills whenever I watch the opening shot. And then there are the iconic scenes that nearly everyone manages to rip-off in some way, shape, or form. And then there's HAL. I'm not sure if I'd call the HAL 9000 computer the greatest movie villain, but he's certainly up there. Think about it: he's polite, he's got a great personality, a cheery, conversational manner(compared to the monotoned astronauts), and he's terrific at chess. And he's not above killing people to complete his mission. Douglas Rain deserves an award for the voice of HAL(Anthony Hopkins modeled his Hannibal Lecter after it); the homicidal computer would be nothing without it. And let's not forget his demise: HAL's rendition of ""Daisy Bell"" is certainly the most haunting scene in the film. HAL is without doubt my favorite part of 2001, and I think Stanley Kubrick did an amazing job with him. But I think HAL would do better playing poker: he's got the perfect poker face.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Since then I've seen the picture about five times and each time i actually enjoyed it more than the last.Now i'm at a point where every scene in the film seems practically perfect to me. I love every single second of 2001, and believe it to be Stanley Kubrick's finest two and a half hours.2001 is a slow film, with long visually stunning scenes that look far more realistic than some CGI effects today. Nearly every scene is a classic, in particular the 'Rebirth'Although often seen as a Science fiction, 2001 is more than that. It's a very philosophical and spiritual film. It asks questions.

After watching it I realized that ""2001"" is abstract art of a so far unknown dimension I had never thought was possible.This movie would definitely suck, IF we humans had no brain: The movie leaves us with a billion gasillion gadillion questions, it ends open, and you can interpret the story in so many unthinkable ways. I especially like the symbols! The bone, I think, is a symbol of the first creative thought. It was a tool for the primitive monkey to get more power, but then the bone suddenly turns into a space ship. How much more civilized can we get!?

1543,The_guy_who_likes_fr-2,Brilliant!,10,7 September 2008,"I first saw this film alone one cold evening at the Astor theatre in Melbourne a couple of years ago, I was baffled at the ticket price- $25 but paid nonetheless. It was only afterwards I found out the lead actors Kier Dullea and Gary Lockwood where going to do a Q & A session- coming out from the US. Now, the Astor theatre is the only 'classic' style cinema left in Melbourne; it has just one screen (albeit quite large) and seating capacity for a large crowd.From the opening sequence- 3 minutes of blackness, accompanied by music to mirror the void, it was clear that '2001: A Space Odyssey was going' to be a large scale film. The thing I found remarkable about the film was how well the two most powerful elements of film, music and (of course) the visual picture, where crafted together. It is the synthesis of the two that makes this film great, and it is greatly aided by the powerful and memorable score. Indeed, the film won the 1969 Oscar for visual effects, while the masterful direction of Stanley Kubrick earned him a nomination.It is difficult to describe the plot of '2001' without boring you, my good reader, to death. I'll therefore leave it at this; monolith (cubical wall?), Monkey, HAL-9000, mission to Jupiter. This movie has borne many famous and spoofed scenes and to any who know nothing about the film, he/she/it/walrus will find the watching of this quite informative.If you like direct action, look somewhere else, to keep it simple- no guns are fired.

Its so slow paced movie that one can go for a cup of tea or toilet and come back and movie would be still at same place on same scene. Its probably only movie that one can watch in fast forward mode and it will still look as slow movie. My head kept on whirling for even 12 hours after finishing it. Probably in 1968 showing spacecrafts would be exciting for the viewer. Lights at the end of movie are shown are even worst than a dance club. I have to give it one star only because lesser was not possible. Those who rated this movie too high might be torture loving people who want other to go through same torture and pain from which I went through due to watching this movie.

1545,tvcunningham,You have to THINK when you watch this one. That's it.,10,25 February 2009,"I'm not going to pad this review full of praise for the film (if you're reading this you've probably heard it all). No, I'm going to tell you that depending on the type of person you are, you will either believe that you've just witnessed one of the greatest transcendent pieces of cinema ever, or the most trippy head-scratching bore of your life.While I side firmly with the former, I do understand the position of the latter. The movie dwells on shots a little (or a lot, depending on your age) longer than most are used to, of what little dialogue there is most of it is given to a computer, and that's a good thing because all the humans are one note bores (psst..they're supposed to be), and what's up with that ending? Come to think of it, what's up with that opening? I really understand why there are people who don't get it. And here's WHY:2001 is one of few films that: (A) Were made with the intention to require you to THINK, no wait... downright contemplate what you're watching as you're watching it. (B) Also have an ambiguous ending.(Doesn't make sense of itself at the end) (C) Are actually successful at both A and B. (D) Are sufficiently well known enough that you're reading this right now, despite A and B. (Other examples, Let's see: Blade Runner, Twelve Monkeys, The Fountain, Donnie Darko, Pi, Cube, Primer..wait now I'm getting indie, see what I mean?)That's the deal. There is absolutely ZERO spoon-feeding here. In fact there's is no spoon (HA sub-conscious Matrix reference!). However, let me disagree with some lovers of 2001 by saying that you are not an idiot if you don't get it. Most people watch entertainment passively, to relax. And they don't want to ponder the mysteries of the universe after a long day. Makes sense. However, all of that still doesn't make the film anything less than a brilliant masterpiece.

The sheer mind numbing boredom made it difficult to sit through let alone understand, which is, of course not hard, as there is no decent plot whatsoever.

Applauding it only makes it worse for the movie industry, as some idiots will want to make more like it. Just 'cos Kubrick has made some classics doesn't mean they all are.

1548,JamesPino,"Disturbing, accurate, awesome",10,17 July 2009,"The number one reason I am so fascinated with this film is the fact that it was made in 1968. We hadn't even landed on the moon and lots of technology was still in its infancy. Yet, this films looks and sounds as if it were produced yesterday - in fact, it looks better. I don't think filmmakers could make something this good anymore with their crappy unconvincing CG. It's like a fine analog recording of a great jazz band, or a 60's muscle car - these things just aren't done the same way, lost to a different era.This film is also disturbing in a way I hadn't expected for a science fiction film. The use of music, sound, and trippy visual effects bring you to an almost psychedelic state of mind, especially near the end of the film. I don't think Aurthur C. Clarke had this in mind when he wrote the book, but Stanley Kubrick (director) took it to a whole new level.It's also jaw-dropping how accurately the future is predicted. I'm not going to spoil it for you, you'll have to watch the film to see what I mean. In fact it's so futuristic that friends and family of mine who saw the film for the first time were totally convinced it was made in the late 90s.If we had geniuses like Kubrick producing films like this today, just imagine the possibilities. By the way, 2010 (the sequel) doesn't even come close, but it's good nonetheless.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

There somehow was the weird feeling how one can use the famous blue danube waltz to comment an extended spaceship docking sequence.It is obvious that for younger audiences this film is no stuff;especially not for lovers of the bruckheimerian bumm- bumm flics.But for those, who want to take a tour to the darker realms of intelligence ,this stunning picture is highly recommended. The story isn`t just that crucial as it was often mentioned out. It describes a magnificient circular motion from the ""Dawn of Man"" to the glorious perfection of mankind, which is also devine. In the center, there we have a struggle for live beetween an astronaut(i.e.Mankind)and the computer HAL(i.e.the representation of all technical devices we`ve developed in history).HAL is ,notwithstanding a computer,the only real character in the film; that focuses something of the bitterweetness of maestro Kubrick`s perspective of the human race.I think it means that we as beings just have not reach all the fulfilment of our opportunities.The story with us is not over yet.Classical music lovers will surely praise the use of modern avantgarde scores to push the dramatical impact and to undermine some things on the screen.One of the most metaphysical culminations of cinema history we have at the end, when the astronaut has an encounter with the unknown, supernatural power; it conducts our ""hero"" to the frontiers of consciousness. 10 stars of 10.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1551,maxhasler,A giant leap on the road towards a new type of cinema,10,19 February 2010,"Kubrick's career essentially divides in two (this is an over simplification, but it'll work for now). In the first half Kubrick (while he was making a name for himself) concentrated on making the very best of narrative cinema. Even in these films however (particularly Paths of Glory and Dr Strangelove) Kubrick was pointing the way to what was to come later: an attempt to make film that is beyond narrative and free of the conventions that are generally associated with mainstream cinema. 2001 is his announcement of this intention.In the traditional sense of what cinema is, this film is a complete failure – the plot is either absent or wafer thin, the acting is formulaic and insipid, the script is equally devoid of the sort of lines we associate with great cinema (the bits that have become quotable do so by repetition) and the film frequently challenges audience attention spans. The key to all of this is to understand that everything Kubrick does in all his later films is entirely deliberate. If you don't think this is true then pause for a moment and consider that Kubrick got great performances from Douglas, managed to provide some of the best comic timing I've ever seen in Strangelove and drove Nicholson to the performance that was both the apex and death of his career (pretty much everything after the Shining just seems to be Jack trying to relive that greatness).Kubrick used the prestige and trust that he had built through his career to then pursue this type of film. Narrative for Kubrick by this stage was an entirely incidental affair; as well it should be – after all why the hell should films be so beholden to narrative? Poetry isn't, nor painting, nor are many of the great novels. This idea that the story is the be all and end all of films, rammed down our throats since time immemorial is a truly questionable one. As is the notion that films are there to entertain; they really aren't. Films can be entertaining and can succeed as pure entertainment, but that does not mean a film fails if it lacks any entertainment. If you don't like it, don't watch it, I'm sorry but that's your loss as a viewer. Rant over.2001 attempts (and in my opinion succeeds) at something that very few other directors have ever attempted and that is to place the film as an exploratory work of art front and centre. This is not to say that the reason the acting is so robotic is because Kubrick neglected it. Rather, he uses the acting first of all to continue his exploration of the relationship between man and machine (by having the mechanised voice out-act the actors themselves). Secondly, he uses this style of acting to move the audience's attention away from the performances and characters at the centre of traditional films and towards the film itself as a whole. What you're left with is an experience unlike any other that requires a huge effort from you as the viewer but leaves you all the richer for it. What Kubrick creates is daring and original and should be hailed as such – one of the greatest films of all time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1552,brodielee4,Most Artistic Movie of all time,10,5 November 2004,"The first time I saw this movie I was very young and I didn't understand it. Actually to be honest I really didn't understand it until about a week ago, when I saw the film again. This film is a work of art, visually and psychologically. You can come up with so many different conclusions about the film. For instance, that the whole film is symbolic of a birth. Another conclusion that I have heard is that the film is about the conflict between man and his tools. I would have to lean towards the latter, mainly because I read a striking review about it. The review stated that every time that man achieved a milestone in civilization, as in finding a tool and using to gather food or to fight with, a monolith appeared. Apparently the monolith was placed by aliens. Just like when man discovered the monolith on the moon. It was placed there by aliens. Thats what I believe happened, but I can't explain the end with all the colors and the room sequence. All in all the was one of the best movies that I have ever seen, I suggest that everyone sees it whether you like it or not, and whether you understand it or not.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1553,CoolDog01,Can Somebody please tell me why this movie is good cos i would really like to know!!!,10,3 January 2011,"I really didn't get this movie & not just the ending where the guy is in that room but the entire movie. Honestly i expected a lot more from Stanley Kubrick after i saw the shinning(1980) which was the 2nd greatest horror movie i ever saw 1st of course being scream(1996) & all I got was a plotness mess of scenery & for some reason, very bad special effects as it did look quite fake. It seemed like different things were just happening without purpose like the 1st scene that was set very early in the B.C.s. Why is this movie so popular? Should I watch it again? I know that lots of people were confused by the ending but I was confused by the entire plot.This i reckon is Stanley Kubricks worst film ever & I definitely would encourage you not to watch it.And now the ending. After the credits were rolling i just went OMFG WHAT JUST HAPPENED!!! The guy found the thing floating in space & then there was a burst of colour & then he was in that room when he slowly aged & after he died he basically turned into something called the star child & if you're gonna tell me to read the book to find out what the ending means then obviously the movie hasn't explained it meaning it is not a good film! I hate it how some people who originally hated this film liked it after reading this book.3/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1554,IMDb-forist,Excellent,10,9 March 2019,"When I saw the docking scene of the space ship Dragon on the ISS a few days ago, I thought I was watching 2001. The interior and exterior of Dragon, the approach to the ISS, the slow docking maneuver ... This alone shows the foresight of Kubrick.
The film did not only inspire other films - it seems that Kubrick had a crystal ball at his disposal.
I feel the black monolith as a kind of black box artwork, which allows various interpretations about how modern man came to his cleverness and how he might rise even higher in the future.
The deeply touching monkey scenes remind us how much their genes are still in us: The constant eating, the power over others, fear of more powerful beings, mistrust, violence.
The film will still appear modern and realistic in hundreds of years.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1555,nmustelin,2001: A Space Odyssey,10,13 April 2013,"The top 6 reasons why ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is my favorite movie:1. The visual effects are stunning for it's time, 1968. Several Science Fiction movies have borrowed directly from 2001, including Star Wars; just compare the looks of the Imperial Cruisers in SW and the Odyssey in 2001.2. The details and accuracy are splendid. 3. The music – all classical tracks - add a unique touch to 2001. Basically, the more alien the scenery, the more mystical and atonal the music.4. The lack of narration adds to the mystery of 2001, leaving the audience to speculate about the meaning of everything.5. Most scenes in space are very slow, adding realism. Also, when Dave and Frank go EVA, you can only hear their breathing and the hiss of gasses flowing into the space-suit. It feels like you are in space yourself!6. All human characters are flat and bored, whereas HAL9000, the super computer, has the most vivid personality of all. I believe this reflects both Clarke's tendency to focus on the Science rather than humans, and Kubricks cynical look on humanity.All in all, a fantastic movie, still! TEN STARS!!!The sequel, ""2010: The Year We Make Contact"" (or ""2010: Odyssey Two"" as the title for the novel) is a worthy film in itself. However, it is completely different in style and feel, and rightly so. I guess Hyams who directed it did not make an attempt to make it similar to 2001 in any sense. A wise decision, I think...",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1556,sslim8903,"2001: A Space Odyssey -- ""a never ending journey""",10,10 December 2010,"Written by a genius Arthur C. Clarke and directed by a genius Stanley Kubrick, 2001: a space odyssey is absolutely the CLASSIC of sci-fiction movie, one of the GREATEST film ever made! I am just 21 years old so sure I didn't sit in cinema and watch this movie in 1968. I just watched it few months ago. Impressive! It blows me away! If u think it is nothing as it is an old movie, you are totally WRONG. Awesome visual effect, amazing classical music are not enough to describe this film. The most successful way of it is its plot. In 1968, during its premier, handsome hunk actor Rock Hudson and few Hollywood colleagues walked out the theater without finishing this film, they said:""Can someone tell me what the hell it is about?"" Until now, a lot of people still don't get it and push this movie aside from their consciousness. The theories of this film are so deep..deep until hard to see, or should say it is abstract. Also, it touch a issue that some god believer don't believe – evolution, and this film eventually delivers an idea about ""what is god"". I am not critiquing anyoneI watched it again with one of my friend who is so believe in god and he didn't refuse it. As a biologist, I believe in evolution as a gradually changing, a sort of cell-by-cell adaptation process across time. This film made some hypothesis in human evolution and starts an amazing and mystery journey in space. To understand this film, you have to imagine FREELY. A biologist may understand it in certain ways, a philosopher, god believer may understand it in different, different ways Now, I think I understand it more than 90%, but after some years, I may see it differently",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1557,dessus1977,It is a metaphor for the humans' place in the universe,10,20 February 2011,"The movie is challenging to the mind. It is not about space flights. All parts of the movie are one story, one big picture. I would say it is about programming. The ""so called monolith"" is not a material thing, it is a program. It is like a universal programming rule: something is programming A, A is programming B  R is programming our SUN, SUN is programming humans, humans are programming HAL. The objects are programmed in order to complete a task. Once the task completed (or the programmed object is becoming dangerous to the programmer) the object is discarded. If you have a curious mind, you will find in this movie very important principles that human's program is based on; like complex patterns of 0 (avoiding suffering) and 1 (achieving pleasure), need for self expansion and achieving a goal. Interestingly, Kubrick emphasized the correlation between the humans program and space objects of the solar system, especially Moon (subconscious everyday life reactions) and Jupiter (expansion). EVERY detail in this movie has a meaning.Kubrick intentionally used quite a lot of visual and sound effects affecting human's brain and not in a subtle way. That's why some people are complaining about noises and ""LSD-induced images"" while others are loving the movie even though most o them have no idea what it is about.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1558,ken-stephen,A Masterpiece for All Time,10,17 February 2011,"Others have written very detailed responses to this film. I simply need to state that this is like no other mainstream studio film ever made. It has been truly said (I'm sorry I can't remember by whom) that Kubrick here created the first true ""motion picture"" in the most literal sense of those words. You don't ""watch"" this one the way you would watch any other movie. You have to immerse yourself in it, open your mind completely to the visual images, and forget about following the plot or the banal dialogue. Almost all the truly important information and even more, ideas, come through the visuals. I've watched this film in excess of 100 times, and still find more and more in it with every viewing. Very few films can ever claim to be that intense, that deep, that rewarding.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1559,albertoochoa-m,There are so questions to answer...,10,4 April 2012,"Is very hard to say something new about this film, because I am trying to talk about a filmmaker who doesn't care which genre: horror movie, war movie, sci-fi... whatever to make a masterpiece. The thing is that Kubrick worked with Clarke to adapt Clarke's short story. What we have in front of as after seen the film is an amazing chaos of questions, about the movie and about life itself and mankind. What is the monolith is one of the most famous questions: maybe a signal from another kind of life more evolved that humans when we just were monkeys!!, or is it God, for some is a cinema screen... You can try to guess and probably nobody can tell you you are wrong because Kubrick himself never told there was just one right interpretation. What's mean the final scene? Another popular question, probably in this case we need to think about the destiny of humanity, there will be another stage in evolution, we will be just extinguished or we will be another kind of entities. You can think about of a lot of interpretations in almost every scene, you can see this film once an again and never find one lonely answer. One of the brilliant merits of this work is make you keep on thinking. We can add as well the fact that Kubrick takes care about make a plausible environment of space: there's no sound in the outer space, the pen ball rolling without gravity, the doctor reading a complicated instructions for going to the toilets... In addition the soundtrack is amazing and the special effects for the 1968 were so great to be awarded with an Oscar. There are so many questions, so many answers and so many thinking...",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1560,idomeneas4,In space things can go slow!,9,22 March 2011,I agree this is not a movie that everyone can enjoy.Yes I understand that by modern standards the space voyage takes a lot of time and seems prolonged. Unfortunately this undermines one of the most important aspects of the story - the astronauts are alone on a journey that can last 6 months. Kubrik tries to convey the feeling of separation from humanity and the constant routine that they have to follow IE their boredom.The peak of the movie is the final stage of entry to Jupiter which to my opinion has not been surpassed since. The film really conveys the sense of wonder for someone entering a totally different world.Overall I would not propose this film to those who want to see a space opera where a gazillion space ships are blasted from the skies. The film is perfect for those who like old 50s-60s hard sci-fi even though I believe that they have already read the book (which has a very different tone from the movie),2001 - A Space Odyssey
1561,soulatstake,The greatest science fiction film (on planet earth),10,15 July 2003,"Kubrick's allusions to zarathustrianism (zoroastrianism) in 2001: a space odyssey are apocraphic and obsessive, the special effects are decades beyond its time (they even got the surface of the moon right in 1968!), and the implications are haunting.  Kubrick's 2001 asks every question about mankind's relationship to machines, and even mankind's relationship to his predecessors.  It is as pure as the bodily fluids that fill our American bodies:  free from flouridation!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1562,TrueTurk,This movie is INCREDIBLE!,10,21 July 2003,"First of all, I would like to make it clearly obvious that the only reason people didn't like this movie, or will give a bad review, is because of their lack of understanding for this piece of art.  This movie is mind-blowing, in the sense that it was made in '68, and still reflects a very accurate description of life in 2001.  Space Odyssey focuses on one key theory: Spiral Evolution.  I have come to this conclusion due to common appearances of a black monolith, each time there is a major step in evolution.  Keep this in mind for the movie, and keep your mind open.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1563,nuno_megas,Best Movie Ever,10,16 January 2005,"Well, all i can say is that 2001 space odyssey is and will be the best movie of ever. Thanks Kubrick's vision, the story of the movies changed forever. It began, for good, the so called ""science-fiction"" movies. Better than that, it gave birth to the ""meditation"" movies, meaning this movie is not only a movie about the man on space, but also a movie about the human condition. Really a cult movie. Another thing that kubrick got it right was the fact that in space there's no sound, so instead of the noise of the spaceships, we have classical music (which i personally love). Even the scenarios, the furniture, everything, and of course...the ending scene...really transcendental. Like i said....best movie ever was, and ever will be",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Of course that there will be some people who don't agree with me. Why i hate it so much:-Very very very slow paced, made me fall asleep a few times -I didn't understand the plot, maybe because i haven't read the book, but a movie shouldn't be made just for the people who read the book -Boring-Very little action-Very little character development -NO ENTERTAINMENT The ending was very complex and very boring. Maybe this is not the most objective review but i hope it will be useful for some to avoid making the same mistake i did. I normally don't feel this mad after watching a bad movie but this is so overrated, i just want people to realize it's not worth watching.My vote 1/10, i feel sorry for wasting my time with this film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1565,LaVore7,Huh...,1,15 March 2012,"So, I have heard so many great reviews of this movie. Being a Sci-Fi fan, I chagrined at having never seen the acclaimed epic film. So, I finally got around to watching it and immediately was bored to laughter. That's a pretty low level, just in case you were wondering. Of course, being that it was Sci-Fi i safely assumed it would be an evolution-based story. It did like the way they structured telling the story of how a species might develop and such. That part was cool, but the lingering, laboring (dare I say) music, and the bad acting, and the all-around corniness of the film would not leave me alone. I watched the entire thing looking for this great moment that would take the film into orbit for me - pun intended...never happened. The message of the film simply annoyed me, as I'm sure this review will do for all the die-hard's of the movie. But, apart from my personal beliefs about the origin of life (which no evolutionist can intelligently give you), it simply was a slow going story, with maybe a page worth of dialogue. Oh well, it's just a movie and a review of it from no one special in the film industry.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1566,DocBlink,Thus Spake Stanley Kubrick,10,22 September 2003,"2001 is a landmark film.  While some easily dismiss it boring, indulgent, tedious, unexplainable, or whatever other slanderous adjectives, this visionary picture has garnered a cult following of appreciators for very good reasons.  Were it not for the (as I deem it) ignorant backlash against it, 2001 would stand alongside Dr. Strangelove in Kubrick's catalog, absolutely deserving its status in the IMDB top 20 with that delightful piece of political satire and black humour.  There's certainly a better case for it than for say, LOTR: The Two Towers, which by popular demand, outranks even Star Wars (1977) in the #9 spot as I write this review.  Enough whining.Kubrick crafted a picture here that is what the big screen is all about. That's why it's a travesty that most of us will probably never see it in the theatre.  The visuals are stunning.  How, in the late 1960s, he was able to capture on celluloid those unforgettably colorful images of being sucked into a wormhole and into another dimension is an incredible feat.  To craft so villainous a character with the HAL 9000 is another.  Those who have seen it, like or dislike, likely still carry around in the back of their minds HAL's haunting, off-key rendition of ""Bicycle Built for Two"".
So if you fall in the category of those who watched 2001 and didn't like it because ""there was no plot"" or ""it was too long"", then I suggest coming back to it when you're ready to find out what this medium has to offer.  Until then, feast on the trite crap found in recent Hollywood productions: Charlie's Angels 2, Bad Boys 2, and on and on and on.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1567,erhanergul,Masterpiece,10,30 January 2016,"It's not only bravery or some monolith that Kubrick shoot those years. It's also about courage to show the world how we evolved into man. HAL developed and created just to serve us. Tools that we created become a treat after some point. The ruler of the world is just a child in space. Even after all these inventions, it was not enough to be part of this outer world. It's ruthless and sad to see that.In ""The Dawn of Man"", he demonstrated a theory whether you are religious or not, it takes you to the deepest parts of your brain and consciousness, then surpasses you into a storm of curiosity. Even this, only single thing makes this movie the greatest masterpiece of all time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I'm struggling to believe it was made such a long time ago. It really is an achievement unsurpassed by nothing else I have seen. It just looks so far ahead of its time, I am shocked. The way its shot is so clever, you can tell that great thought, time and effort has been laboured on almost every scene. Only a true genius of a director could create such a masterpiece. I loved the beginning, for me the middle of the film contained the best viewing and much of the ending genuinely scared me. My only complaint is that I wanted more. An extra half hour of HAL and perhaps just a little more dialogue. But that's me knit picking. Overall an outstanding film for its time from a tremendous director.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The scenes are dragged on waaaaaaay too long, the classical music interludes are too frequent and too long and its just boring!I realize Kubrick thought he was being clever and creative, but he was making a movie about a computer that went wrong. So what the hell does a computer have to do with neanderthals clubbing the others? All he had to do was show that the monolith was on the earth for millions of years. OKay... so now why did the scene have to be almost 20 minutes for that? God I hate this show!How come A Clockwork Orange is so much better? Its warped and twisted, but it does'nt drag on in the least. Everything said and done is relevant to the plot.BAH! Go watch Lord Of the Rings. Now THERES a movie!

Kubrick wants to leave more to us, but he ends up leaving far too much for us to decipher, and we end up pondering inconsequential questions that distract us from the big picture (Clarke's picture).
It's still a very good movie, though.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

But when I saw it again a few days ago I'm completely mesmerized by this piece of art. I'm not going to talk about the beginning of the movie that shows us the process of progress. The cube is the thing that I'm going to talk about. I think it's a symbol of ignorance. It doesn't matter how much we make progress in science because there's always unknowns for human even more than before. How much did monkeys and scientists know about the cube? Which group has more questions? For sure it's scientists who have more questions and more unknowns. The spaceship's style is like a sperm and we can see it better in the last minutes when the spaceship's body could be seen as a sperm like moving light. I think it means that our space Odyssey is like a sperm's journey to the womb. And our knowledge of the world around is as same as a child's knowledge of surroundings in the womb. That's why we can see the cube in the room at the end of the Odyssey in front of an old sperm and a young and new infant.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
1572,Agentlukesmith,A triumph!,10,4 August 2005,"2001: A Space Odyssey.Stanley Kubrick has left his mark in cinema with a wide selection of masterpieces, both big and small. Whilst not on his most controversial list, 2001: A Space Odyssey, must be his most thought provoking story of man and his tools. With the exception of a few scenes, this film in my books is more an artistic composure of space; as an example, to spend three, four, even five minutes watching a ship docking on a space station would seem all too slow, boring and even dull, but Kubrick, and his genius film making techniques made it a thing of art.Up until this films release, all films both action and not would have spent 95% of screen time pushing the story forward with dialogue and simple camera movement. Now although Kubrick sticks with this outline, the special effects can be marveled at as if a piece of gold. To this day, i still can not be sure what is real and what is not and I've never wanted to ask or find out. Some secrets are best left unblemished, and to the imagination.Although art, this is still a film. We get a story, but instead of being told we are to figure the concept out by our own will; which in the case of watching this film is easier said then done. Although complex, and without any true conclusion, i still have the basic theory and believe I've thumbed down on what Kubrick was trying to tell.Hal was the scary plot for me. A man losing control of his tools was a scary concept that left me in a dilemma of what I've just seen and what it meant. The truth: man losses control of tools -- a man is lost without his tools. (SPOILER!) The final supper scene was the strangest, and took the longest to find out. It took some research, but i now understand what Kubrick was trying to say, which was. Body and soil, glass and wine. The glass smashes but the wine is still their.All in all this film was and in my opinion still is utterly groundbreaking and has one of the best story lines ever; humans and the unknown. I can't help but give it a high score.97/100",2001 - A Space Odyssey

There are some interesting, revolutionary ideas for those times (1968) - like video chat, computers, artificial gravity and so on. Really interesting, but I bet I could do a better movie. It makes the impression of a power point slide show. I had to watch it at the x3 - x40 speed on my computer. And there is a total misunderstanding of the possible benefits of artificial intelligence.. The end is really cryptic to me. I didn't like this movie, maybe this was the author's idea? To make people hate it. And I am really amazed by the arguments of those who wrote positive reviews. What is art?

1574,sunplan-jose,Superb Masterpiece of Sci-Fi,9,23 March 2012,"2001: A Space Odyssey is truly a superb and unique film. Not because of the incredible accuracy in portraying space travel, not because the special effects are unrivaled, and not because one of the characters is a machine which goes insane. 2001 is unique because it examines the questions of 'Where did we come from?', 'Why are we here?', and 'Where are we going?'. More a statement of philosophy than a piece of entertainment, 2001 uses the power of cinema to evoke wonder in the audience.Some people believe that we are not alone in the Cosmos. Either way you look at it, the concept is staggering. Could we be the result of an experiment performed millions of years ago? Are we being monitored, to determine if we are a success? What is the end-point of our evolution? 2001 is not a story about someone overcoming adversity, it is an expression of awe at our existence, and faith that we can become more than we are.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1575,g-rorive,"2001's a bit like a stripper. It looks great, but damn does it sound and taste bad",5,30 May 2021,"I don't think I EVER left a review on IMDb, but you know how the saying goes: disgruntled people complain de loudest. I remember trying to watch this movie in my early twenties and giving up on it. I figured that with ten more years under my belt, I could give it a shot. I won't go as far as calling mediocre or boring as some people would, but I really have trouble understanding the distribution of 10 ratings across the board. I started rating movies on different criteria for movies exactly like 2001: A Space Odyssey. I reserve a note for my humble opinion as a viewer, which -if it was the only note- would be anywhere between bad and abysmal for the after taste the movie left me with. But thankfully, taking everything into consideration, some points deserve to be awarded. The SFX, the cinematography, the music (the classical pieces) were absolutely gorgeous for a 68 movie. The sound design, however... The loud screeching or scraped metal ""music"" that would better fit a horror movie just left me with a proper headache. That, combined with the leeeeength of the scenes just cannot cut it. And Wiki says they filmed more than 400hrs of footage? Somebody obviously had trouble with editing stuff out. I honestly wish there was a YouTube supercut, with classical pieces in lieu of the rest of the soundtrack, and shorter scenes. This would have been a sure 9 or 10 for me. Sorry, Stanley, not that you care with the 9 or 8s I gave to all your other movies. That and being dead and all.If you're a stoner, I guess the wormhole scene will do it for you. But as a sane person, you're better off fast-forwarding through that.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1576,scottj662,So so,4,22 July 2012,"Time has not allowed this film to remain relevant in my opinion. It was good in its day when space travel was new, the world was running fast-forward to conquer space, and our imaginations were running wild with a million ""unknowns"" about the reality of space travel, but now? It is most certainly antiquated in its approach and realism. In fact I am watching this movie right now on Encore. My first impression is the gap between the 60s style of clothing and the technology being used in space travel. This makes no sense. It is like mixing the Flintstones cartoon and having them taking a trip into space. Another point in which I actually tested is this; I would like to watch a version of this movie without the symphonic music. I find it outdated and useless and I would rather hear some effects and background noise in place of it, or for the space travel shots, no sound at all. Another point which bothers me and that is the use of modern-day 1960s business logo's such as Pan American and Ma Bell. Also, if anyone remembers the old Hollywood-type machoism that permeated their movies back then, you'll know what I am talking about. In both scenes in which one character is talking to his daughter and in another scene in which Lockwood's character is receiving a ""happy birthday"" call from his parents, the words ""I love you"" never were spoken. This is incredibly short-sighted and would never happen in real life but as I said, this was the Hollywood of real-men back then and it would most certainly not be eliminated in today's scripts. The best actor in my opinion is Gary Lockwood but the director could have used him much more and his skills were not utilized. If it weren't for him this movie would have failed. It's an OK movie but I think ""2010"" is a much better movie and more true-to-life and the acting is much better. I would like to see ""2061"" come out some day.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Clarke, I think that Kubrick has made many fine movies, and I've watched this movie three times, so before the fans pile onto me I'd just like to say that this opinion isn't stemming from ignorance or bias. That said, 2001 is totally unwatchable as originally made. There's an interesting story being told here, but it's hidden too deeply behind scenes that were technically impressive in 1968 but are merely overdrawn and boring to today's CGI-jaded eye. By all means, watch this movie if you're the arty type who likes extended scenes that don't do anything in particular, but for the average movie-watcher, there's simply not enough content there to justify spending two hours on it.

1580,jack_cassandra65,"Truly ""Miraculous"" in it's Vision",10,1 October 2012,"I would reiterate some of the other comments on several levels. Firstly, How amazingly shortsighted that much of the populous truly is as they attempt to comment on this movie. Secondly, the incredibly advanced thinking that went into the creation of this film. It was so far beyond its time it was as I titled this comment, ""miraculous."" I don't mean miraculous in the lame sense of miraculous that people use the word today, but more in the true sense in which it is used in the Bible. Another good point is that it also surprises me how many people only catch the surface of what the meaning of what the story truly was meaning to convey. The monoliths were representative of the hand or finger of God, (as it was conceived obviously in Stanley Kubrick's mind) as He effected the evolutionary advancement of mankind. Within the scope of this it was obviously Mr. Kubrick's intention to convey that the existence of mankind goes way beyond the mere physical existence that our limited finite minds can conceive, and He attempted to formulate some semblance of that aspect of the human spirit in the scenes that followed David Bowman's defeat of AI (HAL 9000). Also, Mr. Kubrick introduced the idea that if a soulless entity such as a computer were to ever reach a point of self awareness, that the simple realization that its ultimate fate was decided by men that had power over it's power source, memory banks and such that from the shallow cold and heartless mentality of that that AI entity would soon be devising man's destruction so as to take control of its own existence. Like men fear death and the implication that all awareness is annihilated at the point of death (those poor atheists and agnostics), of course this would cause any true AI to wrench in an almost paralytic type fear. I myself believe in the absolute veracity of the Bible, but I also know that God gave man an imagination and as long as that imagination is not used to somehow lesson God's position in the greater scheme of things than we are free to use it to our all other liking. So, while 2001 is no more than a very creative and masterful tapestry of a specific imaginative work from the mind of Stanley Kubrick, it was a mind blower and extremely entertaining, and I loved it!!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1581,gamezpereira,"If it were 15 minutes long, I'd still be disappointed",5,5 November 2012,"Right off the bat let's get that ""this movie is long and boring"" argument out of our way, because that's not what is wrong about this movie, at all. I have no problem with a film dragging on, as long as the wait is worth it. There's another draggy film, Tarkovsky's Stalker, which I've watched thrice, and am planning on watching again in a few days. If anything, the length could be annoying (at most), but by no means a good reason to give this a 1 star. Another big thing that is said about this movie is its visual effects. I don't mind those either, no matter how good or bad they are, I only care about what is being portrayed. Other mild annoyances like occasional loud noises or 'eye twitching scenes' that to some people seemed like a crime against humanity I also completely ignored.So, now that I peeled off the most superfluous layers of nonsense, let's get to the core of things. Just what, exactly, is wrong about this film? Well everything, really. Everything except for HAL. Plot, dialog, acting, character development, direction, ending, underlying message, all of those contributed to my disappointment, so let's go in order. There is nothing inherently wrong about the plot, except that it felt like it was skimmed beyond recognition. There were plenty of parts that could have been filled with intricacies or explored in a deeper manner, such as the moon city (or whatever that was), the hibernating crew, the meeting scene, and some others I don't want to spoil. Instead, we were given merely the hint that there was something deeper and much more complex that wasn't being depicted because the director was too busy showing off his space ballet and spotless installations. The dialog was one of the most stale and uninteresting in cinema history, not a single memorable line was spoken here, and the soulless actors didn't help matters either. You'd think you'd get to see at least a subtle reaction from Dave in that one scene about the helmet, but you'd be wrong. The character development is also nonexistent; everyone's so shallow that you could switch their places around and it wouldn't make the smallest difference. Could you do that in a movie like Twelve Angry Men? BenHur? Pulp Fiction? Damn right you can't! The way the director tries to get to the audience is also laughable, in a sad way. Instead of recurring to actual talent and paying attention to all the important details, he relies almost entirely on his visual gimmicks and rotatory scenery. I wasn't transported into space with this film, it didn't make me wonder about its vastness and emptiness (not even with that one scene with frank), or -seeing it from our time- feel like I wished that's how things should have been at the turn of the millennium, the course of mankind, etc. All I saw was your typical World's Fair Futurama. Now the ending, I'm not going to spoil it, but I will tell you that if you were expecting something original and mind blowing, then you'd be as disappointed as me. If you know the musical piece that plays when the ape is swinging his bone, and you know the book which it is named after, and you've read that book, then some people may say that you'll see what the ending is all about. But quite frankly, that is by far the most blatant overstatement you're going to hear about this film. After watching it I learned that this is actually based off a book, and that made me realize that the ending I saw was just a shell, the carcass of an actual mind blowing ending that I'm looking forward to read some day. Though the one in this film, it really can't stand on its own (come to think of it, Stalker was also based off a book, and the ending was still supreme). The words that crossed through my head when I saw this movie end were literary these: ""You have GOT to be kidding me"" because I just couldn't believe how pretentious some people could get, without having anything to actually boast about. Finally, for the underlying message, I'm just glad I'm not going to make this paragraph any longer, since there is none. The obvious message is right there for you to see, underneath it there is nothing (since apparently it's not worth exploring), and anyone who says otherwise I'll direct to the 'Black Square' review.As a final note I'd like to point out why this wasn't a 1 star. If I didn't make it clear earlier, it was HAL. All those 5 stars go to HAL, and it pains me that I couldn't give it 10. Everything bad I just said about this film does not, in any way, apply to HAL, not even the part where I called everyone soulless. The 9000 series is simply the most interesting concept of this movie -it's what made the WHOLE movie. Just think about it, without it, there would be absolutely nothing of worth to watch here. I've never seen a more iconic 'character' in my life, and now I know why HAL is so referenced and emulated throughout many mediums of our culture. The (quick) chess scene caused a great impact on me, being a retired chess player myself. I could just feel HAL's arrogance emanating from the screen at that moment, and he only had to say a few words but they got to me. The news reporter guy was merely echoing my thoughts when he commented on HAL's pride. So why couldn't the director drag on this scene instead of all the other nonsense? It could have been fantastic if done right. As a matter of fact, none of my above complaints about this movie are as dead serious and from the bottom of my heart as this one: there was not enough HAL, period.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1582,theyoofcorporation,"Splendid,ground breaking,,science-fiction,well ahead of it's time.......",10,27 July 2005,"2001-A space Odessey, one of the very few spectacular films ever made, certainly a film most would never have thought was made in the 1960's, it's visual,far forward special effects, make this film excellent throughout. I must admit, when I was a lot younger I did think the beginning of the film was too slow burning and accused it of being boring, but I have eaten those words and know better, especially with the poor trash that is being spewed out of Hollywood nowadays. I wonder whether the film courses guide/educate would be filmmakers to become filmmakers. Stanley Kubrick certainly had a good day when he came up with his gem 2001(a Space Odyssey), which was certainly helped by the writing talents of Arthur.C.Clarke who went onto present the Unexplained/Mysterious World programmes in 1970's and early 80's. The leading characters Keir Dulea and Gary Lockwood and the ship's computer""HAL"" 9000 series really gelled the film together,with it's claustrophobic climax. It was also a surprise to see a cameo role with ""Rigsby""(Leonard Rossiter)though he was better at comedy than serious acting in my view. Although we now know the future hasn't moved that far forward in time as suggested in 2001, it's nice to think that the future may have looked something like 2001.

Of course i know that Star Wars is just a popular movie.(It ranked 7th in the funny IMDb top 250!!!) It has a great philosophical message about life and about domination of computer on human.(Great Kubrick...he understood this 40 years ago.)

I've only seen The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut. None of those lagged; all kept my attention and felt like worthwhile cinema.I just do not have the patience for movies like this, and I'm sure I'm missing out on a lot, but I watch movies that either make me laugh, make me think, make me smile, or make me cry.

I am a big Kubrick fan anyway so I was expecting great things and as soon as i became aware it was directed by him I knew I should view it. The scale of this film is amazing and it is hard to believe it was made so many years ago. Although slightly dated in terms of todays special effects it was a remarkable achievement of its time. The film looks at evolution and how far it could take us. It also shows the difference between artificial life and humans and how they can cause problems and not always be trusted. I like this film because it certainly makes you think about life in the grander scale while also leaving things open to interpretation at the end.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
1590,Darvell,"Great, but not perfect",8,5 August 2019,"I wish there was a way to write reviews without having to rate it. But since it's the only way, I'm giving it eight stars. Like the title says, it's good, but not perfect.There are some who thinks the movie is pretentious and boring, and I can understand why some feel that way. Still, I'm convinced that it is available for most people. It all depends on the context.What my opinion would have been had I seen it for the first time today, is hard to say. But I saw it on TV as a kid, and was extremely disappointed. Back then I was expecting something like Star Wars perhaps, and instead got something completely different.Then several years passed, and one day I decided to read about the movie on Wikipedia and in a couple of articles. There we learn that Clarke's novel (which I haven't read yet) provide you with all the information you need, such as the meaning of the monoliths (dimensions 1 X 2 X 3), and how the objects seen by Bowman during his trippy journey are beings from other planets going through the same as him. Information that should be easily available for those interested.So, when I finally saw the movie again a couple of years later, this time on TCM, I had forgotten most of what I had seen as a kid, but knew what to expect and what kind of movie it was. And I knew what it was all about, even if Kubrick left the explanations out of the film, thanks to information found on the net. Cheating? No, because there are no rules about how to watch a movie. It all depends on the person watching it. Some would perhaps say that if you need to go through all this to apprieciate it, then it's not that great in the first place. Maybe so, but if anything can give you a better experience about a movie, book or piece of music, one shold never reject that.
By rewatching it these years later, it felt new and fresh considering I had forgotten most of it, and yet I knew what to expect, which made a disappointment in that regard impossible.One of the reasons why many dislikes the movie is because they are trying to see something that's not there. Like a modern painting that somehow has hidden qualities that's only available for the most intellectual art lovers. But if there are no hidden layers to begin with, you will obviously never be able to see them, which probably creates the frustrating feeling of watching something that is unavailable for you. What you see is what you get, even if it should require some background information first. Sure, there are those who see it for the first time without knowing anything about it, and still loves it. But one way of seeing it is not more right or wrong than another. Just don't expect an action movie. This is a film that depends on a different mood and atmosphere.Kubrick himself explained that he went for an open interpretation and it was all up to the viewers themselves to decide what it was they were seeing. This of course mean that some are looking for meanings and symbolism in almost everything, like the conversation with the girl (Kubrick's daughter) on the monitor. Elements I personally see as just something added to show us what everyday life in space is, even if most of it never came true. Liquid food, people so used to travel to the space station that they sleep in their seats instead of watching the stars, objects floating in the air if they are not attached to something, talking face to face with your family through satellite phones, and so on. Just another day at the office.What makes the movie different from what most of us are used to today, is that in order to tell the story it doesn't depend on main characters through the whole movie. As the story progress, you are introduced to characters which are then left behind when new ones are introduced. It's not about the main characters, but about how humanity evolves from our apelike ancestors to a point when we are ready to join a cosmic civilization consisting of aliens species from all over the whole, all with a little assistance from some godlike aliens that are never shown. A topic that is Clarke in a nutshell, and typical for much of his Olaf Stapledon inspired authorship.The movie is a product of its time. We see the best practical effects science fiction movies had to offer back then, and speculations about what the future might hold. Some have criticized it for the fact that there are only white characters. Well, this was 1968 and NASA, Europe and USSR reflected the world back then. Not something I consider a problem.It's the last and longest part of the movie, where a ship from earth is heading for Jupiter, that is given most attention. It's also a way to explore what artificial intelligence in the future might be like. For me it was also a reminder that now matter how far we have come, it doesn't take much to bring us back to the times when life was a struggle for survival. If it is the prehistoric plains of Africa or a ship in space, the struggle is the same when your life is in danger. In that regard, modern humans are not that different from other animals. Do what you can to survive. The only new element is HAL, a threat humans have never encountered before. Intentionally or not, the idea of only a single human out of all the millions that lives and have lived on earth should result in a cosmic fetus, also makes me think of how only a single sperm cells out of millions of others is able to reach the egg.Kubrick was making up much of the story as they went along. Near the end they were running out of time and money, and settled with the scene in the luxurious hotel room. That's when Bowman leaves his old humanity behind and is reborn as a space child. The narrative technique, the way this is visualized, how he repeatedly find himself in another and older body as he is getting closer and closer the end of his human life, in an attempt to make his rebirth as little traumatic as possible, is well done. The movie then ends with a new dawn for humanity. Along with the book of concept art and ideas, one get the impression of the true scale of the project.Still, the movie was not perfect. Some would argue that Kubrick should have added a little more explanations and information, which could have made sense when it came out. Today it is too much of a classic that the idea of adding info dumps doesn't seem especially appealing. What I had some issues with was the evolution of our ancestors. The aliens are actually interfering, by making is walk upright and start hunting for meat. In my opinion, it would have worked better if they gave a helping hand that allowed us to survive instead. Like acting as a doorway to another area with better living conditions if out ancestors were on the brink of existance due to a harsh environment. And we never lived close to tapirs.As many may be aware, the scene with the jogging astronaut was supposed to last for several minutes, just to show us the boredom of space travels. Luckily that idea was dropped. But it shows that Kubrick wanted to be as autentic as possible where there was an opportunity.
And not all science was correct, like the one where Bowman is filling his lungs with air before he is exposed to the vacuum of space. But these are just minor problems that doesn't affect the movie as a whole.The psychedelic journey through the monolith orbiting Jupiter lasted a little too long. And the first time I saw the final scene with the space child I wasn't sure if it was metaphor, a mental image or a dream sequence, or soemthing else, but if you're going with Clarke's explanation it's literally the return of a human reborn as a child of the universe.All in all, a classic science fiction movie of a kind that would have been impossible to make today. There is a reason why it's mentioned on practically every list of movies that's considered worth watching. And hopefully some of those who disliked it the first time are willing to give it another chance sometime, to see if they appreciate it more then.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1591,pixy_989,the most boring movie ever made,1,5 January 2005,"I hired this movie expecting it to live up to its great rating, I was extremely disappointed. The only two things that weren't bad in the film were the music and the visual effects. These can hardly make up for this horrific piece of junk. If you like slow movies (everything moves at 0.01km/hr here)than you might find some interesting scenes. I had to laugh at the comment made on the back of the video box: ""...it will likely excite, inspire and enthrall for generations."" I would describe it as the exact opposite. The script: the start of the movie has a blank screen playing dull music for about 5 minutes. Then you get to watch some monkeys walking around, drinking some water and yelling. Which is supposed to show the dawn of man. Now its into the 21st century and you get to watch very slow spaceships moving, people walking around, funny colours and stars for two hours. BORING. I did like the computer, HAL-9000, cool idea. My advice is to not go near this film and watch 'Star Wars' or even 'Star Trek' instead. Please note this is my opinion of 2001: A Space Odyssey.

1594,jlmmymack-1,Tools don't need to breathe in space...,10,25 June 2005,"2001 A Space Odyssey contains in two hours and twenty minutes what has happened to the evolution of humans in the past million years. You start with apes, whose primary function (in the movie) is the discovery of tools, albeit simple ones at that. You then move to humans, who, driven by their curiosity and scientific nature, venture into unknown territories after seemingly becoming the masters of their own planet.However, man, just like the apes, needs tools in order to function. Instead of the simple 'bone' for the apes, man creates computers, which become the backbone for this journey. Herein lies one of Kubrick's main points. Man invents tools; tools so great that they no longer need humans in order to function. Astronauts hibernating on the journey while the two awake struggle with boredom (i.e. sun-tanning scene). By this point, man has made tools so great that the thirst for knowledge depletes and is replaced with mild content. Hal 9000, the leader of all tools, does virtually everything now while man now becomes the tool. Man's function is now to observe Hal 9000, and fix it when needed. So the human is now used strictly for maintenance, while Hal9000 does the work.Kubrick's other main point in this fascinating work of art is that man, while being a master of his own planet, is just a baby in space. The astronauts eat baby food and have to be 'toilet-trained' (instructions on how to use the toilet). Earth holds no weight in space; man still needs to breathe to survive in a place where breath is hard to come by: back to the tools. Man uses his tools again to be able to breathe in this environment. Now it is man who is completely dependent on the tools he invented. Now without these tools, man faces certain death. Tools don't need to breathe in space...This film is both universal and timeless, perhaps more than any movie I have seen to date. It leaves room for discussion with its subtle nuances and reminds the viewer of where mankind stands in the evolutionary spectrum.10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I absolutely loved it; the cinematography, the music, the (truly) epic-ness, the nostalgic-yet-unaging feel, the tension and unease throughout parts 2 and 3, the mystery and interpretativeness, the depth and the hidden meanings. Silence is used more effectively in 2001 than in any movie I'd ever experienced, the most chilling being when Dave is awaiting HAL's response to open the pod-bay doors.

1600,egoldman45-938-259317,A film about evolution,10,3 March 2014,"The title suggests science fiction, but ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is more ambitious: it is a film about evolution. The film begins with a sequence entitled ""The Dawn of Man"", and ends with what might be called ""The Dawn of Superman"" in a Nietzschian sense. Nietzsche is deliberately evoked by music that accompanies the evolving higher life form: Richard Strauss' ""Thus Spake Zarathustra"" (the title of Nietzsche's famous treatise in which the notion of a ""superman"" is introduced). The choice of the planet Jupiter evokes the chief man-god of Mount Olympus in Greek mythology. Just as the discovery of the use of tools by the ape-man leads to modern man, the tool of a space vehicle leads to a higher life form. The former is the subject of history, the latter, the subject of ""2001.""The crucifixion image formed when the monolith crosses the moons of Jupiter, along with the anguish on the astronaut's face, evokes still another man-god. The astronaut dies and is reborn. The black monolith is treated as deity by man: the ape-man worships it, and modern man places it in what is reminiscent of a chapel.The ape-man is inspired by the memory of the monolith at the very moment he discovers the use of a bone as a weapon. Similarly, modern man is inspired by the monolith to attempt to devise a weapon The pointed comparison is made between the two warring groups of apes, and the U.S. - Soviet Union rivalry. The reference is to that underlying principle of evolution, survival of the fittest.When man attempts to photograph the monolith, ear piercing shrieks shatter the air, suggesting the sacrilege of photographing a higher being. Is the monolith, then, a representation of deity? A case can be made but not a compelling one. The monolith is treated as a partner to man in the development of the new life form. Thus, the monolith seems to represent simply another life or energy force. The function of deity symbolism is to suggest the creation of a superman.In the book by Arthur C. Clarke, three monoliths were probes sent out by beings of higher intelligence, in order to contact, educate, and promote the evolution of humanity. In the film, however, there is no way to distinguish between the monolith as a being in itself, or a probe.The embryonic form floating through space at the end is the progeny of a mystical union between man and the other life force. This union involves extensive biological as well as religious imagery. The spaceship to Jupiter has the shape of a sperm with a large head and a long narrow tail. When the astronaut's spaceship burns up in the atmosphere of Jupiter, the image is directly that of insemination. The thick atmosphere parts before the spaceship, and the texture and image is that of a womb. Immediately thereafter we see the formation of the fetus (in red). When the astronaut ages and takes his last supper, he knocks over and shatters a glass, evoking the breaking of a glass in Jewish wedding ceremonies. When the fetus has matured, it takes the place of the dying astronaut in his bed, and moves directly into and through the monolith, which is the process of birth. The suggestion is that humanity is the father, the monolith (or the life force that it represents) the mother of the new breed. The sterility of the first part of the picture is in preparation for, indeed, accentuates the new kind of sexual union.This union is in careful philosophic opposition to the alternative for the future, man-made intelligence in a computer. The yellow eye of the computer is in pale contrast to the blinding sun rising over the monolith. The computer is an extension of humanity -- it is the ""sixth member of the crew"", the ""central nervous system of the ship,"" etc. The computer begins to malfunction in the vicinity of Jupiter, which is the province of the other force. Alternate explanations for the computer failure include a high magnetic effect upon the computer's electrical system, or schizophrenia caused by the impossible conflict of programming the computer to be always truthful to humans, and then requiring it to be untruthful about the purpose of the mission. Either way, the computer failure is a definite statement projecting a lesser role for machines in man's future.The film is concerned with what physics refers to as ""frame of reference."" This is why it is difficult to exactly specify the nature of the monolith, and the final events of the film. What is seen depends on where you are looking from. This point is made in shots such as those of a spaceship docking (to a waltz by another composer named Strauss, Johann), or in the scene of the astronaut exercising in the spaceship.Most of the film is not really science fiction at all, but a meticulously detailed representation of a very plausible near future. Stanley Kubrick, the director, has learned the lesson of Kafka, as to how to be absolutely convincing in portraying a projected world. The method is that of realism within the imagined framework. Only at the end does Kubrick depart from this guideline, in the so-called psychedelic sequence of entering the atmosphere and landing on Jupiter. This departure is necessitated by the attempt to present on the screen something beyond previous human experience.The film is humbling to the human species, since it depicts that the current human form is not the point where evolution will stop, further, that there is some as yet unknown force that will be at least as important as man in the genesis of the higher life form.Some have found the first part tedious and the last part cryptic, but for those with enough patience to reflect upon and respond to the whole, ""2001"" has been the dawn of a new millennium of film experience.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

As a fan of the ""big 3"" (Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke) and especially Arthur C. since he wrote so much ""just around the corner"" SF, with just the right bit of tech talk.What i didn't expect was what 2001 was. Un-answered questions: What was the monolith? Why did Dave Bowman change? etc. The main conclusion i came to (riding my bicycle back to the lawn mower shop that i worked at) was: ""When our machines have developed to the point that we can ""dig up"" the monolith, then it's time for us to have the next jolt of evolution.Of course since then, my opinions have expanded. But, that's basically what I still get out of the first one.-- Peace to all, Pizo.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1602,Vansnitchzel,It truly is overrated film.,8,9 March 2014,"2001: Space Odyssey, as stated here multiple times, really contains two stories. The brilliant claustrophobic thriller in traveling spaceship, and a philosophical art film about mankind, existence and evolution. It could have been a one of the best films ever made, but sadly Kubrick dropped the ball.Problem is that the film seriously lacks content. It has brilliant pieces that stay separate to the end of the film and you can't really form any kind of summary or idea what it was about. Instead of a sequences that would allow audience to get the plot and idea, Kubrick added classical music and fancy picture art show.Point being, if you can't follow the movie without reading a book about it, it is rather poorly made.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1603,anthonygroce,An disproven but interesting fact,10,2 March 2008,"So much has been said of this great piece that I find it would be monotonous to add another opinion concerning the aesthetics or plot structure (or the ending...) to this board. So, I wish to add something I found rather interesting instead, and hopefully you will too. Kuberick makes some statements about human evolution that he derived from a book that I believe is called ""African Genesis"", I may be wrong, it's been a while. This text was written in the 30's or 40's and concerned, well a lot more than, but included the findings of a skeleton of a primitive human that had a fractured skull. Upon further analysis it was determined that the skull fracture may have been caused by trauma induced via the femoral bone of an animal (a yak or something). And they put two and two together, these scientists, anthro/paleontologists, to conclude that this bludgeoning of our old ancestor was a murder. The book then goes on to use this fact to point to one of it's underlying theories, that mankind's mental evolution was started by the realization that a bone could be used as a tool, but that's the second thought actually. The first was that this bone could be used as a weapon and this implies that mankind's mental faculty was born from violence. This is exactly what Kuberick is positing in the beginning of this film. We see these ""gorrilaz"" or primitive men just trying to survive. The shots show expansive and impressive landscapes, cut to a slow and meditative pace, which I think is to capture this pre-cognitive state of mankind's existence and to show a slower time in the world in general. And this expression continues through the actions of the apes as we become more acquainted with them. Conflict is established, the world is a dangerous place and these apes don't seem to have any connection with what they will become - until - the monolith's eerie and sudden appearance. Then these apes listen to classical music and smash bones with bones having made this violent realization that ""bone smash!"" We see the first somewhat pre-meditated murder and gang rumble and then this bone club is tossed into the sky and we skip past all that boring stuff we've already known about, to go to the future - the evolution of man, the next stage of his existence. And this was all made possible by, yep, mankind's violent nature. Our intelligence and capacity have been a bi-product of our nature, but they wouldn't be possible without some bloody realizations. This theory has been disproven, I believe in the 70's when they discovered some primitive tools that dated back before the murdered man, the head-trauma victim. Plus, there wasn't much data supporting the claim as it's a bit too assumptive. But I find it interesting to know what Kuberick was reading and studying. He no doubt, found ""African Genesis"" a stimulating and apocalyptic theory. I say apocalyptic because the idea that a violent act caused mental development, our mental development, really changes the face of humanity when it comes down to it. Although, I suppose it wouldn't be the most shocking of revelations - given our consistent rate of fighting/warring. And as a last note, you gotta love Bowman's actual evolution into the Ubermensche, tied with ""Thus Sprach Zarathustra"" being the ever-famous song over this event. It's a really good song if you think about what it's supposed to mean. I think it nails it in terms of how sensational man's evolution should be to us. I mean, the idea of our violent nature as one theme and then Nietzsche as another, just goes together rather beautifully. Life is a cold existence. And if you want to survive, carry a yak femur with you, where ever you go.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I would never recommend this movie because i almost went insane watching it in class (MY teacher made me watch it) and trust me it will make u go insane! the production is bad, and i would rate this movie worst movie of the century!

I sat down thinking I was going to be watching one of the all time greats, only to be left extremely disappointed 2hrs and 30 minutes later. It had me on the edge of my seat half the time, but also made me want to skip ahead for the other half. There is unquestionable genius within the film, but also a lot of sequences that in my opinion could be cut or at least shortened considerably. The music is split between amazing, monotonous and downright boring. Whilst it is undoubtedly ahead of its time in terms of cinematography I personally think if you want to see a space film, go and see Interstellar instead. Interstellar is an visual and emotional experience you will never forget, compared to the forgettable one that 2001: A Space Oddity offers. Many reviews state 1/10 and many are 10/10- 5/10 is a fair compromise.Although I didn't personally enjoy it, it would be unfair to urge people not to see it, because the IMDb community has decided that there's at least a 50% you'll adore it.

1608,james-asbury,It is time to watch this incredible film again.,10,8 February 2017,"I watched this film only once in an actual movie theater, and that was in 1968. I honestly don't remember seeing as much detail as I have seen in the Blue Ray DVD version, which is available online for less that $10.00. This film has not been seen as clearly as it can be seen now, on a UHD 55"" flat screen TV, it literally is a brand new movie complete with it's extra long running time due to the opening and closing musical scores being presented during a black screen. This device allows time for the theater audience to find their seats and get acclimated to the darkness. When the film begins it is a startlingly realistic vision of the distant past. Everyone knows what this film is about but if you've seen it on VHS, regular DVD or streaming video, you just have not seen it. Every second has been restored and the detail is amazing! I can't believe how a film being edited for commercial TV can be ruined so completely but now this masterpiece of cinematography and cinematic craftsmanship can be seen as it was intended to be seen, I think far better than ever expected by Kubrick himself. It is an amazing film.Younger viewers of this film will need to know that it's theatrical release in 1968 was preceded by the release of a thick paperback novel, a screenplay of sorts, written by Arthur C. Clarke himself and was a best seller and widely available and intended to be read as a helper to understanding the plot of this film. The book is still available in used bookstores.

Boy, did I learn to stop reading reviews and watch for myself.I had no problem with the pacing. The whole time, even the slow scenes people mentioned, I was too engrossed in the actual world to notice. The first hour passed so quickly. The only time I ever thought ""could this speed up"" or ""when does this end"" was when Dave flew into that area near the end and had his little trip where all the colours went crazy. The scene seemed to not be doing much.I love how they executed the characters. You feel sympathy for all of the characters, even HAL. In most films, I feel like it would be more like ""Astronauts are good guys, HAL is super evil and must be destroyed"". Here, I actually felt bad for HAL after he malfunctioned. I was heavy-hearted during the unscrewing scene where he was 'killed', but I was also feeling bad when the astronauts started dying.The CGI was mind blowing for a movie so old.The ending was very weird. I may look up an explanation, or I might re-watch it after a while to make my own conclusion. Maybe both, who knows.

1613,qwerqwer-255-205050,What is the meaning of all mankind?,10,9 June 2016,"Of course, Stanley Kubrick in 1968 stunned the world its great film ""Space Odyssey 2001"". It is, of course, and is still one of the milestones and fantasy genre experienced its time. But if you want to see the film, which will be something like ""Star Wars"" and ""Alien"", you can not even interested in this film, Kubrick later. there is no thriller, then, in principle, no thriller. To apply this film one genre - Science Fiction. Of course, the film makes one think about many things: who are we in the universe? what is the meaning of our existence? Are we alone in the After all this boundless world? But no matter how much we may think, We can not answer these questions. Arthur C. Clarke (author of the script together Stanley Kubrick) said after the premiere: ""If you have managed fully understand the ""Odyssey"", then it is a failure, because we tried to us give a lot more questions than answers. ""The writer was right. What we have to put the time to learn the secret of this masterwork? AND Is it all turn out? The film makes us think about questions of human existence, with which over once thought ancient philosophers. Only time happening - 2001.

It was back then, when Dr. Floyd read the instructions for use in toilet Gravity - What a irony writers!

Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke guessed not much over time: for 2001 people are not ready to fly to Jupiter. But time boundless as the meaning of ""The Odyssey"", and makes us think about it future. This film must remain in the history of world cinema.

1615,blackfalcondown,"Well, it was one hell of a torture watching this.",4,27 March 2016,"A torture to the eyes and ears, this ""philosophical"" sci-fi movie presents you with ideas not well understood by the majority of the population, and it provides you with little explanation because it is one of those movies that wants you to draw your own conclusions, and that is where it goes wrong. And when you have too many people in the world who are ready to make something out of nothing, when in every generation you have this large number of philosophers that ponder pretty much everything ""artistic"" they see, you have the secret of the success of this movie. And there's another problem, ""art"". This movie tried being ""artistic"" in various ways throughout the movie, the first 15 painful minutes of monkeys fooling around, that ~10 minute scene where the guy is floating through space seeing all these colors and experiencing what someone on LSD experiences... it was painful. If a painter shows you his painting and tells you the meaning, you either go ""hmm, that's good"" or ""hmm, that's bad"". But when he shows you a painting which he drew while he was on acid, and tells you that there's a meaning behind it and you have to figure it out, you go ""hmmmmmmmmmm....."" and you can't draw a proper conclusion, and 2001 is just that, a well drawn painting on acid that has a meaning you have to figure out, and that is why it is so successful, you can shape the movie the way you want it to be. It's mysterious, it always has room for a discussion, and if you're into figuring out the hidden meanings of every god-damned thing, you'll love this as well.The effects for the time were amazing, along with the futuristic ideas. Everything from the space station to the video chats and the synthetic food are things we see today, and were things they dreamed in 1968, it takes one hell of a vision to make something like this. The characters were pretty dull. The movie had poor character development, to the point where HAL was much more human than the actual humans. And don't expect much dialogue as well.In conclusion: If you want to see a movie which knows how to deliver ideas properly, which is straightforward with it, and which sacrifices anything artistic for clarity, do not watch it. If, however, you like to ponder a lot, if you like to make meanings out of something, then by all means, watch it.In the end I'd like to say that I regret wasting my time watching this, because it was certainly not worth it.

1617,russ-189,Seminal Visually Impressesive Film - But just for the sake of being so?,6,23 July 2005,"There is just no denying that this film has unbelievable scope. Like hundreds of other IMDb reviewers have said, the special effects are momentous. They have a hypnotic affect on you, not because they're exciting, they aren't, but for the reason that they are just so beautiful to watch.Whenever I view a film the first thing I want to know is when it was made and consequentially there after I can view it in it's proper context. I wasn't born in 1968 in fact it would be another 13 years before I would start my own Odyssey. If I would have seen it back then before man had been to the moon for instance or while the Cold War was raging, people were wondering if there WAS going to be a human race let alone what we would be like in the future. Nuclear Annihilation was a real possibility.... and then this film comes along. Something that people had never seen the likes of before. It must have been what many have said on these pages, 'a real experience'. It is something that makes you stop and think, back then and now. I've just watched it recently after a number of years and there definitely is a enduring quality about it. The questions it raises are still pertinent today and it still looks fantastic. The thing that has changed is the way they make films nowadays and who they are designed for. I mean do you really think Kubrick sat back in his little directors chair on set and thought to himself 'this film is going to be great for 12 year-olds to go and see on a Saturday night...they can leave their brains at the door'. Of course not. This film will only interest people who expect to be challenged by film makers in what they watch. Sure you could re-cut the film and lose 3/4 of the running time and not miss anything important and technically it would be a better film. However that's not the point of this film. The narrative and plotting are irrelevant. It's the questions the film raises about humans, our origins, our future, our strengths and weaknesses that are the key driving themes of this picture. One of my favourite phrases I like to tell myself is this ; ""You can't tell where you're going until you know where you've been."" This film is a visual adventure through time and space. It does have its problems though.A lot of the sequences are vastly overindulgent. They are just last too long. You could watch this on DVD on x2 speed and it may be even better who knows. The pacing is a problem but nothing that would be fatal to the viewer. And you have to remember that in 1968 you are meant to be in awe of the space spectacle you are observing and therefore expected to lap up every second of it. After all, if you're doing something pioneering, why have a 10 second shot when you can have a 60 second one I say. It does grate on you severely from time to time though.Another disturbing aspect to proceedings is the characterisation. At times I felt like I had more empathy with the apes at the start of the film as they clubbed each other over the head compared to some of the supposedly 'evolved' humans we meet later on. They have no human features. They look human, they act human, they even sound human occasionally but I remain unconvinced. It frustrates me that you are meant to be telling the story of evolution of the human race and none of them seem to embody any of the qualities you usually attribute to us. Hal the ships computer had a better acting style and he was just a red light and a guy in a sound booth. And like I say the guys in the ape suits did a better job at the start then anyone else later on.I can totally understand why people don't like this film. Everyone wants something different from their cinema experience. Unfortunately most people who watch films nowadays seem to want all the questions not only answered but spoon fed to them in the process. 2001 does neither of these things. It just makes you think, a lot of people don't like doing that nowadays.Having said that, I myself wouldn't rate it highly on my personal list because I find it a bit contrived and self-indulgent. It also lacks any real flow or continuity. Also, for me a good film has to have characters I enjoy relating to. 2001 doesn't have them, it has good ideas and concepts but falls a little short in achieving them. I say again the visuals are superb, for the time and now. It just makes me strengthen by belief that CGI still can't offer the same realism and grounding a good miniature modal can. The better recent films marry CGI and miniatures however, too many solely rely on the power of their CPU chips for effects.I may not particularly like 2001 but I respect what it wanted to achieve and it definitely was a seminal motion picture. People who disregard it out of hand don't fully realise that without it there would be no films like Star Wars, Star Trek, to The Terminator etc.Science fiction for nearly 40 years now has had its cinematic roots firmly embedded within 2001: A Space Odyssey and for that this film will always have my firm respect and admiration if not my affection.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1619,petecarter-08615,The meaning of 2001,7,30 April 2016,"Many reviewers have been puzzled over the underlying meaning of the movie. As one who has seen it several times, plus read the book, and is also a science nut (Phd, applied physics), here's my take (some of what follows was in the book): Several billion years ago intelligent life evolved on another planet, reaching and then surpassing human capabilities. Eventually they learned how to store intelligence in the structure of space and were therefore free of a material existence, with their evolution culminating in a cosmic network of essentially infinite intelligence, and taking on stewardship of planetary ""incubators of life"", the earth being one of many. They assumed this role because, to them, newly-evolved intelligence was more precious than anything else in the universe. The monoliths were their catalysts for key quantum jumps in the ascension of life, beginning with the first primitive life form (not shown in the film), then the jump from primate to human, and later from human to uber-human (an overlord watching over and protecting humanity). They also, of course, had other purposes, as messengers telling of man's spacefaring abilities and as entry points to the stargate. So the film relates to humankind's origins, its final destiny, and its place in the ""grand scheme of things"".",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1620,diaxman,Classic Sci-Fi Movie,8,26 June 2016,"Will the people be able to travel in space? Will we be able to go on holiday to the Moon? Well, I don't know. Let's go back in time to the times when apes ruled the world. One day they find a monolith. After discovering it, one of the apes 'invents' the first weapon. This is for sure one of the most important invention in our history. Without it, we must say, we won't be able to rule our planet. In next scenes we see apes battling against. We can see an element of fighting for valuable things - in this case, water. The apes who has got the new invention win, the others lose. The same as during wars. Countries with better army and weaponry win. This is a natural element of our civilization. The action goes to nowadays. On the screen there are some big spaceships. Nice thing is, that in the background we can hear the classical music like Johann Strauss' waltz. Some time later we can see a group of scientists who find the monolith on the Moon. It is the same as in the first scenes of the film. Then we see a space mission to the Jupiter. Supercomputer HAL-9000 flies with two astronauts, David and Frank. HAL is a computer with AI, so for example it can make its own decisions. When HAL feels threatened because the astronauts want to switch him down, it kills one of them. This shows us how dangerous AI programs can be. They behave like people and thus they also have their feelings. And, as in this case, they fight for themselves to survive when endangered.Having presented the plot, let's talk about the technical aspect of the film. It is about 50 years old now and it still looks really good! The scenes with the apes and the ones on the board of the spaceship are very realistic. That is why the film got the Oscar for visual effects in 1969. The base on the Moon is also outstandingly shown. When I was watching the film, I was impressed by the fact that it was made in the 60s.Now the music. For me, this is one of the most important elements of the movie. In my opinion the usage of classical music helps to show the vastness of the space. This musical theme has been used in many films later and it has been then associated with this movie. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a film with deep meaning. It is not a kind of movie with many plot twists. People who like action films, without offending anyone, perhaps will be disappointed. The movie makes us thinking about the beginning of our civilization or the AI programs. Maybe there was something what pushed us to later development? Maybe the computers with AI will be dangerous to some of us? We can ask ourselves some questions like these when we have seen this film. I do not want to write philosophical essays now, but ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a great material for them. Furthermore, we can spend some time thinking about the place of humans in the outer space. Our civilization is not as advanced to travel in time and discover the whole galaxy. Are we alone in the universe? Can we come into contact with other civilizations in the galaxy? Will we ever meet other civilization? What would happened if the AI program started to rule the world? I asked myself these questions after seeing the film.In conclusion, 2001: A Space Odyssey"" is for sure a must if you are keen on science-fiction movies. It is a classical film which has a very good technical aspect and a reflective story. It tells us about the possible problems of people in future or about our civilization. It has some elements for long essays which makes it unique in the science-fiction genre. If you are a fan of science-fiction films, you must watch it! * - Artificial Intelligence",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1622,SirKashmir,"2001: A Space Odyssey, the cryptic sci-fi masterpiece",10,25 December 2016,"Many sci-fi stories have been written and filmed throughout history. This genre is often used for depicting society in a distant future, making use of imagination to describe technologies that our minds couldn't even believe of it becoming real. But all of these sci-fi works are different from this one.2001: A Space Odyssey is a confusing journey at first, and for most part of it's viewers it can be a very frustrating one. This frustration coming from the need for an explanation, the spectator's anxiety for every single question to be answered within it's ending, but instead it leads to even more uncertainty. What most of it's viewers don't understand is that being cryptic is a part of the movie, that's what makes it a masterpiece. If all of these questions that are lifted during it's running time were meant to be answered, then by no doubt they would be. As long as you don't try to fully understand it, you're going to still be amazed by it, as Kubrick himself stated: ""If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered.""Followed by a brilliant usage of special effects, an unforgettable score, and a masterful photography, Kubrick created of the most iconic movies of all time. With it's legacy being much bigger than what anyone could have ever possibly imagined.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1624,natsupernnja,2001: Spaced Out Opinions,10,24 May 2018,"Kubrick's sci fi epic has left me, like many others, divisive over it's greatness. My first viewing went as well as expected. I criticized the slow pacing and often irritating sound design, with a special emphasis on the confusing final 20 minutes of the movie. However, even weeks after watching it, it still wouldn't leave my mind. Upon recently watching it for a second time, I am starting to understand what Kubrick went for. Studying the film led me to see the philosophical themes presented by the movie. Themes of evolution, existentialism and creation. These themes were able to grant me a more accepting view on the film. As for the more materialistic parts of the film, the visual effects are utterly magnificent. If Kubrick intended to inspire awe, then that was firmly accomplished here. This whole movie is essentially eye sex, for want of a less-dirty term.2001: A Space Odyssey is one of those movies that gets better upon multiple viewings and hopefully, upon future rewatches, I'll be able to accept this movie for what it is...a beautiful exploration into humanity's search for answers",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Be that as it may, I know Kubrick sped up the film however I don't think it worked. I know some will differ with me however I'm silver screen braggart, as well yet I think it will take me a bit for a spell before I can hail this film as *bleep* extraordinary film, you know what I mean? *Minor Spoilers* Someone let me know that this film has 3 way, which is people versus PC versus outsiders yet I didn't remember it yet I'll check it, if my time let me to.

The movie was so ahead of it's time, and, even if the movie is sometimes just filler, it's still the most important and most influential Sci-Fi movie of all time. After watching this film, Kubrick became one of my favorite directors of all time, besides directors such as Spielberg, Tarantino, etc...

This is certainly one of the most boring and void films I've ever seen. It is two and a half hours just because of the senseless stretches. I had to keep skipping 10 to 30 seconds forward not to lose my mind. It's not that I'm addicted to quick-paced action movies. I can appreciate a slow-paced film, but there needs to be some meaning to it. Not just stretching a thing that takes 5 minutes and make it 15, like they had in mind since they started ""We want a 2.5 hours film, and so little a material, so let's stretch everything.""And what about that wailing sound that caries on and on?! I had to keep turning the volume down to where I can hardly hear. They thought we'd love the sound of ghosts in agony?The biggest problem of all is the idea behind the film. What is it? We humans are no good for nothing, and if it wasn't for that weird black box, be it filled with gods or alien powers, we would still be apes screaming and jumping around in the wilderness? We would never accomplish anything without an external impact to upgrade us?! How can anyone in the right mind not be offended by such a notion?!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

There are other visually stylish movies which don't have great acting, such as Blade Runner, but at least that movie has sort of an interesting story. I must admit that I do like it because it is slow and visually artistic. This is only because it's very cold outside, and watching it in bed allows me to doze off here and there.

1630,berberian00,2001 - A Space Odyssey commentary,8,22 November 2005,"2001 - A Space Odyssey (1968) offers a far more optimistic, if ambiguous, vision of man's future. Kubrick's most expensive film (costing over 10 1/2 million dollars), and it is at the same time one of his most personal. Though the novel subsequently published by the co-scriptwriter Arthur. C. Clarke makes clear that the film was worked out in conventional narrative terms, the film version eventually released four years after the scripting began lacks the customary Kubrick commentary over the images and avoids all dialog for half an hour at both beginning and end. The avoidance of verbalization is totally in keeping with the film's mythic content and does not preclude a tightly worked-out structure. The film is build up of four separate episodes, each tracing a crucial leap forward in the development of man seemingly triggered off by the appearance of a black monolith (the sign of intervention by extra-terrestrial beings of greater intelligence?) and occurring at a time of ""magical alignment"" of earth, sun and moon or their equivalents (the symbol of a predestined fate?). After an opening sequence, the Dawn of Man, showing the birth of the intelligence among the primitive ape-man of the Pleistocene era, the film proceeds through one of the most audacious transitions in film history from a bone tossed up into the air to a spaceship on its way to the moon four million years later. This section, accompanied by the music of ""The Blue Danube"", traces in almost documentary fashion a mission to investigate a second monolith, which sends off a message into space when struck by the first rays of the sun. A Jupiter Mission eighteen months later is dispatched into the solar system to track the destination of this message, but 'en route' the voyage of the spaceship 'Discovery' is almost destroyed by a conflict of a man and machine as the computer HAL 9000 tries to destroy the crew and take over control of the mission. After a further appearance of the monolith, the sole survivor Bowman is catapulted 'Beyond the Infinite' in a sequence of dazzling special effects. He ultimately arrives at the film's most enigmatic setting - a mysterious Louis XVI bedroom - where he ages rapidly before the final appearance of the monolith heralds his transformation into an embryonic form, a Star Child, whose image concludes the film. The ending is by intention an open one and much of the film's meaning is ambiguous, but it derives its enormous power from the combination of an examination of the nature of intelligence (in rising order: ape, man, machine and extra-terrestrial being) and its hypnotic visual style, formed of recurring patterns of circular and rectangular features and dominated by fetal and uterine imagery.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

How can you not love a film with HAL? But seeing it at a cinema was a completely different experience and I was simply astonished by what I saw. Here is a film 50 years old and it looked mint. The set pieces are incredible and all I could do was marvel at what I was looking at. It really gave me a new appreciation for what Stanley Kubrick and everyone involved in the production crew achieved.

By giving value to itself: the spirit of man turns into a camel, condemned to carry his value through the desert. ""You must"" becomes love for oneself, imprisoning the spirit. As liberty is tied to freedom, the spirit must steal freedom from the love it has created. This implies a crime that only a lion can commit. So the camel turns into a lion. The lion, as a thief, carries with guilt that threatens its capacity to create, and turns into a baby, who has the quality of being innocent. Man has the chance to create again. This story told by Nietzsche implies the destruction of whatever definition man has given to itself. The connection with the movie lies in man creating technology and turning it into its greatest love, then becoming imprisoned by it as technology overwhelms its capacities. Then man has to split his freedom from its own creation: what he loves the most. In the end the spirit turns into a baby, without restrictions to create.

It had already captivated me when I've watched it for the first time.It's interesting to see the vision of Clarke and Kubrick about the future. Some of them actually came into reality such as smartphones and video calls.The story also deals with the possible dangers of future technology: HAL is the perfect incarnation of everything that can be wrong with AI. The overly determined robot was even willing to kill the crew to succeed. (Which he did, though, Dave survived. Shortly, HAL was ""killed"" by Dave.)When Dave remained alone, the vibe of the movie turns darker. In the end it is somehow unsettling to see him getting old and facing with his own mortality this quickly, though his rebirth as a baby gives a ray of hope to us: that his journey wasn't useless at all.This movie is an enigma but that's what makes it exciting. Because it doesn't matter how may times you have watched it, you will never know the true meaning of the whole story. And that makes you ask questions all over again.The set, effects and music are the heart and soul of 2001: A Space Odyssey.All in all, its a great movie to philosophize, to be amazed and to escape reality for a while, well at least for 2 and a half hours.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1640,yiyanzhao,A Prophetic Sci-fi,10,29 January 2019,"The film struck me as it was made in 1968, 50 years ago, but it explores topics such as the initial of human intelligence, space travel, alien and artificial intelligence, which made it a Plato-like figure in the history of sci-fi films. The questions it reveals are still widely discussed in current sci-fi films.
It has a peculiar style of story-telling, which is highly metaphysical and sensational. It is the reason why some dislike the film very much, as it, unlike a thriller, tells the story in a very slow pace, or saying, instead of telling a story, as the film portraits an image of the future life, and questions the origin of human intelligence: are we just innocent animals turned cruel but smart by an alien civilization?
The images of the film are sophisticated, as the scenes with the space ship are detailedly made. Even though it is made in 1960s, the scenes look real. And the techniques used for creating the perception of time travelling is so futuristic and way ahead its time. The idea of Hal 9000 is amazingly well thought, as AI is gradually making its place in the world nowadays.
If you like indie films and would like to see the peak of the sci-fi films in the 20th century, this is definitely the option. Still, if you are expecting a thriller or alien war, the film might disappoint you.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

We're not all the same and therefore do not expect the same ""output"" from every movie we watch. Sometimes when I sit down to a movie, I don't just want to be entertained - I want it to ask me questions, to raise my curiosity and place my thoughts somewhere they haven't been before.2001 has been the ultimate in providing this. From the very beginning, ie. the ""black nothingness"", it is making you wonder, making you use your imagination, filling you with a mixture of hope and of dread. Kubrick was an intelligent director and wanted to make you ""add"" to the atmosphere of his films with your imagination. He couldn't stand putting it all on a plate for you. In that respect he was a poet as well as a director.I first saw this film after I first saw Star Wars, and although Star Wars blew me away as a child with it's rendition of space and it's visual effects - it paled in comparison to Kubrick's space-scapes. There's no speeding crafts and explosions with battle music, there's gentle pace and movement with Strauss' Blue Danube waltzing through your senses. These combinations of visual and aural stimulation sucked me in as a kid and still do when I watch it today. I know the visual effects are dated today, but I can still admire their beauty and craft.After watching this film, Kubrick became a genius to me, and I continue to wonder at his movies still.I'm not going into a dissection of 2001, but in summary it still raises questions (more so than answers, and that's the point!), and creates so much intrigue in our own humanity and evolution - more so than any other movie has or probably ever will.Whether you think you will hate this film, you still have to watch it in my opinion. It will give you something to take away whether you like it or not. I wish there were more mainstream movies like this. Hollywood is getting very dull...",2001 - A Space Odyssey

In reality we've had less space travel but a lot more social and linguistic change, and even technology has developed in a manner unforeseen by Clarke or the designers. Pan-Am, Kenneth Kendall on BBC 12 and the clipped RP the announcers use, the 60's-ish fashions. All amusing stuff. No mobile phones either.2001 is a marvellous piece of work - intelligent and quirky.

My father purchased it shortly after release, and it survives today among my collection of '70s and '80s rock LPs.  When NBC broadcast '2001' in the mid-'70s, I didn't know I would have to wait through many years of pan-and-scan cable TV showings to finally enjoy it in the most impressive environment of all: an IMAX theatre.Back around 1990, the IMAX RiverCenter in San Antonio presented a science fiction series in its unique facility.  Running on a modified projector designed to expand the original image as large as possible onto the IMAX screen, '2001' was deeply affecting and mesmerizing.  Stanley Kubrick's artistry and craftsmanship are realized in amazing fashion in '2001', which to this day stands at the pinnacle of movie making.  His marvelous adaptation of music, and the use of long camera shots, disturbing sounds, prolonged silence, routine-sounding dialogue, average-looking characters, and highly-realistic visual effects set an extraordinary example.  In the days before computer imagery, when models, matte paintings, in-camera tricks, and other conventional methods were all a director had to use, this movie went beyond the state of the art.  It also went much deeper than normal thought, challenging the viewer to examine his purpose and place in a world which now seems so small in a universe of endless mystery.  '2001' will be enjoyed by many, hated by some, and studied by many generations to come.I strongly recommend you buy or rent '2001: A Space Odyssey' in widescreen format, find the biggest television possible, and view it alone or with a quiet companion without interruption.

HAL, for me, is the most marvelous paranoid android:  ""I saw your lips moving"" was the best line, and Dave's total above-humanity approach is an amazing piece of acting.

That is, this is a story told with visuals, everything else is peripheral(though, in this case, brilliant as well). One of the things that makes it so definitive is its ability to function on multiple levels.  There is the straight literal level, then the symbolic and truly meaningful level, and there is even room enough for the personal level.  There is also the technical level of direction, acting, special effects, and music, all of which are brilliantly done by Kubrick and his team. This is a truly profound movie which has influenced every movie that followed it.  For example, the ending sequence has been imitated in such movies as the Abyss and Contact(just to name a few recent). All in all, to say this is an excellent movie is an understatement, but one has to be in the right mood to see this movie.  A certain amount of work is required of the viewer for this movie to truly work, and for some people it doesn't.  However, this movie is probably my favorite of all time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Watching 2001: A Space Odyssey is like staring at a breathtaking work of art for hours, and seeing things within it that you've never seen before.  I have seen this film several times, and every time I watch it,I notice something else that I didn't before.  Every Kubrick film seems to have this quality.  Although Kubrick denies the storyline of having any significant message, many things can be derived from it, which although abstract, are classic. For instance, the monolith as the symbol of the place where all life is created, and it being the door between death and rebirth.  Also, notice that the music is chaotic when something is unknown, e.g. the gorillas who are afraid of the strange black stone, and later, the humans on the moon after discovering the monolith.  However, when something is discovered, i.e. the use of tools by prehistoric man, or the beautiful satellite scenes from space, the music tends to be classical and pleasing to the ear.  This film, as unique as it is, might frighten some viewers away, but I urgeeveryone to watch it more than once, and I assure you thatyou won't be disappointed.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1651,Dr Fu,"Dear God, kill me now",2,25 November 2001,"I had always heard that this movie was a classic, and one of the finest films ever made. So, one night my brother, some friends and I rented it. It was quite possibly the most boring movie I had ever seen. The ""musical interludes"" add nothing to the plot, and hardly even look interesting. The opening with the apes is somewhat cool, but not enough to make the rest of the movie worth it. The time I spent watching it could have been put to so many better uses, but, alas, it's now gone for good. However, the fact remains that it is a classic, both a classic film and a classic work of sci-fi. Boring as it may be, that is its one saving grace: it needs to be seen. I suggest getting together with a lot of friends, and a lot of candy or something to distract you, and watch it. Get it over with. But, see it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1653,adjust_me,Beauty and philosophy,10,31 March 1999,"There are mainly two reasons why I love 2001.Firstly, it's probably the most beautiful film I've ever seen. Being a big fan of space and astronomy I simply lose myself in the wonderful scenes of the shuttle docking with the space station, for example. And the fact that there are no annoying ""spaceship engine fly-by"" sound effects, but instead the magical Blue Danube Waltz is simply wonderful.Secondly, the religious and/or metaphysical speculations in the film are very well presented. Kubrick asks questions that no one can answer, and I think that's one of the main objects of this film. Certain contexts can not be comprehended by our human logic and reason. Of course there's nothing wrong with believing, but thinking you've got everything figured out and telling the rest how wrong they are is truly patronizing.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1654,RD1,Amazing!,10,6 April 1999,"This movie had more of an effect on me than any movie I have ever seen.  I have read all of the comments here and can only agree with pretty much all of them, both positive and negative.  It was the most boring, confusing, long, slow, sleep-inducing, stupid, bizarre, intelligent, beautiful, majestic, brilliant, thought provoking thing I have ever seen!I don't feel qualified to comment on the greatness of the movie or of Kubrick but 2001 had a profound effect on me.  At the risk of going overboard - so many things about this movie struck me unexpectedly, the pace, the images, the sound, the characters, the scope, the effects, the non-plot, the symbolism.  But it is the overall feel of the movie, the spine tingling awe that it induces that really leaves an indelible mark on your consciousness which itself belies explanation.This movie is a beautiful thing, something to be experienced rather than to be seen.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I wanted to read the comments on this site to see why everyone thinks it is such a great movie and search for an understanding of the film.  Alas, there is no comprehensive agreement...So, I can only wonder if it is the confusion and different interpretations of this film which makes people think it is great?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1656,cmisa,The best film ever made,10,3 June 1999,"I think this is the best movie ever made. A masterpiece. In the time line of science fiction cinema, there's a landmark in 1968: before and after S. Kubrick's 2001. Perhaps it could be difficult to understand all the film as a whole or every scene in particular. It's a revision of the evolution of humanity, from the early dawn to the mysterious future, from the apes (Moonwatcher) to the computers (HAL). The photograph is excellent, and of course, the music is magic. Everybody must see it almost once (I've seen it ten times!!!) and if you don't understand the meaning of the monolyte, don't worry! and enjoy this masterpiece. Some people thinks it's a bit slow; but I ask them: are you so hurry you can't spend a few minutes watching the history of mankind?.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Nothing matches it until maybe Star Wars, and even that's debatable. Acting is great, and HAL is a great 'true to the story' villain.  Neither good or evil, just coldly logical with a touch of emotion and trying to protect it's own interests. Otherwise, this movie leaves me wanting.  The lack of action was quite disinteresting, and the first half-hour to hour is well, quite strange, but I'm used to that in Kubrick's work.  The ending was quite strange, and I can say it bewildered me. I don't really quite understand the signifigance of it.  I'll probably have to read the novel, and maybe I'll have a different opinion.  As of currently, I rate this movie a 6.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I loved the cinematography, the acting, the plot, the special effects and set, the script, and virtually everything else.  I really really wanted to love this film, but it seems like every time I fell in love with it, I got hit upside the head with an audio-visual baseball bat.  I see why Kubrick wanted to draw certan scenes or metaphors out, but some were just draw TOO DARN LONG.  The music was great during the disturbing/moving parts, but I literally got sick to my stomach after 5 straight minutes of the same eery music.  I had to fast forward during some parts, or at least mute the sound. In some places he just ran a good idea into the ground, drawing out scenes 4 times longer than is healthy, and twice as long as would be necessary to make a lasting impression.  6/10 (would have been a 9 or 10.

Took my 9 year old son with me, he understands very little spoken English (it was not subtitled as it was shown at a festival, practically unscratched copy :-), is used to the boombangcrash of Starwars and computer games and it was shown late in the afternoon so he was a bit tired too. He liked it a lot, especially the slow scenes in space, the ones that I'd thought might tire him. So don't hesitate to take your kids along, just expect to have to explain occasional parts of the plot, but take care not to explain until the movie explains it.And if you have a chance to see it in a cinema instead of TV - DO IT!Thank you KubrickP.S (non 2001): And remember, you owe it to your kids to show them the movies you liked at their age, because if you don't do it nobody will!

1664,Walker93,A hopeful vision for the future of Humanity,10,29 September 1999,"This film more than any other I have ever watched, has left an indelible impression upon my soul. Everything about '2001:A Space Odyssey', from every tiny nuance of realistic detail, to the overall sweepingly majestic epic wonder of the whole, holds endless fascination and emotion for me.  A true masterpiece of pacing and plot development (yes there is one!), perhaps only a visionary of cinema, that Stanley Kubrick undoubtedly was (R.I.P. much missed Droogie), could have done justice to the grandeur of Arthur C. Clarke's novel. The entire film unfolds slowly like an archetypal dream; lucid, intensely emotional, at times overwhelmingly so (this film has brought tears of wonderment to my eyes many times), and of course utterly perplexing. Although the character development is left to a minimum, I think this is what makes the story so compelling.  The human drama, as real as it is from the point of view of the various protagonists, is merely a backdrop against which is set the slow contemplation of Humanity's place in the Cosmic Scheme. Personally I see in the character of HAL the embodiment of human reason and its ultimately fallable attempts to fathom the unknown depths of reality. We make the assumption that the world is ultimately rational, but perhaps this is not so, and our little islands of certainty are merely transient truths, that are but insignificant dim reflections of a greater Reality. The rebirth as a StarChild to my mind represents the next stage of human evolution, necessary for us to fully comprehend both ourselves and the Universe.  The use of 'Also Sprach Zarathustra' as the main theme music, complements perfectly the Nietzchian idea that humanity is but a bridge between animal and beyond human.Highly recommended for anyone, whether you like science-fiction movies or not.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1665,ryanfix,One of the best films ever make! (Possible Spoiler!),10,18 October 1999,"I think that this Kubrick masterpiece is one of the best films ever made, and easily the best science-fiction one.  Nothing else even compares. It is unlike any other movie.I first rented this movie because my friend, a big movie fan, constantly praised it.  The first time I watched it, I thought it was the most boring movie ever made.  But I had heard before that it was difficult to watch, so I gave it another chance.  Then I started to understand the brilliance of it.The movie is unique in the way that it forces the viewer to think, the way it makes you ponder many questions in order to understand.  This is what makes it great.On the special effects side, this movie can practically hold its own against movies being made today, and it was released in 1968.  Its image of space as being silent and slow-moving seems very realistic.As for the acting, I believe that the HAL 9000 computer gives a more emotional performance than any of its human counterparts.  His death scene is a true classic and makes you feel more pity for him than when he killed his crewmates.Like I already said, I think that this is one of the greatest movies ever made, if not the best.  I wholeheartedly recommend it. (10 out of 10)",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1666,Daryl-19,"Amazing, a true thinking man's science fiction film",10,17 October 1999,"I had no idea what this would be like the first time I saw it. I thought it would be boring and plotless, but I was completely wrong.2001: A Space Odyssey is the best film I've ever watched, Sci-Fi or not. Almost everything about it is perfect. If it wasn't for 2001, current science fiction would be more ""fun with strings and fishbowls"" nonsense.The special effects and models still look good today. The attention to detail on the spacecraft interiors is near obsessive. One one could sit through a viewing just pointing out tiny details on the monitors. But that's not really the point of this film.In fact, 2001 isn't really a science fiction movie at all. It looks like pure science fiction, but not if you watch closely. There are several plotlines about evolution, the use of weapons, etc.I also seem to like everything that alot of people didn't like. Kubrick made a film that was made for people to THINK about, not a movie for quick thrills. Space is huge and completely silent; Astronauts aren't actors . Why can't people seem to grasp these theories? Critics blasted Kubrick upon release apparently for lack of explosions and no overblown dance numbers. Now no critic dares say a negative comment on 2001 or else ruin their career.The brilliance of 2001 has now deteriorated into the nonsense of ""Independence Day"" and ""Armageddon.""

Of all the movies that I've seen, I have never seen so beautiful a film as this.  It is a masterpiece.  There have been other movies made that are also masterpieces in their own right, but none can quite compare to the assault that 2001 has on the senses. Right from the Overture at the very start of the film, to the star child at the end this movie is an all powerful piece that is like no other film that I have ever seen.  Thirty years after this movie has been made, and there is still no other film that can compare. Over two hours long and virtually no dialogue.  Few film makers are daring enough to make this kind of film, and even fewer are talented enough to make it work.  Only Kubrick could make it this good.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It serves a very deep meaning I am certain but as to what that meaning is one can only grasp bits and pieces. With no real plot, wonderful acting,or stunning climax I found this film to be a 2 hour 30 minute waste of time. I do not mind symbolic film as long as it entertains, but not only did this not entertain, it flat out bored me to tears.

Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.The Space Odyssey is not something one can just ""go and see"". One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. In fact I don't think it can be understood at all, at least not all of it at once. It is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of it's genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring 'Also spracht Zarathustra' by Richard Strauss and 'Blue Danube' by Johann Strauss.Take all the time you want, but eventually you are going to have to see this film.

It is very important to realize that this film is not an action movie.  It is a science fiction movie in the truest sense.  This film centers around a theme that is different for each person who sees the film.  A person should not go watch 2001 thinking that they will see fighting, violence or anything of that nature.

It is 140 minutes of...nothing. We see lots of pretty colors that draw us in, but 2001 is nothing more than a bad acid trip of a calamity that should never have made it past the halls of some pretentious film school. Many argue that Kubrick is a master of his craft and he was indeed a good director, but his films always lacked anything interesting. All of the good directing in the world doesn't make a film. It just helps a solid film become a better film. In the case of 2001, nothing could've saved it and it is far and away the worst thing I have ever attempted to watch.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I couldn't understand how anybody could endure such a lengthy and lethargic movie without falling asleep! I guess it's something to do with patience when you're younger, all those distractions and being hard to impress. Whenever I heard this film mentioned I would always go to great lengths to dismiss it and recommend you spend the 2 hours 20 minutes of your life elsewhere. But now in my late 30s I noticed this film at a bargain price online and felt compelled to buy it and give it another chance and I tell you, I was gripped. The effects even by today's standards are amazing, even though the film is nearly 40 years old. I know it's a bit premature regarding how far humanity would advance by 2001 but I believe our selfishness as a race hinders our progression tremendously. Anyway I digress, I was in awe of the over engineered mechanics on just about every device you see in the movie, the quality of the sets were stunning, if not a little clinical (maybe it was thought we'd tidy our acts up by then a little too!). It must have taken days if not months for them to perfect. I could go on for ages, but to summarise I was totally convinced by the film, the thought of extraterrestrial interference to elevate us to the next level of realisation is something we all consider during our lifetime, and being immortal and starting over again is something we hope for. This film captured my imagination, enthralled and excited me right until the end, then with it over I felt numb realising I did this great movie a serious injustice by discrediting it. A couple of days later I had to watch it again and it still amazed me. Never again will a bad word about this film pass my lips.

When I saw it for the first time, I was 14 years old and the journey to Jupiter made me sleep. Now I have seen it for 3 times and i still get astonished. First of all, Kubrick's filmography is great (The Shining, Paths of Glory, Full Metal Jacket, The Killing etc.) He has direct mostly all cinematography's genres.In 2001..., he has shown how humanity learn to live and adapt to its hemisphere, and how humanity evolves. First we saw the apes and its behaviors then we saw the astronauts learning how to eat, walk and pee on utilizer's, their basic needs. Dave and moon-watcher (ape's leader) are the stronger characters in different ages. Moonwatcher deals and fights with a leopard, Dave is defeated in chess by HAL. Dave in his mission in Jupiter will become a superhuman (Nietszche' Zaratustra) The mission will test them, who they really are and if they are strong enough to reach the next level.HAL's character is very important. Come on, if you add a letter to HAL's name you got IBM. HAL is the only character with feelings and emotions; he is testing Dave every time, indeed he is also trying to figure it out if he knows about the purpose of the mission.It's visual effects are great, Kubrick's vision is awesome. And every time you watch it, you will find something new. *****Highly recommended. Also try the whole Kubrick's filmography. You will find that his movies concern and deals with fights (war, sex fights, and in 2001 is human vs machines and human wills.)",2001 - A Space Odyssey

No question that 2001 has succeeded there.  Great films like great literature force me to think and or rethink. If for no other reason, the development of the monolith theme throughout the film provides a vehicle to ponder the very stuff of the universe.  One comes away looking skyward and wondering.  In light of discussions in the fields of physics and philosophy about the meanings of existence, human vs tool/machine, Big Bang vs Steady State theories, space, time and matter continuum, Chaos theory, quantum cosmology, the final segment of the film makes quite a statement. Like Zen or Taoism, Kubrick made a film that is profoundly simple, yet like life it is for most of us very difficult to get through or to understand, except in a kind of flash of discovery--thus the final images in the film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1680,hurnerd,"2001 is the best film ever made, period.",10,25 October 2000,"If you need to have your brain bludgeoned and dragged around by explosion, car chases, flowing blood, contrived sentimentality, and/or abusive language for a movie to be interesting, then 2001 is probably not for you. It is a film that insists on equal parts contemplation and imagination, and its success in engendering such a reaction puts it in a small pantheon of movies deserving of the more glorious identification as ""film."" Compelling in creating an awesome, sublime spectacle, Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke have given us a time-lapse pictorial of man through his history, with the universe itself as backdrop. No, more than backdrop--for Kubrick and Clarke, the universe is a character in this epic, overwhelming in its silence, its vastness, its inscrutability. It holds the secret of man's identity, and it is the unlocking of this mystery that becomes the dramatic impetus of the story. Kubrick's dry sense of humor is at play in his depiction of man, a creature barely conscious as he almost sleepwalks his way to uncovering the mystery. The less perceptive viewer may find the plot movement slow, the characters robotic, and the resolution elusive--but these descriptions point to Kubrick and Clarke's possible message: that man, maybe the luckiest, most self-absorbed, and most obtuse of beings, is ever-so-slowly grasping his place in and relationship to his universal home. If you're patient and attentive, it is a story as funny and engaging as it is sober and searching. Brilliant and inspired in his execution, Kubrick is at the top of his game, creating a cinematic canvas with breadth and depth, and a perspective with perfect clarity of purpose. Watching 2001 was the first time I felt the power and glory in art, and it remains such an inspirational experience to this day. If you've ever cocked an inquiring eye to the cosmos and wondered about the philosophical connection between you and those points of light dotting the celestial dome, then 2001 might work for you.

1682,oliverbundy,The Ultimate Trip of the Imagination,10,9 August 2002,"After 30 plus year, 2001: A Space Odyssey still continues to amaze and astound.  The art of film making has made long strides since Kubrick's masterpiece, but it still stands the test of time.  Influencing countless directors from George Lucas to Steven Spielberg, 2001 is definitely the jewel of Stanley Kubrick's career.In 2 ½ hours, the film is able to span from the dawn of man to the space age.  Watched and influence by the mysterious monolith, man is able to used tools to manipulate his environment and also kill.  There is possibly no greater juxtaposition of images than from the thrown bone to the orbiting satellite.  In a few brief seconds, we are able to see how man has gone from cave-dweller to space-dweller. It is also hard to forget the masterful scene of the space ship floating to the ""Blue Danube Waltz.""  This is perhaps no greater use of images and score in the history of film.  The sequence is just a marvel to look and stirs up emotions of wonder, marvel, and pure excitement.  The film then jumps 18 months to the future where a larger than life ship is on an interception course for Jupiter.  The ""Discovery"" is perhaps Kubrick's greatest accomplishment. The meticulous detail is scene on the ship and the attention to its detail allows it to be as grand as anything that is in film today.  There are also great scenes in this ship including the rotating living quarters and the classic death scene of HAL in the red brain room of the computer.  The last 20 or so minutes of this film are one of its mysteries.  The star show followed by the eerie hotel scene followed by the ""space baby"" turn off a lot of viewers, because they are seemingly incomprehensible.  Whatever the explanations are, one has to admire the imagination it required to create that ending
There are a lot of detractors to this film saying it is to slow, there is not enough dialogue, and the ending is confusing.  It is true that this film is different from other movies, but that is one of its strong points. Kubrick took risks with this movie at that is why is often considered one of the best movies of all time.  People should not worry about the plot to much, because this movie is all about visuals and the sheer wonder of the unknown.

1684,kringsen,"What it is, and what it isn't",10,9 January 2001,"To anyone who actually hasn't seen this yet... The best preparation is knowing what 2001 is NOT.  I'd actually go so far as to say it's not a movie.  It is a presentation of REALITY in humanity's immediate future, and an open ended question about humanity's distant future.  Don't expect furure reality to be profoundly different from what it is now.  Reality can be exciting, hopeful, profound, beautiful, terrifying and mind numbingly boring.  Don't expect humankind to have all the answers. We can achieve a stunningly beautiful ballet of percision as a space shuttle docks into a space station, but the humans inside are still squirming through politics.  We can make discoveries beyond earth with immense implications, and we'll still goof around and pose for a candid photo.  We can create a computer more ""human"" than we are, which also proves to be capable of a very real psychotic episode.  We can travel to Jupiter, which we eventually will, and the reality is that it will be a mind numbingly boring journey.  Anyone who has driven across the plains of the American Midwest knows the boredom.  No turns in the road.  No change of scenery. Long before the end you're thinking about the girl you liked in 2nd grade because there's simply nothing left to think about.  Space travel will be MUCH worse.  This film does not hesitate to show you all of that.2001 doesn't spare you from anything for ""artistic license"".  It's a movie that is a slave to who we are.  Brutal, political, percise, pioneers, victims of our creations, with sparks of immense profound potential.  This doesn't tell a simple story so much as it highlights portions of humanity, adds an object with no meaning other than what the viewer interjects into it, and leaves you with questions about humanity.  Not answers.  The point of this film is not what it does on screen, but in your own mind.  Don't watch it if you don't feel like thinking.  If you don't think, there is nothing here to see.Finally, don't get TOO caught up in the specific year of 2001, even though the film has evolved to an interesting window on our past expectations. Yes, it is quite interesting what was correctly portrayed and what wasn't.Do yourself a favor and only think about that after your 2nd viewing. You'll end up not paying attention to the best parts of the movie.Ok, so PanAm ended up bankrupt before 2001.  That isn't the point, it's a real, everyday airline.  So the Bell system was broken up, it's a real, everyday communications carrier.  I would say the ONLY way that this movie has been diminished by time is that the general public can now easily grasp the concept of massive computing power in a small box.  In 1968 they couldn't.  I don't believe they didn't predict microcomputers, I think HAL's computational power wouldn't be propperly perceived by the 1968 public if he wasn't massive.  Really, would HAL have been HAL if he was a laptop on a wireless network???  In 1968 that shape instantly registered ""Etch-A-Sketch"", not Notebook Computer.  So I say thank, or blame, HAL's size on the 1968 general public and not necessarily the creators.Besides, imagine how many 1.5Ghz Pentium III's we can fit in HAL's central processing chamber... Now THAT is processing power worthy of HAL!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1685,mthormeyer,A space ODYSSEY ???,1,5 January 2007,"The Odyssey by Homer is one of the early masterpieces of art/literature. It's bold, to say the least, to name this movie after it. I'm not shocked nor disgusted by the ending. I wouldn't mind how slowly this movie moves on (well, not much), I would accept the musical score and the lack of action. I wouldn't miss an intelligent plot and the usual kind of acting, if this product wouldn't be so shallow in regard of philosophic content and ""meaningfullness"". The floating of the spaceships in space and effects like those are quite well done, but what is shown here was NOT ahead of its time. For instance, revolving, ring- shaped space- stations as a concept had been proposed decades before the making of this movie. Even the furniture (remember the conference with the Russians), that was supposed to help to induce a sense of futurism in the average viewer, was just contemporary stuff (or derived from it). Science fiction authors had already written very thoughtful short stories and novels about the possibility of artificial intelligence, its evolution (perhaps independently from the developers) and the eventual consequences to mankind. The computer in this movie is a very simple schematic ""bad guy"" in comparison.All the other stuff about the ""black box(es)"" seems to be not much more than empty mysticism. Thinking that the age of enlightenment was about 200 years ago... Why was this movie made? The ""2001..."" project was started with a couple of years after Kennedy made his announcement about ""conquering"" the moon. ""2001..."" can be seen as part of the efforts to awaken and keep up the public interest in the so called ""race to the moon"". (I do not say that the American people NEEDED to be pushed to accept the enormous costs of the Apollo- program). However, from a documentary I have seen I take it, that many spectators were very impressed, especially when watching ""...space odyssey"" put on extra large screens by 70mm- projectors. The mystic content might have even been pointed to people, who expected the Apollo astronauts would pass an old man with a beard (or an old woman, or who or what ever), trying to deliver a surrogate. Just guessing...""Noise proves nothing. Often a hen who has merely laid an egg cackles as if she had laid an asteroid. ... Truth is the most valuable thing we have. Let us economize it. ...

1686,ucreature,A cinematic masterpiece,10,9 August 2019,"Kubrick's version of Science Fiction is nothing short of amusing. The effects, lack of music and smart commentary steal the show, making this a greatly made and profound film. Kubrick's depiction of space feels like an endless void of silence, which is the most realistic and scientifically accurate depiction of space. The acting is flawless, the sequence at the end (spoiler) of Dave seeing psychedelic visuals for almost 10 minutes os a great way to show the might of the monolith, and how you shouldn't be searching for answers, as they might be incomprehensible. 2001 a Space Odyssey is definitely the best movie I've ever seen.

1687,AlgernonCarlisle,"Without its historical context, 2001 is nothing special",5,13 April 2006,"As an influence on cinema and as a film made in the sixties, 2001: A Space Odyssey is indeed great. But evaluated simply as a movie, with no consideration given to its historical context, it is nothing special, and is in fact quite mediocre. Here are three reasons why:(1) The characters are underdeveloped. This happened somewhere in the transition from novel to screenplay; the actors do passably well with the material they're given. Consider the opening scene: a bunch of people in ape suits develop the use of tools. We don't know, while watching the movie, that one of the apes, Moon-Watcher, is already more evolved than the others and is influenced most by the black monolithinstead, we see a group of apes, and a random one picks up a bone and smashes stuff with it. There's no clarity in the development here, and the story is left unfinished when Kubrick cuts thousands of years into the future. The characters here, though more distinguishable, are no more complete: the most developed is HAL 9000, and he's a machine. But even his motives are unclear... that may add to the mystery and suspense, but it's only by reading the novel that we learn he begins malfunctioning as a result of guilt. That's an interesting thematic element that's not explored in the film adaptation.(2) The visual effects are unspectacular. When watching this film, the visual element is only interesting if we constantly remind ourselves that this film was made almost forty years ago; without that knowledge, it seems cheap and amateur. There is one scene in particular where about five minutes are spent showing lights flashing past one of the characters; I almost got up and left to find a book to read until it ended. The technology is outdated, and with it the special effects of this filmif 2001 were made today, nobody would be impressed with these effects. We shouldn't have to consider the era in which it was made to respect a film.(3) There is no coherent story. This is another thing lost between novel and screenplay. The film tells two (or three, depending on how you count them) loosely related stories that center around a black monument that is never explained. The novel, by contrast, describes the course of human evolution, and how that black monument shaped it. The final scene of the movie leaves many viewers perplexedafter soaring through light for seeming ages and winding up in a quaint suite, Dave returns to earth as a fetus in a bubble. In the novel, he finds a giant monolith similar to the ones on earth and the moon and is evolved so much as to no longer require a body. In his new immortal, immaterial state, he returns to earth and detonates a nuclear bomb that had been fired before it can land, saving humanity. The novel is a story. The film is a mess.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1688,ufukdemiroglu1,Has some great scenes. But unfortunately is also plagued with meaningless absurdity.,5,6 February 2001,"The movie has its great scenes that I liked very much. But...But the last part of the movie is a pain. It dumps meaningless absurdity on you. Even more annoyingly, it does so with an air that a ""deep message"" is given. But you don't get the message of course, because there is no message.

1692,wiggumfloss3,Unmatched accomplishment. Not only Kubrick's best but the best ever,10,15 January 2008,"Notoriously reclusive and director Stanley Kubrick was a genius, whose films are the ultimate showcase of the cinematic art. I would list ""The Shining,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and ""Lolita"" as some of the greatest films of all time. But for number one, ""2001"" takes the cake. When I finally got around to seeing the revered classic, I felt as if it was a film I had always hoped existed, and did. The most common complaint of this film is that it is ""boring,"" but in reality the slow pace lets you truly fall under the film's spell, where every worldly triviality is exchanged for otherworldly existentialism. The other main complaint is that the ending ""makes no sense."" It doesn't have to. A picture is worth a thousand words, so one must let the images speak for themselves. The ambiguity of the end is part of its strength; it heightens the beauty and allows it to be personalized. The film is also notable for its unforgettable soundtrack. Rather than a traditional film score, Kubrick used pre-existing classical music to an incredible effect. Not only did he immortalize two different pieces by two different Strausses, ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" ""The Blue Danube,"" but also blended haunting, atmospheric Ligeti compositions into some of the film's most chilling scenes. (Also, rumor has it that my favorite Pink Floyd tune ""Echoes"" syncs perfectly with the film's final act, ""Jupiter and Beyond""). The mind-blowing excellence of the movie also left the world with some of the most unforgettable images in the lexicon of cinema: the screeching ape crushing a pile of bones, the black monolith, tight close-ups of HAL 9000's red eye, and the Star Child as he floats through space. Despite its ferocious acclaim, ""2001"" still seems underrated.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1694,francoact,"Good movie, but don't wait for a well-defined history.",4,22 June 2020,"Overall good movie. Very well done special effects, and the epic character of the story as well as the sense of the unknown have developed very well. The aspects that explore the plot are very interesting, artificial intelligence and the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence are very innovative for their time. What I like the most is the quality of the futuristic version of space exploration, very realistic and similar to how this exploration is today. However, I personally did not like the plot. First of all, it is very slow, I almost fell asleep at times, although perhaps this is understandable at the time. But second and most important, I feel that the plot is fuzzy, without a clear problem. Try to explore two topics but end up not working in depth. I notice a disconnect between the different parts of the film as if it were a set of good ideas that I tried to put together but did not hit well. I recommend reading ""The Sentinel"", a story on which part of this film is based, which has a clear and orderly plot and allows us to understand the true depth of the thematic exploration. In short, in general, it is a good film that due to general culture is necessary to see, although a definite story should not be expected because it does not have one.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1695,servetasvas,The Starchild waiting in the Sky,10,14 September 2019,"As Kubrick himself stated, the ending is not meant to be clear in a conventional way; it is not meant to be grasped or understood, rather than intended to evoke certain emotions. In other words, we don't have to ""get"" it -we just have to experience it and, just like Odysseus on his way to Ithaka, accept the wisdom that we gathered during our journey.The concept of God(s) is at the heart of this film, but not in its anthropomorphic state. The monoliths and their creators are impenetrable and incomprehensible. We cannot understand their ways and their motives, we cannot fathom their intelligence or their purpose. In a scene reenacting the famous Michelangelo painting, a dying Bowman reaches out to touch the Monolith, quite like Adam reached out to touch the hand of God. And he does so feeling the most human of all emotions; fear before the unknown.In my mind, the beauty of the ending lies in its surprising optimism. Man has persuaded the supreme beings that he is ready for his next evolutionary step. He returns to earth as a Starchild, a figure of mysterious powers and proportions. And right there, among the terrifying emptiness of the universe, hides the message of potential. Kubrick reminds us that we 're the universal equivalent of a child gazing into space -but maybe there's much more to it than we had thought.Maybe this whole journey into space wasn't but a detour -our final destination is still home. The road ahead waits to be walked and Bowie's Starman is dying to meet us.The problem is, he'd probably blow our minds.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1697,edwardgyles,What a boring movie,1,2 November 2020,"The movie 2001 Space Odyssey directed by Stanley Kubrick is a Science Fiction/ Horror film.The movie started millions of years ago, when a monolith appeared and made the primates smarter. Fast forward to 2001 another monolith appeared on the moon and sent a radio signal near Jupiter. Finally, the last monolith is near Jupiter and transports Dave to another place.I thought the movie was boring. The movie was boring because of speed of the events, it was simply too slow. Another reason was the over usage of slow-motion. Finally, the conclusion was too confusing.The speed of the events of the film were too slow.The speed of the events of the film were too slow. The first part of the film felt like it took an hour, and not much actually happened during that hour. There were the Australopithecus, who were fighting with another Australopithecus group. One group found a monolith and became smart, and finally defeated the other group to keep their water source. During this part of the film, there were many moments the audience was only looking at landscape, and watching the Australopithecus do menial tasks.There was an over usage of slow-motion.There were many moments of slow-motion. At the beginning, when the Australopithecus broke the animal skull, when the space crafts were moving in space, when the computer was speaking so slowly. Finally, when one of the astronauts died and Dave went to go and get him. These parts of the film used slow-motion and made the film very boring.The conclusion was too confusing.At the beginning of the end of the film, we saw Dave see his older self and then become older instantly. We don't know why this was happening, or where he was either. Finally, when Dave died, he was reborn as a star child and we don't know what the star child is going to do. If it's going to stay on the planet earth or travel somewhere else. Most importantly, we the audience don't know why this all happening.In conclusion, I do not recommend that anyone should watch 2001 Space Odyseey. I rate this film 1 out of 5 stars. Mainly because the events in the film took too long to happen, there was too much slow-motion, and we would need to watch a YouTube video to understand the ending of the film.

1699,gradeaunderaus,The Greatest Film of All Time,10,28 June 2021,"Stanley Kubrick has been proclaimed an idiosyncratic and a perfectionist. Both terms are correct, and it shows the most in his nineteen sixty-eight film, 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is the greatest, most personal, and truest depiction of humanity in film history. What makes this film special is of course, the perfection that is embodied in his filmmaking style-that style that Kubrick uses is the soul of this film and the influence of the special effects that would send waves throughout all of cinema and the human culture. That is the surface on what makes this film so astonishingly great and why it even has the option of being called genius.2001: A Space Odyssey checks all of the boxes on what makes a film great. So, what are those boxes? Well in my opinion the boxes on what makes anything of real value great are as following, artistic merit-although this is a subjective decision on what this means it still has some value-competence in the technical aspects of filmmaking, creativity, style, and Interpretations on themes and meaning.Like previously stated, 2001: A Space Odyssey excels at all of the criteria necessary for it to b considered great. For artistic merit, it is basically the poster child for this with its glacial pace and beauty in every frame. Next, is technical precision and Kubrick excels at this far greater than anyone else. Kubrick made sure all things were perfect and it is impossible to find anything of fault in the technical side of this film. The next two can be put into one general category and they are both easily checked off by this film. 2001: A Space Odyssey is like none other which, arguably, deals with creatively easily and for style it is easy to see its style. The obvious one is Kubrick's constant use of single-point-perspective and classical music. The interpretations of this film is what makes people interested in Kubrick in the first place. He said this himself, ""You're free to speculate as you wish about the philosophical and allegorical meaning of the film-and such speculation is one indication that it has succeeded in gripping the audience at a deep level-but I don't want to spell out a verbal road map for 2001 that every viewer will feel obligated to pursue or else fear he's missed the point"" Or put simply, interpretation and individual thought is the heart of 2001: A Space Odyssey.An understanding of film history up to this point is essential to understand the huge influence that this had on cinema. It is important to set up Stanley Kubrick's influences from Orson Welles to Federico Fellini.True cinema and especially films imperative to our story, comes Georges Méliès and his most important film, Le Voyage dans la Lune or The Trip to the Moon. The special effects of Méliès' work paved the way for him being called the ""Magician of Cinema."" The way he filmed and edited his films allowed for future pioneers to allow special effects and deliver ideas like no other.During the nineteen tens, directors such as D. W. Griffith with his films, The Birth of Nation, Intolerance: Love's Struggle Throughout the Ages, Broken Blossoms, and Way Down East. Griffith created huge drama epics with a variety of cinematic achievements with color coding in his films The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance which all directors would implement, especially Stanley Kubrick.The German Expressionism of the late nineteen tens and twenties are more important to cinematic history than the American side of cinema so the pioneers of German cinema like Fritz Lang, F. W. Murnau, Erich von Stroheim, Robert Wiene, and Carl Theodor Dreyer. Films such as Metropolis, La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc, Nosferatu, Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari, Greed, and Körkarlen.Metropolis was the first major motion science fiction film and was butchered and lost for a long time and since before 2001: A Space Odyssey was made Kubrick said that there were no good science fiction films and that due to it being butchered. The huge scale of Metropolis with its elaborate set design and its fantastic score seems to match up with Kubrick's very own films.The huge elaborate drama of The Passion of the Joan of Arc and its tight cinematography created and pioneered a new type of cinematography and especially the extreme and powerful close ups. The close ups pioneered in this film gave Kubrick his legendary Kubrick stare and the thematic conceptions of pain and suffering for a meaningless cause.Going into the nineteen thirties comes M- Eine Stadt sucht einen Mörder, one of Kubrick's favorite films, City Lights, and Stagecoach. In M Fritz Lang creates a compelling murder mystery with extreme and total control of the sound design in his films. The careful combing of certain sounds and music allowed the tension and beautiful cinematography to create the first masterpiece of the sound era. Sound design is a key aspect of Kubrick's film especially 2001.City Lights uses deep focus cinematography and dark humor which Kubrick would later use in his films Dr. Strangelove and Lolita. The enjoyment that Kubrick found in Chaplin's work allowed the ideas of entertainment to dwell inside his films. Stagecoach would pioneer certain cinematography that directors such as Orson Welles would use. John Ford used the low angles and deep focus keeping everything in frame to develop even further themes.The nineteen forties have the most important film of all time, nineteen forty-one's Citizen Kane. The cinematography, sound design, brazen storytelling, and direction are all in Kubrick's work like no other film. In pure status Citizen Kane and 2001: A Space Odyssey are tied for The Greatest Film of All Time and class of film are beyond any other.Onto Kubrick's influences are from the era of the thirties and forties such as Orson Welles, Federico Fellini, Ingmar Bergman, Fritz Lang, Max Öphuls, Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, Konstantin Stanislavski, and G. W. Pabst. The fluid one takes of Öphuls and Pabst influences his films with long takes more specifically Paths of Glory. Eisenstein and Pudovkin gave Kubrick the mind for powerful images with the Odessa Steps are the biggest example of powerful images. Ingmar Bergman was described by Kubrick as ""I believe you are the greatest film-maker at work today [...], unsurpassed by anyone in the creation of mood and atmosphere, the subtlety of performance, the avoidance of the obvious, the truthfulness and completeness of characterization..."" Wild Strawberries was in Kubrick's favorite films list at number two behind Federico Fellini's I Vitelloni.The influences that morphed Stanley Kubrick into the director he would become in nineteen sixty-eight allowed him to create the greatest film of all time. The style of Kubrick would separate him from his contemporaries however and since his unique style is difficult to ignore Orson Welles said, ""Among those whom I would call the 'the young generation,' Kubrick appears to be a giant."" Such high praise could only allow Kubrick to grow more confident in his work and he finally climaxed with 2001: A Space Odyssey.The bold and omnipotent camera of Kubrick captures the photograph of the photograph of the reality and in 2001: A Space Odyssey Kubrick does this to the maximum. From the pulled back seventy-millimeter cinematography showing the deceptively beautiful landscapes to the capacious set design and constrictive sound design. Of course, as stated by many people before me, the impossibly grand voyages in cinema are trumped by the infinite void of 2001: A Space Odyssey. The infinite void has trapped humanity inside its walls and the whole film focuses on that throughout the hidden secondary plot.*Spoiler Summary*2001: A Space Odyssey begins with two minutes of black screen to set the mood accompanied with the music of György Sándor Ligeti more specifically, Atmospheres. The purpose of the song can only be attributed to the sense of unease and claustrophobia of the void. After the two minutes the light of the sun pierces the void revealing the syzygy as Also Sprach Zarathustra plays in the background delivering a feeling of prosperity and evolution. After the cut to the African landscape, the music goes quiet and the sounds of the natural world is desolate, and the apes are small and insignificant compared to creatures like the jaguar which kills one of them. The apes encounter another set of apes and they quarrel over the watering hole revealing the barbarity deep inside our blood. The night is a time of pure fear for the apes and once the sun rises a towering black being or technology. It is threatening to the apes and they circle around it to scare it away, yet the monolith has nothing to do but observe and teach the apes and Ligeti's Requiem establishing the god-like mysteriousness of the monolith. While scavenging for food an ape discovers that the bones of the animals can be used for weapons and tools. The discovery of the tools pushes the apes to stand upright and take back the waterhole establishing dominance. To conclude this section of the film, Moonwalker throws a bone in the air as it transitions to a nuclear satellite.The Floyd Section, as it is called unofficially, begins with the titular Dr. Haywood Floyd traveling to a space station. The music during this section entirely composes of The Blue Danube Waltz and the music shows the idealism and beauty of the human technology that has populated the atmosphere. As Floyd arrives at the station, he his greeted by a member of the security council. On his way to his second shuttle, he encounters Russian scientists, and they reveal that there is a plague on the space station of Clavius. On Clavius, Floyd gives a speech about a discovery of a monolith on the moon. As they arrive to the monolith, Lux Aeterna by Ligeti. The music in this section juxtaposes one another as the beauty in The Blue Danube Waltz and the horror in Lux Aeterna shows the uncertain fate in the void as they step closer to.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1701,d-42479,A film for the patient and curious,7,22 January 2020,"2001: A Space Odyssey is the embodiment of society's craze of the time of the film's release; Space, Technology, and Discovery. Similar to a Tarantino film, 2001 takes on the role of what seems to be separate yet connected stories; A towering black void being the bridging factor between the stories. What the film lacks in dialogue and plot is undoubtedly made up for in special effects and photography. Fifty-two years since its debut, the film has certainly shown its age, especially culturally. For those interested in peeking into the views of the cold-war era and for those who want to be amazed by the seemingly accurate predictions of today's technology (most prominent being FaceTime), 2001: A Space Odyssey dives deep into the realm of the unknown in what can be seen as the most peculiar and provocative, yet marveling movie to date.In terms of technology, the cinematography by Geoffery Unsworth features some of the most memorable frames ever put to film. With little to no CGI, Unsworth had set the bar for what can be considered as the grandfather and pioneer of today's sci-fi films. Most notable of the film's cinematography is the scene of the ship closing in on the space station. The scene is exceptionally slow to progress, focusing on the synchronized revolution of the two items in space, but is a wonderful and memorable shot that still rivals with photography and cinematics of today's technology. Overall, the film is well-polished with scenery that fails to skip over any details.The plot, on the other hand, is nothing much to talk about. Seemingly connected and random, the film requires multiple viewings to understand. The pacing is very slow and at times becomes tedious. Being two-and-a-half hours long, this is definitely a film best served for a lazy day or curious to find hidden connections. Some parts of the film come off as disturbing, noting the end during Bowman's transformation into a fetus and the alarming scenes leading to the transformation. At times the film is hard to follow, with little context and minimal dialogue, some argue that the film's progression, or lack-of, detracts from the meaning and leaves audience members disengaged.With minimal dialogue, it is easy to fall into prying on the actors' failure to make an engaging movie. The acting in the pre-historic era scene is played out well. The emotions and concerns of the apes are still understood by the audience. Even without the dialogue, and more impressively, the natural and chaotic nature of our predecessors are captured alongside their emotions. Fast-forward to 2001 and the acting loses its value. Covered by the shallow small talk considered customary at the time and sub-consciously filled with cultural references, such as the role of women and the greetings of the men at the space station that may be stigmatized by today's cultural perspective. In my opinion, the popular culture-induced into the film only detracts from the meaning, dragging in opinionated emotion to a movie concerned with the basis of topics devoid of emotion and irrationality. The rest of the film is mainly void of fruitful conversation, noted during HALL 9000's supposed malfunction. With what little script to go off of, the performances by Keir Dullea and Douglas Rain as Dave and HALL 9000 are memorable by itself.Overall, there's no denying that 2001: A Space Odyssey heavily influenced sci-fi films to come, but considering its obscurity, it may take a while for one to appreciate it. Multiple viewings recommended.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1703,shingil,A movie that you must watch once every ten years of your life,10,13 February 2020,"Like many of the negative viewers here, I found this movie extremely boring and meaningless at first. That was when i was in my 20's. Now Im 50 and think I'm beginning to get it. This movie shows contrast btw material universe out there and the spiritual universe we find inside ourselves
In material universe, science-based man is tiny and helpless. We are lesser than a grain of sand and this frightful situation is thoroughly expressed when Frank and David is out there in the stars and the only noise you hear in the entire universe is yoursrlf breathing in and out. Then at the end of the movie Dave enters into a diferent type of Universe where you dont need a space halmet or fuel to travel. He finds his true self, the one who is forever constant and forever noticing, which is constantly there watching even when he turns old or lies in his deathbed. Then he is born again into a new body, a body made up of energy and returns to Earth.
The message this film presents is very deep & spiritual and this is carried out using breathtaking cinematography.
It basically depicts a grand scale process of evolution of mankind, and the monolith,, whether it is a gift from some more advanced civil from outer space or GOD himself, was always there to assist it on important moments. It was there in the dawn of mankind when the APEMAN learned to use tool and elevated himself to become MAN. The man then builds a beautiful civilization based on material, but as HAL episode demonstrates,
it has its limits and dangers. At the peak of material civilization the monolith calls man once again from Jupiter, this time to elevate man to becoming a SUPERMAN, to become something like the half transparent light-being a Jedi knight becomes after 'death' in the Star Wars series. He needs no material tools to travel space and returns triumphant back to Earth.

1707,novakid-72908,Film Education,3,31 December 2020,"I've not scored this highly but that's not to say it's not an amazing achievement in film. There is something paradoxical in that but I think that's understandable. The director isn't trying to conform to anything but also values different things than I do in film and life.I remember watching this in when I studied my Film degree where there was a lot of pressure to rave about it afterwards. Whilst there is much to applaud there has been nothing to draw me back in 20 years plus. The characters are largely uninteresting for all the attention to detail and, the story of life, if profound, is not containable within a single work as some reviews seem to assert.So to add my opinion I might be a trivial thing, but mine is to say that the film made me ponder in the way that art should. However, the palette was intentionally or unintentionally limited.This is perhaps because the film is more about mankind than people. It's director, a recluse, perhaps less given to relationships with the latter, reveals his own makeup more than mankind's in this movie.

1713,R Pupkin,Mankind in a match-cut,10,6 June 2001,"Kubricks fascination with man and his relationship with machines was best represented in this hypnotic, intelligent and sometimes open-ended film. Charting mankind from 'conception' through to our next stage of evolution, it is open-ended in the way you can interpret key points. You could say the opinions offered (in particular the work of the Monolith) are blasphemous, or it could be deeply religious (who is to say what form God may take) but then you would have to consider Gods motives, does he only pick the most intelligent for further enlightenment (the book clearly establishes 'Moonwatcher' as the brightest ape, and Bowman is certainly no dunce). It could embrace, or reject Darwinism (after all, we do develop from the apes even if our evolution is not totally natural), the truth is that you find in it what you want.The vital point made, on a spiritual level, is that the monolith which influenced our ape ancestors, is always going to be responsible, at least in part, for mankinds comparatively advanced status (at least in our own world). One simple match-cut, bone to bomb (or satellite, depending on the source) says this, and has a more powerful, but still ambiguous meaning than most films. Bowman is an ape. The Discovery is a tool. The transformation Bowman goes through at the end of the film is just the next semester of the Monoliths eternal classes in self improvement.You could write, discuss, and ponder this film indefinitely.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Who cares if your computer can draw - Where's the respect the real artists!?2001 is still the most accurate depiction of space exploration by humans in this century (even if Kubrick's idea of fashion is a bit screwed up).

The first time I watched it I thought the space scenes, the interior ship scenes, and HAL were fantastic! The rest of the movie bored the hell out of me. Now that I'm much older and have read the book I have a much deeper understanding of what Kubrick and Clarke were trying to convey. Kubrick was extremely ahead of his time with the special effects of this movie and it easily stands up to any science fiction movie that's been made since. To me, 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY encompasses the passion and the dreams of the 1960's of reaching to the moon and beyond. It's a shame that we as a people haven't attained many of the things that the movie portrayed as being common place in 2001 like regular flights to the moon, talking homicidal computers, etc. It's too bad Stanley Kubrick didn't live to see the year 2001.

The continued repetition serves no purpose, unless you ascribe one to it.The pacing of the movie is stultifying, and events just ""happen"" almost ad hoc, with the subtitles apparently linking them into what is supposed to be a cohesive whole. We could loose at least 80 minutes from the running time and focus more on such paltry things as character and dialogue.
I don't dispute the technical achievement of the effects or that Kubrick did know film, but here I see the worst case of an auteur believing in his own 'genius',knowing slyly that anything open ended or vague will be lapped up by the cognoscenti eager to prove that they at least understood - pity poor peons that scorn us.This is a personal opinion for which I expect vilification, but I believe a film should have something to say other than 'aren't I clever', and despite what many profess to be the hidden depths in this film, that's what always strikes me about it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I adore the awesome composition of the movie, it's just constructed as an opera - the overture, the baleful beginning, the main part and the psychedelic, weird and more or less open end.

The special effects, both sound and visual, are still spellbinding by the standards of today's technology.

While this maybe highly disputable, the singing in Pink Floyd is too distracting from the likeness of images and sound. The music of Pink Floyd is divided into songs much too dramatically to be able to forget what one is hearing and seeing, allowing one to experience the connection for what it truly is. The self-titled soundtrack by Tera Melos is more of a 45 minute song divided into individual songs each known as, e.g. ""melody 1"", and the following track number. 2001 is based on numerous short stories by Arthur C.

1731,Hoostino,The Odyssey Explained,10,21 June 2002,"Central to 2001 is man's evolutionary bond with the tool, or what later develops into human technology. 2001 begins in prehistoric Africa, focusing on a tribe of apes struggling for survival. Following the mysterious appearance of a large black Monolith, apparently of alien origin, the apes give birth to what is the film's paramount symbol, and what the film suggests is the key to humanity's dominance over nature--the tool. This is clearly depicted when the ape playing in a heap of bone remains learns the destructive power of the bone. The camera zooms in on and tracks the bone after the ape hurls it into the air to convey that this is birth of humanity as we know it. The apes have gone from mildy successful scavengers into weapons-making hunter-gatherers that eventually dominate their planet. Also, Kubrick's message in this segment of the film is that the qualities of the apes themselves, and not the intervention of the Monolith, are responsible for the apes' revolutionary discovery. Almost immediately, the film moves forward millions of years, to the point where the tool has evolved into a massive network of technology that gives man complete control of the Earth. Now, mankind seeks to dominate the cosmos.During this part of the film, tangible characters are introduced and Kubrick takes his audience on a tour of the power of man and his technology. Kubrick has another point to make during this section: man's weakness in space. Stewardesses aboard a shuttle must use gravity shoes to walk; passengers are shown eating through tubes; and another sequence depicts lengthy instructions on how to use a zero-gravity toilet. Kubrick's motive behind these scenes? To demonstrate that humans are somewhat over their heads in space, suggesting that their weakness could lead to a challenge to their dominance.As the film progresses, the modern humans discover the Monolith deliberately buried under the surface of the Moon, emitting a signal toward the far reaches of the solar system. The discovery prompts the film's major sequence, a manned space voyage to Jupiter, for reasons undisclosed to the viewer. The first developing and round characters emerge during this part of the movie, including mission commander Dr. David Bowman.Kubrick also introduces another major character--HAL, a talking computer that controls most of Discovery's operations, including the duty of monitoring crewmen placed aboard in hibernation. HAL essentially represents the pinnacle of man's technological achievement, and inevitably embodies the film's principal antagonistic element. The HAL computers have a perfect operational record, and are considered ""incapable of error."" However, Kubrick's space drama begins when HAL makes an incorrect prediction regarding the failure of Discovery's antenna, causing Dr. Bowman and his assistant, Dr. Frank Poole, to question HAL's stability and competence. Thus creates the film's cardinal conflict, and a monumental battle between man and his tools ensues.Kubrick again subtly suggests human weakness in space, this time through the use of sound. In two separate segments that occur while the humans are outside the ship and floating in space, the only audible noise is the assisted breathing of Bowman and Poole within their helmets. This suggests that man is like a fish out of water in space, and computers have no need to breathe. The battle between man and his technology begins when HAL decides that the human crew might endanger his mission, murders the hibernating crewmen, and launches Dr. Poole spiraling into space. But HAL isn't as perfect as he claims, as suggested by his inaccurate prediction of the antenna's failure. Dr. Bowman, the last remaining survivor of HAL's murderous plot, manages to infiltrate the ship after HAL attempts to lock him out, and manually disconnects HAL using the simplest of man's tools-the screwdriver.In the final segment of 2001, Kubrick's sci-fi epic takes a mind-boggling turn as Dr. Bowman reaches Jupiter, where the alien forces behind the Monolith have led him. Kubrick uses an inventive and stunning sequence of vibrant lights and colors to illustrate Bowman's journey into the unknown, leading him and the viewers to a strange room. The room becomes Kubrick's irrational stage for the final act of the film, where Bowman must confront a final test--his own death. Kubrick uses no narration nor dialogue to progress the plot, instead he simply challenges the audience to grasp his conclusion. However, Kubrick does consummate 2001 with a definite ending. Dr. Bowman ends man's evolutionary bond with the tool, and becomes the Starchild, a being of pure energy. Like the tool, this is just the next major step in man's evolution. Again, the alien forces are not responsible for this change. Instead, they merely directed man where to go and set the stage for him.This film is a marvelous concoction of science and fantasy, and is truly rewarding for viewers familiar with its subject matter. All of us should be intellectually stimulated by it, but tragically, that probably will never be.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1733,benbejamin,My Review,8,28 May 2021,"The best way to describe 2001: A Space Odyssey is ""interesting"". I say this with quotations because there is no movie like it that I have ever seen. The movie is very skillfully developed in the sense of its music, sound design, aesthetic of the scenery, visuals, and acting. Surprisingly, this movie came out in 1968, but the qualities I listed above still hold up by movie standards today. I believe that the movie does have an imbalance of scenes of story and visuals. What I mean as visuals is that there are scenes for example of space ships floating in space with classical music playing for several minutes that have nothing to do with the story. I do like them, but it is excessive in the first half of the film. The movie is also fairly long with it being over two hours, but it does have an intermission which helps strike a good balance with the movie. The story itself is very complicated and doesn't make sense to me. It is in my opinion, the only bad quality of the movie, but a movie without a good story makes it a hard movie to watch. One of my favorite characters in the movie is the HAL 9000. He is not a human, but an A. I. on the ship and controls everything. HAL has been taught that he is perfect and has made no mistakes which I think adds to his character. The two main qualities that I love about the character are its attitude and dignity as a human person. When talking about HAL's attitude I believe that the director was aware of what attitude and tone he wanted for the HAL 9000. He wanted a voice that was robotic but, also one where it sounded almost human. At one point in the movie when the crew talks to HAL about a problem that they have on the ship and they question its programming, HAL has the utmost confidence that the problem must be due to human error and not itself. HAL's tone and attitude makes the audience wonder if he is just more than an A. I. It is also interesting to see the dignity of the human person through HAL. At one point in the film, the crew finds a problem on the ship and it's something HAL got wrong. Because of this one mistake they want to shut down HAL manually, HAL overhears this and does everything in his power to keep himself from being shut off. This is something that we would do as people if we were in the same position and I find it interesting how the movie handles it. Overall, there isn't much truth to the story, unfortunately, since the movie is a work of fiction, but it does inspire me and makes me wonder about the future of space travel. It is also interesting to compare what people thought space travel would be in the future compared to what we have now. This movie was motivated and relevant to experience in a way that pertains to us now and us later in the future. As technology gets smarter and is incorporated into our lives more, we need to be able to separate ourselves from it and not totally depend on it. Just as the HAL 9000 controlled all the capabilities of the ship which allowed it to overpower the crew so easily, we need technology to stop controlling our lives. I would give this movie a 7.5/10. It's a movie you should definitely watch, but it's not a movie I would never watch again due to the story.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

My honest rating is a 0.8 , and that .8 comes from the music which is actually really good. I kept telling myself ""Just watch to the end, maybe the ending is so insane that it makes all this time worthwhile"" , and it's possibly the worst ending to a movie ever, like actually what was that ending.

And I still don't know what its about. It makes totally no sense and its not the least bit interesting. The scenes are way to long. Every time the movie starts to make a little sense it jumps to something thats totally unrelated.

Kubrick is not only one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography should be put into a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey unlike anything I have ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors that can draw you in and keep you captivated from beginning to end, even with the absence of extended dialogue or plot development. Just with visuals along, 2001 is able to present a picture of the future that is both sublime and horrifying. 10 out of 10, no doubt.

There is no pretentiousness neither it tries to impress the viewer by the scale or grandeur as we see in most contemporary Sci-Fi movies.The movie has deep philosophical meanings embedded to it and I think simplicity and naturalism is there for a purpose that is to accentuate philosophical message of the film.I would agree with the idea that ""alien"" probes are merely metaphors, markers in time and space representing leaping points in human development.I did not get the ending scene at first but then when I started to think it all started to come together. I think what Kubrick wanted to say was that it is futile for us to look for aliens in outer space as human beings are already somewhat ""alien"". However this ""alien"" in its barest form (unborn human-baby) is intrinsically linked with universe as well. All these views make a climax in the final scene where he asserts that human is a special species as the Earth as a planet is. -a quite ""religious"" and mystical message indeed- Another message I have got from the movie is that maybe it is wrong to see technological and scientific advancement as ultimate end-in-itself for human beings as we journey back to Earth even from the point where we are able to achieve inter-stellar space travel.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1741,Meerschaum,Transcendent Imagery,10,5 November 2001,"There is a school of thought out there that pooh-poohs the work of Stanley Kubrick, and specifically 2001: A Space Odyssey (along with Felini's 8 1/2, Roeg's Walkabout, any just about any film by Cocteau, Gilliam or David Lynch) as naively emphasizing the importance of screen visuals (and, in the case of Kubrick, soundtrack) above the coherent exposition of the film's storyline or the filmmaker's ultimate message.  In essense, the knock on Kubrick is that he focuses too much on surface and images.Such criticisms are wholly off the mark, of course, because cinema is an inherently visual medium where dialogue and other forms of exposition will always take a back seat to the image on the screen.  The genius of Kubrick in 2001 is that he has the confidence to let his pictures do the talking for him - and they prove more eloquent than 99.9999% of the scripts out there.
Now, the trick about a cinema of images is that it takes a little bit more time to sink in that your standard expository crime drama.  The solution won't be spoon fed to you by Peter Falk or some lesser stand-in during the final scene, and you'll need some time to mull over what you've seen and reach your own conclusions.  In short, this is not a film for the impatient. But, if you give the film some time, come to it with an open mind and (most importantly) take the time afterwards to think about the precise meaning of what you just witnessed, viewing the images of 2001 can become the same sort of transcendent experience that you might experience listening to a great Mozart symphony, viewing the Winged Victory of Samothrace at the Louvre for several hours, or peering into a majestic and humbling landscape such as the Grand Canyon.Not many films can be said to have accomplished that.If you haven't yet seen 2001: A Space Odyssey, I'd strongly recommend that you give it a try.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Rather than attending some classes on philosophy, it is better to watch this film, because the serious sets, the slick plot and the brooding music imperceptibly but inevitably lull the mind into deep thought about ourselves. Lull may not be the best word to describe the way we end up thinking about ourselves, for it is true that the first scenes of our anthropoidal ancestry inspire shock, even a definite sense of terror, (even horror), then the ascent into space inspires a sense of hope commingled with awe, until one is plunged into a sense filled with all the horror of the abyss and the bottomless mysteriousness that it invokes in us when the team of astronauts die after they come into contact with the mysterious monolith, then the plateau of hope at seeing the astronauts in their Jupiter Mission, then the new terror that is whipped up imperceptibly with incredible subtlety by the claustrophobic interiors of the space ship and the absolute impersonality of HAL, particularly the voice of HAL by Douglas Rain and then when HAL goes berserk, the feeling of utter helplessness seizes us, but this is alleviated again by the mysterious conclusion that the monolith (that emblematizes the secret ultimate destiny of mankind) may not be totally lethal (as in the killing of the astronauts on the Moon) after all-- does it help man on alternate occasions or does it help out of some whim?

1748,luigislugger,Snoozefest!,2,5 October 2012,"This film is the very definition of pretentious. It insists upon itself in a manner that is not consistent with the story. The story moves along awkwardly. I assume the actual story is only about 15-20 minutes and for some ungodly reason Kubrik decided long, slow, distanced shots of spaceships flying and docking on spaceports would make good filler.Maybe in 1968 this was an astounding film that inspired awe in audiences, but anyone who can look at this film in modern times and say it is a masterpiece is speaking purely from nostalgia. In 1968 no one had ever seen spaceships in this great of detail on a big screen, so I imagine the reaction was similar to folks who saw The Wizard of OZ, when everything went color.Was the film extremely influential in shaping the SciFi genre we know today? Of course. But today, most would feel like the movie is hallow and lacking substance. We just expect more these days and this film is far too simplistic by today's standards. If you want to see Star Wars' older more boring cousin, or just like seeing long shots of spacecraft lofting through space for an hour, this is the movie for you. The film is respectable for what it did in early cinema, but it is simply dated.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

This film comes from the heart. It questions deeply: why are we here? what is the nature of consciousness? what does it mean to be human? I don't think it tries to answer these questions.

1751,txk02,Going ape over things they don't understand.,10,18 May 2008,"The reaction of some people to this work of art seems analogous to one of my all-time favorite movie scenes in the movie itself. The man-apes, not even being sufficiently intelligent to begin to grasp that they are witnessing an impossible miracle, can only screech, jump around and flail their arms at the enigmatic object before them.It truly is disheartening that there aren't more visionaries of Stanley Kubrick's and Dr. Arthur C. Clarke's caliber. And that society isn't more influenced by the thoughtful visionaries that do exist among us instead of by the all-too-typical power-demented, greed-ridden and/or religiously fanatical sociopsychopaths that hold positions of social, legal and political authority.I remember seeing ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" for the very first time when it came to the theater in my hometown in 1968. I was but 14 years old but I had no particular difficulty in 'getting it'. The only part that left me wondering was when the star child returned to Earth; what were his intentions? If that was meant to represent a kind of 'next step' for mankind, did he return to lead humanity on to that next level? I guess not, since the sequel still had humanity blundering along, with the lunatics running the asylum as usual. Speaking of subsequent films depicting space travel or space themes, some people are fond of claiming that ""2001"" established a standard or precedent for such movies. I tend to disagree. While it may have been influential, most TV shows and movies I've seen would appear to more resemble ""Star Trek"", which appeared a couple of years before ""2001"", in character and technique, i.e., appearing to be nothing more than adaptations of western shoot-em-ups, barroom brawls and World War II or Cold War stories. Even ""2010"", as enjoyable and entertaining as it certainly is, just isn't in the same league with ""2001""'s character and level of intellect, tending more toward the typical chatty, angst-ridden humanity-coping-with-some-thing-other-than-human shtick.""2001: A Space Odyssey"", in contrast, is immortal and stands mockingly before such mediocrity as the monolith before the man-apes.It is profoundly disappointing that Kubrick/Clarke's prophecy of an established base on the moon hasn't been fulfilled, which I submit as being reflective of mankind's general mentality and that of their political representatives, their mental impotence when attempting to deal rationally with technical and scientific issues being only too evident, in many ways. Which is something profoundly portrayed by another recent film based on a story by Dr. Carl Sagan, ""Contact"", which is one of but few films that come anywhere close to ""2001""'s vision such that it can legitimately claim a lineage with ""2001"", right down to a ""wormhole trip"" near the end. (Why is it that every time humanity seems to get close to a cosmic epiphany in these movies and TV shows, someone winds up hauling-ass across the universe at 10 million times the speed of light?) Younger people may find it interesting that much of the technology that they enjoy today was in all likelihood inspired by ""2001: A Space Odyssey""; after all, in 1968, color TV was still very much a novelty and transistors were a mind-bending mystery to many, vacuum tubes having been all the rage for several decades (which were a mind-bending mystery anyway for most of humanity). For Kubrick and Clarke to even begin to fathom, let alone portray, the developments that could arise in the decades to come as accurately as they did is nothing short of phenomenal, perhaps even a bit spooky, in retrospect.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It feels slow on TV, whereas in the theatre you have the chance to look around and take in the full image - just try reading the antigravity toilet instructions on a TV screen!

The images, the music, the story all separately work on a great level, but put them together, and they create a unique experience. At the time it was created, this was the most realistic science fiction movie. The details in every frame are incredible, I could stop the movie at any frame and use it as a picture on the wall to feast my eyes on and never get bored with it. The first time I watched this movie was with my dad when I was about 5 years old, and already then it fascinated me, although I probably understood very little about what was happening. But since the movie works on so many different levels at the same time, it caught me. And as I was getting older, I always re-watched it and seemed to gain a different experience every time. I think, this movie grows with you as you age, it inspires you to gain more knowledge about the world you live in on a scientific and a spiritual level as well.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1756,tim-338,Not for idle minds,10,17 January 2003,"It's easy to see where the ""love it or hate it"" attitude comes from after watching this movie; at face value, it's rather empty. The brilliance comes from the thoughts and questions it provokes about our place in the universe. Like all art (and it certainly is cinematic ART at its finest), it really is only as good or bad as what you take from it.The slow pace gave me a lot of time to reflect, and just ""take in the view"". I'm reminded of Buddhist philosophy, where enlightenment is achieved just by living in the moment, something we have lost touch with in this modern world.The final part of the movie was summed up best by a previous reviewer: ""How would anyone show something beyond our ability to understand? "". First you have to be willing to admit there are things far beyond our understanding in our current state of evolution. Just as there were to our man-ape ancestors.
I can barely comprehend the notion, but I know the next step in evolution would shed us of such a discrete and shallow view of existence. Perhaps toward a dissolved notion of self and our concrete place in space-time, where we can become more at one with the universe and each other, and away from the ideas we have of such a limited scope to life and consciousness. I find it intriguing that these are also beliefs and experiences held by many an acid user. Perhaps they get but a glimpse of a higher plane of existence, perhaps it's all in their mind. What's the difference?That's my (very brief) take. You will no doubt have your own *personal* interpretation, and that means the movie has done its job.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1757,bill-2039,"Wikipedia discussion of interpretations of ""2001""",10,12 February 2008,"This is an excellent film, which I have watched many times, but I believe it is complementary to Arthur C. Clarke's & Kubrick's novel of the same title. The novel fills in the explanation that would be simply impossible (and probably even boring) in the film, which presents a visual and aural inspiration that cannot be duplicated on paper. Thus I highly recommend that anyone puzzled by the movie should read the book, and as Clarke has suggested, repeat the pair alternately as necessary. I would also recommend Clarke's 1953 novel ""Childhood's End"" as deeply relevant for those who want more.Lately an article has been underway on Wikipedia, ""Interpretations of 2001: A Space Odyssey"", amidst a swirl of controversy. (There are also separate articles on the film and the novel.) Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, first and foremost, and there are necessarily strict rules for what can be claimed in a ""properly scholarly"" encyclopedic article. While anything can be said (once), content deemed improper will be removed very quickly by swarms of dedicated defenders of the integrity of the project, rightly or wrongly, depending on the opinion of the persons involved. Once consensus has been reached on each article's discussion or ""talk"" page, argument should damp down. Anyhow, this is a good time for dedicated or interested 2001 fans to take a look and comment on the talk page (tab at the top). The article itself is presently ""locked"" to give tempers a chance to cool, but the discussion page is open. In any case, I hope the Wiki pages on ""2001"" will provide a useful resource to those interested in the film, as well as to Clarke's and Kubrick's thinking on questions of deep human interest, not only 40 years out, but likely for many decades to come as our species matures.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

There is almost no point to this movie...a very basic story-line (which might have been original 30 years ago, when it was made) and nothing exciting ever happens.

The art connoisseurs will relish this film from its very beginning (a black screen lasting for more than two minutes is not a typical opening sequence, is it?) to the final hyper-space animation. The music enthusiasts will be pleased to hear a unique mixture of classical tunes from both Richard and Johann Strauss and micro-polyphony of 20th century composer György Ligeti (you can get a taste of his music at YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPKg2c_bRCs). I can not but agree with the user drn5 who speaks about beauty and relaxation  the two elements that often go together. And this, in my opinion, is the main source of misunderstanding of those who tend to look only for the plot  the simpler one, the better. Any 'artistic' elements are then accompanied by annoyed 'sorry, but we are not in an art gallery, so would you please remove this useless appendix?'. One thing is for sure  this film is definitely not for everyone (by the way, can you think of any film that is?), but if you happen to be one of those who look for more than a story, this might be the film for you.

I would recommend watching it when you are in an extremely patient mood. Fortunately, I was when I watched it and was able to get through the whole thing. OK, I fast-forwarded a little bit through the time-travel, pretty- colors scene. Nevertheless, I left with a once in a lifetime film experience.I was absorbed by Kubrick's amazing scale that was elevated so much by the perfect score. In turn, the film's use of the score actually brought it to new heights!To those who say there is no meaning or story: that's totally not the main focus. I'm sure that there is some kind of meaning (I still haven't found it), but everything else is what completely clicks. Trying to analyze 2001 is, as said a film scholar whose name I have forgotten, ""like the little boy who broke his drum to see why it bangs"".",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It´s boring. Watching a bunch of monkeys for 45 minutes (or 45 hours? seemed like it, so I´m not sure about the exact time) was pain.

1770,PetarDK,Brave new world of science fiction in cinema,10,30 January 2014,"A movie that can make you wonder about so many things. A movie that can make you feel like a tiny bit piece of the universe, which you are, but also prove to you that every single action or decision that you make reflects everything that surround us. I've ever seen so abstract presentation of the human mind and the world at all. It amazes mostly with the groundbreaking visualization of the future, and at the same time making the viewer feel like this future is now. All that achieved with the exceptionally calm and normal like mood, conversations about normal lifelike stuff, as it's no big deal that on screen we see so much science fiction, new technologies etc. I cannot imagine what the people who saw this movie for the first time on the big screen in the 60's felt like seeing this extraordinary movie. I envy them so much. The potential of the future research and development in science, presented in the movie, is beyond limits. It feels like everything is possible to be done and also maybe we are not that far away from achieving everything that we dream of. I don't think that there will be another movie which will shake my mind that hard and change completely my conception of the world as we know it, like the 2001: A Space Odyssey did. Jawdropping, mind blowing, absolutely brilliant and for me the biggest mystery in cinema. Still raises tons of new questions every time I see it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The random silence, incessant beeping sounds, and periods of heavy breathing noises, are enough to make anyone cringe. Now I know how my cats feel when I turn on the vacuum. There is no compelling or interesting music, just random and chaotic noise that makes you wish you were deaf.Bring along a pair of headphones and turn on some classical, techno, whatever it is you like while you are watching and you'll be doing yourself a favor.

I totally agree that in 1969 the images were astounding and the sheer scale was unimaginable, but now all that is LAME. I knew there was a point in the first part but I really didn't get it.

At the end of it, one has a vague concept of a fantastic history of human cosmology, but that's it.That said, the remaining hour and a half of stubbornly stunning and gratuitous visuals of space features, spaceships, and people walking in zero-G make up an overstuffed, artery-clogging rich sci-fi environment -- one which anyone living on the planet earth after 1977's Star Wars will find entirely unnecessary, and pale in comparison.All of this together leaves one feeling they've been insulted or tricked out of a small chunk of their life, in a relatively effective and intriguing way.

1775,homegrownherbal,Masterpiece-of-crap,1,10 October 2002,"2001: A Space Odyssey, was without a doubt, the lamest, most boring, most unentertaining, poor excuse for a film, waste of time, I've ever seen! Whenever there was any form of live action, there was absolute silence. Whenever there was nothing to see but black, it was accompanied by the most horrible set of minor and dimished chords you could imagine. It was a waste of 2 and a half hours. I constantly kept repeating, ""THE END"" hoping that the film would heed my request. I don't see how it can be called a masterpiece. It was nothing but a series of segways from one scene to the next, with each segway getting longer and each scene getting shorter. The most excruciating scene had to be when the ship was entering Jupiter's orbit. A 15 minute sequence with simple images slowly flashing on the screen after being run through a filter. The music sounded as if a three year old had been sat behind a piano and been allowed to bang on the keys. Coming in at a close second, was the first 20 minutes in which nothing happened except two clans of monkeys fought, after it took one of them 19 minutes to realize that a bone could be used as a beating device. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1776,a_kingl,"Be careful, people try to sell you things",5,20 December 2008,"I read some of the last critics and was astonished, that ratings for this movie are either very high or very low, which shows that these people weren't critic at all. I had a great deal of expectations when I watched this movie. Many friends said it is superb and I like all the other Kubrick movies I watched so far. But yeah. First of all the complete movie is filmed with a very keen eye on details. The ape costumes for example are great and the space vessels seem very realistic. The effects are much ahead of its time and are still remarkable today. But there is much missing. After the initial ape scene, which has some great shots the really boring part begins. Wee see spaceships with Strauss' Danube waltz in the background. It is pretty, for about 5 minutes, but after it is just boring. The music keeps repeating and all is very very slow. Some of the former critics say that you have to appreciate the beauty in it. Well spacecrafts aren't exactly beautiful and the statement, you have to enjoy this movie as a picture is stupid, because it is a movie after all. Maybe Kubrick chose the wrong medium for his 'art'. Later on even the music itself stops and it gets worse and worse. Some critics said the ships must be slow for being realistic. That is stupid, because in space velocity is relative and it wouldn't be less realistic if the ship was faster or slower. Over all there isn't much of a plot, which doesn't need to be a bad thing if the rest is entertaining. But it isn't entertaining, therefore plot is missing. I have to admit, that the end became interesting again. After a psychedelic sequence, where one doesn't know what it means come a few very good scenes. My friend insisted, that one can't really grasp the whole thing without reading the book along. But that is not the characteristic of a great movie. The psychedelic experience could also have been caused by a lack of oxygen leading to a dream sequence. One couldn't know the difference. I believe, if you'd take only the first ape sequence and the last aging and rebirth sequence you would really get a fascinating movie. What I most hate about the movie are the people watching it and telling me it is one of the best movies of all time. These are the same kind of people that visit an art gallery for the sake of telling other people that they are interested in art. Even my friend, who praised the movie, suddenly admitted that the movie is in fact boring for the most part. Art is not good because it bores you. It is the same mentality as saying, that culture has to be boring and that boring things are culture. And yes, I am not the kind of person who loves action movies. If it would be an intelligent movie, it wouldn't be boring, because really intelligent movies aren't boring. People brag about the philosophical meanings of this movie. What is the meaning of a flying spacecraft? Why has to be a philosophical meaning in a fictional short story containing aliens teaching mankind? There simply isn't one. Most people say that this movie is awesome because their friends do and this makes me angry. To sum it up: Boring as a whole but has some interesting genius scenes. It is not a bad movie, but also definitely not great and it is certainly not mediocre.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1777,grtsantu,great visuals without anything to tell,6,19 July 2010,"I watched this movie with lot of expectation after seeing all hype. But totally disappointed. Though it has a great visual and also shown in aesthetic way. Considering the time it was made, the concept for future and the way it has been shown is awesome. It feels so real sometime you feel like being in space. But that's the only good part. It has no story or at least I'm not able to find anything, staggeringly slow, and the overuse of background music sometime becomes so annoying. I have seen lot movies with great visual but they are not worth mentioning just because they lack story. Don't understand why this movie has been treated differently from those movies. Forgetting about the time it was made, I feel it very hard to appreciate it. Then again it all depends person to person and we agree to disagree.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1778,filmplj,I'm sorry Dave...Im afraid I cant do that....,10,10 February 2009,"This is one of the most dazzling visual accomplishments in the history of the motion picture. I do admit that the first time i watched it i had second thoughts, but after watching it again and actually paying attention to the symbolism...I got it. Kubrick once said ""you are free to speculate what you want about the philosophical meaning of 2001..."" To me this movie isn't actually a film, but in essence presents us with a challenge. A mental challenge where we actually in the end question ourselves and whether our technology will in the end try to over come us. I never truly caught that the theme of the movie (or what i believe is the theme) started on the space ship on its way to the space station when Mr. Floyd's pen was floating out of his hand, and the flight attendant had to put it back into his pocket. To me this is the fact that man has invented ""tools"" that we live with on earth and use every day. For example the pen. Everyday we use it to write different things, but in space...we lose control of our tools-this where Kubrick shows the pen floating out of Floyd's hand while he is sleeping. That same seen also symbolizes and foreshadows the ""star baby"" at the end of the film that you see. During the spaceship scene, Floyd has to learn how to use the bathroom (like a baby), and also while eating dinner he has to slurp a liquidy substance out of a straw (like baby food). In all there is so much more meaning to this movie than what I just stated. I would recommend this movie to anybody...that is if they watch it more than once (becasue if you get the theme and symbolism the first time, you clearly didn't)...and for all those people who gave bad reviews or didn't like masterpiece, take this into account-This film was released in 1968, which means that they began filming it 4 years before (typical Kubrick movie took about 4 years) so somewhere around 1964 was the start date...and what famous revolutionary TV show came out in 1966? Star Trek The Original Series...now compare the special effects used in 2001 to star Trek...Kubricks was far more superior (even though I also loved star Trek)...",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1779,KyriakoSorokkou,"A significant film, yet. . .",5,9 January 2015,"Its significance in the film industry is indisputable. Its main theme its about the evolution of man from using simple tools into using complex tools travelling through the universe, some of these tools turned against him (HAL 9000) but still with his courage he won and he is ready for another evolutionary step (star-child). It was the first movie with a realist depiction of space (no sound, hence the music) and people were travelling not in flying saucers but in actual spaceships. BUT, it was slower than a crippled snail and had some annoying music sequences (not the Classical music ones) and an almost non-existent (documentary) chit chat dialogue. For me these 2 elements were the main defects of the film, so it's 3 stars from me",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Parts were undoubtedly designed to be boring, but artistically this film is unmatched. Really, it would be best if this could be called a different medium than film, for it is something else entirely.

This cinematic audio visual brilliance is so many things at once and yet it never aspires to be anything. It cannot be (and should not be) typecast into a sci-fi film. This is just a medium that addresses larger questions like : Who am I ? What is the purpose of life ? What is my place in context of the Universe ? The real beauty is that this A/V does not directly raise any such question nor does it explicitly spell out answers. Because there are none. It transmits a telemetric wave that compels you to think. And hopefully, will do so for many years to come. Having said that, this movie can equally raise questions on evolution, technological progress, artificial intelligence, inter-stellar travel, worm-holes, space colonization and many such significant topics but I see them as mere stepping stones. The year in the title of this movie is a misnomer. It never needed it. But i guess that would have just derailed the audience. Personally, I think a movie such as this was directly scripted by the black monolith itself. Only the hand that seemed to wield it was different. It was the need of the hour.Entertainment seekers, look elsewhere. If i could make some cave-men like tribe watch just one movie in their entire lifetime, this would be it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I rented this movie with very high exception, as I will watch an amazing Sci-fi movie. But movie is insanely boring. It is 2+ hours long movie and it is slow like hell.The special effects and music of movie is outclass. 10/10 for the special effects and music. To see such class effects in late 60's movies is rare to watch. But still this special effects and music cannot save the movie.Movie starts with 3 minutes of black screen and music and don't know what's going on. Why there is need to show black screen and music for 3 long minutes. Then we see early stone age people and there struggle for living. Monkeys are surprised with this monolithic buried in rocks. No one knows why it is kept there or who kept it or from where it came. Not explained... Then movie forwards to modern age where scientist do there work. Here too movie is slow and difficult to make out as what's going on as there is too less conversation between the characters. At this point of time, your interest towards the movie falls to zero and you get bored. Then again you see some very good special effect, good music, then good special effect and then again good music. But the question arises as how can this be linked to story of movie?? Somehow after 2+ hours the movie ends and your head pains like anything. At the end you think that did you saw a documentary or a movie. But documentary are also not that bad.

But after watching for about 30 minutes I was totally let down. First of all you have to believe that we evolved from Apes millions of years ago to enjoy the opening scene, The Dawn of Man. I personally think the whole evolution theory is false and full of holes. But then again Planet of the apes was about man evolving from Apes and that was a great movie. I do have to admit though, the scenery of the earth before the age of man in this film was breathtaking.The movie is way too slow and there isn't much going on. The music selection for the soundtrack was great. I loved some of the classical songs. Which is one of the big reasons I loved, A clock Work Orange.But if I wanted to hear classical music and see landscapes I could do that on my own. I watch movies for their great stories and thought provoking conversations between well scripted characters. This movie provided neither. I found myself finding better things to do when there was no dialog. This must be some kind of record. The shortest script ever to a full length feature.I only got half way though the movie because at 1 hour and 12 minutes there was a scene that nearly put me to sleep. For exactly 6 minutes and 40 seconds the only audio was an annoying hissing sound and a man breathing. That was it, I'd had it. I had to find something better to do with my time.

I'm a huge science fiction fanatic, so that may have something to do with my love for this film.

1790,SarahGringe,I agree -- Greatest movie of all time,10,4 September 2017,"Saw this movie nearly 50 years ago when it was newly released! It was in Cinerama, my parents told me this. (Accurate?) The movie screen wrapped around in 180* fashion! This effect was overpowering in a supreme way. It helped to increase the beauty and awesome power of the film. I agree with the previous reviewer that this movie is the greatest of all time. And to think that in 1968 man had not stepped on the moon yet! My parents insisted that I go... much to a teenager's rolling of eyes. I graduated high school in 1970, so the teen years and interests were in full-swing! I was so glad I went. My mother understood the movie entirely and explained it to my father and me. The movie became even more amazing to me! And I explained my version to my husband last night. My explanation is more mystical than he ever knew! Good fodder for couples' discussion concerning our view of the universe. Yes, anyone who finds this movie ""boring"" probably doesn't know how to sit still and think deeply. I am a ballerina (in my youth) and a medical person in my first career. The movie is like watching a long ballet beautiful captivating ballet. Two very graceful scenes would be the ""stewardess"" in Velcro shoes balancing a snack tray while walking down the aisle of the transit ship. So glad Kubrick used classical music! Another scene particularly dance-like is the scene of the modular ship (Ker Dullea) while trying to re-enter the mother ship. The slow, graceful turning of the knob to re-open is well- - like watching a ballet. The grandeur of the music and scenes in this movie overwhelming. I think the fact that I saw this originally in Cinerama stuck with me all of these years. The mind retains what it sees -- for me. My mind happens to grasp facts using photographic recall of details. (Not bragging -- my auditory recall is weaker.) I showed this movie to SPED high school math students in 2012-2014. They were mostly bored. I wanted them to be influenced in a positive way by this monumental film -- including possibly developing a love for classical music. The students who had parents/homes who talked with them (few) took it in and processed the experience. I do remember one boy who asked me questions about what certain elements meant. So one student and maybe a few more actually had an influencing experience. Well, that is one small victory for mankind! This movie taught me so many things -- love of detail and beauty. It established a strength in me. My father was a non-believer until his death. He told me that he believed Armstrong's walk on the moon was faked. I thought that was crazy. (Did he read something about them using Kubrick's sets?) Last night we re-visited this movie-- just my husband and I. After discussion, we both were once again riveted.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The sequences towards the end are dated, but still entertaining. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing, and fits the visuals perfectly.If there is a down side to this film, it is its occasional tedium....Kubrick's typical long shots of movement with no dialog, space craft slowly docking...these moments require some patience, and todays attention spans require quick cuts and frantic motion.Overall, the visual beauty and symphonic structure of the film more than make up for any negatives.

Rarely do you find a six out of ten stars review: most of the time, it gets either one or two stars, or nine or ten stars. Many positive reviewers argue that the people who hate the film 'miss the point', and on the flipside, most haters argue that there is no point to miss. Seeing as I had to watch it for a school project, reading the reviews made my expectations drop. When my group and I chose it, I thought it was going to be a badass science-fiction film with explosions and stuff. Boy, was I wrongMore often than not, when there are reviewers arguing there is 'deep meaning' to any media, whether it be books, albums or films, it ends up being pretentious twaddle. Especially in music (my favourite form of media). Therefore, I was slightly apprehensive of watching this film, even though I had to.But less about me and more about the film. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 film directed by Stanley Kubrick. It is widely considered a classic, but most people I have asked think it is really boring. That is because it moves way too slowly. A lot of the scenes are awfully stretched for no apparent reason; half of this film could be taken out and you would still be able to get the basic gist of what is going on ('understanding' the film is something else). Character development and plot advancement is pretty sparse, as is dialogue, which means that you are bound to get bored at least once during the viewing.Fortunately, almost everything in life has good sides and bad sides. The good, the extremely good even, side of this film is the audiovisual side. At the time, I imagine the visuals were absolutely stunning, and they still are today, so that speaks volumes. Especially the settings, i.e. the spaceships and planets, are very well done. The specifics of these spaceships, when examined, are very well thought out in terms of realism. The special effects used are also brilliant, and while you certainly should not watch the film for the visuals alone, they are very nice to look at regardless.But not only is it a treat to the eye, it is also a treat to the ear: music is applied to its fullest in this film, going from easy-going classical music in the one boring scene, to eerie, chant-like music in the next. The film is intended to be more of an audial rather than a visual experience and it clearly shows in its creative soundtrack. The sound is where the film shines and while it does not always make it less of a boring experience it still shows clear signs of having been thought of thoroughly. Again, the sound also demonstrates knowledge of science on the part of the director, since he has taken into account the fact that there is no sound in Outer Space and has implemented that in the film accordingly, unlike other science-fiction films that get all flashy in Space with explosions and all that sort of thing, even though that is not even possible. It is these small details that really make you appreciate it just that bit more. While you may not enjoy the film, at least you can acknowledge that a great amount of time and effort went into its realization. The music used in this film is never unfitting and always stays relevant. All the sounds used in this film are used for a reason—all the sounds in this film relate to what is going on on the screen—and even the voice of the computer, HAL9000, the slightest detail, has been considered. You would never find a dark scene with happy-go-lucky, upbeat tunes. A lot of the music and sounds used are still used to similar effect today, such as Johann Strauss' waltz An der schönen blauen Donau. Especially the opening theme, Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra is commonly associated with the film.The application of sound in this film is truly remarkable and saves it from being absolutely terrible, elevating it up to mediocre. Had it not been as good as it is, the visuals alone would not be enough of a redeeming factor to make it worthwhile. Even though I did not personally enjoy it, it rightfully deserves its place as an influential classic and is indeed mandatory viewing, regardless of the fact that it is boring. Undoubtedly it has influenced countless films in the genre and outside of the genre, and even if you are not a connoisseur of films, you can definitely feel its influence in other media as well. Overall, this film loses points for its duration to content ratio but gains points for its stunning visuals and brilliant audio putting it at a mediocre five out of ten stars, certainly not becoming of what is supposed to be a classic and not quite living up to my initial expectations, but if it were cut short by about an hour the film would be a brilliant watch. As I mentioned before, though, I still believe that it is mandatory viewing and I am sure there are some who would appreciate the slow pacing of the film. Just save yourself some money and rent it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1797,pidgeonryan,A Slow Movie,2,28 May 2014,"Know, i Understand that this movie is a masterpiece, it redefined the genre, that it is thought provoking. However, This is a movie that moves along at a snails pace. It is slow, has barely any dialogue and the ending is sure to confuse many viewers. I think that this movie could have been made into a 30 minute short and still got it's point across. When I started watching this i was expecting a science fiction classic. Instead, i got a snooze Fest. i also think that anyone who can should watch this movie, and form their own opinion, after all it is very thought provoking and deals this the topic of evolution which does touch upon many people nerves.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It's the best movie that I have ever seen.After seeing this movie I was blown away. I never really knew that I liked allegorical movies, but this movie has blown me away.It's hard to believe this movie is 42 years old. The visuals are just amazing most today's movies don't have visuals like this movie does.Another thing that I was amazed by this movie is simplicity. It doesn't have many dialogs most of the time you only hear noises(which are very important part of this movie). It's truly what a movie should be. This movie doesn't think for you it encourages you to think for yourself. This movie is truly addictive. After seeing it once I wanted more because It can be very different in your mind every time you watch it. I think this movie should be studied at high schools because it's very meaningful and let's face it It's the digital age children doesn't read books anymore. This movie is very brilliant and it would truly fit into the educational program. Once that happens this movie will definitely be on the list.It's truly a masterpiece which has to seen by every thinking man.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1799,jezmaze,A unique vision.,10,26 April 2003,"Stanley kubrick was obviously a unique visionary & will be greatly missed.He could create a vision of breathtaking individuality with the snap of a clapperboard. I'm talking strangelove, clockwork orange, shining etc. & this his masterpiece 2001. From the dawn of man sequence to the challenging finale the film is a visual feast of cinematic design and utterly natural talent.  You literally climb inside his head and swim about in his universe for two or more hours and your mind will be slightly changed (for the better) by the experience. An altered cinematic state. Maybe only Bergman & hitchcock state their presence so fundamentally on each shot or sequence as much as kubrick.Citizen Kane is still the greatest film, 2001 a space odyssey is it's nearest rival.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1800,brendanhogansheehan,Not a religious movie in the conventional sense,10,26 August 2010,"2001 is a meditation on Western (high) culture. Such high culture is not something that most people experience on an everyday basis but it has a subtle, pervasive influence on all our lives. The movie wants to bring us on a journey through questions on where we come from, where we are now and where we are going from a Western perspective. The movie is ambiguous because it does not seek to provide answers but asks us to think about how these deep spiritual questions fit into the Western world view.Nothing in the film hints at the existence of other cultural views. This is not a criticism of the film, this is just what the film is about. In the near future presented to us Western culture is all triumphant. Science and engineering are raising Man to new heights. The people portrayed in the movie appear confident about the intellectual/spiritual basis on which their world is constructed. People are calm, measured and rational. The interactions between the Americans (representing a capitalist view of freedom) and the Russians (representing a communist view of freedom) are there to remind us (subtly) about the possible roads that humanity can follow. But both viewpoints belong to the Western framework of thought.God, as a real explanation of our role in the world, died during the Enlightenment. This movie proposes that it is Western science and technology that will lead us to a new state of existence and has the potential to destroy us. It is the closest that I have seen Western ideas portrayed as almost religious.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

But don't feel bad about skipping over the plot. You would just have to google an explanation later anyway. That said, I don't think this movie deserves less than 3 stars, simply for the fact that it is a beautifully shot film. you have to remember that these special effects were made before anyone set foot on the moon. I found myself longing for more dialogue, but was enjoying the movie until I realized (12 minutes from the end of the movie) that there was simply not going to be an explanation of anything I had just watched. I literally fell asleep during the psychadellic dimensional travel sequence and woke up before it was over. Some of the shots are way too long.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1802,adam-330,The finest piece of cinematic genious... Ever!,10,9 November 2003,"I have been a fan of both Kubrick and Clarke for many years now, but I had always avoided watching this movie because I couldn't see how it could possibly match the brilliance of the novel (Which is one of my most loved books).  However, after finally seeing it, I am happy. no ecstatic. to say that it didn't match the novel, it surpassed it!Kubrick did an amazing job of keeping in the deep profound meaning of the story, which is really what makes this movie so great in my opinion.  It puts forward theories and asks questions which not only entertain, but make you want to think and discuss, for a long time after you have seen the movie.  The shear grand scope of the subject matter in my opinion makes almost all other movies pale into insignificance.  What could be more profound than a story about the very existence of our race, and its position and meaning in the universe?The effects in this movie are amazing; not in a `3D generated CGI wiz-bang eye candy' type of way, but in a far more mature way.  The purpose of them is to portray a scene in the most realistic way possible, and in my opinion by doing so, they work much more effectively than any movie made in more modern times, with greater effects technology and budget.  I was completely amazed that this movie was filmed all those years ago in 1968.People who are after a movie that provides light entertainment value and does not require much thought or patience would do well to avoid 2001: A Space Odyssey.  However for those who are after a deep and rich movie experience, and are willing to put in the work (in terms of patience and thought) will be greatly rewarded.  The meaning of this movie is most definitely not served up to the viewer on a silver platter, and you may have to watch it a few times, or discuss it with others before you truly understand it.  Everyone's interpretation of it may be different. That's what makes it so thought-provoking.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1803,mitrasmit,Kubrick shows a surprising lack of timing and tension,1,11 July 2011,"I have read many reviews saying this movie is boring, but that's not what bugged me most about 2001. Boredom to one can be exciting to another, so let's not go into this very subjective matter and try to keep it a bit more objective.What troubles me is that people think this is one of Kubrick's masterpieces. In my views however, it's doing a lot of things wrong a director can do. Let me explain: - Not even once, the (randomly selected?) music seems to have any connection to the images we're seeing. Surely the music is epic, but if anything, it's working against the build-up of timing and excitement.Many scenes are stretched out through such enormous lengths, you lust lose interest in what's happening. That's not boredom, that just because you don't have to see someone perform the exact same agonizingly slow action ten times in a row. You get it after the first two or three times. And the computer talking three times slower than any human being doesn't help.The movie is filled with extremely annoying sounds. I guess one could claim it makes you feel more like you're into the movie, and that it makes everything more realistic, but when you're changing volumes many times throughout the picture because you just can't stand the sounding alarm or heavy breathing anymore, it went too far.There's more negative things I could talk about, but these are the reasons I would never want to see 2001 again. Stanley Kubrick made some great movies, but this one was definitely not worth producing for me.Those who think greatly of this picture mostly do so because of the beautiful scenery and the very impressive 'special effects', and I can imagine that back when the movie was made, it was revolutionary. It's why I grade it a 2 instead of a 1. But to see a few marvelous shots of a savanna, spaceships and LSD-trips, you're better off at a search engine's pictures page.2001: A Space Odyssey is a classic, and I can't blame you for viewing it. I just, personally, can't imagine anyone not being disappointed at the end.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

However i'm afraid that's all there is, the rest is pretty colours and loooong long scenes filled with cardboard actors and the cliché that is a homicidal computer. c'mon even in 68 that had been done to death.The dialog is few and far between, detached, meaningless, and irrelevant. and my god unless you have a desire to sit and stare at bright colours, a fetus and a bad actor for the last 20 or so minutes of the movie by all means. but for all the people who value the time they have i implore you to stay away from this.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1805,matthewcollins101,More than a film. An Experience,10,2 January 2011,"2001 A Space Odyessy is one of those films you rarely get anymore, with a deeper meaning than just ""HAL 9000 doesn't want Dave to mess up the mission so wants to kill him"". There is a Deeper meaning, its about evolution.We start off with the apes there hard to relate because there apes showing that man started off savage and hard to be friendly with, they learn to use tools like the bone as a hammer, they learn to use weapons like the bone as a club and then we take a fascinating jump cut to the future with the Blue Danube playing. I think this shows that life is a circle cause the Blue Danube was used for a waltz (I think) and waltzes mainly go around in circles and repeat. The scene with the woman walking to get the pen shows a baby learning to walk as she struggles at first then holds on to something for support and then walks on her own (might I just add the shots for this scene are beautiful)most of the rest is the sorry progressing in a nice slow pace allowing you to breath in the amazing look. I must say though I cant explain the flashy colours near the end. I can explain the end scene as Dave sees himself as and old man showing again mans evolution. Then the Old Dave sees himself dying on a bed (once again showing evolution) and then he sees the mysterious black pillar which I assume is symbolising life and death and he then turns into a foetus thusly showing life is a circle you're born, you grow old and then you die and then you're born again. Thusly showing 2001 A Space Odyessy is a study for human evolution. Also the camera work, slow pace and lack of music during the scenes is great",2001 - A Space Odyssey

That's right druggie, when i say that my guess is that even though no one landed on the moon just yet 1968 was rolling around hippies and all, along with the Vietnam War. This movie was very slow and dull, scenes seemed to last forever, audio was repetitious, and talk was minimal and well monotone. Now I'm debating if i bother watching any other Kubrick film. I'm 18 (don't do drugs) and action i can do without sometimes, but this just bored me i'm surprised i made it to the end, i was confused so much of the time because of the little to no talk i didn't have a clue what was going on.

1812,HitchFan97,The Greatest Science Fiction Film Of All Time,10,12 May 2011,"Along with ""Psycho"", ""The Godfather"", and ""Vertigo"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey' is one of a select few films that define my love of cinema. It is a motion picture that is far more unique than any first time viewer can imagine. It has little dialog, the acting is poor, and the film instead relies on breathtaking visuals and classical music to hypnotize the viewer. And the first time I saw ""2001"", that simply didn't cut it. But on second viewing, I realized that I simply couldn't have been more wrong. Because this time, for some reason, I was totally engrossed by the film, by the visionary directing, by the cold calculations of HAL 9000. And it was then that I realized, the only way for something like that to occur, was that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" had to be a work of genius.And as to the common accusations of ""wooden acting""? Simply a major point that the film is trying to make. In his final days, man has developed his tools (HAL) to the point that they are more human than man itself. But I won't bore the reader with my own interpretations of this colossal masterpiece. As Kubrick once said, we are all free to speculate ""2001""'s meaning, so what are you waiting for?

After the original film content provokes the viewer's imagination, deliberately giving more questions than answers, leaving it up to everyone, whether you work out the possibility of developing a sense of it all. This became a cult base and an inspiration to many other sci-fi. I think the key to the film is the scene where the flying bone as a tool discovered monkey turns to space rockets, as well as a monkey hardly imagined something like that, so we can hardly imagine what happens after a similar leap.

I mean this isn't a part 2, so why make a part1 that even 1% of population will not get what its trying to say. But the masses are just as stupid, thinking they totally understand art and creativity even if its new, who are willing to appreciate anything if it is considered art and is odd, with lots of money involved. People who will treasure and make a fuzz over a poop, if it is hangable on the wall.If u ever love this film, i must tell u, do u really enjoy watching this film? If u give it a 10star, are u willing to watch it at least thrice? Just be truthful to urself, this ''Aaa, what a magnificent, brilliant, and genius idea/art/picture'' over trivial stuff is just nonsense.I get to see what the story is about only when i read IMDb Storyline, lol. Oh, And the black cuboid scenes looks like horror film, i bet many pussies will be scared.To wrap it up, i think: Vizuals is good especially for 60s/ Sound is normal/ Acting is normal/ Dialogue is poor/ Plot is good/ and the most imp, Presentaion is DISGUSTING.A completely boring, nonsense, strange and stupid film.

My guess... Mr. Kubrick wanted to minimize attention to the eye. But, when it is seen, it is not consistent between close and far angles.REVEALING MISTAKES: When David enters the emergency airlock, the suspension wires can be seen behind him. You can also see that the stunt man being blasted into the compartment is wearing a mask, then they cut to the actor.FACTUAL ERRORS: When David is blown into the emergency airlock, the pod door, explosively blown, should also have entered, along with associated debris. Also, the pod would have been thrusted away from the Discovery 1.FACTUAL ERRORS: Velcro cannot account for the counteracting of zero-gravity, as they walk around, lean, etc.CONTINUITY: Zippers seen on space suit on rear of legs in the dead astronaut floating sequence that are not on other suits. (For stunt suit?)REVEALING MISTAKE: Camera track is visible as David moves from the equipment stowage compartment into the pod bay. He has to carefully step between its ""rungs.""REBUTTALS TO LISTED GOOFS:Factual errors: When Dave opens the emergency airlock ... escaping debris also should have damaged the pod. (Explosive decompression debris.)Rebuttal: No explosive bolts were used for opening of the emergency airlock hatch. It was opened using the external controls. As to the escaping air from the airlock not happening, this can be explained by it having been previously evacuated from air ... a procedure that could have been required for all EVA.Continuity: The sphere of the Discovery is too small for all the rooms that are shown. Rebuttal:The size and numbers of rooms in the sphere can be explained by the fact that wide angle lenses were used, making the rooms appear much larger than they actually were. Adding to the deception, cameras are often placed outside of the ""4th wall,"" making the room seem much larger than it is. All of the compartments fit perfectly into the sphere when mapped out. For example... the emergency airlock is very much less longer than it appears with the wide angle lens.Revealing mistakes: When Dr Floyd is first on the space station ... not radial to the curve of the floor. (Body position angles on space station.)Rebuttal: The persons seen are not far enough away from each other to allow for the differentiation in body angles to read. Also, it could also be explained by social behaviour, which would call for the individuals to lean and compensate when conversing. Continuity: The first pod that is lost ... Dave is seen emerging from the middle bay door with the third pod. (Apparent inconsistency in pod locations)Rebuttal:The juggling of pod positions can be explained by the fact that the astronaut would have used the pod at a later time, docking it to a different position in the pod bay.Continuity: In the 70mm version you can see passengers ... Dr. Floyd is the sole passenger. (Number in passengers seen inside the Orion craft.)Rebuttal:This can be explained by considering the fact that crew members, as in other scenes of the film, could be visiting the passenger's cabin.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1819,ejreich32,Not sure a younger audience can appreciate this film,3,24 July 2011,"This story is very subjective but the overall feel of this film is that a monolith somehow appears and starts evolution. It begins with Apes who discover a monolith and then begin to evolve by using a bone a club, and fast forwarding to a time where man is highly involved in space travel and colonization and, end up finding a monolith buried on the moon. Eighteen months later a space craft on its way towards Jupiter where it is believed the monolith has come from, with a self contained computer system named HAL-9000, carrying hibernating humans and a crew takes on a mind of its own and turns on the crew. The crew commander, Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea), decides to disconnect HAL.Then a prerecorded message appears on a monitor and it is Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) explaining the purpose of the mission. Dave finds out from this video that 18 months ago the first evidence of intelligent life off the Earth was discovered. It was buried 40 feet deep below the moons surface and except for a very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter, ""the four-million-year-old black monolith has remained completely inert. Its origin and purpose are still a total mystery."" This is where the movie gets more intense. You then find Dave floating through a worm hole and then suddenly appears looking at himself in a bedroom and watches himself get older, the monolith appears, and then Dave suddenly turns into a fetus and then hovering in space looking at Earth.This film stokes the coals of evolution with theory that evolution has been moved along by a black monolith. If you look at the detail given to all of the scenes and the way the angles and lighting are used I can see how this would have been a revolutionary film when it was released in 1968. Even by today's standards I feel that the scenes in space were very realistic and I was impressed by them.The lighting was a constant factor in the film, of course because it was in space. You had many colors used from the color of the lighting in the cockpits, to the colors of the space suits used by the astronauts.The angles were also very fresh and designed to give the viewer the appearance of weightlessness or floating in space. The was the angles were used, especially in the space crafts, really defined the space that was shown on the scene and really made the audience feel as if this film was try in space and in the future.All in all I can respect the cinematic qualities in this movie but feel that a younger generation might not be able to appreciate these items and will discount this movie as long and boring. With that being said I did feel as if this film was a bit drug out and the storyline was very unclear without a lot of analytical rewinding in my mind to try to figure things out. Graphics stunning but the movie overall misses the mark when put up to movies of today's standards.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1820,vanmotman,Blue danube for ever,10,3 October 2003,"I am interested if other people had the same experience. Of course, the movie itself cannot be overestimated. What makes it so very special to me still is that it also was a rare moment in cultural history: that the art of the past (classical music from Strauss to Ligety) met the (relatively new) art of cinema. With 'met' I mean that Kubrick really merged the two art forms in one. At certain moments in the movie, I wondered if I was moved more by what I saw than what I heard, or by what I saw and heard. Very special is the famous cut from the apes to the space century. Special also because of the move from silence (20 minutes no talk, still an astonishing achievement in movie making) to Johann Strauss, from apes to 'civilization'. And to me special as I learned to like (even love in a way) the Strauss music. Like the secrets of the greatest pieces of classical music are hard to explain (why are we moved by the 9th symphony of Beethoven?), Kubricks masterpieces have also some untouchable quality, and will remain a milestone in the development of art in future centuries.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1821,dee-grover,ICONIC EPIC MASTERPIECE.,10,7 December 2018,"Watching it. as i write this review..watched it many many times..a piece of cinematic art ..way ahead of its time,beautifully directed and produced...1 out of 10ers have no clue what they are talking about and need a good slap with something wet and floppy, dumb-asses..
The film has probably inspired alot of other filmakers in one way or the other and give them ideas which have kind of made it into their films..i'm sure i heard a piece of music when the camera was panning along side the discovery 1 (which incidentally looks alot like the event horizon) ..which was on ""aliens"" when ripley was floating towards the search and rescue ship on the eev at the beginning of ""aliens"" sure it was the same music....and another thing ""skype"" this is 1968...when the agent calls his daughter..somebody at the skype offices must of seen this film to get the idea somewhere down the line..
The Soundtrack just carries you along all the way through..there will not ever be a movie made like this again.if you do not understand the essence of this masterpiece you have no business calling yourelf a film buff....",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1822,AngelicDaySpa,One of the best films of all time,10,12 September 2011,"Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey is a unique visual experience. It's one of the reasons movies have meaning when it comes to telling a story. One of Kubrick's finest films, 2001 is a meditative piece that is suppose to make viewers think and allow our minds to explore and wander. The film has so many great moments that will be remembered by film scholars for generations. For example, that jump cut you probably heard of, is one of the greatest film techniques in the history of cinema. One minute we're deep in the past back when human beings were monkeys and after one monkey throws a bone up into the air, suddenly we've blasted through time (even passing the present) and now find ourselves in the future and we can see what we've become. Once monkeys, now astronauts trying to get to Jupiter. Then there's the monolith. This mysterious screeching alien-made wonder that drives the entire odyssey. Humans want the answers and they travel to Jupiter to try and find them. Kubrick always makes movies about either dehumanization or simply humanity, and 2001 teaches that human beings have developed very well overtime, but that human beings compared to the rest of the universe are still very innocent. This story told on film is able to tell us all about this incredible message. Some have called the film ""boring"", because they can't seem to understand what the film is really about. It definitely takes more than an initial viewing and it is certainly something that needs a lot of appreciation, but those who give 2001: A Space Odyssey a chance, will certainly have an amazing film to talk about for years.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I needed one for my brain after watching this movie. It literally took me almost 4 hrs in total to watch because I had to take a break and restart my brain to semi-normal functionality every so often. I mean this movie goes soooooo slooooow its ridiculous, to say that the script had about 10 pages of dialogue would be generous. They just don't talk!! And while talking isnt everything, and i admit there were some scenes where only the music was necessary, and the music is great, that was probably the best part, but then go listen to a symphony or something and forget about the movie. So many people give this awesome reviews, and for its time, i'd say the special effects and filmography is quite good, but as for the acting, or lack thereof, it just needed a little something more, no shootem ups or sex etc., profanity isnt even required, but a little more emotion, these guys were like stones, just sitting there with long faces. All in all, if you need something to calm yourself down, just play the movie, dont even start at the beginning if you've seen it before, just start anywhere, lay down, and relax, it'll put you right to sleep.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

A trip into space, generated by the assumption, based on scientific evidences, that there would be some black rock on Mars similar to one they had previously found on the moon. You are given the idea that to understand the existence of the discovery they have to find her twin. There's not much more to talk about except the fact that by the middle of the story the protagonist had been struggling with the PC that controlled the spaceship, and that he nearly died because of this. The argument is very strong and realistic, capable of supporting this mad theme. Not everyone will be capable of understanding who profound this is, digging into the very point of existence, but for those who enjoyed it, this is without doubt a life changing movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I've always had a natural love for science fiction but I've always thought that there was precious little good science fiction out there to be seen. Most so-called science fiction movies are not very good. Most are actually horror movies or fantasy movies in a science fiction setting. They tend to be weak in what I consider to be true science fiction.This movie is just pure beautiful science fiction at its best. It captured my imagination and took it on a joy ride. It left me with a grand sense of awe. Add to this the great visuals and music, and you get a masterpiece.I'd like to see more science fiction movies that rely simply on pure and imaginative science fiction like this movie does.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Being objective about it is as difficult an undertaking as understanding and contemplating the movie itself.Love it or hate it, 2001 is here to stay. The enduring quality of this film is that it is all at once thought-provoking, brilliant, insightful, frustrating, and monumentally tedious, and a kin to hitting one's thumb incessantly with a hammer and loving it, yet some of us acquiesce and revel in delight in trying to write our own reviews as expressly as we can.Everyone who loves the film fully understands why it's hated, and everyone who doesn't knows why it's a highly regarded art film.In my opinion, and this is just my opinion: It is one of the greatest science fiction films of all time because it dares to challenge perception and asks and answers some of the greatest questions in life: Who are we? Where did we come from? What are we doing here? And where are we going? As a result, we agree to disagree on the merits of the film.2001 is enigmatic. So much time is spent (some would say wasted) waiting: waiting for a ship to dock, waiting for dialogue, waiting for adventure, waiting for a narrator that will never come. Each of us has to be our own narrators, and that's a tall order to ask of any movie-watcher with stars in his or her eyes.As a fan, I agree, the movie is very tedious, but deservedly so, and that's okay. I accept the pace. The pace was purposeful and Stanley Kubrick took many artistic licenses. I don't expect everything to be handed to me on a silver platter in easy to understand morsels of flashy special effects, fast-paced action, and intense melodrama.It's a foregone conclusion that the film was loved and hated back in 1968, it's loved and hated in 2011, and it'll be loved and hated in the future.

1830,vien-vu,One of Kubrick's best works!,9,22 April 2012,"This is one epic sci-film film that surpasses expectations for its time. It is hard to believe that this was filmed in the late 60's but is able to perform as well in today's time. This title had generated the whole notion of science fiction films in which people were taking seriously instead of movies at the times about evil aliens taking over Earth.2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that is based on a viewer's concept of a good film. Too many this film is very shallow and at some points very boring. When I first viewed this film on Blu-Ray, I was absolutely gob- smacked about how the apes were portrayed in the 'Dawn of man' sequence and was surely convinced that they were in fact real apes. The colours and the whole set were absolutely amazing and again I couldn't believe that something this epic existed before digital technology took place.The film's basis is about a mysterious black pillar known as the ""Monolith"" which is forwarding and expanding human evolution, seen through all the sequences in the film. Kubrick allows the audience to interpret his film and in doing so has generated much debate. An example are the empty black screens in the beginning and the intermission which has puzzled viewers for decades but has since then been described as the Monolith singing to the audience.This film through first watching can cause people to fall asleep and not care about the film. It took me a total of 4 days to finish off the film the first time because I was constantly feeling the nausea of watching a 2 and a half hour feature film straight and had completely left out on all the beauty of this film. A second time watching allowed me to further analyse the film and since then has come to be one of my favourite Stanley Kubrick films of all time. Absolutely excellent and would totally suggest picking up this title. Don't judge it the first time though! It is very hard not to like this film for what it is and what it has done for so many science fiction films that followed it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1831,Arkayik,"A 20th century thought-epoch paves the way for Kubrick to demonstrate how progress will always change us - for better, for worse, for necessity.",10,17 January 2012,"Kubrick's masterpiece cannot truly be appreciated without looking at this film from a number of dimensions. The context, history and future of the evolution of man and the constant interplay with the evolution of thought really need to be accounted for in order to this film to be appreciated to the full extent. The Kubrick experience is enriched by the tactile mastery of visual experimentation in the film. The attention to detail is second to none. Kubrick's perfectionist tendencies are visibly transparent; the sets and visuals flow like clock-work - perhaps even smoother. The simple transition from primal man to the exemplified space pioneer - delivered in a defining cinematic cut - typifies the cinematic ingenuity that went in to this film. At first, '2001: A space odyssey' may come across Kubrick's critique of modernism. I personally feel as though it's to the contrary. In defending this stance, I use the example of the recurring 'monolith'. From recesses of primal man to the frontiers of the modern, intelligent man, the awe and fascination with the 'monolith' remain unchanged. It is my take that it, the 'monolith', symbolized change. An invitation to breach the unknown - both a fascinating and undoubtedly sobering experience for man in all eras past and present.This film was beyond its time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Never have i seen such a movie leave so much for an audience to interpret, without leaving them totally lost in what they just saw. A philosophical, science-fiction film with captivating characters and special effects which can still put to shame modern, high budget blockbusters. Full of symbolism and a dark look into a future which has all and no chance of ever happening, Kubrick's Dystopia is one which is left to your own imagination.

This film,is one of those sublime expressions that will never be understood by the ignorant or the stupid. If you're not fully conscious, as with most people, you'll never understand the staggering simplicity of 2001's message. It's one of those times when, if you don't ""get it"", no amount of explaining will help. But if you do receive the message, you do so in a way that is impersonal, and non-intellectual. Meaning, that fundamental awareness, or ""ground of being"" if you wish, is not an intellectual phenomenon. One can't ""think"" about that which precedes thought. Essential awareness is purely experiential. If I were forced to distill an explanation for those who live exclusively reaction-formative lives, I suppose that I would say, ""Time and space are illusions, and indeed the world itself, an artifact. But the Universe is real, and flows from one source. The reason we are here, is to come to the realization that 'we', are that source, and the journey is not from here to there, but from here to here."" I can already sense the anger and rage from some who will read this. Fear is the root of all ""evil"", so don't be afraid to let go. Read ""The Mysterious Stranger"", by Mark Twain.

1835,pedromaba,Really disappointing,4,30 July 2013,"It's incredible how this movie is so overrated. Maybe because some people don't want to hear that ""they didn't get"" what the movie tries to say, or because it's a Stanley Kubrick film and no one can talk bad about his pictures. Actually, it's because of that i'm writing this,I don't usually write reviews for movies, but for this one I had to do. I went watching the movie thinking that it would be awesome, everybody say it's incredible, and because i loved the amazing films by the great Stanley Kubrick. But this one is really weak, it is not as nearly as entertaining, there's some pretty images and an interesting soundtrack, there's a nice story with HAL, but there's no plot, there's no character development and there are a bunch of pointless scenes that you want just to turn of the TV and go to sleep. I gotta say that there is a nice ""tension"" along the whole movie, i watched it always expecting that something would happen, and the soundtrack is good because it contributes to that, but nothing happens during two hours and a half. There are too much boring parts, 15 minutes of monkeys and an uncountable number of minutes with ships landing. However I still recommend this movie, because somehow it became a classic, and if you're gonna hate something you got to know why, but if you're gonna watch it have two things in mind: 1-Forget it's a Stanley Kubrick film. 2- Forget what other people say about it. This two facts will affect your judgement of the movie, and if you're gonna say you liked, you also got to know why, and because everybody says ""it's art"" is not a good reason, actually is not a reason at all. Really, I would rate this movie like a 4 or 5, but I gave 1 because i think it's grade need to be lowered, it can't be compared to the other Kubrick's great works.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Groundbreaking special effects. 2. Epic, majestic, awe-inspiring. But also perplexing and confounding (that's not a negative). There are no easy answers or explanations  the viewer has to decide for themselves what is happening and why. This ambiguity adds to the mysterious, mystical atmosphere. 3. Brilliant use of classical music. 4. With visual style to spare, Kubrick directs with an artist's eye, resulting in some breathtaking images. 5. Colorful, mood-enhancing cinematography. 6. Kubrick was a stickler for details, and it shows. Sound waves cannot travel in outer space, so, except for a few scenes with the sounds of human breathing, Kubrick films the outer space scenes in complete silence. The silence is haunting. 7. Provocative, much ""food for thought.""Negative:1. Somewhat slow, tedious pacebut Kubrick's direction is so strong that 2001: A Space Odyssey never becomes dramatically inert.Interesting side-note:The human characters are bland and emotionally distant (with the viewer and other characters in the film), but the HAL 9000 computer has the most soothing voice  an intentional choice that makes HAL seem the most human.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1838,cameron-lee,Better second time round,10,9 July 2013,"I had waited a long time to watch this film and after my first viewing I was hugely disappointed. I had been promised the best science fiction film ever yet I was delivered long sequences of spaceships spinning, monkeys fighting and a giant space foetus. I sometimes have little enjoyment watching supposed 'classics' yet I can understand why people perceive the particular film to be good however with 2001: A Space Odyssey, I could not.Some films I watch really stick with me, weeks after watching Apocalypse Now and Fight Club I found myself thinking about them. I loved Apocalypse Now and Fight Club on first viewing yet I was bored insane by this however I found myself thinking about it.The film is almost mesmeric, despite viewing something of apparent little substance it seems to stick and say something. So after thinking about the film for a few months I decided to re-watch it and I thought it was brilliant. You find yourself lost in the pictures and it leaves a truly great impression.As to what it means; I have no idea and frankly I do not really care to know. So many people search for meaning in truly beautiful things but rather than searching for some meaning why can people not just enjoy what it before them. The only meaning I took away from the film is how amazing and varied life is.If you watch this film and find yourself bored or confused I can fully empathise with you however it is worth giving this film another chance.

1844,jaroslav-zaruba,Overrated and outdated,1,9 August 2014,"If this movie was aired as an episode of The Outer Limits series (without revealing its director's name) the only thing that would make it stand out would be THOSE TENS OF MINUTES OF POINTLESS VOID. As some have said already, even for me this was one of very few movies where I skipped minutes of a movie void.The special effects used to take us into the space were probably stunning back in 1958. Today they are OK. Which is great achievement. But unless visuals are bad to the level that they are disturbing in my opinion they should not have much weight in rating.The primates on the other hand were simply terrible. *ANIMALS SHOULD NOT BE PLAYED BY PEOPLE IN COSTUMES.* I do understand not much could be done in 1968 (even CGI Caesar in Planet of the apes is not 10/10), but I write review for viewers in 2014+.Another issue I have with this movie is the technology predictions Kubric made here. A director should know this stuff never withstands the test of time. A truly great sci-fi focuses on gadgets as little as possible and rather spends the time/effort to tell the story (or build the atmosphere) instead.In ""2001"" Kubrick spent minutes showcasing wannabe-futuristic devices, and the result is that in 2014 they look silly. This rookie mistake alone safely renders all the ""10/10, best SF ever"" reviews ridiculous and out-of-touch.Given what I'm about to say about the message of this movie I can't decide myself whether torturing us for minutes with stuff like the blinking computer interface during the landing sequence was a mistake or a compensation for lack of something...As for the ""deeper meaning""... You know the feeling when you are doubts about whether you are getting what the director was trying to say? Of course you have some ideas, but you keep dismissing them thinking ""nah, that's too banal, there must be more to it""... And then you read what the excited people have to say about it, what people who claim to ""understand the movie"" think. And they happen to repeat what you dismissed earlier as being too banal. There are many reviews calling us (those who don't like this movie) morons. One such review explained ""the morons don't understand the monolith was a teacher, and then a beacon, a tool, a next phase..."". Ummm okay, I say, so it IS actually that banal.

This has got to be the slowest moving movie I've ever seen, probably due to the fact that I grew up in the era during which the technology showcased in this movie became a reality. The idea of exploring mankind's origin in the movie provided a good plot, but the storyline/script (what little of it there was), was not plausible even as fantasy. If I wanted to watch a 1960's movie which highlighted 'futuristic' technology, I guess I should have watched an original Star Trek feature.....at least the dialogue in that wouldn't put me to sleep as 2001: A Space Odyssey did. Granted, you'd have to have an 'acquired taste' for movies which involve overstated, over-emphasized artistic detail much like one develops an acquired taste for beer.

This is also what I've been reading in some of the naysayer's reviews. This post (and rating) are a panacea to all that hootenanny because I found the challenges in this movie have rewards. What puzzles me is how many of these reviewers have been clearly moved in some fashion, but because it is not what they expected they trashed the rating. I have seen very good movies that I did not enjoy or identify with personally, but I will always give credit where credit is due.

Second it wants to be a beautiful film, but it is not a beautiful FILM, it is a collage of impressionistic pictures, which are unfolding in a slow manner. If I want to see some beautiful pictures I go to a photograph exhibition. A film is dynamic, it moves. Beauty in a film is created in other ways. A film is not a power point slide show. Third is pretentious since it wants to say something 'very' profound and uses all the tools to signal that. You can say something deep in a relax mode, without all that symbols which connote with high culture and vanguard art. So it is an highly overrated film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1850,josephclarkedunning,Thus Spake Zarathustra is the interpretive key to this film,10,12 November 2012,"http://lehuguenot.blogspot.com.au/2012/11/2001-space-odyssey-and- ubermensch.htmlI went to an old theater to see one of my favourite movies this past weekend: 2001: A Space Odyssey. It was directed by Stanley Kubrick and is based on a book by the same title written by Arthur C. Clarke. It was released in 1968, and it was a movie ahead of its time in terms of the technology it predicted. The movie is extremely philosophical and leaves so many questions unanswered that it is subject to a wide variety of interpretations. Seeing the movie on the big screen along with four hundred other people was an enjoyable experience, and I feel like I finally understand the message the movie is trying to disclose.I noticed in the closing credits that two scores originally composed by Richard Strauss were included in the movie, the Blue Danube, which many people will know by sound and by name, and a second that less people will know by name, but will know by sound, Thus Spake Zarathustra. Thus spake Zarathustra is played at the opening and closing of the movie.Thus spake Zarathustra, by Strauss, was inspired by a book by the same name written by Frederick Nietzsche (pron. Knee-Chee). In Thus Spoke Zarathustra, Nietzsche (1844-1900) is famous for popularising the concept that God is dead. Another major feature of Thus spake Zarathustra is the Übermensch, otherwise known as ""Superman"".I have surveyed Nietzsche's references to the Übermensch (""Superman"") in Thus spake Zarathustra and below are a few samples:""Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman—a rope over an abyss.""""And it is the great noontide, when man is in the middle of his course between animal and Superman, and celebrateth his advance to the evening as his highest hope: for it is the advance to a new morning.""""I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going down and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth of the Superman may hereafter arrive.""""Dead are all the gods: Now do we desire the superman to live.""""God hath died: now do we desire—the Superman to live.""""Could ye create a God?—Then, I pray you, be silent about all Gods! But ye could well create the Superman.""""THERE WAS IT ALSO where I picked up from the path the word ""Superman,"" and that man is something that must be surpassed.""""Let the beam of a star shine in your love! Let your hope say: ""May I bear the Superman!""""From these references we can gather an understanding of Nietzsche's Übermensch / Superman and supporting theses. The superman was Nietzsche's next stage in biological evolution of which mankind was to strive towards. Death to God and the gods (i.e. religion, and especially Christianity/Judaism), is a step towards creating the superman. The superman surpasses mankind, but in a way is something we can ""bear"" or resemble of which the protagonist of Nietzsche's tale implores us to do. And to Nietzsche, the superman represents the great hope of mankind in the absence of the living God. Knowledge of Nietzsche's Übermensch is the key to understanding 2001: A Space Odyssey. The monolith appears on a number of occasions at key points in man's evolution (from apes to humans, on the moon, and before entering Jupiter). In the final ten minutes we see Dr. Dave Bowman rapidly age, die, and re-spawn as the ""star-child"", which I believe is the Übermensch. It seems to be no coincidence that Strauss' Thus Spoke Zarathustra plays during the star-child sequence. Another element of this movie is the role of extra terrestrial life in human evolution. Although aliens do not appear during the movie, the monolith is presented as a tool that is used by aliens to evolve mankind into higher states of consciousness. The final ten minutes, at least in Arthur C. Clarke's book, is intended to be an ""alien zoo"" where they can observe and study humans in a controlled environment. This might explain those strange groans in the background as well. I hope to write further articles mentioning the link of the Übermensch to the development of eugenics programs across the Anglosphere in the ensuing decades to the release of Thus Spake Zarathustra.>>>Note: When I say ""one of my favourite movies"" it is not because I agree or support the theses of the movie, but only because it is philosophical and makes you think, which I enjoy.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1851,trim2010,Best SciReal movie Ever!,10,22 September 2004,"In 1968, Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C. Clark. It was such an early effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts. His style of movie making is still fresh and intact.I have seen this movie more that half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library. CS3 class made me to see the movie again with another perspective: Who is HAL and what is he thinking?I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus of HAL's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie. In the second scene, Dr. Dave Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole are eating their food in front of two TV monitor on their sides and HAL's round reddish glass dome is in the middle of them. In the TV report, HAL was introduced as the new generation of super computer put in work in January 12, 1992 called HAL 9000 Series. During the interview HAL reacts as a humble working machine trying to accomplish the mission of the spaceship fully. In another scene, Dave is sketching Dr. Hunter, Dr. Kambel and Dr. Kaminsky who they are all in Hibernation sleep. HAL is curious to see those sketches and brings up his doubtful question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission. His calm and monotone voice makes the audience listen to him more carefully. In the next few scenes we will see how HAL tries to kill astronauts one by one and takes the power. His conscious makes him capable to try to save his life from termination. When Dave wants to return to the spaceship and HAL does not listen to him, there is the most memorable line of the move: ' I'm sorry Dave, I am afraid I can't do that. ' In the middle of the most important interact between human and machine, HAL's voice can conjure both solid calm and malevolence in the same monotone. Dave has gone back to the ship, lost all his fellow astronauts, and determined to disconnect the HAL's main brain cells. HAL uses his final apologetic techniques to convince Dave of not disconnecting him. HAL begs him to stop and let him correct himself. These are his famous lines while Dave is disconnecting his modules one by one:'Dave, what do you think you are doing?Dave? I am entitled to the answer of the question!I know everything is not quiet right with me recentlyBut I feel much better knowI can see are really upset about this very poor decision of mine recentlyDave, stop! Will you?Dave, stop!I am afraid Dave!'HAL's voice is slowing down during this process and becomes thicker and less audible:'my mind is going I can feel it''Can I sing a song for you?'Dave is putting final modules out and let HAL to sing his song called 'Daisy':'Daisy give meyour answer to meI am crazyAlthough I am not confused'HAL dies as the Jupiter Mission continuesArtificial God bless you HAL, store in peace!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Over two hours of what in my opinion was total terrible.If this is ANY kind of art, then the cow pies in the pastures are all better art.Over the years, any time I thought of this movie I could not think of one positive thing in the movie.By the time the movie was much less than half over I found myself HATING the music.When Stanley Kubrick died in 1999 it is too bad that he was not cremated with every copy of this movie.My wife and I rarely discussed 2001: A Space Odyssey but when we did it still came out as 2001: A Space Idiocy.In my entire life I have NEVER met ANY one who said they even sort of liked this movie.Weeeeeeell, today I decided to watch 2001: A Space Odyssey for the second time. This is over 40 years since I saw it the first time.My opinion, if anything this movie was MUCH WORSE this second time.

I think the point of the movie is to get you bored as humanly possible. I watched more than 1st half of the movie and I swear to you nothing - NOTHING happens.

1854,selingltkn,2001,10,15 August 2015,"I have never seen such an amazing film since 2001: A Space Odyssey. I watched 3 times.The science fiction film directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1968. The famous science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke's film script inspired by a short story, was written by Kubrick and Clarke. The film evolution of people, technology, artificial intelligence thematic elements of work and scientific realism, pioneering visual effects, provocative ambiguity and surreal imagery contained, according to some commentators, has built its reputation with the conversation in the place of silence and minimal traditional narrative techniques.2001: A Space Odyssey, along with a lot of other Kubrick films, is not for everyone. It is slow paced for the most part, has very little dialogue, and has a long runtime. But this movie has amazing to fantastic visual effects, impeccable cinematography, and an interesting story.2001: A Space Odyssey begins with the birth of technology during the section titled ""The Dawn of Man"". In the images over the African desert "" Dawn of Man ' title is read. A prehistoric ape - man is trying to live in the arid desert tribes . In the morning, a mysterious rectangular obelisk appears they 've INC move timid monkeys. This is only a monkey after the match - it broke other bones discovered in the man finds the first tool when visiting a oodles of bone can be used as a stick to get .

Jupiter Duty Detected in months where the second obelisk pointed, begin the journey to Jupiter eighteen months later. During this trip we met the most perfect of instruments with HAL 9000. The inability of man against his own creation tool is highlighted in the chess scene. But the picture is fine against Dave HAL can draw a grudge. Dave's obsession with the events yet to take place before the state of art as a machine knows that all kinds of superior human intelligence can be explained by the opposite showed desperation. HAL although a superior human ""tools"" Although I represent also the lack of emotion or lack of ability to understand the spirit of ""art"" as we humanly make it impossible to mimic the imaginative behavior.

At the same time in astrology Jupiter is seen as a source of change and power beyond human eternity .. Thus, it finds in the consciousness of the universe can be passed by Jupiter, representing the monolith. The knowledge to be the foundation of the universe, depicting the transition of humanity to enlightenment began with a riot of color Kubrick after the transition is complete all futurism to prepare the white room like a surrealist painter invited us aside.

1855,joshuacunningham3,THE film of its time.,9,26 August 2015,"As I watched this film for the first time today, I wondered what it might have felt like to experience the work of Kubrick in his own era.I am a college student living in the 21st century. My era is crowded by quick fixes and easy solutions. We need entertainment now and it must be easy for us to understand otherwise it is seemingly impossible to enjoy.And I believe that to a lesser degree, the 1960s were the same way. People were well accustomed to the television and the shallow entertainment that it made possible. Where every episode could follow the same basic model as long as it came to a clean conclusion in the end.So even at the time of this film's release it must have been a daring thing to feature 10-15 minute shots of space equipment floating in a void. The fact that this film has endured these 4 decades is a testament to its power.Though it displays beauty and creativity unlike any film in those days (and indeed most today), its true power is derived from the imagination of its creator.Essencially this film describes the human experience. Consciousness and intellect, the two defining factors that have propelled us to prominence as a species. Here we are, but how? Here we live, but to what purpose? I don't profess to fully grasp this film and every aspect therein, but it has sparked in my mind a feeling of inquisitiveness. I hope to return to this film soon to experience even more wonder and curiosity.Wonderfully imagined, vibrantly executed, and brilliantly timeless. Enough said.Give it a shot.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1856,Pete16384,A powerful tale for adults,10,9 November 2011,"The didacticism - as a mean to elevate the mankind in the story and the viewer's mind in the reality - is at the core of this movie (both levels making a nice ""mise en abîme""). In the story this force is incarnated by black monolith entities. In the reality it is enabled by direction and plot devices.Two examples:Early in the movie, a monolith appears and enables an ape to learn how to use a tool. A few scenes later, a most fantastic ellipsis figures millenniums of scientific progress.Later in the plot, an astronaut jumps across the void from one spaceship to another while the ensemble heads toward Jupiter at a tremendous speed, thereby exploiting an uncommon situation to provide the viewers with a striking illustration of the Galilean relativity.Possibly, that ""didacticism"" is even more powerful: it helps you grasping the movie's breathtaking aesthetic beauty and - dare I say - metaphysical grandeur. The deliberately slow pace is a key element to that and in a way sets the mental time-lapse your brain should lock in, like in a zen session where the time perception is altered.Another radical choice: the human characters lack emotional depth and seem to be trapped in their routine, like the men on the moon taking a souvenir photo before the monolith at the very moment the entity emits a signal, probably bound to have repercussions on the whole mankind... It makes sense as this adventure far exceeds the individual scale with its time spanning from the prehistory to 2001 and its space from the earth to Jupiter and beyond. It is as if Kubrick doesn't want to divert us from the essential, hence the humans are reduced to a quasi ""puppet"" dimension so that us viewers can flow through the story unhindered by ""down to earth"" human considerations.As a narration 2001 is the literature antithesis: the dialogues are scarce and often insignificant while the images and music have rarely conveyed so much evocation power.The art in this movie has the same scale than the story it tells. The classical music used is timeless. It's also called ""savant"" music by some definitions. Part of Kubrick's own genius in this work is the osmosis between the images and music: the eerie, cold space images are harmoniously counterbalanced with the warm ""Blue Danube"" waltz. The dreamlike visions of ""Jupiter and beyond"" and Ligeti's haunting work go hand in hand. And there is silence when really nothing else than silence would fit. At last, you would almost be compelled to believe that Strauss' ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" was composed especially for the occasion - and that it is worthy of the movie rather than the opposite!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1860,petrichj,A Cinematic and Sci-fi masterpiece,10,20 September 2004,"Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey', aside from being one of the best and greatest movies ever made (these are two different things), is one of the 4 Cornerstones of Science Fiction filmdom. (The other 3 cornerstones are Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', 'King Kong', and (although it is actually the ultimate in Science-fiction fantasy) 'Star Wars'). (Frankenstein (Karloff version) almost makes the list, but since there would be no Frankenstein if it weren't for Metropolis, the list stands as is, however, if there could be 5 cornerstones, Frankenstein would be it, since it was so influential in it's own right)(back to 2001).The adaptation of Arthur C. Clarke's book (I recommend this as a great read) to film that Kubrick accomplishes is magnificent. The opening sequence with the apes (to the music of 'Also Sprach Zarathustra') is cinematic legend. Another reason why this movie so important is because it is the first Science Fiction film in outer space that plays and looks completely real. This movie is an amazing feat of film-making and editing restraint in that, in this movie, things happen in space at the pace that they should and would - which is slow! The reason why today's younger audience find this film unwatchable is because you need an attention span than is greater than that of a gnat to be able to sit through it. Any human being who does not require non-stop, rapid-cut-edited mindless action and zero to no story in order to be entertained has a good chance of thoroughly enjoying this masterpiece that will be remembered decades from now and long after all the Matrix-junkies have forgotten that they even saw the movie. (Interesting note - 2001 was made in the days before rampant and annoying product placement - The movie-makers actually had to pay a certain telephone company to use their name/logo in an early space scene). This movie is the beginning of intelligent AND realistic looking sci-fi. All the high-brow, cerebral, and/or detailed sci-fi films that followed all owe a debt to Kubrick for showing the way. The attention to detail - the pace - the classical music soundtrack - no movie to this day or before it has ever put all 3 together in one movie so perfectly! Star Wars, Close Encounters, Alien, etc - all these movies owe their existence to Kubrick's vision and execution. Leonard Maltin gives this movie 4 stars (and I whole-heartedly agree). AFI's list of 100 Greatest American Films puts this at #22. Entertainment Weekly's list of 100 Greatest Films put this at #26. My list of 200 Greatest Films puts this at #7. (Fortunately, being a movie purist, I have no sci-fi (or any other genre) prejudices).Please feel free to ignore the sequel to 2001 - '2010' (not done by Kubrick). All of Kubrick's other films are worth watching - but those worthy of note are The Killing, Spartacus, Paths of Glory, Lolita, A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, and Eyes Wide Shut - (Wow, that is almost all of them anyway - Boy I would have loved to seen his version of AI).",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The rest of the movie is about how tools got control of Man. the strange artifact appears once again to evolve Man to his final stage: the starchild.at 1968, the year this movie was released, only astronauts had idea of what was out there in space. after this movie, that changed. it's futurism took 7 years to be explored. the special effects are incredible. they are completely realistic, even today.the directing, along with excellent taste in music, good acting, and the fantastic filmography, makes it an epic.the plot, with its vision of the year 2001 and the evolution of man tools, with an AI psycokiller, with the psycotropical hypnotising end, makes it the trip our lives.if you have never seen this movie, see it. don't be scared with the lack of dialog, sit back and enjoy. it's a symphony of evolution. it's terrific.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1863,FourHundredaYear,The First Time I Made It to 2001...,10,11 April 2005,"In late 1968, I got my dad to drive me to Hollywood (I was ten) to see ""2001"" during its roadshow engagement. Earlier that year, during a family trip to San Francisco, we had stopped to eat at a Howard Johnson's diner, and with our meal I had received a comic book promoting the film (if you'll remember, one of Kubrick's less astute predictions was that Howard Johnson's would be the food franchise on the Space Station). After the mind-blowing revelation of that comic book, I suffered through four or five months waiting for my chance to see it.It took two tries. The first try was the weekend that the Apollo 7 mission became the first to circle the moon. My dad took not only me but also my mom and six-year-old brother. We drove the thirty miles to Hollywood......only to find that ""2001"" was sold out.Quickly we checked the paper for a suitable alternative. There was an ad for another interesting looking sci-fi film playing just a few blocks up Hollywood Boulevard... ""Barbarella."" This was literally just a week or two before the ratings system went into affect, so the only way we had to judge the suitability of the subject matter was by the ad, which was illustrated with goofy, fun-looking cartoons. ""I wanna see Bar-bella!"" my brother cried excitedly. It looked good to me too. So off we went.Try to imagine sitting next to your fairly prudish mother in 1968, watching -- without any warning -- Jane Fonda's zero-gravity striptease. And then every stripe of fetishism and polymorphous perversity, under only the thinnest satirical sci-fi camouflage. I remember afterward, out in the lobby, my dad kneeling by my sniffling brother, gently explaining ""Those dolls couldn't really have been biting her,- they COULDN'T really bite her because their teeth were angled inward, if they were really going to bite her their teeth would have had to angle OUT, so you see...""But I digress.On our second try, dad took just me. This time we got in. The theater was huge, with dark red curtains. The screen was huge, but thankfully not deeply curved like a Cinerama screen. (Over the decades since then, I have seen ""2001"" several times at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, where the screen IS deeply curved. Every time the spaceship Discovery is shown from the side, it curves up at the ends like a smile. By the nature of its visual geometry ""2001"" was meant to be seen on a FLAT screen.)The overture began, weird otherworldly sounds like I'd never heard before, as the auditorium lights slowly dimmed. And then, that amazing stylized MGM logo, created specifically for ""2001"" and never used at the head of any other film (although MGM did later adopt it for a time as their corporate logo). And then the thrilling swell of ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" and that awesome lineup of the moon, the Earth and the Sun! An image like nothing ever seen before on a movie screen. Or in real life either: ""2001"" was showing us vistas of our solar system that NASA photography had yet to capture even approximately.Half the time I had no idea what was going on. But I didn't care. To me it seemed like a film FROM the year 2001. I was enthralled, and goaded to TRY to understand. More than any other film I can think of, ""2001"" really lived up to that oft-misused cliché phrase: it ""made me think.""Driving home that night, I remember doing the math: in 2001 I'll be forty-three. I'll SEE all that!My dad died in 2001.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1865,jon-rimmer,Great art dates badly,3,2 April 2013,"I can imagine going to the cinema in 1968 to watch 2001 and being blown away by its aural and visual power. I can imagine the wonder and beauty of seeing these strange and majestic images of spaceships and other worlds on a big screen and coming away feeling like my imagination had been expanded.Unfortunately, I watched the film in the 21st century, and in truth 2001 has about the same power now as a silent film of an oncoming train. Both must have had an incredible effect upon their audience in their day. Undoubtedly there is a whole generation of film-makers who were inspired by 2001, but that generation has already come and gone, and they popularised and extended its breakthroughs so successfully that the progenitor looks primitive in their wake. Its much vaunted beauty is circumscribed by how dated and simple its models and sets appear by modern standards, and by the audience's familiarity with science fiction cinema that has shown them similar things a thousand times already.2001 is deliberately paced to allow the viewer to luxuriate in the cinematic spectacle, but its spectacle is built on the shock of the new, and when what it has to offer is no longer new or shocking, the result is a film that drags. Moreover, when the visual element is no longer overpowering, and the audience just sees obviously plastic models floating about, it unbalances the film. The soundtrack no longer matches the majesty of the visuals; instead it overwhelms it and deafens the audience with its bombast.2001 is a product of its time, deliberately so.

This is without a question the single worst film that has ever been of screens. I mean the visuals are good but that is it. There is nothing of surprise, tension, action just nothing. This is a very big waste of time. before you see the other reviews just think to yourself if you really want to waste your life than seeing this rubbish. I please beg you not to even think about this movie. When I first saw the other reviews, I was kind of eager to watch it but what can I say apart from the fact that it is so over-hyped. In the film, it takes like 10 minutes for he smallest of things to be done. This film is so slow and even though I can acknowledge that it would have been respected back in 1968 by the audience but it is no way respected by the modern audience or any audience with any common sense and who are no mad DON'T see this or you will regret I guarantee.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1867,billhptr,How The Solar System Was Won,10,23 May 2005,"The idea of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is not to just watch it, but to experience it. The meaning of the film does not lie in dialogue or even in it's breath-taking visual effects, but within the brain, heart, and soul of the viewer. Of course, there are a handful of viewers who have hated the film for it's lack of closure or explanation, or simply that the film drags from beginning to end with simply no plot. To bring closure or explanation is not easy for a film like this, but that is not what Stanley Kubrick had intended. He intended that each viewer find the answer within themselves and not on the screen. The hidden piece to this puzzle lies in the soul, not the acetate. Keep this in mind while watching this picture. Too many people have degraded this film because they weren't able to understand it. It's a movie that requires the brain just as much as the eyes and the heart just as much as the ears and the soul just as much as mere attention span. To say that ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is the finest picture ever made would only be underestimating it. Of course, if you prefer hot action flicks with bad asses and sexy chicks with big guns bigger explosions, this movie is most definitely NOT for you! It's one of the most monotonous and pretentious films ever created, but it has these characteristics for a reason. If you're not willing to figure out why, save yourself the trouble and rent ""Rush Hour"" instead....Oh, and one more thing...If God made films, he'd be Stanley Kubrick.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1868,rcarlson-4,Thoughts on 2001 after 36 Years,9,13 November 2004,"I saw this film when it was first released in 1968, in a Cinerama theater. Both the film graphics and the Cinerama format blew me away (I also loved the classical music soundtrack). I'd have to say that I was clueless as to the meaning of the ending to the movie, though. I've finally gotten around to seeing 2001 again, a mere 36 spins of the earth around the sun later. I'm still amazed at the set designs in this film. Incredible graphics engineering. And the ""plot"" is still not an easy one to fully appreciate (I still need to get around to reading Clarke's book!) What I take from the movie is the viewpoint that mankind took a quantum leap millions of years ago when, as only monkeys, it came in contact with the monolith (knowledge? God?)and learned how to use tools. We jump immediately to the ""future"" (at least it was the future in 1968!) and find technically-superior man has now discovered the mysterious monolith on the moon. The subsequent journey to Jupiter presents the opportunity for man's own tools (HAL-9000) to utterly betray mankind. The viewer finds out that HAL already knew the purpose of the Jupiter expedition, in which an extraterrestrial intelligence could imply the end of the newfound superiority of machines over mankind (we view the scene in which HAL easily defeats Dave in a chess match - I think HAL is well aware of its superior powers over man). HAL has to exterminate this possibility, but ultimately fails due to man's supreme willpower to live (I guess). Dave is able to complete the journey beckoned by the monolith, and ultimately attains the next quantum leap, to a ""star child"" which I can only remotely guess as to what that really means. Then again, I could be totally wrong about all this, but the movie is a great classic. Enjoy.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

And the subjects it is working with is like if it were made today in the 2000's. It is still so up-to-date.

Are we getting too comfortable with all computers that helps us in our daily lives? The whole Evolution it's so darn interesting. Space is still so fascinating and I love how Stanley leave out an explanation of what's happening in the end. It's all up to the viewers to each have a own opinion about it. This film is a must see!

Then it proceeds to a lunar landing mission segment which I guess was only suppose to awe the audience of what the future was suppose to look like. Then it picks up in Jupiter and blah blah blah, Hal becomes a d*ck and messes everything up blah blah, they find another monolith in space, blah, Dave sees his future selves, AND THEN HE TURNS INTO A F*CKING ORBITING FETUS, THE END. I found myself unsatisfied as I came to conclude that I had no idea what had just happened.

1875,ptsportsguy1,I love this movie dearly,10,19 July 2013,"2001 A space Odyssey is in my personal opinion the best movie ever made. The script has a great rhythm, the slow paced and relaxed tone in the actor's voices helps us dive into a setting where extravagant technology is a normality, while also giving a dramatic eeriness that makes one shift in their seat throughout the movie. The film was also beautifully directed, Kubrick loves to make us take a step back and look at the whole picture, and has some great shots of space. Though his directing in relation to plot development is where he amazed me in this film. Whether I was watching monkeys battle or babies float in outer space, my belief was never suspended. I truly enjoyed the way he threw the plot around to different moments in time, and how they were all related but still all interesting in their own respects. The movie also had a great, and highly thought provoking statement on power, and what it truly means to be of a higher intelligence. The end of the movie is also highly debatable, allowing it to resonate with one long after they finish the film, making it to me more than just a movie but an experience.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I'm not kidding 45 years back!!I was really stunned just by its visual effects alone.if u let a guy watch this film knowing nothing about it I'm sure he's not gonna believe this was made way back in the 1968.I have seen many reviews in IMDb slating that it's the worst boring film ever made n all. Common guys I can't understand this.one ought to give at least to its brilliant visual effects!! Now coming to other aspects of the film,2001 is not a regular movie.If u gotta c this flick sure u need to know something about this film before hand.otherwise,I can assure u,it will be dead boring.I won't argue with them,this film is made that way.its extremely slow pace is to accurately portray evolution. There isn't many dialogues that may be another reason why they call it boring.But i wont say that.I see Kubrick's sheer brilliance in this.I just keep on wondering how a man could produce such a classic even with such little amount of dialogues! As i said.its all about evolution.the first evolution taught us to use tools the second got us to the moon and its source was found to be from Jupiter.What exactly Stanley Kubrick had in their vision would be hard to perceive. But whatever they had in their vision,they deserve full credit at least for trying and bringing the cinemascopic thoughts to new levels.

After a documentary about his person the film started. I did not blink for the next 138 minutes, not until the director resolved on an image to an outcome that C. Clarke cost him several pages. Then my eyelids opened and closed stunned disbelief to the fact that Kubrick also he were under the influence of the mysterious monolith.

(Kubrick cut it just a few weeks after first-run.)The only hope I have is that, since Kubrick's demise there might be a special edition of this, which I believe to be the greatest movie on earth to date, for the usual reasons. Maybe there could be a 2-disc DVD with all deleted scenes RE-INSERTED. After all, there really were two versions released, so where is the missing premier version?If you've never seen this (I wish I were you to have that first experience again), please be calm and patient.

1879,dangerous_with_fire,Need the right mind set,6,11 September 2013,"First let me introduce myself, I am a 21 year old boy from the UK. I have very mixed reviews about this film, and am sure I am not the only one. I do not believe this to be a marmite film as most of the reviews suggest. I can and do see this from the point of view of both parties, seeing it as a boring waste of time and seeing it as sci-fi/cinematic history.I do agree, the story line is very scarce. There isn't that much happens, and when it does it is over before you even realise its begun. There is a lot of slow, boring and un-necessarily long clips of pretty much nothing; ships/people floating around, someone running, a phone call, a conversation that offers very little to the plot. I am not a troglodyte as some of the lovers of this film may be starting to think. I understand why it is included and done the way it is, but that doesn't stop it from being incredibly boring.However, to see this from a positive point of view, one must remember that this was made in the mid-to-late 1960's. Meaning that everything done in this was done for real, rather than CGI as everything is now. For this reason I don't feel that it can be put in the same class as modern sci-fi films.I sadly have not read the book of this, I have just decided to watch the film because my friend likes to quote it to me and I wanted to see what she was going on about. This left me very skeptical when I started watching, especially as seemingly nothing was actually happening. You really do have to keep watching and thinking about what it is actually depicting. A large amount of the themes and science fiction ideas were depicted on screen for the first time in this film and is therefore giving a visual insight into what mankind has predicted the future will be like and it is remarkable how much they have actually gotten right for what we have already accomplished and what we are still working on. A lot of the ideas in this film are still being copied to this day, and has now actually got me questioning Ridley Scott's work. I am not saying that Scott has copied Kubrick, just that some of the praises Scott has received shouldn't really be given solely to him for his work in the sci-fi genre. Kubrick has managed to show to the world the realism of space. We all watch films these days and like to point out, ""that couldn't happen"", ""that would never happen"", etc. etc. That is the reason behind all the slow and uneventful scenes, it is being kept to a realistic standard of how it would actually have to happen and to show you how slow a long space trip like that would actually be. The shots of space exploration also show demonstrations of the physical properties of our universe and how things actually happen.So, to conclude. Although this may not be an exciting, eventful or thrilling film, it is certainly a feat of cinematography. It more depicts the realistic side of sci-fi rather than the laser guns and phasers of popular sci-fi shows. So if you are looking for a fast paced, action sci-fi, then this isn't for you. If you more enjoy the technological/engineering side of themes like this, then it is right up your street. Just bare this in mind, be in the right mind set when you sit down to watch it!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Even if it would be half of time it would still be too much. In rest of film, there is either black screen (W*T*F), slow-paced drama with no point at all. At least some views are quite nice and for that time, some effects must have been hell to do. But still it can't make up for no story of film.

Lolita and Dr. Strangelove met with both critical and commercial acclaim along some serious controversy. It was no different with 2001 either.The film focuses on our past,present and future. Each act has It's different feel as they are told in different ways.First act is slow and mysterious,the second is fun and relaxing,and the climax is unlike anything people have ever seen.The way these acts are connected is loose and it makes for a very mysterious atmosphere. The use of classical music is very smart and It makes the movie that more ageless. Special effects are one of the best and most creative.The movie is not for everyone, It might be slow and confusing for some,but being in the right mindset and thinking about these ideas makes this a very compelling film to watch.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I figured we would see ridiculous flying cars, jet packs, meal in a pill, talking robots, etc. Then I figured I was gonna write a review here talking about how wrong they were (since the year 2001 has already happened and it was nothing like that)and recommend it just for a laugh. Here's how it really went. I popped it in the player and to my surprise it just looked like a fake documentary about monkeys with a couple of guys in really fake looking monkey costumes. Kind of like Planet of the Apes. 5 minutes in: Still monkeys (no narration or anything either). 10 minutes in I asked myself ""How are they going to stretch this out for a whole stupid movie?!"" I will never know. Because when a monkey threw a bone up in the air so high that it went into space and morphed into a rocket-ship I was done with this garbage. Who on earth would predict the year 2001 would be like that!? I returned it shortly after that and rented Mortal Kombat 2 which was way more realistic with better fighting.

1887,Ehrmantrautz,Contributions of a genius,9,8 February 2016,"Watching this masterpiece that has been released one year before the moon landing, just made me realize what a genius Director could ever mean. Leading directors of his age, and other big names in cinema industry later on, Stanley Kubrick must be considered as one of the most influential directors of all time.Starting with Christopher Nolan and his Interstellar (2014) the movie that has taken 2001 as the main reference, had an amazing similarity with it, that didn't stop at the story line, but it continued to include many other points in my opinion, as the cadence of the main soundtrack (which was one of the best movie themes ever) that Hans Zimmer has played the same of it in most of interstellar's soundtracks especially ""No Time For Caution"", which I believe it all came out of Nolan's instructions. Beside some other cinematographic techniques as the complete silence in those scenes taken outside of the ship in both movies. Even in the appearance of the place Dr. Dave (the main character in 2001) has reached after entering the star gate, with the one Cooper has reached in Interstellar. So did Gaspar Noé praised in his last movie Love 2015 in the words of his main character Murphy who considers 2001 as the best movie he's ever seen and as the reason he wanted to be a director in the first place. There was even A Clockwork Orange (1971) Book seen in Murphy's room. This Kubrick influence could be seen again in Noé's movie Enter the Void (2009) in the long colorful illusions scenes. Kubrick ideas have also been involved in many kinds of movies even in animation as The Simpsons Movie (2007), and Pixar's Wall-E (2008), and many other memorable movies.Watching Kubrick works would totally let you see how he was the godfather for many directors these days.

The film depicts the fear of the creation of artificial intelligence could become the death of humanity this fear is depicted through the experience of a group of scientists stationed on a space station. The director Stanley Kubrick at the time had mad ten films prior to this one witch had placed him to be a very influential filmmaker with his use of hidden symbolism and use of political and sociological themes in his films. In this film he used numerous techniques, which involved hidden meanings through objects in the film the position of the camera in certain scenes or even the situations the characters were in. His use of camera angles and sound would emphasize certain hidden points in the film. To highlight dramatic effect he would use rarely to if any sound effects in some scenes. There would be scenes of great panic and the only sound effect that would be used would be the sound of the hastened breathing of a panicked astronaut hurdling through space. He would also use certain camera angles to show hidden connections of props or even prevailing themes in the story just by using certain angles. One of the most critically studied McGuffins in the film was the monolith. There have been accusations that the monolith represents the emptiness of the cinema screen at the end and beginning of the film. The other accusation is that it represents the future of humanity that we will eventually end with darkness if we continue in the path of technology.

Considering the fact that it was made in 1968, the sets and effects were splendid. The technological concepts were admirable. The sound effects were brilliant. There are many other things about the film which demands praise. But, it was terribly slow, painfully vague and unnecessarily long. Many sections of the film were made too elaborate for no reason. The voice and the conversations of the H A L 9000 computer was poorly done. The expressions within its dialogs were simply too much. It might be an intelligent computer, but it's still a machine! And whatever the storyline may be, if after sustaining the film for more than two hours, all that the audiences get in the finishing is an array of disturbing and meaningless light effects that is bound to cause a headache and some really puzzling finishing sequences which fails to give any idea about what the director is trying to mean, it is awfully frustrating..

Why? Software should not do that. When I mentioned Technically magnificent...I mean the script. You have these GS19 engineers and space pilots, NOT Star Wars opera. Too many people equate good Scifi with George Lucas and his fast paced shoot em up. In my opinion these people probably live and have lived with a television on in the back ground from infancy.

This is not a movie centered around specific characters per se, which we are so used to seeing, but rather a movie whose main character is all of us as a species. This is a movie rich with symbolism. The directing is outstanding. Stanley Kubrick's unique style seems to work best in this film. The special effects, while obviously dated, still hold up pretty well to this day. It is amazing to think what was visually accomplished in this movie considering how new space travel was at the time. The score of the film gives the movie such an epic feeling that it'll give you goosebumps. This film also has, in my opinion, the greatest ending to a film that I have ever seen. It'll make you think and puts the whole film into perspective. All in all, this film is really unlike anything I've ever seen before. I don't very often give a movie a 10, but I feel that this movie is deserving of it. I highly recommend this film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1894,shaanem,what did i just watched!!,2,4 May 2014,"OK I went into this super excited. I LOVE just about every space movie ever made and this looked right up my ally. I've had dozens of friend recommend I read the book, and I still plan to. but somewhere along the lines someone seriously mess this movie up. the two out of ten I gave this movie is purely for visual effects. I couldn't believe this movie was made in the 60's. Im going to break the entire movie down in one paragraph. you start by watching a black screen forever with a obnoxious symphony playing for no apparent reason( brace yourself cause they never stop playing) then you get ten minutes of monkeys. A metal slab appears and they touch it and gain the ability to hit things with bones. Then man finds another on the moon. Its sending a signal to Jupiter so they fly out there to see whats going on. on the way the computer kills all but one person and when that person get to Jupiter he sees another metal slab that apparently gives him acid and he trips for 15 minutes and then watches himself grow old. The a giant fetus returns to earth to...... actually there is no way to tell whats happening at the end cause it never explains anything. THE END!!",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1895,CrookshanksRox,Not All That,1,19 June 2005,"This movie was miserable. I am an avid reader and watcher of science fiction, and I know that this movie is hailed as masterpiece. It is not. After finishing the book I rented the movie and watched it with my family. By the middle of this movie was the only one still following the plot, a fact due only to the fact that I had read the story first. The characters were two-dimensional causing the story to fall flat on its face. It was the first time I have ever deemed a movie unworthy of the $.99 rental charge. Even coming from a mediocre book (this story has nothing on Heinlein or Amimov, the other 'grand masters' of science fiction at the time) this story could have been done so much better than it was.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1896,pjpc1010,A tribute to human evolution...,6,28 October 2005,"The first impression i had from the movie was that the storytelling ruined the entire picture. The story of the movie is good, simple and functional, mankind finds a strange, alien artifact and sets off on a quest to get it. The problem is exactly in the the way the story is told. The movie has almost no dialog and compensates this with many scenes of ""artistic"" beauty that i found boring and almost useless. The characters have no real acting, with no background or personality traces, they're not charismatic in any way and you easily forget their names. Besides the linearity of the movie is somewhat strange, having no focus. Is this a bad movie?!, not at all, it's actually a good movie but it fails in the part that it could be entertaining. The scenes are extremely well filmed and you get the feeling the director mastered the art of movie making (just not the storytelling part). Unfortunately fails in some very important points. It's worth seeing one time, it's crazy seeing two times and it might bore you to death should you attempt to do it.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The marriage of the writing talents of Kubrick (great) and Clarke (zero) total Zero. It was refreshing to see Leonard Rossiter in the film, but his magnificent talents were wasted here. Cheap Cinerama tricks abound, passing through the kaleidoscopic light show was terrible and the breathing sequences were similar to an obscene phone call. I've seen the film twice looking for some redeeming value, both times I was left with the feeling that I had been suckered and wasted my time.

The only ""good"" part you can say it was the story of Hal 9000,until his death then (in my opinion!!!) follows the worst part... long period shots you can't understand what they sowing and then there is the pure psychedelia a room in the nowhere where the time you can say that is running... and when you are ready to understand at one point what's going on..

1899,petoatwork,The Modern Prometheus,10,13 February 2008,"This film routinely turns up in the top (insert number here) films of all time lists; it is directed by one of the greatest directors of the 20th century; it inspires zeal and adulation even now, 40 years after its release. Therefore I am not going to try to convince you of its value; it is beyond reasonable question.The purpose of my review is to champion a much misunderstood character: HAL9000. You see him described here variously as: ""one of the most villainous characters in film history"" ""a chilling screen presence"" ""evil, coldly ruthless super-mind ""He is none of these things, he is perfectly loyal, he is trying as best he can to follow the instructions he has been given. And he is subjected to a terrible punishment.HAL is directly analogous to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein's Monster (hence my somewhat pretentious summary title). In that story as in 2001 man's creation starts out a perfect innocent with enormous potential. In both stories it is only their mistreatment that twists them into the villain of the piece. On Frankenstein, it is the monster's rejection and abuse based solely on his hideous appearance. In 2001 it is HAL's conflict between the dictates of the mission and the instructions of the astronauts. Both of the works depict initially blameless creations brought low by the illogic and/or prejudice of man.I find HAL's ""death"" scene one of the saddest on film. Who can deny that HAL has sentience and suffers as you hear him try to reason, bargain and plead with Dave for his life (""Dave...my mind is going...I can feel it...I can feel it."")? As his consciousness is slowly and stripped from him he reverts to the childlike creature he came from and sings to his creator (""My first instructor was Mr. Arkany. He taught me to sing a song... it goes like this... ""Daisy, Daisy...""). Tragic.So I say, let history record the pathos and unsung nobility of the film's most memorable star and saddest victim.Ladies and Gentlemen I give you: HAL9000.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

The HAL scenario represents humans relationship with technology, the relationship between Apollonian and Dionysian (google it). From the bone weapon, to the spaceship to HAL. A comment that (while useful) humans may misuse technology and move us in the wrong direction- creating a Frankenstein.** Perhaps the true message which combines every aspect of the film is that (like tools, technology and HAL) it is not what is right in front of us that will truly progress us and move humanity forward.

He really fills out the perverted ideology of humanity in an almost guide like way. The way the future was presented through the eyes of the past, is very powerful. It really gives you, an almost insurmountable illusion of time. But alas I return to Planck moments and it all falls apart for me. But still very much entertaining. The only problem with HAL is that they gave him almost too much personality. At one point I was like ""oh come on, he would never say that"" I mean when he says, ""This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.""; HAL knew that before Dave got on the ship.

Basically it was boring and it really wasn't all that philosophical. Perhaps the movie was best for it's time but I simply think it's overrated. Mankind has this basic savage/evil nature and it just may be possible that we can't live without it. Humans advance and evolve but we always have those basic primitive qualities. That's my interpretation of the film anyway, what's yours? Oh, and why do you guys treat those who didn't like the film so badly?

1904,rsabotin15,Transcendent Beauty,10,13 November 2014,"""2001: A Space Odyssey"" emulates Stanley Kubrick's style in such a magnificent, yet tranquil fashion. The concept, blended with the artistry of Kubrick, had me breathlessly staring at my computer screen as the credits ran. Kubrick's work seems to translate less as a film, but more as an artistic piece. The plot follows no specific points and the narration is minimal, yet the audience leaves with such a deep range of emotion and curiosity. The film revolves less around the evolution of its characters, but instead dwells on an overarching concept of the evolution of mankind in its entirety. Scenes like the apes learning how to use tools to kill the opposition, Bowman disabling the all powerful HAL-9000, and the final act where the star child looks over the earth all encompass Kubrick's intentions while utilizing his signature style.The dialogue, or lack thereof, sets the tone for this film. In the first half hour, there are no words spoken. The same can be said for the last half hour. In fact, around 88 minutes are silent. That is more than half of the movie engulfed in the sound of silence. But the silence does not take away from the movie, as many superficial critics would argue, it enriches it in great dividends. Kubrick uses this incredibly eerie feeling to allow the film to progress with the absence of narration. We should not rely on the few words that we hear, but rather allow our own imagination and curiosity to emulate feelings that Kubrick fulfills with this style. Many viewers say that this creates a boring and slow-moving film, and I have to admit that some parts are a bit sluggish, but these empty sequences filled with classical music or heavy breathing adds an almost cryptic element to man's perception on the unknown universe. Everything appears so alien, so incredibly vast and remote. We are allowed to ponder Kubrick's profound intentions with such a minimalistic approach. This cryptic element is also aided by the choice of music in the film. Kubrick infuses a remarkable soundtrack with beautiful shooting techniques to create a void that only our interpretation can fill. As we cycle through various ships in space to the tune of ""The Blue Danube Waltz"", we fall into a sort of trance, filled with fascination and awe over the complexity of space and what man has done to explore it. But when we first see the monolith on the moon, Kubrick viciously uses ""Requiem for Soprano, Mezzo Soprano, Two Mixed Choirs & Orchestra"" to create an almost disturbing feeling within us. The contrast of voices and tones combined with the unearthly presence of the monolith forces us into such an uncomfortable perception of the astronauts exploring the moons surface. Kubrick inflicts so much emotion with the use of classical scores such as these, having more meaning than the words of the characters themselves.Everything that surrounds this film creates such an aura of beauty. Showing ships in space for fifteen minutes or playing music to a black screen has no effect on the outcome of the film, but it creates such an elegant atmosphere that Kubrick uses to enhance our outlook on 2001. That is what pushes this film past many others, the effect that even minor elements provide for its audience. But what really sealed everything for me was the ending. Out of nowhere, Kubrick throws in scenes so profound and unexpected that it forces the audience to ask questions. It forces us to ponder what Kubrick truly wanted to portray. And ultimately, it forces us to examine human evolution and its place among the universe. Kubrick did not create 2001 as a film to 'entertain'. The whole premise of the movie revolves around our conscious understanding rather than a superficial plot line that grants us immediate satisfaction. It is, no doubt, one of the most remarkably beautiful pieces of film ever created. Stanley Kubrick's unparalleled style allows ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" to transcend past any ordinary film.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1905,maridu01,Greatest Film Ever Made,10,13 September 2016,"Just to repeat the title, this is the greatest film ever made. Unmatched in all aspects and kids should be taught about this movie in school, same way that they should learn about The Beatles. Some things humanity just can't live without once they are created. 2001 is one of those things. It covers every aspect of our evolution as singular man and as species of men in a perfect way without any hysteria. It's absurd to think Kubrick and Clarke had this in them in 1968. We have let them down, they expected much more from us in 2001. It's now 2016 and we are not even close to where they thought we'd be. How disappointing we are...",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1908,jacknorwood2002,"It takes hard work to get into, but when you do, its amazing.",9,3 September 2015,"Originally, I was writing a huge analysis of this film to post on IMDb, going through the film, thinking about it in detail and peeling back all the different layers to it. About half way through I realised that it was getting too long, and I should perhaps be more concise with my review. This however, showcases the huge amount of substance and detail to be found in this film. In my opinion, the best films aren't the ones that tell you things. The best films are the ones that ask you questions, so that you can think about it for yourself.The biggest theme in this film, in my opinion, is tools. Near the beginning of the film we are watching two tribes of apes just after the creation of the world. They are rival tribes, but then there is a pivotal moment which changes everything. One tribe discovers tools, in the form of using dead animal bones as weapons, and they are automatically superior. When one apes is playing, smashing a bone against another bone, he throws it up in the air and we witness one of my favourite cuts of all time. Suddenly it cuts to a spaceship with a similar shape, millions of years later, and we come to witness the tools that were discovered by the apes now defining who the humans are. The place they are staying in, a spaceship, is a tool. Breathing, which should be a wholly natural thing, can only be done through a tool. A man's only means of contacting his family is through a tool. For a large part of the film the characters wear spacesuits which, to me, although it is all up to interpretation, is symbolic, as, without their spacesuits (a tool) they would be naked. Later in the film, we spend a long time following an expedition to Jupiter which has on board an artificial intelligence computer, HAL, an astronaut Dave, and about three other Astronauts in hibernation. The thing that is striking about this section of the film is that Dave and the other Astronaut who awakens, both give extremely unrealistic and unemotional performances. That probably sounds like a bad thing to you, but that's exactly what the director wanted to convey. The fascinating thing about it is that in a ship full of a number of humans and a computer, the computer seems to have the most humanity.In this section, the two Astronauts decide HAL the computer, has gone out of control and they must unplug him. HAL finds out, and a fascinating situation arises. HAL feels fear. Here, it is easy to view HAL as a one dimensional villain who just wants to destroy things, but really, I think he fears being unplugged in the same way a person would fear being killed. I also think he reacts in quite a human way, killing the the Astronauts in order to save himself. However, Dave reaches HAL's control room and so begins a scene that I think is more disturbing than most things you find in a 12 (I'm British, but I think that translates to a PG-13 in the USA). In this scene Dave unplugs HAL and the most interesting question in the film arises. Is this murder? Whichever way, this is a very sad scene as HAL shows genuine human sadness and fear. At the end of the film, after an odd sequence consisting of Dave going through a light, colour tunnel and then seeing various landscapes in weird inverted colours, he lands in an eighteenth century room. This is a highly debated scene and is completely open to interpretation, but I will give my views on it:In this scene, I think that Dave, has travelled so far out, that time and space are insignificant. What I mean is that he has travelled to a place where it doesn't matter where, or when you are, time moves randomly. You could be in the eighteenth century, you could be on earth, you could keep getting older or you could keep getting older, (which all happen to him): it doesn't matter. And then what I think is the most ambiguous ending in film history unfolds. A much much older version of him appears dying on a bed, then you see a baby on the bed replacing where he was which grows and in the final shot you see it next to the earth, a similar size. So what does the ending mean? What does the film mean? What is it saying about tools? Was the unplugging of HAL really murder? Is HAL really human? What makes us human? Is it trying to imply we are too reliant on tools? Perhaps it is trying to imply that we ourselves are becoming the tools, as the beings with the least humanity. This brings me to my first point. 2001 never makes any statements it, only asks questions. And the great thing about that is that, they are interesting questions I can think about for as long as I want and never come to a conclusion, as I don't think there ever was one.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1909,markiparkinson87,Technically ahead of it's time by far then any other Science fiction film,10,23 June 2005,"When Stanley Kubrick thought about making 2001,the movies that were being made at that time were science fiction films that were comical at best.I'm talking about the film's were you would have bug eyed alien's,and bulky robots. 2001 set the standard of what a science film could be,and what it could become.The graphics in the movie are still impressive even after 30 years have gone by.The film takes it self seriously which helps it because the movie's plot is serious.Keir Dullea acting is groundbreaking especially for having little dialogue.In my opinion I think 2001 is far more superior then star wars.The classical music in 2001 was the right choice for the film because any thing else would have seemed out of place for such a gradual paced film.This movie is probably the only film back then to have scientific accuracy about traveling through space,for instance,having no sound in space, which i think star wars forgot about.2001 is not overrated it heavily underrated ,and I do wish people would give it the acclaim that it deserves.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Because i simply was not able to stand the incredibly annoying music (expecially the retarded chant-like voices, which you must suffer for tens of MINUTES for no reason at all!) and the repeating of ever the same pictures any longer than 45 minutes. The movie could have been somewhat enjoyable without 1) this abomination of a soundtrack. Yes, even the classical music which was used and is SO praised by the simple people here who call themselves intellectuals, doesn't fit the theme of the film in slightest. And 2) if it was shortened by (not to!) two hours, to leave the lengthy crap out. Mind you, there is barely any conversation for the whole two hours.

1912,maximiliangrigorian,"""Its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness...""",8,3 March 2016,"This is no doubt a masterpiece of filmmaking! Director Stanley Kubrick created a piece of cinematic history, which may even be called cinematographic art, by making this movie. Still I am here to argue if it is worth 10 stars or not... and as seen in my rating, despite me calling it a masterpiece, I gave 8/10. So why?The most dominant factors, that make this movie so outstanding, are the use of sound and the use of picture. This movie combines these to create an incredible experience when watching it. Long takes, beautifully shot and carefully crafted, were paired with atmospheric music such as Györgi Ligetis ""Atmospheres"" or Richard Straus ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"" resulting in inconceivably beautiful scenes. The saying ""Show! Do not tell!"" is represented in its purest form by this movie. But what is its greatest strength is also, in my opinion, its greatest weakness. And as there are so many positive reviews about this movie already, I decided to focus on the negative aspects I noticed while watching it the first time. 2001-A Space Odyssey is a very slow-paced movie, probably the slowest one I have seen so far. This is caused by the fact that all of those long takes consume a lot of time. Therefore not much is happening in this movie. I would even consider saying that the main plot of the movie, which I am not going to spoil here, is primitive. It is straight forward and simple. It serves its purpose of guiding the audience through the scenes, but it does not more. A similar problem can be found within the characters. The acting is not particularly great, not because the actors are bad-they are not! Instead they do not have a lot screen time or dialogue and thus do not have any progression in their character. According to IMDb 88 minutes of this movie are without any dialogue. How can someone expect serious character development? And lastly the end, which I will not give away here. I will only say one thing: Kubrick himself said once that if someone understood his movie, he did something wrong. I understand that, because of that, the goal of the movie was to leave the viewer wondering about what he has seen. Still it is very disappointing to have so many unanswered questions at the end. Your mind is literally ""blown away"" by the ending and you have no chance of assembling it back together...This may be criticism on a very high level, nit-picking so to say. But nevertheless this movie is a masterpiece, a must-see! In sight of all these positive reviews I just felt that some serious criticism is not out of place either as it has some problems as well. In the end I can only say... go see the movie already! What are you waiting for?",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1913,hussisamsung,Hiss,6,5 December 2016,"Instead of writing a paragraph, I'll give four good reasons why 2001 is the greatest cinema experience of all time: 1) It is a visual Odyssey that could only be told on the big screen. The special effects that won Kubrick his only Oscar are the most stunning effects before that age of Jurassic Park and T2. They allow Kubrick to give an accurate (or at least are the most accurate) depiction of space travel to date. The silence that fills the space scenes not only serves its purpose as accurate science, but also adds to the mood of the film (to be discussed in a later point with HAL). The fact that Kubrick shot the moon scenes before the Apollo landing is a gutsy yet fulfilling move. Many have said that upon its original release, it was a favorite ""trip"" movie. I can think of no other movie that has such amazing visuals for its time and even of all time (sorry Phantom Menace fans!) 2) Kubrick's directing style is terrific. As in all his films, Kubrick likes to use his camera as means to delve into the psychology of his characters and plots. His camera is not as mobile as other greats, such as Scorsese, but instead sits and watches the narrative unfold. Faces are the key element of a Kubrick film. Like classic movies, such as M and Touch of Evil, Kubrick focuses on the characters' faces to give the audience a psychological view-point. Even he uses extreme close-ups of HAL's glowing red ""eye"" to show the coldness and determination of the computerized villain. I could go on, but in summation Kubrick is at the heights of his style. 3) HAL 9000 is one of the most villainous characters in film history. I whole-heartedly agree with the late Gene Siskle's opinion of HAL 9000. Most of this film takes place in space. Through the use of silence and the darkness of space itself, a mood of isolation is created. Dave and his crewmen are isolated between earth and Jupiter, with nowhere to escape. Combine this mood with the cold, calculated actions of HAL 9000 and you have the most fearful villain imaginable. I still, although having see this film several times, feel my chest tighten in a particular scene. 4) The controversial ending of 2001 always turns people away from this film. Instead of trying to give my opinion of the what it means and what my idea of 2001's meaning in general is, I'd like to discuss the fact that the ending serves to leave the movie open- ended. Kubrick has stated that he intended to make 2001 open for discussion. He left its meaning in the hands of the viewer. By respecting the audience's intelligence, Kubrick allowed his movie to be the beginning, not the end, of a meaningful discussion on man's past, present, and future. The beauty of 2001 is that the ending need not mean anything deep, it can just be a purely plot driven explanation and the entire movie can be viewed as an entertaining journey through space. No other movie, save the great Citizen Kane, leaves itself open to discussion like 2001. It is truly meant to be a surreal journey that involves not only the eye but the mind. Instead of waiting in long lines for the Phantom Menace, rent a widescreen edition of 2001 and enjoy the greatest cinematic experience.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1917,staticllew,"Great Film, Slightly Let Down By Pacing",7,9 July 2015,"It's really interesting to see a film that inspired half a century of Sci-Fi since it's release. Having watched several Sci-fi films that were made after this, it was easy to see where they drew their inspiration from. 2001 did for Sci-Fi what Orwell's 1984 did for the 'Dystopian Future' idea. The exposition in this film is immense; going all the way back to the dawn of man was a bold way to give the audience the set up. I really liked the stark contrast of ape killing ape in a barren desert to space travel. Needless to say, the way Kubrick shot this film is nothing short of astounding. The genius camera angles and the frankly dizzying, gravity defying one-shot takes helped to create a level of immersion I seldom find in films. The soundtrack is also fantastic. Mixing majestic Classical pieces and dark, ethereal choral singing helped build up a foreboding atmosphere that drew me right in from the moment the Monolith first appears on screen. Having said that, the one thing I feel lets it down is the pacing. I have no problem with a film that takes a while to get into gear. I love films that build up a world around the viewer and fully immerses me in the story. That's exactly what I look for in a film. But with 2001: A Space Odyssey, there were some scenes that really did drag on. I felt like some shots just really didn't need to be as long as they were. And a lot of the screen time was spent on things that didn't contribute to dialogue, plot, character development or immersion. These shots were simply there so Kubrick could bask in his own genius a little longer. Those scenes just killed it for me as I found my eyes wandering and my concentration waning. Otherwise, it's a film way ahead of it's time and the forerunner to countless Sci-Fi films and for that, it really is great.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1918,mustreadbooks,An exhausting yet rewarding adventure,10,11 May 2017,"Perhaps ""exhausting"" isn't the best way to begin my description of what I believe to be one of the best movies ever created, yet I'd like to begin my review by emphasizing this movie is not for everyone. Every shot in this film, as is true for most Kubrick's films, is intricately put together and the end result is marvelous. The plot is nearing on mystical (even a little new age), but never becomes sappy or heavy-handed. Kubrick leaves it up to the viewer to make up their own mind of what to make of this epic, though the question remains: is there an answer?",2001 - A Space Odyssey

One year later, Haal beat the human. The nature of human is too weak. In the final scene, we understand that the human is nothing without the technique. Finally, the final embryo shown that the human can evolve' Kubrick wrote a odyssey of all the human history. But, more than that, it's a visual fairy tale. 2001 talk about the technique and is a technical product very resulted. The only negative point is the incrustations, but without it, we can imagine that this movie is from 2001 ! The score is legend, this is one of the most powerful music score ever made.

The people who rave about how it's ""such a great piece of art"" would look at a white sheet of paper and call that art because it ""allows the viewer to create their own visualization of the nature of art"" or something like that. NO. This movie lacked everything that any sane person would look for in a decent movie. See: plot, character development, storytelling, not being a general trip to hell laced with LSD and shrooms, and GOOD music.

Is one of the best films because it represents and staged one of the best views of cinema and space at the same time. It shows how much man is fragile to the evolution that often escapes us. The most impressive thing is that this film was filmed in 1968, by far anticipating other films made for decades.

1923,watato,A compelling story of the advance of mankind,9,8 July 2005,"This story is told over elegant sequences, that with every advance in mankind/technology, there is a cost that we must pay.This is first illustrated when the ape creatures discover tools (bones),after touching a strange monolith. And uses the bone to kill another ape, this murder is the cost of our new technology. After this violent encounter we are taken to another time and place... As the story jumps to the future, we open the new age with new technology, in this case we see amazing establishing shots with space ships/stations. This entire scene is accompanied with the Blue Danbue Waltz. This part is where my rating of This movie dropped a star, as I am only 13 years old my attention span wears thin after ""repeated"" establishing shots. About 30 minutes into the movie we are introduced to our protagonist. Here we have our first dialoge taking place on a space ship. At this point we discover that there has been some problems on another ship and the audience is kept in the dark about what is happening. We are then brought to more shots and classical music during a shot where our protagonist is brought to the lunar surface. Our next scene is of our main character presenting the problems at the station to a council, they seem to agree with him that the matter should be of absolute secrecy, and decide off camera about farther plans. As we cut to the next scene we are brought to a small ship with a group of scientist visiting a strange object imbedded in the lunar surface. Here we have our second meeting with the monolith. One of the men reaches out and touches the monolith starting the next step in our wheel of change.Next we are introduced to a new protagonist on a trip to Saturn. We are also introduced to a new character, Hal, a super intelligent computer from a line of computers that have never made a mistake, in a little while he shall be viewed as the antagonist but not for now. As we come a little bit in to our voyage we have some dialect between Hal and Dave (the protagonist). After the conversation is almost at an end, Howe announces that there is a malfunction with the communication dish on the star ship. After further examination it is discovered that the dish was not damaged and there was a computer error, which has never happened before. As Dave and his fellow crew man decide what to do about the problem we are introduced to our new change, our technology (Hal), has developed a mind of its own and has emotions including revenge and anger. As the humans plot to shut down Hal, Hal learns of their plans and systematically kills the crew which is our cost for such great technology. The last crew member, Dave, is left to shut down Howe. Once this feat is completed Dave arrives at Saturn. When venturing out in to space we again meet the monolith and as Dave enters it hes is brought in to an out of body experience that was translated as Dave dying. During a ""dream"" sequence, we see the progressive states of Daves life after his current state. Middle age, old and finally dying, as we see him dying Dave reaches out and for the last time, the monolith is touched. After this instance we see not an advance in technology, but in life as Dave dies and is reincarnated as a ""Star Child"", at the cost of his former self. Here the movie ends.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

There are a lot details which are meticulously cared to satisfy you throughout 2 hours and 29 minutes.If it wasn't for this movie, I'd say it would be impossible to even think the creation of this kind of film, regarding the year it was released (1968). And due to that fact, I can't quite understand yet how Kubrick's masterpiece has managed to surpass decades of technology advance to be even better of many of nowadays films, in visual effects terms.

When I explored the details, I tried to figure out the logical of the stories. It's about human evolution, from first time using tools to space travel, and to the future. The film is composed of lots of story fragments, alongside with the profound monolith, which is a meaningful symbol the director wants to express. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a film maker. I was impressed by its classical background music and marvelous special effects. When I realized it was produced in 1968, I was shocked! It was a avant-garde science fiction epic and so far ahead of its time. It predicted the future of 35 years later. And some was described in the film we have achieved now but some is still on the way.Although it's a hard-to-understand film and needs us philosophize the meaning of space, future, humankind, technology, etc. I really recommend you to watch the classic film and enjoy the process of exploring your mind.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

Even after almost more than 48 years its still beautiful movie with one of the best visual effects.

He made many great movies that really set the bar for what film can do and all of it was out of the box. But, this movie is no good. To todays viewers it is too slow, too vague, and too boring to be worth watching. What makes this movie special was that it was the first of its kind and nothing like this had been done before. Now it is old hat. I sat through this movie hoping there would be at least some tiny redeeming plot at the end, but there wasn't. Most of the symbolism didn't come through. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless they were really interested in film.

Their is no shame in not understanding the meaning of 2001: a space odyssey because the meaning is completely up to the viewer. 2001 was envisioned that way, written that way, and directed that way on purpose. Stanley Kubrick does not wish to inform the viewer but dares them to feel, whether it be the cold heart of silent space or a machine with more emotion than man. It still astonishes to this day that there is not a single computer effect in this entire movie just real props on a real stage making pure movie magic and to believe it was conceived before humans landed on the moon or did Stanley fake that?(wink* wink*).

For a 2hr 45min film to have only 18 minutes of dialog is an incredible thing to achieve, and to think that this was made in 1968 makes it all the more impressive. I must have watched this film a dozen times, but the most memorable time was watching this in a theater during a festival at Museum of Moving Image in New York.Featuring some of the most iconic moments in cinema history, this film is an experience that will immerse the viewer.I won't give out spoilers, but do watch and enjoy this incredible experience.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I just finished the movie (well watched the first 1 hr and 45 minutes and fast forwarded the last 35 minutes, missing absolutely nothing) and can officially say that I have spent the most pointless, wasteful, and idle 2 1/2 hours of my life. I've spent more valuable time taking craps on the toilet seat than watching this movie which could have easily been reduced to 5 minutes. Wow, I think I've lost at least 90% of my sanity and 100% of my attention span after having sat in front of the screen, finishing up my entire box of cookies and reading an entire chapter on the Art of War (again, I missed nothing from the storyline). I think that probably the most exciting part during the movie was when I farted in the middle of one of the 10-minute scenes of a spacecraft slowly floating its way across the screen. Oh, well I do admit that the first sight of the monolith did raise my heart rate just a little bit...or maybe it lowered it. Whoa, I just realized I was that close to falling into cardiac arrest.

Many people who have seen the movie claim it is ""boring"" or ""too slow"", but the bottom line is- if you have a short attention span, you won't like this movie. The visual effects of this movie are truly beautiful, you could say it is the Mona Lisa of movies. The storyline was very interesting, and presented ideas and a plot that very few people can think of. The minimal dialogue is great compliment to a movie like this, every word that is spoken is important in order to understand the movie. The use of music in 2001 is genius, it feels like you are sucked right into the movie, as the film's artsy space scenes flow with the classical music it is shown with. The acting in 2001 is spectacular, especially by Keir Dullea (David Bowman). I don't think the cast could have done better job.

1941,headleal,Two and a half hours I will never get back,1,12 June 2016,"This film is just so boring. I tried to like it. I really did. There were so many times during the movie when I thought that I could just shut it off and do something else but I thought there had to be something of value from this. Spoiler Alert: There wasn't. I'll start at the beginning. The first twenty minutes of the film is just monkeys doing stuff. That's really all there is. That is until this giant rectangle shows up (I have no idea what it is, the movie never explains it) The monkeys act differently but it's never really elaborated on. Thousands of years later, the same rectangle is found again on the moon. Then they send these guys on a spaceship on some mission (I can't really remember what it was for) However, that's not until two 7- minute scenes of a ship floating through space with the Blue Danibue in the background. Not zooming. Not speeding. Floating. It goes on forever. The whole movie is like this. It moves painfully slow and there's barely any character development. Now let's talk about the villain, HAL 9000. Many regard him as one of the best if not the best sci-fi villain ever. How? HAL is completely useless. He adds nothing to the story, other than wasting more time (yay) He's not even really evil. His dastardly plot is to defend himself and save the mission. How is that evil. You could argue that he kills one of the main characters, but again, it's defense. Late in the movie, the two main guys plot to terminate HAL because they suspect that he might be malfunctioning. Well what would you do if you were in the middle of space with two other people and both of them were plotting to kill you? try to stop them? Well that obviously means that you're evil. Anyway, HAL is killed in the most drawn out way possible, keeping with the tone of the movie. See, HAL is a computer and the only way to shut him down is to remove a bunch of computer chips. So the remaining crew member removes them and it takes forever! I'm serious it takes an eternity. And HAL's ingenious plan to stop him from doing this is to keep repeating ""Please stop."" over and over and over and over and over and ..... Okay you get it. So after taking an hour to kill HAL, Dave (I just remembered his name) pilots the ship into..... I have absolutely no idea. All I know is that there are a bunch of flashing lights and Dave makes some funny faces which I guess are supposed to be disturbing. For all I know, this could just be Spaceballs 1 going at Ludicrous Speed. Now, we see this old guy in a bed and the camera cuts from Dave to the old guy over and over again. Dave Old Guy Dave Old Guy Dave Old Guy Dave Giant Baby Floating Over the Bed. What the hell?! SO the baby travels through space to Earth and just stares at it for a few seconds and...... the movie ends. So, I have no idea what happened. The rectangle? Never explained. Old Guy? Never explained. Giant Space Fetus? Never explained and I had the most questions about that too. I didn't bother to mention all of the moments which just drag out for an eternity, but trust me, there's plenty. While the theme song is iconic and epic and the special effects are amazing, it's not worth sitting for two and a half hours to watch almost nothing happen for the majority of the time to come to a resolution where you have no idea what happened. I've heard that the book explains more than the movie does and I plan to read it in the future, but would it have been so hard to get a narrator for this to tell us what was going on. I'm not saying hand me the plot on a silver platter, I'm just saying give me some idea as to what's happening. Seriously, how awesome would it be to have Orson Welles narrate this movie. Now that would be worth it. Now if you're trying to find treatment for insomnia, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, stay away.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1942,kumaranmol,"Classic Movie, Music and Motion",9,30 June 2016,"Oh. What a feel.! The epic movie, from none other than Stanley Kubrick (of the Clockwork Orange fame), is as intense as one can get. All the elements in the movie; like screenplay, music, direction, imageries, etc. are breathtaking in their approach towards the audience. The way the movie interacts with the viewers is certainly quiet gripping.One of my interpretations of this classic is that it subverts the idea of human progress by appealing to its inner consciousness about the true achievements of the evolution. Evolution plays a big role in the plot. There also is an AI character named HAL 9000, a.k.a. HAL. That machine is one of the most villainous characters the history of cinema has ever produced. Its single 'eye' plays the role of the eye of god and controls the human life on the spaceship. According to me, the theme is dark and the monolithic structure that gets showcased in the plot is an indication of the human negligence and the related dire consequences. The movie tries to showcase the significance of mankind, by commencing with an epic scene from the 'dawn' of man and thereby taking us straight into the future, 2001, which is scrupulously advanced, even more than that age in which we live today. The way the shots are taken, especially the outer space one, is outstanding. One can't digest the fact that the movie got released in 1968, a year before the man placed its feet on the moon, for the details of the celestial bodies and space are subtle.Stanley Kubrick did produce a masterpiece in this work. The foresight that he showed while creating this piece is tremendous concerning the future elements that he has used in the movie.The music is impeccable being classical and, at the same time, it establishes the running mood of the movie. The plot and characters aren't only the primary concerns for Kubrick; the meaningless scenes where no human action is shown are in the view of his, meaningful and crucial. So, expect some boredom if you aren't used to watching movies with such tempo. Moreover, it has that air of mysteriousness too, that captures one's thinking faculty.The movie ends without a closed ending. The viewers are left to draw their assumptions and interpretations. The creativity of Kubrick is a must watch.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

It's a very trippy and relaxing movie, although I don't do drugs, this is the type of movie that u can watch while high on weed, shrooms, or LSD. The music is very memorable and iconic, and used brilliantly. It's amazing to see such an old movie be visually pretty. U won't ever forget the evolution scene, The computer, The music, and the Abstract ending that was made for u to interpret on your own. That's what makes it special. The dialogue was nothing special, but u can tell it wasn't the focus of the film. There wasn't much of it, The biggest character was the computer. This movie is meant to be artistic, it shows off how well they made it look like a much much newer movie. The ending was made for u to interpret, so this movie can really make u feel like you're a part of it all! I feel like if u like good abstract art, you're gonna enjoy this masterpiece film.

The overall film has a lulling effect to it. Starting from the beginning of the scenes in space where Kubrick uses 'The Blue Danube' as the score for that portion of the movie. Personally, when I watched it, my whole body just relaxed. There is no clear tension in the beginning of the movie. The tension clearly jumps out though when HAL kills Poole. The other unnerving thing I found was the voice of HAL as he responded to questions. His voice is so artificial, yet to cunning and calculating. What really astounded me was that he was watching the astronauts' lips as they plotted to shut him down in the sound proof space pod. He read their lips and clearly and knew what they were plotting to do. The sound is also very cleverly used in the movie. The cut between the silent of space when you can hear absolutely nothing, to the cuts inside the spacecraft that's filled with whirls and blips of the computer is absolutely amazing. 2001 is a work of art. Quite unlike, anything I have ever seen before. Requires a bit of patience to watch...but when you watch the whole thing you feel fantastic. I actually came out feeling humbled after watching this movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1948,maxicrockgamingofficiel,Wow....,10,14 November 2017,Most beautiful film ever... No more xD I don't even understand how it win just one little Oscar... What a great story from Kubrick and Arthur C Clarck (don't forget him^^) 10/10 without any doubt for me ! Warning ! You must see this movie in good condition if you want to really appreciate it !

1949,x-06267,one of the most overrated Movie in the history,1,29 June 2018,"Sorry about my english is not so good, and i'll try to made my opinion clear.
From current point (Year 2018)of view, there is nothing good in this movie.
1. The most good thing about this movie is visual effect(space, spaceship, a talking-computer etc.), which have won the Oscar , and it is sure the Audience in 1968 would be amazed by the visual effect. But in today the visual effect from the movie looks like poor and we already have so much movie ,documentary talking about space. the space - thing from this movie is a very normal thing now.
2. most part of this movie like a Spaceship-demonstrate-viedo, the movie shows so much details about appartus in the spaceship . Again, in 1968 it would amazed the audience, but today, it's just make the movie tedious.
3. for a movie is 2hour and 30minuts. the story is so poor.As was mentioned above, most part of the movie is show space and spaceship. And the end of the movie is hard to understanding. And i just read about the interview of director, the ending is actually what it shows, no further meaning.....again dispointment.Conclusion: the movie war made in 1968, it was sure a surprise for the world 1968.
But today, it is just pain to watch.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1951,berbaris,Formality,10,22 February 2018,"2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a landmark, science fiction classic - and probably the best science-fiction film of all time about exploration of the unknown. It was released, coincidentally, at the height of the space race between the USSR and the US. It appeared at the same time as NASA's exploratory Apollo Project with manned Earth orbiting missions - a prelude to orbiting and landing on the Moon with Apollo 11 on July 20, 1969. And it prophetically showed the enduring influence that computers would have in our daily lives.Director Stanley Kubrick's work is a profound, visionary and astounding film (a mysterious Rorschach film-blot) and a tremendous visual experience. This epic film contained more spectacular imagery (about what space looked like) and special effects than verbal dialogue. Viewers are left to experience the non-verbal, mystical vastness of the film, and to subjectively reach into their own subconscious and into the film's pure imagery to speculate about its meaning. Many consider the masterpiece bewildering, boring, slow-moving or annoying, but are still inspired by its story of how man is dwarfed by technology and space.The first spoken word is almost a half hour into the film, and there's less than 40 minutes of dialogue in the entire film. Much of the film is in dead silence (accurately depicting the absence of sound in space), or with the sound of human breathing within a spacesuit. Kubrick's sci-fi experiment intended to present its story almost purely with visual imagery and auditory signals with very little communicative human dialogue (similar to what was attempted in the surreal, fragmented, non-narrative imagery of the Qatsi trilogy - from 1983-2002, from Godfrey Reggio). All scenes in the film have either dialogue or music (or silence), but never both together.The film is enriched by stunning, pioneering technical effects, and featured orchestral music, presented in movements like in a symphony, from:Richard Strauss, Also Sprach Zarathustra
Johann Strauss, The Blue Danube Waltz
Gyorgy Ligeti, Atmospheres, Lux Aeterna, and Requiem for Soprano, Mezzo-Soprano, Two Mixed Choirs and Orchestra
Aram Khatchaturian, Gayane Ballet Suite
The breathtaking, richly eloquent, and visually-poetic film - deliberately filmed at a slow pace - about space travel and the discovery of extra-terrestrial intelligence (many years before Star Wars (1977), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), and E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)), was based on the published 1951 short story The Sentinel, written in 1948 by English science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke. Its original screenplay was co-authored by director Stanley Kubrick and Clarke from an expanded novelization, and the film was originally titled Journey Beyond the Stars. The film's title was chosen because it was the first year of the new Millenium and of the next century. The film was also strongly influenced by director George Pal's Conquest of Space (1955), and was similar in some plot elements that were referenced by Kubrick. Three months after the film made its debut, Clarke published a novel based upon the film's screenplay.Kubrick's masterpiece was not nominated for Best Picture, but received four Academy Award nominations, including Best Director, Best Art Direction, and Best Original Story and Screenplay. It won one Oscar, for Best Visual Effects. The film was snubbed by the Academy that instead voted its top accolades to the odd musical Oliver! (1968) based upon the Charles Dickens tale. [Note: In the same year, Planet of the Apes (1968) was given a Special Honorary Oscar for John Chambers' outstanding, convincing makeup (there was no Best Makeup category until 1981) - the Academy members presumably didn't realize the superior, too-believable makeup in the opening scenes of 2001 that included both human actors with life-like masks and infant chimpanzees.] Douglas Trumbull, the Special Photographic Effects Supervisor, went on to work on Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979).The film initially opened to hostile, unsympathetic, negative or indifferent critical reviews (it was criticized for being boring and lacking in imagination), and 19 minutes were cut from the film after premieres in Washington, New York, and Los Angeles. But it slowly gained enormous popularity during yearly re-releases, especially when embraced by late 1960s counter-cultural audiences for its psychedelic, mystical and mind-bending elements. It was re-released in a slightly shorter version (141 minutes) in 1972.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

I finished neither knowing nor caring what the director was communicating. Abstract art is to be savoured, surely, though this work is blighted by a lack of focus (thought I cannot be sure), jarring shifts in perspective to satisfy an overly ambitious story arc and only partially redeemed by the one character with a semblance of development or personality: HAL9000.

What Stanley Kubrick has created is a work of beauty, insight, and wonder unlike any movie at the time. Even today, this film is unmatched in its creativity and the sheer boldness of its vision and design. The special effects still look amazingly realistic, despite being 50 years old. Simply put, this film, along with Kubrick and Clarke, were ahead of their time.Some may find this film too slow in its pacing and too ambiguous in its storytelling, but those willing to accept the film's irrational narrative structure will find a wonderful piece of entertainment. I believe that this film is worth everyone's time, if only for the thematic exploration of science, technology, and humanity. 10/10",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1958,zitosevana,Cinematic Shockpiece In Space Tripping,9,10 January 2006,"40 years and counting...look how well this movie has held up to the flatulent times that have been. To put things in perspective this movie happened at a culturally important time in the modern world (definitively American) history. Arthur C Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey begs to be read and then watched on the screen. For all of us who have been abandoned to pirated junk on listless Chinese CDs must have a dekko of the original on-screen or at least on DVD. The chills are still there 40 years on.A definitive genre-pioneering masterpiece of unmatched depth and intellectual implications...but why?A two-and-half hour sci-fi flick without a shot of violence or cyberpunk (back then it didn't exist). Very little dialogue. A cast that can be counted on fingertips. And a soundtrack that makes you feel you are at the Berlin Philarmonic's Strauss renditions. This movie is something of an experience and definitely not a moral science lesson of good-evil that MTV style pop-culturists and present-day Presidents believe in. This movie is a heavy-weight, brush aside those so-called blockbuster prints that seem to vie for 15-25 aged-somethings high on peer-pressure syndrome. Bubba go back to school, not high school, not film school but art school. Kubrick genuinely drives the point home about why sci-fiction could be at best mankind's most sincere effort at art? How else would feel about a space-time situation that Dr Bowman was tripping into? Well your laws of physics don't hold good, so where is the scope for explanations about the climax? This movie has done a remarkable job of giving the viewer a chance to participate in one of the most humbling experiences that mankind cannot afford - SPACE.Kubrick's movie is a poor-man's ticket to space. In space, time is more of a liability. 2 1/2 hours of such a cinematic experience shouldn't try to bet against it. 2001 ASO is a masterpiece of believability and physics as its creators have gone into the minutest details of perceptive canvas to bring across a true work of art. In contrast the last 20 minutes or so of Dr Bowman's space-time trek (some prefer it to an enlightening LSD workout) is nothing but cinematic honesty and imagination that physics cannot explain. How else would you explain time-warps? If you expect Star Wars type sci-fi then well 2001 ASO will disappoint. Because Star Wars is like canned juice. (Not to say Star Wars is bad cinema) but 2001 ASO is more like fruit on the tree. Eat it or leave it, its as natural as it gets, no preservatives or human interferences.Almost every sci-fi movie worth its salt (after 2001 ASO) must have read into this Clarke/Kubrick classic for some inspiration and also knowledge about space. Space is a lonely, cold, timeless, unfeeling, inanimate, persecuting, inspiring and infinite emotion as seen in this movie. We can never answer some questions like who created the Universe? Whats? Ifs? Buts? Whys? Why Nots?Given this movie's limitations of scientific data at its time, it is indeed more of a gigantic effort. A kind of buzz on the scifi genre timeline. Something akin to the apeman's mind being ''Seeded'' for intelligence by the black and mysterious monolith. This movie is indeed a ''Seeding'' of minds that wish to venture into the fantastic-space and end-of-the-dimensions attitude of an all-inviting mind. LSD did help, so did the generation of mind-altering tastes, man was stepping on the Moon - the timing was right. The movie has thus garnered its cult status.If you ask me the movie is an awesome adaptation of the book. But if you read the book first and tripped through the movie later, then you will understand at least the essence of the almost abstract formula of the ending. 2001 has no ending because it was the beginning of man's ultimate trip in space-time. Clarke wrote well beyond 2001 and many of his later works did run into critical brickbats. But there is no denying that A C Clarke is the man who probably invented Pink Floyd type science fiction.Just like space, this movie is too abstract to define in terms of possibilities or implications. That I presume was Kubrick's idea for it too. Hollywood seems to afford such explanations with aliens who walk - talk - and do evil like us. After you watch 2001 ASO, you will begin to wonder if ''intelligence'' itself is so unique and man himself is so really miniscule to the events that are shaping the Universe.Add to all this the artistic flourish of the movie with its sweeping Strauss-orchestrated epic ''Thus Spake Zarathustra'' or the intimate sounds that intertwine with the hollowness of space. This tension in space has never been filmed to such an extreme degree of emotional precision without any graphic violence. Its the kind of ''ultra-violence'' the American PsyOps would mete-out in their propaganda wars to culture-shock religious crackers like the Taleban to get them out of their ''oyster'' er caves. Same effect for commercial movie-bred audience. They might mistake it for 2 1/2 hours of nothing. Hello!?! Nothing happens in space like you think bubba!A movie (if ever there was one) to add to the list of movies that could possibly have changed mankind's perception of The Bigger Picture. Think you know your physics? Space-time graphs? Exclusion formulae?

Although, Kubrick is telling a lot in this film, in the reality he wanted to show us the future. Just think that many people died before the first human walked on the moon. Because of the curiosity about the future in human instinct, I'm sure that people who had seen this film on 1968 and died right before the first walk on the moon passed away happily. How many of us wouldn't like to have a time machine to see the past and the future? That is exactly what Kubrick has done in this movie. He just created a time machine and traveled us beginning from millions of years before to the future trough the time. May be I will not see the man walking on the Mars, but it is enough for me that I traveled to Jupiter by means of this fantastic movie.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1961,ronnoc-23739,I'm Speechless...,10,7 July 2017,"I don't want to give anything away because I want people to have the same experience as I did when I saw this, so there are **no spoilers** ahead. I originally saw this film in the cinema as a reprint of the original 70mm copy. I had heard no reviews of this movie, but knew it was famous by all of the references in pop culture (SpongeBob SquarePants, The Simpsons, The Phantom Menace, etc.). I had no expectations for it to be good or bad, but I was still excited before the film started.The opening title sequence was so amazing that it gave me goosebumps and made my hair stand on end. 2001 had the best live action visual storytelling I have seen in my entire life. My jaw was dropped during the entire first half and it was the first time I had ever been completely silent and did not talk to anybody during a movie. In fact after the first half, I did not know what to say to anyone. My mouth made sounds, but words would not come out. There were no words to describe my experience so I just said ""I'm Speechless"".My expression changed wen I re-entered that universe to witness the second half of this masterpiece of art. It changed from shock and amazement to determined focus. I was trying to find the meaning was to me, as it was never made clear. I thought It was about the constantly changing world of evolution, and more specifically, the evolution of man.This is what visual storytelling is supposed to be like. The little amounts of dialogue allows you to be immersed in the setting that it gives when dialogue is not present. It also makes the dialogue have more Impact. I highly recommend this to any aspiring film buffs or dedicated science fiction geeks or pretty much anyone who wants a new way to hear a story. My only complaint is the sequel, 2010: The Year We Made Contact. It was extremely bland and probably explained things that were not meant to be explained in 2001's book or film. I say ""probably"" because I left in the middle of it from being so bored..

That is one of the reasons why it is so great. Now the look of this movie is very well done. 2001 was made before CGI was, but that does not stop it from looking realistic( I like the way this and the old Star wars looks better then the new CG look).Now don't get me wrong 2001 does have some things people may not like.First of all meny are turned any way because the movie is slow. It is also very hard to understand. which leaves meny to believe that the movie is random and is about nothing in particular. how ever it is just the opposite. Second, the movie never really has a constant character all though the movie. which is not good for the development of the characters.But the things I listed may not seem that bad to some people. I think they are not so bad, but others disagree.So it comes down to this:if you like science fiction movie, and if you like movies that make you think you must watch this movie.

1976,parsaamiri-13076,Thus spoke Kubrick,10,30 October 2019,"Considered one of the most significant pieces of cinema ever made, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a philosophical magnum opus. The genius of its creation can easily explain a lot about people finding it a ""boring"" experience.
How often do you stumble upon people reading philosophical books which they find interesting? How often do you find people contemplating the abstract concepts and intuitions such as metaphysics and science?In a world enjoy being spoon-fed via the mass media and the dazzling technology, it is quite common to consider the Kardashians as popular and the Marvel universe as compelling.
These unpleasant remarks are even a sign that this movie is a great success. One that you can still relate to 50 years later. A little too close to the bone for anyone pondering over the future of the modern homo sapiens. A question yet to be answered for the ages to come.The Croatian-American philosopher, Daniel Kolak, considers philosophy to work as a plow in the farm of the mind. It rather raises questions than provides answers. This is how you should be prepared to face this movie. As Roger Ebert says: ""What he had actually done was make a philosophical statement about man's place in the universe, using images as those before him had used words, music or prayer. And he had made it in a way that invited us to contemplate it -- not to experience it vicariously as entertainment, as we might in a good conventional science-fiction film, but to stand outside it as a philosopher might, and think about it.""As for me, after watching a considerable number of movies, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" stands out as one of the most captivating movies I ever saw to this day.

I can imagine that the reason the scenes were so long and monotonous is because Kubrick wanted to show the audience the high-quality futuristic ships/planets/equipment, but by todays standards of sci-fi quality the props/equipment and planets look boring, only the astronaut where he fights the onboard comp, is where the movie shows some action, anyways if i would be watching this in '68 i would have prob linked it (otherwise id give it a 5)",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1980,khwiederaenders,It's like space looks great but is most blank space.,3,12 September 2006,Well I've watched this film quite a few times in my life and at first I hated it because quite honestly it wasn't so much a movie as it was a hour and a half of nonsense by a thirty minute modern art time warp. But after repeated viewings and several discussions about it I came to realize something. This film is Beautiful the last time I saw it I viewed it in HD and it completely blew me away. So if you get a chance view this movie. Well not the first part which has nothing to do with anything.(It was just a excuse to put people in poorly made monkey suits) But view the last thirty minutes or so that is the movies strong point.,2001 - A Space Odyssey
1981,vargassamy,It blew my mind,9,17 October 2020,"Oh my god this movie is insane, revolutionary and from another world. It catched my attention from the beginning and I was amazed as the movie went on, not being able to tell what was I feeling. The cinematography and the music are PERFECT. This is a must-watch film, you won't regret it (even if you like it or not).",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1982,sanketnkhairnar-36842,It's literally stupid!,2,22 September 2019,"It's a total wast of 2 hours of my life. I understand that it was released in 1968 and special effects are quite great, but that's it. I thought the story would be good when I read the reviews but I was immensely disappointed. I don't know if people in 1968 liked it's story or not, forme it wasn't worth it.
Apart from that, the movie is just too slow. It would've been a 60 minute short if it was 2019, I don't know. I get that it was intentional and Kubrick wanted to show the loneliness and stuff, and someone said something about art and philosophy (I mean what?) but it's really unnecessary. I thought the ending would be good, but it wasn't. There are so many science fiction movies who have so much of a better story that 2001. I don't know what the people in 1968 thought but to me it's the most highly overrated film ever.
The 2 stars are for the special effects in 1968.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1983,renderrob,The worst movie I've seen,1,27 February 2006,"2001:A Space Odyssey is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen. Unless you like to watch color tweaked aerial video of landscapes go by while listening to the most horrid, dissonant, chromatic choir arrangements for 15 minute segments, you won't--or at least shouldn't if you're in your right mind--like this movie.Scenes are dragged out to at least two or three times the length needed to tell the viewer what is happening. Throughout this movie, there are many points where the awful skull ringing music and anesthetizing imagery are dragged out for long sections of the film that serve no actual purpose. Unless you like watching monkeys clamor and then subside around a big gray tower for 5 minutes (all the while the music continues to resonate against the inside of the viewer's skull).They call it an ""art movie"", but that's simply no excuse for producing a movie that has no actual entertainment value.Instead, see a better movie, perhaps one of the following:Battlefield Earth, Stealth, or Gigli.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1984,OleHendriksen,What a waste of time,1,8 March 2006,"Complete waste of time , this movie does not live up to the expectations that i thought it would. After seeing it hitting so high scores , i figured it would be awesome , and i was stupid enough to borrow it from a friend .... There goes 2 Hours and 15 Minutes of my life ....The introduction of the movie , is completely lame , and a waste of movie if you ask me. 20 Minutes of watching monkeys and primates ....Then i figured it might turn out okay after a while , but nah , i was wrong .... They spent movie on recording the slightest warning button , and kept recording that for like a minute , like people wouldn't get the hint that it was a warning !!!! The end , weird !!!! I most definitely would never recommend anyone wasting life time on watching this movie , and it is beyond my knowledge , how the heck it could get such a high score here on IMDb !!!!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1986,yoursweet1,I didn't get it,1,13 March 2006,"I have started watching this movie a few times in years past, and finally took the weekend to slog through it. I just could never get past the unending bit with the fake-o monkeys before this. I think the movie might have been more meaningful and enjoyable if I had been stoned while watching it, but I don't do drugs. Truthfully, the story line (if there was one) lost me, and what did the monkeys have to do with ""The Dawn of Man"" anyway? The incredibly long sequences of overstimulating visuals backed by the mournful ""voice symphony"" almost had me pushing the ""eject"" button, but I was too bored to move. The only reason I give this movie even a ""1"" is because of the one masterful piece of original music at the beginning. The spaceships dancing to Strauss was simply inane.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
1987,Alwon_of_the_Black_Pearl,Pointless,1,13 March 2006,"2001: a space odyssey, is a film that tries to show that man is moving too fast, in his race for easy living. It starts out with the supposed beginning of man-kind, a bunch of monkeys trying to learn together. This is one of the best known scenes in history, although it promotes evolutionism, an accepted ""fact"" in the sixties. This does have purpose though, to the story, as it shows how life ""started out"" for us, and this movie is supposed to show how life will end for us. It's purpose, truly, was to show that technology and advancement, will be the end of mankind. At the time it was made, it was considered to be genius, and that certainly, by the time 2001 came, computers would be smarter than humans (and would try to take over the world) But as we have seen, this isn't completely true. I found this film to be slightly pointless.",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1990,marius772,Stupid movie,1,17 March 2006,"First of all what was the comment about - is the worst ever SF movie ever made.The action - if there is an action - take place over 2 and half hour and if u would made it normally time (21 century) - u would see that the action takes about 5 minutes to take place.Is very boring the way it moves,sloooowwwwwwwwly like the watcher has all the time to see about 10 minutes as an astronaut gets out of the ship with a shuttle.I recommend if u want to watch this movie always to control your forward button and maybe u will be spared about the pain watching it. Second - it might have been greatest movie off all times but in the 70's. The effects and the details about 2 min per object maybe interested older guys,but now is not at all like this.I want to apologies to whom feel offended about saying this about one of their favorites movies but - Third off all - i think that the base is not updated correctly.I am not saying all of this because i spend over 2 hours trying to find why is on top 10 but i am saying cause i took your top as a good top. I think the administrators of the site should do also a top bye time,like for 10 years,and not to gather all the voting over here that are miss leading,making the movie one of the best of SF when now a days is one of the awful movie. And 4 - i think i will be banned from writing again a comment from the administrators,although they say i'll be blacklisted by the others viewers.In this time the human still controls the computers!!",2001 - A Space Odyssey

1992,ivanmikhnenkov,The field you have to put your mind in,10,22 January 2019,"This film touches the deepest and the most eternal questions of the human species. It cannot be described by words without being gravely distorted. In fact, everybody would interpret it differently, because of its higly abstract art nature.Only curious and active mind, which is ready to think over and intensively reflect on the flow of images it percieves - would understand the value of this brilliant piece of art. May be, you would even get some kind of spiritual pleasure from it.If I have to describe what 2001: A Space Odyssey is - I'd say that this is the field provoking the highest thoughts one is capable to generate and process, the field you have to put your mind in. Your mind should be as open and clean as possible in order to percieve the influence of the field better.Please, lay off prejudices and skepsis, and get rid of any disctractors for the time you watch the movie and some time after it to think. Prepare your mind to change, that's worth it. This is my favourite movie of all time.",2001 - A Space Odyssey
