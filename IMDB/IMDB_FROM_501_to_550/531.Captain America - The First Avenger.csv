0,MartinHafer,Exceptional in almost every way...,9,22 July 2011,"I just returned from the midnight opening of ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" and I must say that I am a nut to be sitting here writing this review at 3am! But, considering how pumped I felt after seeing the film, I guess this is understandable.When the film began, the history teacher part of me was quite happy. Many films purport to try to replicate WWII and many fail miserably. However, aside from all the anachronisms (many of which were in the original WWII-era Captain America comics), the film got the look right. I think having Joe Johnston direct has a lot to do with this, as his job with ""The Rocketeer"" was also excellent in this regard. Getting down the look and style of the time is a big plus. Sure, the special effects were absolutely grand--but the little things such as hairstyles, dress and language all were quite vintage.The next thing I noticed about this film that sets it apart from some of the lesser films based on comics (such as ""Daredevil"") was that it had a great sense of fun and, occasionally, a nice sense of humor. While way too old for the role, Tommy Lee Jones had some really great lines--a few of which made me laugh--and shouldn't a superhero film be fun?! The third thing I noticed was that this film really could not have been made until recently. I am not just talking about the 3-D (which was nice but unnecessary as in most films) but the way they got Red Skull to look, the way they shrunk Chris Evans for the first portion of the film and the great giant plane scenes towards the end were all impossibilities until recently and made the film just look fabulous. The last superhero film that managed to look this good was ""Thor""--which, in my opinion, was about the equal to ""Captain America"" for overall quality and entertainment.Now despite me enjoying the acting, direction, set designs and practically everything else, there were a few minor things I did not like--and herein come a few spoilers. So, STOP READING unless you don't mind finding out a couple big plot points. Bucky's character seemed underdeveloped in the film and his apparent death came way too quickly. In addition, the big showdown with Red Skull and Captain America was way too brief. After all, Red Skull was also a super-soldier--so why did his demise happen so easily?! And, why didn't they just have him also crash into the ice at the end (allowing his return in subsequent films)? In other words, all this buildup--only to have it all resolved too quickly. But, despite these complaints, the overall film is as good a superhero film as you can find. Well worth seeing. And, like the best recent Marvel films, stay to the very end to see some more cool stuff and look for the cute cameo involving Stan Lee.",Captain America - The First Avenger
1,TheLittleSongbird,A couple of flaws but a lot of fun regardless,8,3 September 2011,"I love superhero movies when they are done right, and Captain America is one of the better ones I've seen recently and a big improvement over the 1990 film. Is it perfect? No. Entertaining? Yes, I think so. It is a very well made and efficiently directed film, with wonderful costumes, effects and settings and the cinematography and editing also impress. The music is rousing, and I just love Star Spangled Man, one of Alan Menken's best songs in my opinion. The script is witty and smart. Cheesy also? Perhaps but in an endearing sort of way. The story has a strong start, but loses its way to sluggish pacing and clichés in the final act. The characters are clichéd too in a sense but like the actors are engaging. Chris Evans is perfect in the title role, and he is joined by sassy Hayley Atwell and a wonderfully gruff Tommy Lee Jones. Hugo Weaving wasn't quite there for me, he is a great actor and he is charismatic and menacing, but his accent is inconsistent and the character could have been delved into more. Overall though, a lot of fun. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Captain America - The First Avenger
2,Leofwine_draca,Has potential before descending into an overblown CGI mess,4,23 March 2017,"Captain America: The First Avenger is the flagship re-launch of the popular American superhero, made as an introductory story for the character prior to him being included in THE AVENGERS team-up blockbuster. Having previously watched Albert Pyun's 1990s-era B-movie working of the same character, I'm afraid to say that that film was by far the superior of the two; this po-faced effort starts out well but soon descends into an unremarkable CGI action mess.The first hour of this film is the set-up of the tale and despite some weird effects (the skinny Chris Evans never quite convinces and is oddly creepy) it generally works well. It helps that the cast is ram-packed with familiar faces giving reliable performances, including the likes of Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones. Evans has a kind of likable charm here although he was better in other fare such as SNOWPIERCER. I adore Hayley Atwell and she's not bad, although a bit constrained by a prim and proper character; blame it on the poor writing and attempts at Britishness by the American scriptwriters.Unfortunately, once Evans becomes his proper superhero self, the pacing begins to flag and the action becomes slick, glossy, and unconvincing. The Brooklyn car chase is a good example of where this is going: the stunts are all CGI and poor looking, and the big set-pieces have actors acting against CGI backdrops and CGI opponents. It's all rather lame and the CGI has dated quite considerably in the six years since this film was released. A pity, as a slightly less overblown staging of the events may have made it more convincing and a better movie. Let's hope the sequel, THE WINTER WARRIOR, is better.",Captain America - The First Avenger
3,SnoopyStyle,Like Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell,7,25 January 2014,"During World War II, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a 90lb weakling who keeps getting rejected for military services. Then Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his potential and recruits him for his secret scientific program where he encounters Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). Rogers undergoes an experiment that makes him a new super soldier. Meanwhile the Nazis have invest heavily in a secret weapons research agency called HYDRA. Only the head of HYDRA Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) has bigger goals and his own ambitions.I really like the skinny Chris Evans even thought it's odd to hear his voice coming out. He and Hayley Atwell have good chemistry before and after the transformation. Their relationship is better than the usual comic book movie. As far as the action goes, it's all very CGI. That's not unexpected. However the cartoon nature and the overuse of montages really takes away much of the tension. After a good first half, the second half gets into a rambling flow of jagged story telling. Even the climax lacks the needed excitement. This ends more as a setup for future sequels.",Captain America - The First Avenger
4,Hitchcoc,It's Good to Be Uninformed,6,21 July 2015,"As I've said in the past, I go to these comic book movies with little knowledge of the foundation of work put forth over many years. I had already seen the sequel to this one and wondered what some of the schtick was about. It answered my questions. My responses are quite basic. For one thing, I love seeing Nazis get theirs and this allows that, although the guy is more than a National Socialist. The character of Captain America is quite delightful and full of sap. I love that shield. He can hit a three rail shot and take a guy's head off from fifty yards. Overall, it was fun to see how he came to be. It was great entertainment as an entire battalion troops into camp after he has saved them from imprisonment. Of course, considering the enemy firepower, one must question the lack of casualties. I'm sure I'll see the third movie. Apparently, Marvel now produces about half the big budget movies released.",Captain America - The First Avenger
5,Horst_In_Translation,"Oh Captain, my Captain!",6,9 October 2017,"""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is an American (of course!) 2-hour movie from 2011 and the first of so far 3 films about the world's first Avenger. Or lets say with the world's first Avenger in the center of it all as Chris Evans' character also showed up in other recent Marvel movies. The cast includes many known names such as Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci, who are fun as always, especially in their scenes together. The main antagonist is played by Hugo Weaving who you certainly know from the Matrix trilogy. And if you take a look at some other cast members, you will find the likes of Hayley Atwell for example who got her own series afterward. In terms of the story, it is almost always entertaining and rarely just another generic superhero film. I liked how they emphasized the American military aspects, for example that we see the Captain attack with an army of soldiers and some are killed because this is war. It fit the character nicely unlike for example in the Avengers movie where he is a lone wolf character like the others. But back to this one here: There are moments like this like for example the TLJ steak scene (and I am saying this as a vegetarian) and many others like the brilliant ""Star Spangled Man with a Plan"" sequence that should have won a Best Song Oscar or how we see the Captain struggle to gain the forces' respect and support on one occasion especially.The transformation was also handled nicely all in all. The weaker components? Well the villain character was not really that memorable apart from his (transformed) looks of course, but I wouldn't blame Weaving for that. It's not that bad though. I also was not too fond of all the girls/romance parts and honestly I could have done without the Peggy Carter character completely, but then it would have been 100% sausage fest and I can see how they didn't want that. I am not sure if I disliked the actress or the character, but something didn't feel right there. To end the review on a positive note though, the way it should be, let me say that the way in which they connected the end of this film and the beginning of The Avengers was handled very competently and it fit really well together, even if I admittedly will never really be too fond of SLJ as Fury, even if I adore the actor in other projects. The positive in this Captain America movie is definitely more frequent than the negative and that's why I think it is a good watch. A must see actually for American patriots and Marvel film buffs. Go check it out if you are among the not too many who haven't already. In my opinion, this one gets even better on rewatch. I think I liked it less during the first time I saw it as now I am even curious about the sequels and I think Evans was a really good casting decision for the central character.",Captain America - The First Avenger
6,claudio_carvalho,Extremely Nationalist but Enjoyable,7,18 December 2011,"In 1942, the weedy and sick Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is determined to enlist the military service to serve in World War Ii, but all his attempts are rejected by the military doctors. His determination, courage and goodness attracts the attention of Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), who is ahead of the secret Project Rebirth, and Steve is summoned to be submitted to an experiment to become stronger and stronger. However, Dr. Erskine is murdered by an agent of HYDRA, a secret German agency led by the powerful and cruel Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). Steve is used by politicians to promote the selling of war bonus and recruit new soldiers to fight in the war. However, when his best friend James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is captured with his regiment by Johann, Captain America heads to the fortress where he finds that the insane Johann Schmidt is actually the dangerous Red Skull. Captain America rescues Bucky and his soldiers and begins to battle against Red Skull and his powerful warriors.""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is an extremely nationalist but enjoyable action film. The beginning with the weak Steve Rogers being bullied and beaten by stronger guys is funny and entertaining. His exhibition on the stage in Italy is too much nationalist, boring and annoying. His romance with Peggy Carter has no chemistry, and the technology of the Project Rebirth and HYDRA is too much ahead of time. However, if the viewer forgets the flaws, he or she may find ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" an entertaining ""popcorn"" film like I did. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): ""Capitão América: O Primeiro Vingador"" (""Captain America: The First Avenger"")",Captain America - The First Avenger
7,nogodnomasters,Do you fondue?,9,22 March 2018,"The movie starts at its WWII origins. Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers a puny 4F man who has lied his way into a military science experiment. Tommy Lee Jones plays an excellent Colonel. Meanwhile evil Nazi Hugo Weaving believing he is Darth Maul, has his own plans for world conquest using sharks with frickin' laser beams. (Just kidding about the sharks.) Rogers is a 90 pound weakling who displays intellect, courage, and guts. He is selected for the military's secret program and is transformed into a muscular super hero. The special effects were very good, although we do know from ""Last Action Hero"" you can't really jump around car roofs. After Rogers is transformed he becomes Captain America to be used as a recruiting tool, as Tommy Lee still has his doubts about the 90 pound weakling.Of course things change and the rest of the story shouldn't be too hard to figure out, even if you don't read comics. Now the very end utilizes the one-eyed Samuel L. Jackson from Iron Man 2 which hints at an ultimate sequel providing everyone isn't dead by then.The movie combines action, drama, light comedy, and light romance. Good acting, good dialogue, good frickin' laser beams.No swearing, nudity, or sex.",Captain America - The First Avenger
8,kosmasp,"Gotta take a stand, it don't help to hide",8,16 January 2012,"You might recognize the summary line as part of the theme song Hulk Hogan had (Real American). It does fit with the movie too, of course. Our main character is someone who is taking a stand and does not want to hide. Even against all odds (and if you haven't seen the trailer or read the comic books, you'll be surprised by them!) he still is motivated like nobody else.Of course some might have trouble finding his inspirations. But that is not that point. It's also not good trying to figure out if technology that is shown in the movie actually existed back then. First of all, this would have been secret anyways and nobody would have known about those things and secondly: It's a movie. If you think what is shown in here is history (though it might take a few historic elements into the storyline) then you are sadly mistaken or too young to understand. If the latter ask an adult or better yet: Read a book/watch a documentary.The fact that the movie is a period piece might also be one of its downfalls (boxoffice wise that is). That and the fact that people seem to have seen enough comic book movies contribute to the fact, that this hasn't been received so well. Other than that, this is in no way inferior to other comic book movies that made more or less money than this.I liked it a lot and although you don't get a real tag-scene at the end (something we have grown accustomed to with Marvels heroes), some did get very excited by what followed after the end credits rolled: A glimpse at the Avengers movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger
9,classicsoncall,"""Don't win the war till I get there.""",7,12 February 2012,"If I had rated and reviewed this picture when it first came out it would have scored a notch higher. Watching today though it lost some of it's original magic, and begged the question - do I have to watch every movie more than once to give it an objective score? I just don't have the time or inclination to do that.On balance, the first half of the story, well maybe the first third of the story is what bears kudos. I like to see how movies handle the origin stories of comic book characters that originated way back in the Thirties and Forties. ""Batman Begins"" was a good one for example in the DC Universe, along with the modernized version of the origin of Spider-Man that kick started the Marvel movie franchise. The super serum project that amplified Steve Rogers' ninety pound weakling physique into that of a steroid freak was particularly effective here.What I didn't care for this second time around was the latter part of the story with it's over extended battle scene between Cap (Chris Evans) and Red Skull (Hugo Weaving). The Nazi villain's demise was way too anti-climactic, and given the decades long relationship between Captain America and his friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) in the comics world, his death here seemed contrived and almost certain to disappoint Cap fans.One of the pluses for me, and I always mention this, is the appearance of Marvel Comics legend Stan Lee in a cameo role. This time around he shows up as Army brass at a Captain America war bond drive. Another would have been at the very end when Cap wakes up from his frozen slumber and enters a new age, to be greeted by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and commissioned into a modern day assignment. Here's hoping The Avengers raises the bar at least back up to the level of the original ""Iron Man"".",Captain America - The First Avenger
10,jboothmillard,Captain America: The First Avenger,6,1 May 2012,"From director Joe Johnston (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Jumanji, Jurassic Park III), with Superman, Wonder Woman and Spider-Man the superhero of this Marvel comics based film has a very iconic costume, and I was keen to see what it would be like. Basically, set in 1942, World War II has begun, and Steve Rogers (Fantastic Four's Chris Evans) from New York City is keen to join the fight, but he has been rejected a few times because of his health and physical problems. It is only after overhearing a conversation that Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) helps him enlist in the army, the scientist has recruited him for a new ""super soldier"" experiment, with Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) and British agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) also keeping an eye on him. Phillips is for a while unconvinced, but Steve's conviction and self sacrifice change his mind, and before the real experiment treatment goes ahead Steve is warned of what happened to Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) who suffered bad effects after an imperfect version. While Schmidt and his sidekick Dr. Arnim Zola (Toby Jones) are harnessing the energies of the powerful tesseract cube, Steve goes through the super soldier treatment, with special serum injected into his body with doses of ""vita-rays"", and he emerges from the chamber bigger and muscular than before. The success of the experiment is short lived though when Schmidt's assassin Heinz Kruger (Richard Armitage) kills Dr. Erskine, and destroys the formula tubes, and Steve goes after him in a big chase, but the assassin kills himself with a cyanide capsule before he can be questioned. With the experiment lost Steve is given a position so scientists cannot study him and rediscover the formula, he is given a colourful stars and stripes costume to become ""Captain America"" and promote war bonds, before hearing his friend James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan) may be in trouble. Steve has Peggy and Howard Stark, Tony's father (Dominic Cooper) take him behind enemy lines to rescue Barnes and other captured soldier, also meeting Schmidt who reveals his true face under his skin mask, a skull-like red face, hence his other name ""the Red Skull"", and they all return to base. Next Steve, Timothy 'Dumb Dumb' Dugan (Band of Brothers' Neal McDonough), Gabe Jones (Derek Luke), Jim Morita (Kenneth Choi), James Montgomery Falsworth (J. J. Feild), and Jacques Dernier (Bruno Ricci) attacking other bases run by the evil organisation HYDRA, and Stark gives Steve an experimental circular shield made of rare vibranium, an indestructible metal. A mission on a train sees Barnes fall to his death, and they capture Zola, and he gives them information that leads them onto a mission to stop Schmidt using weapons of mass destruction on American cities, and in the process of the fight the tesseract is damaged. Schmidt handles the powerful cube, and dissolves into bright light, while the cube melts the floor and falls to Earth, and Steve is still in the plane, and with no way to land it safely with the weapons on board he starts it heading to the ground in the Arctic. Stark is seen finding the tesseract in the ocean, while Steve awakes in a 1940s style hospital room, but he recognises a radio broadcast he already heard, and he breaks out of the fake scenario to find himself in present day New York, Times Square, and meeting S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who reveals he has been asleep for 70 years. Also starring Harry Potter's David Bradley as Tower Keeper and Stan Lee as General. I thought it was odd that Evans was cast as another Marvel comics hero, having already been The Human Torch, but it is actually a really good choice as he is straightforward and determined, Weaving is a good power crazed villain, and Jones gets some good moments as the concerned Colonel. The story obviously sets up that he is the first Marvel hero in history, and will lead onto Avengers Assemble, the story is pretty easy to understand with the world destruction trying to be stopped concept, less so with the political war stuff, and the special effects accompanied with good fights definitely keep you engaged, an entertaining wartime action adventure. Good!",Captain America - The First Avenger
11,ccthemovieman-1,Nice Old-Fashioned Hero Meets Goofy Sci-Fi Villain,7,26 December 2011,"This had both a ""classic era"" and a ""modern-day adventure feel to it.It was a throw-back adventure story in the sense that the hero is a totally likable, patriotic guy and there is no profanity in the movie. It was similar to most of today's movies in that it added sci-fi, occult-type stuff to the WWII story and had overdone action scenes. Thus, overall it was okay.....entertaining but could have been better with a few more lulls and less sensational material, particularly in the second half of the movie when things get carried away. The first half is intriguing and well done.Chris Evans as ""Steve Rogers/Captain America"" was good and a convincing average-guy type hero. The villain ""Red Skull"" (Hugo Weaver) was ludicrous and very unconvincing.The two halves balance out to a film worth a rental, but not a purchase. Had it been more of WWII story than another of these goofy mysticism action flicks, it could have been better.",Captain America - The First Avenger
12,BA_Harrison,All-American superhero fun.,7,10 May 2014,"With its clean-cut all-American hero, beautiful heroine, nasty Nazi villains, and airborne action finalé, Captain America reminds me of Joe Johnston's earlier 1991 WWII 'superhero' movie, The Rocketeer; like that film, this Marvel superhero origin story proves to be a solidly entertaining adventure, but one that never really knocks the ball out of the park.In my opinion, Johnston has always been a competent action director, and knows how to use his special effects to best effect, and here he once again provides a very slick and entertaining popcorn movie, but he's yet to make a film that has really blown my socks off. Captain America comes close at times, but lacks that special wow factor to make it a bona fide classic of the genre.Still, it's undemanding fun for the duration, never pretending to be anything more than a rollicking World War tale designed to cleverly tie in this character with the other Avengers; and it's certainly more enjoyable than the drearier superhero movies of recent years—I'll take this film over dreadfully overblown nonsense like The Dark Knight or Man of Steel any day of the week!I look forward to The Winter Soldier, which by all accounts is even better",Captain America - The First Avenger
13,paul_haakonsen,A breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale superhero genre...,6,15 October 2011,"Alright, well first of all I have to say that I am not really a fan of superhero movies. And with that being said, then let me just say WOW! This movie was without a doubt one of the better superhero movies that I have seen in a long time.I am not keen on super powers bestowed upon people and such, hence I am more prone to watch something like ""Batman"" or ""Captain America"", where it is all in the gear and the actual person themselves; not some dim-witted superhero power! And it worked well in this movie, despite the lead role of Captain America being played by Chris Evans who we also saw in the ""Fantastic Four"" movies. What? No! No! NO! Please do not re-cast an actor already used in a previous superhero movie. It is just so wrong! Don't get me wrong here, Chris Evans is not a bad actor, far from it. He was really well cast for Captain America, and he far out-shined his performance here than what was seen in ""Fantastic Four"". But the damage have been done, he played Human Torch in ""Fantastic Four"", so he shouldn't had been cast for this movie. Or better yet, never been cast for ""Fantastic Four"", so he would have had this role to shine through in.Anyway, ""Captain America"", this movie is action from start to end, and it works quite well. There was lots of good action scenes, nice fight scenes, and lots of really cool stuff to look at. Lots of nice small details everywhere.However, one thing that really bugs me in movies with Germans or Nazi, please do not have them speak English with a weird German-inspired accent. It just discredits the entire movie. They had the Norwegian people speak Norwegian, so why not have a German cast to fill out the roles of the Hydra folk? That was an epic fail, and it really brought down the movie a notch for me.Another thing that had me puzzled was the level of technology available to the Hydra people. Come on, this was during the 1940s, during World War II, and I am sure if that technology was available, Germany would have won the war - not that I am in any way rooting for Nazis or anything. I am just saying that the level of high-tech gear and stuff that was in the movie was misplaced and seemed too stupid for that era.The cast in ""Captain America"" was quite good. I especially liked Chris Evans (playing Captain America/Steve Rogers), he was cut out for that role. Hugo Weaving (playing Johann Schmidt/Red Skull) also did a good job, though he should not be speaking English - there were times where his pronunciations had images of Schwarzenegger flashing through my mind! Tommy Lee Jones (playing Col. Chester Philips) did it good, as always.I am not one bit familiar with Captain America, though I did read some comics when I was a young boy, but got no recollection of them. So I found this movie to be quite entertaining, as I had no prerequisite hopes or expectations for the movie holding true to the comic book universe.So if you like a good action movie, where you of course get the American patriotism tossed at you in endless streams, then ""Captain America"" is a good choice for an evening's entertainment. I, despite not being American, was thoroughly entertained with the movie, and the small annoying flaws of the movie were quickly drowned out by a captivating story and the cool action.",Captain America - The First Avenger
14,blanche-2,fun,7,1 March 2014,"I will say up front I know nothing about Captain America, nothing about Marvel Comics, and I'm not a connoisseur of special effects.That all being said, Captain America was highly entertaining.Chris Evans is the scrawny Steve Rogers, who, after trying without fail to get into World War II, is chosen by a scientist, Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) for an experiment called Project Rebirth. Steve is transformed into the superhuman to create the all-powerful man, who becomes Captain America. Dr. Erskine is assassinated by a HYDRA agent - HYDRA being the Nazi secret research.Initially Rogers is misused, sent out to sell war bonds. However, he abandons this when his good friend Bucky and his unit are caught behind enemy lines. Then he finally gets into the war as he has always wanted.Great cast, including Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Toby Jones, Neal McDonough, and Samuel L. Jackson.I really liked the effects, although I gather some people thought they weren't that good. What I liked the most was the old-fashioned ambiance, which was very well done.Enjoyable.",Captain America - The First Avenger
15,tavm,Captain America: The First Avenger is the best filmed version of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby's creation yet!,9,25 July 2011,"So, after spending the last month watching the previous films that depicted Captain America in live action, I finally watched this latest one in 3-D with my movie theatre-working friend and I have to say right now, this was the most awesome of them all! I mean, finally, they get it right in having the true origin of how Steve Rogers went from a skinny weakling classified as 4-F to one becoming 1-A because of a scientist named Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) showing an interest in him. Those scenes with Tucci and Chris Evans as the eventual superhero bring gravitas to what makes Cap such a great patriot. Also great are the supporting cast of Tommy Lee Jones as the doubting Colonel Chester Phillips and Hayley Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter whose spunk and looks make her one of the most alluring leading ladies in these comic book superhero-based movies. Then there's Hugo Weaving as the great villain Johann Schmidt a.k.a The Red Skull. He's sure a hell of a lot more menacing than the one depicted in the 1990 Captain America, that's for sure! If there's one disappointment, it's that while there's a Bucky at last in one of these CA movie adaptations, he's not a teenage boy and he doesn't even wear the costume associated with him. Instead, he's just an enlisted friend about Steve's age who happens to travel with him when they go on missions. Though at least there's still enough of a friendship between them that we get it when Steve tries to drown himself in drink after James Buchanan Barnes (Sebastian Stan) falls off. And I also believed in the almost-relationship between Steve and Peggy. And most of the action scenes were great especially Cap's chase with a stolen taxi. And how about those humorous touches like Steve's shilling for war bonds with dancing girls and ""Adolf Hitler"" in tow? So on that note, Captain America: The First Avenger gets a high recommendation from me.",Captain America - The First Avenger
16,ComedyFan2010,Not a masterpiece but entertaining.,7,28 August 2017,"Not really a masterpiece but an entertaining superhero movie.It doesn't have much originality, so I don't know how it was to watch for people who love this genre. For me who just watches it once in a while it was entertaining enough.I really liked how they made Chris Evans into a skinny guy. I didn't see much of him before so I wasn't sure if they have visually pumped him up or other way around. So well done with visual effects.My favorite part is when he goes to save his friend Bucky and they do all the fighting. It was beautiful and also exciting. Yet this was somewhere in the middle of the movie. The final fighting scenes didn't top it for me, and it is kind of sad when the peak of the movie is so far from the end.I did like the twist at the end as well. Him waking up in our time.

19,preppy-3,Surprisingly dull,4,1 August 2011,"Based on the comic book. In the 1940s Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is deemed unfit for military service being too small and frail. He takes part in an experiment that makes him tall, ridiculously muscular and possessing almost superhuman strength. He joins the army and helps them battle the evil Nazi the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving).I heard a lot of good things about this movie and was surprised to see how dull it was. It takes far too long setting up the back story and Cap doesn't show up until 30 minutes in. I don't mind slow movies but this was deadly dull. The movie drones on and on and moves in fits and starts. I never got involved in the characters or the story. Also there's tons of casual violence but no blood (to get the all important PG-13 rating). The special effects are good but don't help that much. Evans is OK as Captain America but he comes off as sort of dull. He never shows any range of emotion. Hayley Atwell walks through her role as Peggy Carter. She's not a bad actress but she's given nothing to work with. Tommy Lee Jones gives yet another bad performance as an Army colonel. He can do this part in his sleep--and he does! Weaving sneers his way through his role and plays the Red Skull as a one-dimensional evil man. Only Dominic Cooper(as Howard Stark) and Sebastian Stan (as Bucky) give good performances. This isn't the worst comic book movie ever (that award goes to ""Green Lantern"") but it's slow and dull. I give this a 4.",Captain America - The First Avenger
20,CinemaSerf,Great looking boy's-own hero stuff...,7,11 November 2021,"Weedy young ""Steve Rodgers"" (Chris Evans) has been trying to join up to fight in WWII for a while - but each time he tries, he is rejected. Frustrated by the success of his buddy ""Bucky"" (Sebastian Stan) at both joining up, and with the girls - he signs up for a programme run by ""Dr. Erskine"" (Stanley Tucci) which sees a pretty miraculous change. Just in time, too - Hugo Weaving's ""Schmidt"" is an erstwhile Nazi scientist who is hell bent on world domination. There is something charming about the design of this film - and in many ways it exemplifies just why this hero captured the imagination of young Americans. The hero is a decent character - and, indeed, much more emphasis is placed on the characterisations here than in many similarly themed productions. Sadly, though, Hayley Atwell is as wooden as ever, but the pink-headed Weaving makes for quite an effective baddie and the whole thing has a class about it that augments the entertainment well. It's got plenty of action but somehow these visual effects look much more authentic, they are more subtle (a little like ""Sky Captain"" from 2004) and the characters have more depth. Maybe not the most successful of the Marvel iterations, but I'd say one of the best.",Captain America - The First Avenger
21,Bunuel1976,"CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER (Joe Johnston, 2011) ***",7,15 August 2011,"Although the character of comic strip hero Captain America has been adapted cinematically as early as 1944 (in a serial that also featured horror stalwart Lionel Atwill) and has been rebooted relatively recently (in two TV movies in the late 1970s – including one in which appeared another genre icon, Christopher Lee! – and a fairly maligned theatrical movie from 1990), this is the first wholly successful transposition of Marvel's original heroic character (as the title itself points out) to the silver screen. Needless to say, as would be the fashion with his later counterparts, the patriotic avenger had also been the protagonist of his own (relatively short) 13-part animated TV series that I fondly recall watching as a kid.Thankfully, the film-makers here wisely decided to adhere to the WWII origins of the character and did not tinker unnecessarily with it by making him hipper so as to be more palatable to the short attention-span audiences of the 21st Century; indeed, when we first see Chris Evans here he is the complete antithesis (short, alarmingly skinny and prone to being beat up every 10 minutes!) of the accepted/expected superhero image. He plays Steve Rogers who, for all his eagerness to do his bit for Uncle Sam, finds himself – just like Buster Keaton in THE GENERAL (1927) – continually rejected and is only thanks to his chance encounter with German scientist (and refugee from the Nazi regime!) Stanley Tucci that he gets to perform his civic duty in ways far more effectively than he could ever have imagined. Incidentally, Evans had earlier made inauspicious superhero appearances as one the ""Fantastic Four"" in two middling and decidedly juvenile adventures.The supporting cast is headed by Tommy Lee Jones (initially a stereotype but one eventually warms to him), Hugo Weaving (he had himself played an avenger in V FOR VENDETTA {2006}, and also appeared in THE WOLFMAN {2010} with the same director – his ""Red Skull"" make-up elicits uncomfortable comparisons with the awful GHOST RIDER {2007} but the character is well enough written to dispel these immediately), Hayley Atwell (her opinionated character provides a surprisingly fresh take on the typical heroine model in this type of fare) and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (father of Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark!).The fact that WWII is being fought here by way of enhanced muscles on one side and black magic on the other is liable to displease purists, but the triumph of the little guy over all sorts of adversity is what really counts (with Weaving clearly a substitute for any dictator/terrorist you may wish to cite, and God knows history has provided enough of those!). Still, one would have expected the Fuehrer to put in an appearance and how he planned to deal with ""Red Skull"" who was usurping his power and, by way of his disintegrating ray-gun, stealing his thunder! Director Johnston proved an ideal choice, having helmed the similar and equally delightful ROCKETEER (1991). Action scenes are reasonable but, thankfully, not overly cluttered that one cannot figure out what is going on. Interestingly, the CGI effects are employed to shrink Evans' physique rather than to excessively build it up! As for the interlude with Captain America as morale-boosting poster-boy, it may have been a narrative necessity but it is also a dent in the film's pace (despite the evocative use of montage). The finale, then, leaps into the future, making for yet another Samuel L. Jackson cameo as Nick Fury, with the typical (and, by-now, expected) Marvel Studios post-credits sequence actually being the teaser trailer to their blockbuster for next Summer i.e. the superhero and star-studded THE AVENGERS!",Captain America - The First Avenger
22,utgard14,The Sentinel of Liberty,7,24 April 2014,"Captain America is Marvel's Superman. A hero respected by all. All who matter, at least. It was a daunting task to bring him to the big screen but they did an amazing job. The acting is terrific. Chris Evans IS Cap and was spot-on casting, though I initially had my doubts when he was first announced. He brought the character to life in ways that few actors today could have. He's immensely likable and gives Cap that presence that he has to have for us to believe people would respect and follow him, especially since the movie has to unfortunately rush his earning that respect. Hayley Atwell is an excellent Peggy Carter, beautiful and strong. Hugo Weaving is a little one-note as the Red Skull but that's a problem with the script more than his performance. Tommy Lee Jones is fine in an unnecessary role as a cynical Army colonel.The special effects are fabulous. The look of the Skull and the way they convincingly placed Evans' face on the skinny body were both praiseworthy effects. I also enjoyed the old school sci-fi machinery and technology. They did a great job getting down the look of the period, if not always the lingo. The action was good, though there were no real stand-out sequences. The tone of the film was perfect. It's nice to have superhero films not steeped in navel-gazing and pathos. The Marvel films in general are excellent in this area compared to the DC films or the Marvel ones made by other studios. Superhero films don't all have to follow a mold but it's good to have bright, positive characters like Captain America represented in films the way they should be. However, it's not all perfect. I did have a few problems. First, the costume. I guess they did their best and this is likely to be the most faithful representation we'll ever get but I still wish it had been more classic Cap than modern Cap. Comics fans will know what I mean. Second, the fight with Red Skull was extremely brief. All that buildup for something that lasted a minute. Third, I'm not a big fan of movies that don't feel like they have a beginning, middle, and end. I give some latitude on intended trilogies like Lord of the Rings but movies like this should be able to stand on their own while also setting up for sequels. I just felt this one ended just as things were getting really good. I knew the story would continue on in other movies but I don't see why Cap, like Thor and Iron Man, couldn't have a complete movie of his own that also served its purpose on the larger shared universe story with the other films. The last half-hour felt rushed and the cliffhanger ending, while poignant, stuck a bit in my craw.Those criticisms aside, it's a marvelous film (no pun intended). It accomplished what it needed to. It brought a hard-to-translate character to the big screen in an impressive way. It paid proper respect to Steve Rogers, the man, and Captain America, the symbol. It treated the character seriously with no snide sideways remarks or 21st century cynicism about patriotism. Most importantly, it's just a fun movie with the right mix of humor, action, and heart.",Captain America - The First Avenger
23,zardoz-13,"Red, White, and Blue!!!",10,1 August 2011,"""Rocketeer"" director Joe Johnston's ""Captain America"" amounts to a timeless David versus Goliath tale set in the Marvel Comics' universe where good always trumps evil. Unlike ""Thor"" and ""Green Lantern,"" ""Captain America"" ranks as a thoroughly spectacular but larger-than-life extravaganza with a genuinely charismatic hero struggling against a marvelously malignant villain. Chris Evans' engaging performance as the 'First Avenger' is something else, too! If you recall, Evans had the time of his life several years ago playing egotistical Johnny Storm, aka 'the Human Torch,' in the two ""Fantastic Four"" flicks. Make no mistake; Evans is nothing like he was in those two super heroic sagas. Indeed, ""Captain America"" boasts some amazing special effects, but its best special effect is the sincerity that Evans brings to the role of Steve Rogers. Whether he plays Rogers as either a scrawny, 98-pound zero or a brawny, fleet-footed hero, Evans imparts heart to this $140-million thriller. During the first half of ""Captain America,"" Johnston gradually builds the momentum to let us grow accustomed to Evans as a scrappy little fellow who suffers the wrath of bullies. This pathetic weakling refuses to let anybody keep him down, and it's fun because Evans makes it look so authentic despite the obvious CGI effects. Hugo Weaving registers as the ideal villain who holds the upper hand throughout most of the supercharged shenanigans. Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell co-star respectively as Captain America's superior and his love interest.""Captain America"" opens in the present before it reverts to the past. Typically, movies with contemporary openings and endings sacrifice any sense of suspense. After all, you know if the characters thrive in the present that they must not have suffered in the past. Basically, this constitutes nothing more than a narrative cinematic convention. The chief difference here is that we're only given a glimpse of Captain America's legendary star-spangled shield instead of the eponymous protagonist himself. Anyway, the film unfolds in the frozen wasteland of the Arctic Circle as a Russian oil expedition stumbles onto something buried in the ice. They contact the Americans who slice into the ice with a laser, find a commodious craft of unknown origin, and uncover a circular red, white, and blue shield with a star. The scene shifts to March 1942 as despicable Nazi officer Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving of ""The Matrix"") and his men storm into Tønsberg, Norway, and confiscate an enigmatic tesseract. Essentially, this is a magical cube boasting incalculable power. Supposedly, the tesseract was a fabulous jeweled artifact that belonged to the legendary Norse god Odin. Once anybody lays their eyes on it, they are no longer the same. Meanwhile, in New York City, the U.S. military brands Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) unfit for duty owing to a myriad of health problems. The resilient Rogers tries to enlist again when his buddy James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan of ""Black Swan"") takes him to a showcase of futuristic technologies. Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci of ""Easy A"") eavesdrops on Rogers' conversation with Barnes about his desperate need to get into combat. Suitably impressed by Rogers' attitude, Erskine allows him to enlist. Moreover, Erskine recruits Rogers as part of a ""super-soldier"" experiment under the aegis of Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones of ""Coal Miner's Daughter"") and Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell of ""The Duchess""). Phillips displays considerable skepticism about Erskine's contention that Rogers qualifies as the ideal candidate for the procedure. One day during a training exercise, Phillips lobs a grenade among the recruits. Everybody but Rogers scrambles for cover, while he smothers the grenade with his frail body. Predictably, the grenade is a dummy, but Rogers' act of self-sacrificing bravery convinces the colonel that he is the appropriate choice. No sooner has Rogers emerged from the procedure as an entirely new man with a buffed up body than a Nazi saboteur steps in and kills Erskine. As it turns out, Erskine keep no notes except those in his head. After Erskine dies, Rogers experiences his new-found strength and captures the saboteur. The saboteur lives long enough to warn Rogers that he has to face more of his kind before he crunches on a cyanide capsule and croaks. Roger wins fame and acclaim across the country, but he suffers a setback because he is the first and only of his kind. Colonel Phillips reassigns him and Roger ends up at War Bond rallies where he acts like a cheerleader surrounded by dancing girls. Eventually, when our hero learns that his best friend has been caught, he disobeys orders and leads an inspirational rescue behind enemy lines. Now that Rogers has proved himself, he must face the Red Skull. The Red Skull is Nazi officer Johann Schmidt and he is so ambitious that he not only wants to crush America but also Adolf Hitler. Talk about a villain to end all villains! Anybody who has read the reprints of the World War 2 era ""Captain America"" comic book should be thrilled with the way that ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" scenarists Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have handled the original material by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. Of course, Johnston and his scribes have ratcheted up the hardware for the big transformation scene that turns Steve Rodgers into Captain America. Altogether, ""Captain America"" is a predictable but entertaining comic book movie with sensational special effects and a sympathetic hero. If you are a Marvel Comic fan, you should stick around after the lengthy end credits for a glimpse of the forthcoming ""Avengers"" film due for release in May 2012.",Captain America - The First Avenger

26,Boba_Fett1138,Meh!,6,25 April 2012,"No, I won't say that this is a bad movie but it is a very average one, in about every department.I truly had a hard time discovering a main plot line in this movie. I know that it's mostly supposed to be an origins story but it either should had been a complete origin story or one that told about the origins of Steve Rogers/Captain America, in its first 10 minutes or so and then continued further with its action. The movie now is half of everything. The first half is the origins story, while the second half of the movie is being a more traditional superhero movie, in which our hero has to battle an evil villain, who tries to take over the world, with his occult powers. It's not balanced out all too well in my opinion and made the movie also a bit of a messy one, with its pacing and storytelling.It also was a problem that I just couldn't ever like- or care enough for the movie its main character. Captain America just came across as a pretty dull character, with not enough charisma. He just didn't had enough in him for me to like him well enough, which also caused me to care even less about this movie and everything that was happening in it.But the one character that was even more worse and disappointing was the main villain, the Red Skull, played by Hugo Weaving. What the point of his red skull was? I have no idea. And further more, he also remains terribly underdeveloped and gets poorly used in this movie. He doesn't have enough scenes and is being far too stereotypical, for a superhero movie villain. Nothing about him ever works out as anything threatening or surprising at all.Now, people that I did like in this movie were Tommy Lee Jones and...well, that was it I suppose. All of the other characters remain far too shallow and besides stereotypical to ever make a real impression.It seemed like the movie had plenty of good ideas in it but putting all of the ideas together and turn it into one great, well flowing movie, was a whole different nut to crack for them. So actually I'm not saying that the Captain America character and franchise doesn't has a bright future ahead of it but they need to come up with a better story next time, also to make all of the characters some more compelling ones.Of course it's not being a terrible movie by any means. I mean, it still has plenty of entertainment value to it and it sill is a big and slick looking movie, with all of its effects and settings and some decent enough action. Still I can't help but to feel disappointed, with overall the movie.6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Captain America - The First Avenger
27,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,One of the best of the recent ones,8,12 August 2011,"During World War II, Steve Rogers is turned down for military service due to being about a third the size of a usual adult male, but he gets a chance to fulfill his dream of serving(this is surprisingly enough not as jingoistic and blindly nationalist as you might think, it pokes fun at that, with propaganda pieces and being more about real patriotism, courage and wanting peace) when he gets to test out a super soldier serum(try saying that three times fast). Meanwhile, The Red Skull has plans for the future of the world that need to stopped. The characters tend to be memorable, the supporting cast really adding. We have Tony Stark's father Howard who's the good guys' team's tech guy and just as careless as his son, a strong female agent who fought her way to her rank and Tommy Lee Jones playing himself and being the biggest badass in the entire thing(impressive, when you consider that he looks roughly 180 years old in this), and delivers every line of his perfectly(he could do it in his sleep, and possibly did, and it's still incredible). The acting is great for all concerned(who didn't know that Weaving could play a fantastic villain? And the nuance(same with the colors on our titular hero's costume) is well-chosen, it doesn't feel silly, and it seems like it's make-up, it follows his facial movements), and most of the dialog is, as well, with a lot of funny, natural and quotable lines. A lot of time passes before the action kicks in, at which point there is plenty of it and it's nearly all fun and effective. The look is remarkably well-done, sepia, art deco and really makes you believe that we're seeing the 40's. Cap fights(with his every punch launching people flying) Hydra(not Nazis... is this what political correctness has come to?), and they have awesomely designed suits and weapons powered by an amazing energy source. The 3D is seldom obtrusive, and it's done really well. This relates very directly to Iron Man 2 and Thor(You'll appreciate it more if you've watched those), and sets up The Avengers. While I'm not sure, I think this follows the comic book pretty well. I recommend this to any fan of Captain America. 8/10",Captain America - The First Avenger

Someone needs to do something similar to me so that I will lose the urge to watch big-budget Hollywood super hero movies.I told my wife about half-way through this especially stupid example of the genre to remind me next time I thought it sounded like a good idea to rent ""The Green Lantern"" or something about my experience watching ""Captain America."" I hate to be lost during a movie, but if I'm lost because the movie is especially intricate and complex, then I can at least tolerate it. But when I'm lost because the movie itself is so badly written and directed that ANYONE would be lost, I lose patience instantly.I'm not even going to ask the questions about this movie that I want to ask, because no one is going to be able to answer them without making something up anyway, and because it would be giving the movie too much credit to take it seriously enough that questions are necessary. Suffice it to say that the two most entertaining things about the movie were the ""let's see who can come up with the most ridiculous German accent"" contest duked out between Hugo Weaving, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci; and the performance of Tommy Lee Jones, who barks out dry one-liners as if he was born to fulfill that very task.Grade: D",Captain America - The First Avenger

Yet, despite repeated attempts he fails his physical each and every time and has to watch as his peers prepare to head out to military basic training. However, as luck would have it, a German scientist named ""Dr. Abraham Erskine"" (Stanley Tucci), who has escaped from the horror of the Nazis, offers him the opportunity to potentially enhance his physical prowess by undergoing a dangerous experiment with the understanding that there is a chance he may not survive. Feeling he has nothing to really lose and everything to gain, Steve accepts wholeheartedly. Unfortunately, although the experiment is a complete success, Steve is relegated the unenvious duty of parading around in a costume and encouraging everybody to buy war bonds under the moniker of ""Captain America"". This changes, however, when Captain America is sent to the front lines to entertain the troops and discovers that his best friend, ""Bucky Barnes"" (Sebastian Stan), along with a number of other American soldiers, has been captured by the Germans. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie was a clear improvement over the previous ""Captain America"" film released in 1990.

30,ferguson-6,Star Spangled Man with a Plan,7,23 July 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. If it seems to you as if the past three years have provided an overload of superhero and comic-based movies, you are absolutely correct. There have been too many. There are a few I would be willing to toss out, but Captain America is not one of them. This ranks right with the first Iron Man as the closest to a real movie ... one with a story to go with the action and CGI.This one begins with the present day discovery of an exposed plane wing jutting from the frozen Arctic tundra. The search team quickly finds the Captain America shield visible beneath the ice. Flash back to WWII and we are introduced to a scrawny Steve Rogers who wants nothing more than to fight for his country. Unfortunately, this 90-pound weakling might as well have 4-F stamped on his forehead.His tenacity at trying to enlist is noticed by a powerful scientist named Erskine (played with sheer smirking joy by Stanley Tucci). Erskine happens to be working with Col. Phillips (a grumpy Tommy Lee Jones) on a secret plan to develop super-soldiers with the injectable cocktail Erskine has invented. As you might guess, the plan is thwarted immediately after scrawny Steve Rogers is transformed into a super soldier yanked from the pages of Men's Fitness.Working with Col Phillips and Erskine is Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). Her main purpose seems to be testing the brightest red lipstick and flashing her legs in front of the soldiers. She falls for Rogers and spends most of her scenes staring somewhat scarily into his eyes. Actually, their scenes together are pretty good and her character helps us remember that Captain America is still just a regular guy ... not a Norse God.Personally, I thought the movie lagged just a bit in the fight scenes between good and evil. But that doesn't mean I didn't find Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) to be a terrific bad guy. Nazi's still make for the perfect adversary. Although, I found myself laughing on occasion as Weaving's German accent reminded me of Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds.What makes this movie work is the fact that Captain America remains Steve Rogers. He is always a good guy wanting to do the right things. He is deeply affected when he thinks his actions may have caused the death of his best friend Bucky. But he also manages to keep his ego in check and his patriotic duty in the forefront. Also, the film is directed by Joe Johnston. If you are unfamiliar with his work, let me recommend two of his underrated earlier films: The Rocketeer and Hidalgo. You are probably familiar with his Jumanji and October Sky. He is a director that creates a specific look and feel to his films, and the texture helps make this one work.Since this is entitled Captain America: The First Avenger, it is obviously another step towards The Avengers movie slated for 2012. So don't miss Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (father of Tony Stark/Iron Man). And don't miss Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury in the odd ending to this film ... and the obligatory ""extra"" after closing credits.",Captain America - The First Avenger
31,morrison-dylan-fan,The Rocketeer.,8,25 January 2019,"During a run of viewing Action flicks from 1991,one of the main titles I was utterly charmed by was The Rocketeer. Reading trivia afterwards on the movie,I was surprised to learn that director Joe Johnston had been hired by Marvel due to what he did with Rocketeer, which led to me seeing the first Avenger arise.View on the film:Standing out from the ""Phase 1"" stable, director Joe Johnston & cinematographer Shelly Johnson offer the nearest tantalising sight of what the planned Rocketeer 2 would have been, in the 40's setting being painted in a dusty bronze straight from the serials of the era, and The Red Skull and Captain America being given a prime pulpy appearance. Whilst not fully able to escape Marvel's Blue Beam of Light, Johnston fits the exciting superhero action set-pieces into the serial mood, from the rousing score by Alan Silvestri and chases in 40's cars, to Captain America throwing his shield at hissing Nazi goons. In a genre known for being on the nose, Johnston displays a surprisingly subtle ""show, don't tell"" approach towards the origins, thanks to a seamless blending of CGI and practical giving a pre-Captain Rogers a scrawny appearance, with Johnston crushing Rogers into corners, and upwards shots giving everyone else a towering look over Rogers.Becoming the main writers for the Marvel Franchise after their first entry here, the screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely does very well avoiding the cynical glance Captain America could fall under, by having those around Rogers emphasis the importance of his part in the war effort. Giving the pulpy daring hero and cackling Nazi/ Mad Scientist of the script and directing an extra spark, Tommy Lee Jones, Toby Jones (not related) Dominic Cooper,Stanley Tucci and Hugo Weaving giving the flick the feeling of being from the Golden Age of Hollywood character actors, such as TLJ and Cooper buckling down with troops on the battlefield, and the Weaving/Toby Jones duo howling like baddies from a 40's Mad Scientist flick. Whilst he does well flexing the action chops, Chris Evans brings the Captain most to life in the sweet-natured, elegant romance with Hayley Atwell's adventurous Agent Peggy Carter, who joins the first Avenger, as Captain America picks up his shield for the first time.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Chris Evans isn't new to the superhero roles and here he is in his element playing a young adult who desires to defend his country in the heat of the second World War but because of his small size he is rejected. Finally a scientist takes interest and has him go through an experiment that broadens his muscle tones. Now he can assist in the fight against the war but instead, he is placed in a ridiculous costume and doing commercials. He will eventually take charge and go after the leader of the Hydra cult whom he will do battle against with his trusted shield. How this concludes is somewhat depressing in its venture into an Avengers film. Where the film goes wrong is in its formula placement of supporting roles. Hugo Weaving does well as the Hydra leader who turns out to be some sort of mutant. Tommy Lee Jones has the standard role of military leader who down plays Evans and discourages him until Captain America proves his skill. The worst element is Hayley Atwell as the female Lieutenant whose role consists of looking tough and being Captain America's potential bed buddy. Sebastian Stan plays Captain's best pal who ends up the victim of a nasty accident. Director Joe Johnston previously made Jumanji and The Wolfman.

33,FlashCallahan,I'm not kissing you.....,4,8 August 2011,"So finally after three years of movies, the final Avenger movie arrives. And i'm really upset to say, it's the blandest and dullest of the lot.Steve Rogers is a an unfortunate man with many disabilities, but when a friendly Schnapps drinking Tucci considers him in a super soldier experiment, he has the chance to help against the 'bullies' in the world, much to 'grizzly' Tommy Lee Jones disdain.He becomes Captain America, a super soldier who can run really fast and whom is great at Frisbee. The only problem is, Mr Smith from the Matrix has been in the sun too long and decides to reference Thor and raiders of the Lost Ark in a very evil way.But ol' Cap isn't bothered, because he has Iron Mans dad to help him and to assist with Avengers continuity.I really wanted to like this film. I thought Johnston was the ideal director, seeing the work he did with the very nostalgic Rocketeer, and he can handle action well, like he did with Jutassic Park 3. But then I remembered the boring Hidalgo, The Wolfman, and Jumanji, and alarm bells began to ring.The first act is fantastic, seeing Rogers as the weakling he is and his struggles with coming to terms with it, is a joy to watch, and Tucci is nothing short of excellent in his small role.But then, as Rogers transforms, so does the movie. It's not the actors faults, Evans has never been better, and Jones can do this role in his sleep, Weaving seems to have fun.But, even though the titular hero is the nicest guy in the world, ouldn't a few amusing moments been inserted in Cap's mission, or heaven forbid, a few one liners like Thor had? It appears not, this goes for serious in the most deathly dull way. There are as few exciting moments, but when the finale reminds you a little of a Die Another Day/Sky Captain hybrid, you begin to care very little.Weaving is staggeringly underused, and is too straight faced, a little Alan Rickman in Robin Hood could have given him some Gravitas, seeing as he thinks he's a god, but no, the screen writers decide to go straight.So all in all, Evans is great, as are the rest of the underused cast, 3d is pointless, and the film is dull, boring, with a few good action scenes.I think Captain America will be at the end of many a put down by Tony Stark, come May 2012.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I enjoyed it more than Thor that was released the same year; however, the other two Captain America films would be better than this one. Of course they would be as there is more action and such, but for an origin story it does alright. The main problem with the film is that it is so well done at first, the second half almost seems a bit rushed. Not bad mind you, just like they were running out of time or something. That being said it did have a really cool battle between hero and villain at the end. This would be the fifth and final Marvel film leading up to the Avengers and basically where Disney took over pretty much all the Marvel films. This is good and bad as now all the films seem to have the same flow, but at the same time, you did get a bit more unique experience when different filming companies were doing them.The story has a team during the present finding a huge airship at the North Pole. Then the film turns back the clock to World War II where a team of Nazis known as Hydra bursts into a cathedral where the head Hydra agent, Schmidt finds an object of immense power.

Captain America is born and at first is stuck doing promos and such to help boost of the sale of bonds and enlistment, but once he learns that his friend was in a group of infantry men demolished by Hydra he goes to the rescue. During the rescue he meets Schmidt who has taken on the persona of the Red Skull due to the serums gruesome effect on his face and the two race towards a final confrontation as Captain America and a group of troops destroy the Hydra bases one by one.The film is good and a large part has to do with the casting as Chris Evans does a very good job as Captain America. He is completely different from when he did the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four films. Tommy Lee Jones is also good in his role as a cranky colonel who even when he warms up to Rogers still remains the same. Hugo Weaving though was totally excellent as the Red Skull and I do not see anyone else doing as well as he did in the role. Which also saddens me because he has yet to turn up in another Captain America film. I thought for sure he would be in the second Captain America or something.So, I enjoyed this film a lot. Though once again, after a certain point the film seems a bit rushed to me. Basically, after Captain America saves the prisoners and then gets his trademark shield this occurs where we only see a few clips of battles and things going on. Even the infiltration of the last base seems a bit rushed. One wanders when Captain America and Agent Carter had time to develop feelings for one another during this stretch. Still, the final fight on the huge airship is cool and it ends nicely as it sets up the Avengers film.",Captain America - The First Avenger
35,zetes,Pretty good,7,6 November 2011,"Another quite good comic book movie. Like this summer's Thor and X-Men: First Class, it's far better than it needs to be. Captain America is one of the cornier superheroes, and the film does a good job of playing with that. Chris Evans is good (though I do miss the cleverness he exhibited in Fantastic Four, in which he was about the only good thing) as Steve Rogers, a 90lb weakling (created through some good CGI effects) who undergoes an experiment to make him a superman. Although he immediately exhibits heroics, no one knows what to do with him, so they just use him as a war bond salesman. He feels kind of worthless about it, especially at USO shows where he just ends up as the butt of jokes by weary servicemen who would rather just see the dancers come back on stage. Soon enough, he gets another opportunity to be a hero, and, after that, he becomes a full-fledged soldier with an elite team to fight Hydra, a secret Nazi scientific organization working on super-powered weaponry (Hugo Weaving and Toby Jones are great as the villain Red Skull and his lead scientific mind). The film is quite respectful to the era and WWII (it easily could have come off as insulting), while still being an exciting and fun modern action flick. Hayley Atwell is quite good as Evans' love interest. Also co-starring Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci.",Captain America - The First Avenger

37,StevePulaski,Not as toned as Rogers' figure,6,5 April 2014,"There's a pleasant visual-scheme and aesthetic that exists in Captain America: The First Avenger, thanks in part to its recreation of the 1940's time period. This makes it the most visually unique Marvel film I have yet to see being that all the aforementioned superhero films had the similar, ultra-crisp, spit-shined aesthetic that wouldn't allow a flaw or imperfection to be noticed by the naked eye. With this 1940's costume and set design, we can at least see how Marvel plays with time period, offering up common settings and historical occurrences to go along with this specific time period in a way that is a breath of fresh air from the monotony that can entail with looking at the same kind of superhero film.Having said that, it's disappointing to note how flat Captain America: The First Avenger can be as a whole, despite focusing on a character who hasn't seen much cinematic love outside the ho-hum films of the past few decades. As the film begins, we meet Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a scrawny individual with numerous health conditions, who still optimistically tries to enroll in World War II because he wants to know he's making a vital difference when serving his country. Rogers gets turned down time and time again, finally given the honor by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), who believes that he is the perfect one to play along with his ""super-soldier"" experiment that he is concocting. The operation leaves him with side effects that will stick with him permanently, including super-strength, impeccable athleticism, among other physical benefits.Just in time too, with Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), Adolf Hitler's head of weaponry who possesses his own plan for world domination involving an object called the ""Tesseract."" Schmidt's alter-ego is Red Skull, the famous Marvel villain who runs the terrorist organization HYDRA, which Rogers, now draped in red, white, and blue clothing going by the name of the patriotic mascot ""Captain America,"" must find a way to destroy.This is the kind of superhero film, similar to what would later become Iron Man 3, where there isn't really a core thing that's wrong with the picture, but numerous little things that work against the entire project that will come to derail it in the long-run. To begin with, Red Skull's backstory, character, and overall personality is never really laid out for audiences, becoming just another villain we're supposed to root against because of Marvel namesake. Never do we spend enough time with Schmidt to hear more about his plans for ""world domination,"" and we're just expected to kind of go with it, passively accepting the cheap excuse for a villain motive.Secondly, the technology, some of which looks the time period, most of it doesn't. The weaponry during the war, the artillery, and a lot of the superhero technology (which may be true to the comic book, I'm unsure) doesn't look at all fit for the time period. It would appear that the crew of costume and set designers spent so much time trying to recreate the exterior of what a 1940's cityscape would look like that they forgot that everything the characters used to fight each other look like just another device from modern-day superhero films.Then there's just the obligatory romance between Rogers and a military commanding officer named Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) that goes shockingly undeveloped and rather cold throughout the film. It doesn't help that the writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (the same men who wrote all three films in The Chronicles of Narnia franchise thus far) keep this relationship very low-key until near the end when they decide to bring it into the main focus.Those issues aside, Markus and McFeely do a great job at illustrating the shortcomings yet big aspirations that come in a package-deal with Rogers. This element brings to question ""does every superhero need to be musclebound and physically dignified?"" I was looking forward to a scrawnier Captain America defending the universe. Then Dr. Erksine's experiment blew up his build considerable (and by ""blew up"" I mean the visual-modifications to Chris Evans in post-production were generously ceased).Captain America was a hero I always tied together with Superman in the regard that I never felt any vulnerability or nervousness when he was leaping around from place-to-place. Captain America, especially in this case, seems fazed by absolutely nothing in this film, never being thrown in the face of danger, never seeming to be at any risk of injury or peril, and so forth. This is likely why I enjoy Spider-Man so much as a hero because I could sense physical and mental vulnerability in the character with the same going for Batman in Christopher Nolan's trilogy, as towards the end, we saw a bit of Bruce Wayne's mental vulnerability. I can't make those same connections with the invincible, heartthrob that is Captain America.While I can appreciate and admire that director Joe Johnston efficiently contains most of the action, Chris Evans fits the bill perfectly for Captain America (except, you know, the whole computer-generated weakness business), Tommy Lee Jones' great performance as a military colonel, and the 1940's aesthetic, there's little to offer in terms of something that isn't an interchangeable superhero flick of the modern age. The saving grace is that at least Captain America: The First Avenger doesn't come gift-wrapped in bleeding heart patriotism like it easily could've been. Markus and McFeely thankfully seem to have bigger plans than that, even if they don't all succeed overwhelmingly.Starring: Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, and Stanley Tucci.

38,lasttimeisaw,On a par with its sturdy sequel,7,14 July 2014,"Incited by its super polished CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER (2014, 7/10), I feel impulsive to watch its prequel, which eluded me when it came out in 2011 chiefly thanks to the irreparable damage caused by Evan's lame Human Torch act in the awful FANTASTIC 4 duds, and his breakthrough role in the murderously awful comedy NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE (2001, 3/10), I just thought he was not bright enough to be interesting as a national hero, however, both the second Captain American venture and SNOWPIERCER (2013, 7/10) have regained my faith in him, and finally I watched the film.Being mostly sceptic about Marvel's comic exploitation, I find this film makes a smart decision to get away from the ultra-modern havoc-wrecked cityscape, and locates the story in the WWII with an enticing retro flair around it, it instantly emanates a more reality-approaching understanding of the milieu, and the magical CGI achievement of a puny 90 pounds Steve Rogers also lights up one's intrigue, smoothly propels the plot unwind in the anticipated direction where he is transformed into a super soldier. Stanley Tucci leaves a strong impression as Dr. Abraham Erskine, whose keen attention makes cherry-picking Steve as the guinea pig much more plausible than we could guess.Hayley Atwell, as Agent Carter, not a red-lip pin-up girl for soldiers fantasy only, proves that in Marvel's realm, real girls are never guy-shy, the romance between Steve and her plays out disarmingly with a crescendo in the near-end, a date he is destined to miss; Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Chester Phillips, as grumpy as usual, but the banter amid the crucial chasing sequences means he is not a stiff militant officer as he appears, and his a sterling driver too; The seed of the bromance between Captain and his best-buddy Bucky Barnes (Stan) is sown pretty palpably as well, and their all-race-included squad could not be more politically safe for the alliance. Hugo Weaving is the Nazi officer Johann Schmidt aka. Red Skull, the head of HYDRA, who blatantly discards his human skin for the second half of the movie, falls short as a qualified super-villain, basically the only countermeasure of Captain America's front-door attack is to retreat with his treasured tesseract, his ruthlessness and supernormal toughness never take off too far.Most of the time, the film looks like a vintage war movie than a Superhero production, and Captain American is a down-to-earth paragon with all the virtues needed for an orthodox representation, Evans steadily sheds his frivolousness and shoulders on the most legitimate American hero to be a prominent part in The Avengers assembly. Finally, the time-jumping finale, it is a bit rushed, no details of the 70-years cryogenic nap is materialized on the screen, how he survived the crush, and how he was discovered and reserved, all omitted; the bug of the radio is also very amateur. By comparison, the action part is not as thrilling as its sequel, and director Joe Johnston (THE WOLFMAN 2010, JURASSIC PARK III 2001, 4/10) may never be an innovative creator, but certainly he is a hard worker who is able to streamline the patchwork and as far as this movie is concerned, it is not bad at all.",Captain America - The First Avenger

40,OllieSuave-007,Good old superhero Americana.,6,15 June 2016,"A movie part of a list of superhero films in the Marvel canon, where we are introduced to Captain America (Chris Evans). He is transformed from rejected U.S. soldier Steve Rogers after taking a dose of a ""Super-Soldier serum"" and aims to take down Nazi Germany's secret HYDRA terrorist organization headed by Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving).Set during the 1940s, this movie has a lot of good old Americana and patriotic themes, from Rogers serving as an American mascot to the red-white-and-blue dressed female dancers. There's also the spirit of comradeship and teamwork when the Army troops, led by Captain America, storms the HYDRA to rescue captured military servicemen.There is plenty of decent and spectacular special effects to highlight the plot, as well as a smacks of comic relief where appropriate. The movie, though, has lesser action than previous Marvel movies I thought, and the tension was also limited - not so much in edge-of-your-seat excitement and not much in suspense to keep you glued to the screen. This, unfortunately, made the plot boring at times. As a result, it's more of an average superhero film, overall.Grade C+",Captain America - The First Avenger
41,Hellmant,Worth the wait!,10,26 July 2011,"'CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER': Five Stars (Out of Five)The fifth Marvel Studios film adaptation of one of their 'Avengers' comic characters (following two 'Iron Man' films, 'The Incredible Hulk' and 'Thor'), this time based on the original 'Avenger': Captain America. Joe Johnston (the filmmaker behind a variety of genre films including 'THE ROCKETEER', 'OCTOBER SKY', 'THE WOLFMAN' and 'JURASSIC PARK III') directed the film. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (who also co-wrote all three 'CHRONICLES OF NARNIA' film adaptations) wrote the screenplay. Chris Evans (who's co-starred in a series of other comic book and superhero films including 'SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD', 'PUSH' and 'THE LOSERS' as well as two 'FANTASTIC FOUR' films from Marvel) stars in the title role. Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Dominic Cooper and Sebastian Stan co-star.Captain America first appeared in comics in 1941 (published under Timely Comics) and was created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. The series told the story of a weak wannabe war hero named Steve Rogers with a huge heart and enormous passion for doing good but lacking the physical prowess to match. He was selected for a secret military project which enhanced everything he was good at and gave him the physical capabilities to match his amazing good will. Like 'Superman', 'Captain America' was a great patriotic symbol but after World War II died off in popularity and disappeared in the 1950's. The character was later revived by Marvel Comics in the 60's as part of the Avengers team (it's leader) and it was explained that he had fallen into suspended animation since the end of the war. The film retells his origins story and sets up the Avengers film which is to be released next year.There have been several other film adaptations of the classic character in the 1940's, 70's and 90's but none have been very satisfactory to die-hard comic fans (until now). This is the first time a film studio has spent a significant amount of money on a project and actually invested the resources to do the material proper justice. It's quite surprising if you think about it that it took them so long (for such a beloved and classic iconic character) but it was worth the wait. I don't think any film adaptation until now could have turned out this good. The special effects are amazing (and it does look good in 3D). The movie's villain 'Red Skull' (Weaving) looks incredible, the action is spectacular and the scenes of Steve Rogers looking almost deathly ill are completely seamless and flawless. Johnston's directing is solid grade A filmmaking. Like his similar themed 'ROCKETEER' Johnston really shows a knack for classic nostalgic storytelling. The film is a technical marvel but besides that (like it's lead character) it has tremendous heart to match. It has been a while since such an admirable patriotic symbol has been portrayed in a major motion picture. American pride of course isn't quite as big as it used to be but the heart and nobility of someone wanting to do good (just for the sake of doing good) really resonates with the viewer in this film. Like 'Spider-Man' the classic tale of a wimpy outcast with a heart of gold becoming the super-hero is truly inspirational as well. The acting, cinematography and screenplay are all top-notch too but it's the movie's heart and message that are most impressive. It really is what good filmmaking and storytelling is all about.

42,thesar-2,The First and Best?,8,4 May 2013,"In the summer of 2011, when it had already been announced that the following summer would be kicked off with The Avengers, I got so severely burned out on poor to mediocre superhero films, beginning with Thor and followed by X-Men: First Class, Green Lantern and finally, Captain America - The First Avenger.In all fairness, I got burned out after the X-Men prequel which I only barely liked then and would later appreciate more. On video, I would finally see Green Lantern and absolutely hate almost every minute of that. Due to that, I put off Cap't America as long as I could. As Julia Roberts' Vivian once said in Pretty Woman: ""Big mistake. Big. Huge.""ForI actually really enjoyed this movie a tonand he's completely down my list of favorite superheroes.Chris Evans brought a special heart and selfless spirit to the contagiously patriotic Steve Rogers, a.k.a. Captain America. I understand and have seen overly Gooo-America films – most recently, Act of Valor, but this one, thanks for Evans, really roped me in and I both loved and rooted for him the whole way.While I'm not a big fan of CGI, the computer generated, miniscule and original weakling Steve Rogers, before he becomes Captain America, was, in fact, weak. I understand there had to be a transition from small to super soldier, but they all-but made him look like a mouse that would later turn into a tiger. A bit too under-the-top.Nevertheless, we have a small boy who's desperately trying to fight for truth, justice and the American way in World War II and continuously gets knocked down, literally and figuratively. Untilhe gets spotted due to that deep heart I spoke about. Not just overnight, but within minutes, he's now fast, strong and regenerative. What hadn't changed was that perfect attitude.He's got the (ho-hum, and sometimes boring) Red Skull to deal with, as, I guess, Hilter's so passé. But, along the way, he's accompanied with a beautiful broad and the always awesome Tommy Lee Jones as his Colonel.Admittedly, the first half is a lot more entertaining, contains welcomed great performances and special effects/cinematography for a superhero film. Even the second half is still a fun ride with wonderful tie-ins to the other Marvel/Avenger films and an extremely touching and admirable finale.While it's not perfect, and not the genre I'm fond of – period piece films, but it's a lot of fun, and comparatively speaking, they saved the best for last in Summer 2011.",Captain America - The First Avenger
43,cherold,Fun old-fashioned comic book brought to life,8,18 July 2012,"This is what I want from my comic book movie adaptations. Captain America is fun, amusing, lively and well paced, with solid character development and a lot of nice action. This movie completely captures the comic book vibe, and has a 1940s movie-serial quality reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark. (My appreciation of it was increased by having watched the rather soggy Thor the previous day.) The funny thing is, I never liked Captain America when I was a kid. He was so stodgy and bland and square-chinned and All-American. I normally prefer angsty X-Men-style superheroes, so I wasn't really that hopeful that I would enjoy this. But I enjoyed it tremendously.",Captain America - The First Avenger
44,bensonmum2,"""I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.""",7,17 March 2021,"Instead of the normal plot summary I try to include, I'll just say that this film begins with the Captain America origin story and ends with his battle against legions of Hydra soldiers, including Red Skull. Along the way, we are also introduced to Peggy Carter and Bucky Barnes - characters that would go on to have significant roles in the MCU.Also, instead of the normal thing I do when writing about a film (you can read all about Captain America all over the internet), I'll limit this to some random thoughts I had while re-watching the movie last night.1. I especially enjoy the first half of the movie. I would have been perfectly happy had the film ended after Cap saves Bucky and the others from Hydra. Cap's triumphant march into camp would have been a fitting end to the Captain America origin story.2. The cast is perfect. Chris Evans (I can't imagine anyone doing a better job of bringing Captain America to life), Hayley Atwell, Tommy Lee Jones, Toby Jones, Neal McDonough (needed more screen time), Sebastian Stan, and Stanley Tucci are all amazing.3. I continue to be underwhelmed by Red Skull. Other than making threats and looking menacing, he doesn't do much. And the final fight scene does nothing for me.4. I never cared much for Captain America when I was reading comics while growing up. HIs goody-goody persona didn't do much for me. I think this may help explain why I really didn't enjoy this movie very much the first time through. In fact, I found it boring. After living with the MCU for the past several years, learning more about Bucky and Agent Carter, getting some insight on the Tesseract (which this movie does a poor job of explaining), and changing my preconceived ideas about Captain America, this movie has grown on me.5. Other than Vision and Wanda, I can't think of a relationship in the MCU that works as well as Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter. It doesn't feel forced. And I appreciate the way it's left at the end. Ridiculous pronouncements of love would have ruined it. Re-watching their growing romance makes the end of Endgame even more special.6. Finally, for the most part, I think the people responsible for the movie did a fantastic job with the period details. The cars, the costuming, the lighting, the dialogue, and the sets all feel like a film much older than 2011 - and I mean that as a complement. There are times when you really feel as if you're watching a movie from the 40s.A few years ago, I would have probably rated Captain America: The First Avenger a 5/10. After this re-watch, I appreciate the film so much more. I still have some complaints, but a 7/10 feels about right.

46,Robert_duder,"Fun, entertaining and a terrific superhero flick...no more and no less",8,29 December 2011,"Marvel had a solid lock on this summer's superhero genre with the exception of Green Lantern. Regardless there was a barrage of Superhero flicks to choose from and they ranged from just okay (Thor) to exceptional (X-Men First Class.) Captain America sits firmly on the better end of those films and delivers exactly what you want from a fun action filled flick that brings an age old superhero to life. I'm not a Marvel comics fan, in fact I'd be surprised if I ever read one but the movies seem to work most times and this one is a little more set to your typical regiment of a modest and unassuming man who finds himself endowed with super human abilities. The special effects were solid without being overused, the story was tried and true to what most know about Captain America and it was an excellent introduction to bringing together all the characters for 2012's Avengers film.Chris Evans wouldn't have been my first choice for Captain America although I do like him. He's known more as the sarcastic one liner heroes than someone more serious but he pulls it off terrifically and the computer effects of him as the younger weaker Steve Rogers and then Captain America were astounding. Hugo Weaving was the perfect choice for Red Skull but I also thought he was underused given he is Captain America's number one adversary. I just thought Weaving could have done more with the character. Tommy Lee Jones is completely wasted as a third or fourth string character unfortunately and Hayley Atwell was also underused as the lead female in the film. Basically the movie focused on Evans and that's okay and even makes sense but if they wanted to give this real depth they could have done more with the supporting cast.If Captain America has one fault it would be that it doesn't surprise you. What you see is what you get and maybe that lack of risk should be heralded as if it ain't broke don't fix it but they certainly don't take any chances with the character or the film. Its exactly what you would expect. Director Joe Johnston has done some terrific adventure films and even worked with George Lucas and Spielberg at various times in his career so he has plenty of experience backing him. This is probably one of his most exceptional projects and I hope he stays with the project if they serialize it. Captain America is simply put, fun, and there isn't anything wrong with that at all. Its the perfect introduction to the first avenger and worth seeing!! 8.5/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
47,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Over ambitious, sprawled out yarn",4,20 March 2012,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Steve Rogers (Chris Evans-a nerdy TV personality over here) is a scrawny, unmasculine weakling who wants to be big and strong so he can fight for his country in the Second World War. His prayers appear to be answered when a German scientist (Stanley Tucci) invites him to be his guinea pig on a new serum that induces super strength, which proves successful and he becomes Captain America, a force for good and strength during America's dark days. But he faces his greatest nemesis in the shape of Captain Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) a mad Nazi who plots to mis-use the serum and even becomes his even more twisted alter ego, Red Skull.Superhero movies are a pretty reliable and consistent money spinner for the studios, with a pretty loyal, solid fan base who can always be relied on to pack the theatres out on opening weekends and get the box office coffers spinning. It would take some pretty lousy reviews and test screenings to have a really big impact on their chances in these regards, and Joe Johnston's latest, big budget effects bonanza would appear to have escaped this fate. But if more of the reviewers had been like me, maybe that wouldn't have been the case.The superhero genre is still a fairly successful, winning one that churns out a lot of successes and still has a lot of potential, but while Captain America might have generally won favour with the audiences and critics, I found it to be an over ambitious, over long and over blown misfire, which appears to have ended at least three times but carries on, dragging the story on and playing out in a mispaced style, the end effect of which is just one big bore that all the big action set pieces and effects in the world can't put right.Performances wise, Evans makes for a fairly standard, unmemorable hero, while the best thing is probably Weaving as the villain, doing his usual steely eyed, uncompassionate thing to the best effect he can. Tommy Lee Jones in a supporting role is as reliable as ever, but hardly has the best material to work with and doesn't get the best screen time. Samuel L. Jackson makes a cameo appearance at the end, by which time his appearance feels as desperate as the movies become.It seems an inevitability that a sequel will emerge in a couple of years or so, bigger, better and maybe with a different director. And maybe I'll think it's better. I hope it couldn't be worse than this. **",Captain America - The First Avenger
48,Lejink,"Aye, aye, Cap'n",6,2 May 2012,"Well, my wife was out for the night so I thought I'd indulge myself with a big blockbuster super-hero flick. I'm much more of a DC than a Marvel fan, so Steve Rogers and his red white and blue alter-ego mean little to me, but that may have helped me enjoy the movie more, not trying to reference every character and scene back to the comic. As a movie, despite its being primarily set in World War II, it lacks the darkness and psychological depth of say Christopher Nolan's Batman and to be fair doesn't once threaten to go there. Thus most of the characters are very 2-dimensional, either very heroic or very evil and as you'd expect, a good portion of the running-time is given over to action sequences and while there's a smattering of humour throughout, I could have stood some more. The early, scene-setting section works the best I think, particularly the remarkable shrinking technology which reduces Chris Evans to a mere pipsqueak. Can it be a coincidence that another 98lb weakling who morphed into a fearless muscle-man, Charles Atlas, shared our hero's initials? To be fair, that's about as much depth, if that's the right word, as you get here. However the story zips along like a good comic should and the acting's okay too. Tommy Lee- Jones gets an easy pay-day as a sub-Patton crusty C.O. while Hayley Atwell does a nice all-action English rose. The Red Skull makes for a good villain, with Hugo Weaving hamming up it up convincingly as the other mad Nazi out to rule the world. I did find the tying-in of the film to the upcoming Avengers movie as blatant as Stan Lee's pointless cameo, but all-told this was an enjoyable if not exactly marvellous comic-strip outing, the better for its war-time setting.",Captain America - The First Avenger
49,bowmanblue,Solid superhero,8,27 May 2014,"It seems that a modern day superhero movie has to follow certain rules: the hero/s must be flawed, the villain must maintain a parallel existence until the final confrontation and, most recently, Samuel L Jackson must pop up to make a cameo that links the whole film to a greater body of work.Captain America follows these trends quite closely, leaving not an awful lot of shocks and surprises. Now, this may seem like a bad thing, but, actually, the film is pretty good fun to watch. The characters are all likable, Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones add a certain heavyweight star-power to the proceeding. Perhaps the only drawback is that the film seems to take quite some time for Captain America to actually become 'proper' Captain America, but then that leads me on to the movie's real purpose.Like Hulk. Like Thor and like the Iron Man movies, Captain America is largely one giant prequel for the upcoming Avengers movie. If The Avengers wasn't being made, the whole of Captain America's story could probably have been shown as a flashback. It felt like - and this is a criticism of all the recent Marvel movies - they all seem to be holding their true potential back, presumably so as not to burn themselves out and leave nothing for the Avengers movie.However, looking at Captain America as a stand alone movie, it was pretty good. I don't know much about the origins of the character (in other words I've never read one of his comic books), but I liked the way the story was linked to real historical events.Good to see that computer-generated effects wasn't overly used (I'm still scarred by Transformers 3), so, if you fancy a decent romp, give the Capt a try.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Captain America - The First Avenger
50,ThomasDrufke,"Not a Perfect Solider, but a Good Man",7,4 May 2016,"In preparation for the upcoming Captain America: Civil War film, I've decided to go back and reexamine Iron Man and Cap's previous entries that I haven't reviewed.Much like Iron Man 2, I wasn't a huge fan of The First Avenger the first time I watched this film years ago. But every single time I have watched it since, I have enjoyed it more and more. It has its cartoonish moments and an unmemorable performance from Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, but Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell bring so much charisma to the film that it's enough to outweigh some of the mishaps.Probably because we have been spoiled with how Joe and Anthony Russo have portrayed Captain America, but Joe Johnston doesn't get a ton of credit for his directing job. Granted, the film is uneven in tone at times and it has a certain amount of bombastic elements to its visuals, but The First Avenger is about as good of a job as you could do at introducing the man out of time.With the Avengers coming out merely a half a year after, the film had the task of giving a proper origin story to a man with morals structured around a completely different time period. It's the only true period piece Marvel has done as more than 90 percent of the film takes place in the 1940's as Cap receives super soldier serum in an attempt to counter Red Skull and Hydra's attacks.Red Skull felt much like every other Marvel villain, wasted. Weaving comes off as more cartoonish and James Bond-villain-like than the tone of the rest of the film. Even if that's who the character is in the comics, I think there were some changes that needed to be made. With that said, I really enjoy everything that's going on in the army, led by very solid performances from Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hayley Atwell. Atwell is positioned as the love interest for Cap and it couldn't have been handled any better. Much like the film itself, their relationship in this film has grown on me over time.The First Avenger is an origin story through and through, but that doesn't stop it from having some cool action sequences both before and after Cap gets his suit. And of course, I have to mention the heroic score from Alan Silvestri. It was unfortunate that they didn't carry it over to The Winter Solider, but Henry Jackman ended up doing it justice. Overall, the most unique film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a solid way to introduce us to the undeniably likable Steve Rogers, even if it has plenty of faults both in front and behind the camera.+Cap & Peggy+Supporting performances+Silvestri's score+Evans' is so dang likable-Cartoonish Red Skull-Uneven directing7.6/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
51,MLDinTN,boring superhero movie,2,5 May 2012,"I didn't like this at all. At least Thor was pretty good and had an excellent beginning. There wasn't anything I liked about this movie. First Chris Evans is not a lead actor. If I saw him in a commercial, I wouldn't know who it was. Second Captain America doesn't have any cool weapons or abilities. All he does is throw a shield around like a boomerang and can jump really high and long. Most of the story was just boring as it showed Steve Rogers joining the army, getting transformed into a big guy, then he goes around the country raising money. Over half the movie is about this.Then the bad guys are the Nazis, with the leader being a guy with a red head and no nose. He doesn't have any cool abilities either, just some neat gadgets like a gun that makes people disappear.FINAL VERDICT: The whole was just terrible. Not worth your time.",Captain America - The First Avenger
52,g-bodyl,Another Marvel Delight!,9,3 March 2013,"The time has come! We are now at the point where we are at the last stand alone superhero film before the great ensemble hit, the Avengers. This movie happens to be Captain America: The First Avenger. This film happens to be politically correct more so than the other recent Marvel films like Iron Man or Thor, but it's still pretty good. People have been complaining that there is no action here, but they are dead wrong. This film has plenty of stylized action and great use of special effects.Joe Johnston's film is a gritty take on the popular Captain America. This film goes through the origins of Cap on how he was a small, weak man and thanks to Howard Stark, turns into a national hero. He must not only help the Allies defeat Nazi Germany, but defeat the heinous Red Skull.It wasn't a very popular choice at the time of filming, but I'm glad they chose Chris Evans to play the main hero. He has just the right physical strength and charisma to play the guy. Tommy Lee Jones is a great addition to the cast because of his famous grumpy persona which he brings to the Colonel quite well. Hugo Weaving, although not as scary as his Neo from the Matrix villain, is still really effective as the Red Skull.Overall, I enjoyed this film because it was really fun to watch. I also got a sense of national pride watching this movie. The costumes were well-made even though some people may disagree. I really liked how the ending went. The entire movie is set in the past, except for the final scene. I loved how they made the transition from past to present day. This is a worthy film to add to the Avengers collection. Bring on the Avengers! I rate this film 9/10.",Captain America - The First Avenger

It's rare to find a superhero movie that literally and effusively represents the American spirit, harking back to the 40s, the classical war time stereotypes and perhaps in the Civil War spirit of sacrifice. The ending of this movie is particularly, if not somewhat predictable both American in its relief and yet haunting in its loss. A movie for the downtrodden and the overcoming of evil by innocence of goodness. It's hard to say whether or not this movie is an outdated, old-fashioned, naive young adult fairy-tale of comic book fantasy or a renewed sense of retro-inspiration and a refreshing rebirth of the American spirit has seemingly has been lost in today's selfish, egoistic society. Overall, this is an American action-superhero thriller that encompasses all the elements of both traditional movie classics and contemporary special effects.",Captain America - The First Avenger
60,ironhorse_iv,USA! USA! USA! Captain America: First Avenger was awesome throwback to the Golden Age of Comics.,7,3 July 2015,"Captain America: First Avenger is the fifth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Its serves somewhat as a prequel. This film is not to be confused with the 1990 film Captain America, or the two Captain America TV movies from the 1970s, or the classic movie serials from the 1940s, all of which have no relation to this film, aside from being based on the same comic book character. Comic books such as the movie's source material, the original Captain America #1, gained immense popularity during World War II as cheap, portable, and easily read tales. Most of them, were about superheroes batting the Axis Powers. This movie is paying homage to those early comics! It has adventure mixes patriotism, and explosive action. Directed by Joe Johnston, First Avenger tells the story of US Army reject Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), who volunteers for a secret government program which transforms him into the world's first super soldier. As Captain America, Rogers goes to war against Nazi Germany's military forces — including HYDRA division, Johann Schmidt AKA Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), who has his own plans for world domination. Without spoiling the movie, too much, the movie is fun to watch, but somewhat dated. There was nothing new to be found. Honestly, I was hoping for a more Indiana Jones type story, here, but the movie doesn't have much depth. The story felt a little one-dimension. It didn't even bother explaining what the Tesseract McGuffin does. The movie kinda forces it's viewers to do some research, coming in. It's like the movie is imposing you to see Marvel's previous film, 2011's Thor, so you wouldn't get lost. That's not right. The movie could have, so much more, explaining than it gave on its own. There were a lot of odd plot-holes, and misdirection. I wish, the movie focus more on the super soldier formula, more than the Tesseract. It kinda pull the plot, apart. Honestly, I have no idea why the German try to steal the super soldier formula, if weren't going to use it. The super soldier formula never pay off, in the film as it rarely mention beyond the first act. Also, I still have no idea, why Steve Rogers was put on USO duties for so long. It's really strange. Why didn't the military use Captain America, better? It's like having an Atom Bomb and instead of using it, Harry Thurman sent Enola Gay to do airshows for the public for War Bonds. It doesn't make sense!?! Even in comic book terms. It's also very bizarre, how many years, it takes for Red Skull is bomb, America. It's like the villains were wasting time! They had plenty of time, to build it! Way, before Steve Rogers show up, and destroyed all their production factories. For villains with a powerful superweapon, they were very underdeveloped. Red Skull spends more time building his death plane and reminding us how evil he is, rather than, showing that he can be a true threat for Captain America. No wonder, why Nazi Germany lose the war. Even, the climax was a bit confusing; they never did make a good account on how Captain America reach the present day. If the director and the script took more chances with the material, Marvel could have had their best movie ever. Instead, they have an alright film. While, the story is pretty mediocre. I have to say, the movie had some good set pieces. While, I got the sense that I was in the 1940s, the technology for the film didn't match up, historical. It was a bit jarring. I guess, they were going for a World War Sci-Fi Futurama feel. The action is a bit unrealistic at times, but it's somewhat entertaining. The CGI stunt work was alright; but I was hoping for more real stunt work. I love the way, the movie photo shop and use visual effects to transform Chris Evan's buff body to make him, look like a small skinny weakling. That's really amazing! Mad props to those guys! I have to give, Chris Evans, some credit for having a well tone body as well. He looks the part. What I like about Chris Evans's performance of Steve Rogers was that he didn't come off with the same attitude and cockiest of his previous role as the Human Torch in 2005's Fantastic Four. Still, the movie didn't take any significant creative risk with any of the movie characters. Captain America is a plain old boy-scout. Red Skull is over the top plain evil. The supporting characters are worse, the lovely-and-capable Agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), and James 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan) had little to no chemistry with Steve Rogers. I really didn't buy them, being Roger's love interest and Cap's best friend. Both of the actors, acting was a bit off-putting here. One of the film's highlights are the Howling Commandos, a group of ragtag soldiers whom Cap breaks out of a POW camp. They honestly deserve their own movie, rather than extended cameos, here. Having big names play Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) & Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) was kinda a mistake, as they somewhat overshadow, the other supporting characters, due to how well- their acting was. While, the overall acting was meh, Captain America soundtrack was booming. I love the score by composter, Alan Silvestri. It really capture the over the top, superhero feel, without going all broody and dark. It's remind me so much of the original 1978's Superman main theme song. One thing that I love about the movie is the musical number, 'Star Spangled Man With a Plan'. This song would get me to buy war bonds. It was so catchy. One thing, missing in the film was humor. The movie was very lackluster when it comes to that. Overall: Captain America is like a firework. It's has explodes, but in the long run, it's get kinda smoky and unclear. Not the best Marvel film.",Captain America - The First Avenger
61,The-Sarkologist,The origin story for the first avenger,6,30 July 2011,"I never was really interested in Captain America simply because it seemed to promote the idea of a good empire and put this character at the front of this empire as an ideal for people to emulate. While it is true that in this movie, the person that was selected for the experiment was a small man who did not like violence, but believed in standing up to bullies does give the ideal of what the American Empire is about, but this is in many cases an idealist vision that hides the greed and corruption that is rife.However, I am not intending on using this as a criticism of the American Empire because this is not what this movie is about. It is a super hero movie, and does create the American ideal of the superhero (in fact it appears that the superhero genre arose from the US in the 30's, during the Great Depression). The idea is that this world has a lot of evil and bad things happening, things that a mere mortal is unable to fight, so there is a desire for a 'super hero' to fly down out of the sky and deal with the evil that we ourselves are unable to deal with. Maybe this comes from the Christian heritage of the United States were the belief is that at a time in the future Christ will return, coming from the sky and being visible to everybody. It is that inate desire of us to see Christ return and make right a fallen world.Captain America is the continuation of the Avengers story arc, though in the comics there are a lot more cross overs. The heros are mortals that are changed and become super human, while the mutants were born that way. However it appears that in the films the mutants and the heros are separate. I am told that Logan (Wolverine) was a member of Captain America's Howling Commandos.As a film it is enjoyable, and if there is a theme it is that even the smallest and weakest in society can rise up and become a hero. It is interesting that after he is turned into Captain America, he is turned into a propaganda tool for the US government, going around entertaining troops and attempting to sell war bonds to the public. However it is when his friend is caught by Hydra that he tosses the actor mask aside and becomes the superhero.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I appreciated the 1940s period settings and costumes, which were a break with the usual generic cityscapes. I got a sense of a broad story, rather than the impression of a series of sensational set pieces. Here is a real movie, not just a noisy assembly of special effects. Of course it's loaded with CGI. It goes without saying. But it has layers and takes the care to be a real film. You know, like with a hero we care about and who has some depth and dimension. And with weight to the story.Chris Evans is perfectly cast, as is Tommy Lee Jones as the grumpy Col.

65,tomgillespie2002,Worthy entry into the epic franchise,6,3 August 2011,"Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is desperate to get into the army and help his countrymen fight in World War II. The only problem is that he's short, skinny, and has a list of medical conditions longer than his arm. In his umpteenth attempt at enlisting, Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees Rogers' passion and help enlist him in a research project to build a super soldier. Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) doubts him, yet when Rogers dives on a loose de-activated grenade to save his group, he is convinced. Along with Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper), Erskine doses Rogers with a special serum that turns him into a muscled, near- invisible super soldier, and he becomes Captain America - at first a frontman to sell bonds, but when his friend needs to be rescued, he becomes a superhero. Meanwhile in Europe, psychotic Nazi Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) is harnessing a power that may help him rule the world.The Marvel films of late seem to fit into two categories - either very good, and passable. This, unfortunately, falls into the latter category. The passable Marvel films (X-Men: First Class, The Incredible Hulk) have been relatively pedestrian yet have the uncanny ability to be irresistibly likable and undeniably entertaining. Captain America was one I was expecting to be on the level of Iron Man and Thor. It's noticeably overlong, it has poorly developed supporting characters, and an one-dimensional bad-guy. But Chris Evans and the fact that this is a teasing final link into the film that we're all really waiting for, helps raise the film up a few notches.I'll start with the bad. Firstly, the action scenes, compared to even the lesser Marvel films, don't really add up to that much. I mean, this is a superhero fighting Nazis, and we all love seeing a Nazi getting smashed - but the big and loud action scenes are surprisingly dull. There's nothing to compare to the Frost Giants fight in Thor, or the Circuit du Monaco attack in Iron Man 2, or seeing The Incredible Hulk getting angry. And Cap's whole superhero persona just isn't that good - he's just really hard and can throw a shield rather well. He can't fly, doesn't have a hammer of near-limitless abilities, and can't turn massive and green.Sadly wasted are Tommy Lee Jones and Weaving. Given a role he can sleep- walk through, Jones just doesn't seem to be making the effort, and delivers his few comic lines with a can't-be-arsed look on his face. Weaving chews on his lines with relish and is near-faultless as Schmidt, who later becomes The Red Skull. It's just a shame that Schmidt is basically there to do no more than give Cap something to fight against. After Tom Hiddleston as Loki in Thor, who was if anything a lot more interesting than his blonde-haired brother, brought emotional torment and raging jealousy into his multi-dimensional character. Maybe I'm comparing it too much to the other Marvel films, but knowing that it's all building to The Avengers, it's difficult not to see it as one huge film.But while Captain America the superhero may be a little full, Steve Rogers isn't. Seeing him transform from a skinny weakling who will get straight up after a beating to become a giant of a man over-awed by his new strength, is a great reason to finally root for the little guy. The nodding winks to the comic book nerds and the links to the other films provide lots to smile at, especially in Tony Stark's father Howard, who as well being an entertaining character, is played well by Dominic Cooper (though not the level of Robert Downey Jr.) who is an actor I've never really taken to in the past . And it's nice to finally have a strong love interest in Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) after the blandness of Natalie Portman in Thor. As well as the obvious attractiveness, Peggy is a character that can kick some arse as well. Overall, it's a worthy entry into the epic franchise, and a nice final character film before it all really kicks off.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Captain America - The First Avenger

Good plot and origin story of Steve Rogers played by Chris Evans. Chris Evans is great as the character. The cast ensemble is a good one. The story taking place in 1940s during WWII. An experimental drug that gives Steve superhuman strength. There are plenty of fun and big action sequences to make this a fun summer blockbuster. The villain Redskull played by Hugo Weaving was good. I will say the films direction is kind of cheesy with playing Captain America like a propaganda film. And the cheesy music score by Alan Silvestri was cheesy. The visual effects are decent. Not the best. Especially, the cheesy look with skinny Steve Rogers.

67,Floated2,Drags for Certain Duration,5,18 January 2015,"Captain America while begins. Now the image of an all-American soldier, Steve is dressed up in a star-spangled Captain America outfit and paraded around the country with dancing girls and a Hitler stand-in he repeatedly knocks down. The desire to fight for his country is still Steve's goal, however, and his rescue of friend Bucky (Sebastian Stan) and hundreds of other prisoners convinces gruff Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) that Steve will be an asset in the battle to stop emerging villain the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving). There's time for a dash of romance, of course, with Hayley Atwell's British agent Peggy Carter falling for the muscular superhero.With its World War II setting and devilish German villains, Captain America immediately brings to mind Raiders of the Lost Ark and director Joe Johnston's earlier effort The Rocketeer. As composer Alan Silvestri does his best to emulate John Williams, the movie strains desperately to match the efforts of Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones saga. Yet Captain America lacks the deft humor or breakneck Saturday morning serial momentum of Indy, instead delivering its outlandish premise in a dull, straight-faced and earnest manner.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Not that that hasn't happened before: as of late, comic book characters have been regularly getting reamed royally by Hollywood honchos. Even the comic creators themselves don't seem to think twice about tossing their creations to the wolves.

69,filipemanuelneto,"Worthy of the effort and money invested, it is a film that is truly worth watching.",9,2 March 2021,"A few years ago, superhero or comic book films were the worst imaginable. That changed with Marvel films and the quality CGI show the studio has been able to offer to fans of its superheroes.This film tells the story of Steve Rogers, an aspiring soldier: he was eager to fight in World War II, but his short stature and physical weakness prevented him from enlisting. When he finally succeeded, he found himself participating in a special military program to create ""super soldiers"". Thus, Captain America was born. And his first mission could not be more demanding: to face the sinister Hydra, a secret SS branch specialized in the occult and the research of super weapons.I confess that I never felt any empathy for the figure of Captain America. For me, even as a cartoon character, it is a piece of propaganda. And although this opinion has not changed with this film, I liked what I saw: in addition to being a visual spectacle, the film has a clear script, a well-structured story, well-built characters and the historical consultancy worked very well, allowing the film to be satisfactorily accurate in recreating the period. Joe Johnston, the director, is worthy of our praise.The cast is full of familiar faces and does a pretty good job. Chris Evans is a good protagonist, and he seemed very committed to the character. Hayley Atwell also did well, and gave the film a feminine touch, a pleasant presence and good lines. The chemistry she built with Evans seemed convincing enough. Hugo Weaving is a threatening villain and has given his character a certain amount of raw and gratuitous cruelty and unpredictability. At first, Tommy Lee Jones seemed aged to me, limited himself on recycling the attitude and lines he used in ""MIB"" movies, but I think he ended up fitting the big picture, even though it is not a very good job. Sebastian Stan is competent, but I felt that he had little screen time and his character was unimportant to the plot. Although not as relevant to the story, Toby Jones had more presence than him, and that was something that Jones knew how to take advantage of, giving the audience a job well done.Technically, it is an impeccable film, worthy of the millionaire budget it had. Cinematography is enviable: the colors are just right, the play of light, shadow, contrast and movement was well accomplished and the footage is clear and sharp, even in the most intense and fast scenes. As I have already mentioned, the effort to recreate history was very successful, so the uniforms, costumes, weapons, vehicles, props and sets were exquisitely executed. The special, visual and CGI effects are great, and they do things that seem impossible, like Chris Evans's apparent reduction in height and muscle mass. The soundtrack also seemed quite adequate, although it is not memorable.",Captain America - The First Avenger

The movie has a lots of action scenes, that are very entertaining and will definitely satisfy a fan of the marvel movies. The ending is unpredictable for a action film, but the director prepares the audience from the first scene of what we should expect to happen. The romance is developing but not completed between Stan and Peggy, something that is not a disadvantage of the film. The soundtrack however wasn't very good for me.

72,TheMovieDiorama,The First Avenger confidently throws its shield in enjoyable acts of heroism.,6,3 April 2019,"Captain America. The man everyone wants to become. Pure hearted, self-sacrificing bravery and a body that could make anyone swoon (me especially). This phase one origin story of Marvel's enigmatic cinematic universe may not be the strongest of the original 'Avengers', but is packed with a colossal amount of sincerity and an appealingly good-hearted protagonist. Making it near impossible not to enjoy. He is the ""Star Spangled Man"" after all. A borderline paper-thin Steve Rogers desires to join the army, but does not have the physical prowess or stamina to do so. His vast level of bravery allows him to enrol and become a super-soldier, in a bid to stop the Red Skull and his Nazi division known as Hydra from taking over the world.Director Johnston, accompanied by Markus and McFeely's timely screenplay, got one aspect absolutely spot on. The character of Captain America. The symbolic embodiment of heroism and patriotism. A representation of nationalism, displaying the brevity and amiable power of America's superiority during World War II. Unable to save captured soldiers? Don't fret, Captain America is here! Fell down and can't get back up? Do not worry, Cap will graciously lift you back up. Thrown into a canal? Well, chances are you can swim, so save yourself. His character progression may not be as advanced as other superheroes, but that's because his heart was already perfect. The physical transformation allows him to display his fearlessness during acts of valour. Evans portrayed this to perfection.Even when I first watched this years ago, he automatically asserted his physical and personable demeanour, assuring audiences that he was the only choice to play this character. To be honest, I couldn't see anyone else pull it off. Evans is Cap. Johnston and the writers had the difficult job of presenting an origin story and the first integral chapter in the MCU. Whilst both of these sides were balanced, unfortunately many aspects were inevitably underdeveloped and rushed.The first act was executed thoroughly. Establishing the light-hearted romance with Agent Carter, introducing the villainous Red Skull's motives (played excellently by Weaving) and undergoing the physically enhancing experiment. Once Captain America starts divulging in acts of valour, the narrative starts to crumble under the weight of bloated exposition. Tucci's mad scientist was primarily used just for detailing the plot in its entirety. Bucky and Steve's friendship lacked natural development and felt too staged. And the entire third act, which involved infiltrating a Hydra stronghold, passed by in a flash. The final showdown, the resolution of plot holes and the setup for proceeding chapters, again, were all rushed. It's a shame considering the first half was paced meticulously like clockwork.The action was exciting (albeit unmemorable) and the 1940s environment was gorgeously replicated. The visual effects were occasionally garish, particular the noticeable green screen, however superimposing Evans' head on Deeny's body was sublime. For what it's worth, The First Avenger is a perfectly solid film. Its primary focus on characters is what drives the film through minefields and grants the plot fiery production value. However it tries to tackle too much and often succumbs to exposition which detracts from the vivid characters. A solid start cementing the foundations of what is to come in the future.",Captain America - The First Avenger
73,BaronBl00d,I Rather Enjoyed It - a LOT!,8,3 November 2012,"For the recent rash of Marvel Comics oriented films from the last few years, I found this one to be the most enjoyable for me. Why? I am sure it has to do with the primary setting of the film as war-torn America in the 1940s, Nazis(they ALWAYS make the best villains), a story with loads of heart, not too over-done special effects, and how about Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter(va-voom!) Anyway, this film starts off with a wonderful patriotic tune with some montages of the 2nd world war done credibly and with inspiration. The settings, the mood, the atmospheres mirror much of what we think of during that time - and yes, it is bent toward patriotism. Hey, the guy is called Captain America! I enjoyed the unfolding of the story. Director Joe Johnston, while not a premier director by any means, does what I think might be his best film. This was a popcorn roller-coaster ride, a Saturday morning serial, just good-old-fashioned movie entertainment - the stuff that good comics are made of. The CGI effects are done well for the most part, the set pieces are very credible for their time period, and the acting is pretty good. Chris Evans makes a very affable hero. Tommy Lee Jones is perfect as a craggy, no-nonsense army general, Hugo weaving is a good Red Skull slash Nazi pain-in-the-ass. Hayley Arwell is an adequate actress and breathtaking to behold. A buffet for the eyes to be sure. Two character actors stand out for me though: Toby Jones as Dr. Arnim Zola(he looks like the perfect Nazi scientist) and, most especially, Stanley Tucci as Dr. Abraham Erskine. His portrayal gives the jump-start for this film in terms of how it evolves. he does a very good job with a fairly small role. Of course we eventually get to Captain America being around today so that he can join The Avengers...okay, but I really liked the background story.",Captain America - The First Avenger
74,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Classic storytelling techniques and large-scale action make ""Cap"" easy fun",8,24 July 2011,"As far as superheroes go, they don't get much campier than the ""Star-Spangled Man."" A super soldier dressed in red, white and blue who bashes in Nazi skulls with his all-American shield? Undoubtedly, Captain America served a very specific purpose when he debuted in 1940, but 70 years later, Marvel Studio has found a way to make him relevant again in ""Captain America: The First Avenger."" With a script that dives into the soul of its character as every good origin story should and packs in adventure of old-school proportions, ""Captain America"" strikes a strong balance of nostalgic charm and modern action.Anyone that felt director Joe Johnston had to prove himself as the director of a superhero film should and will stand corrected. Like anyone he's had his misfires (""Jurassic Park III""), but with films such as ""The Rocketeer,"" ""Jumanji,"" and ""October Sky"" under his belt, he knows how to tell a story that pleases its audience above all else. ""Captain America"" achieves that almost instantly. You can feel the influence of Johnston's early career work doing visual effects for George Lucas in the original ""Star Wars"" films as well as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Like those beloved films, ""Captain America"" quickly establishes a protagonist you can root for and a large scale for action and adventure.Chris Evans finally shakes loose his comic relief type-casting and shows off his leading man potential as Steve Rogers, a scrawny young man (thanks to some excellent special effects) from Brooklyn whose persistent yet futile attempts to enlist in the army catches the eye of a fled German scientist named Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci). Erskine has developed a serum that the military hopes it can use to build an army of ""super soldiers"" and he insists on finding the perfect specimen to test it on — someone of outstanding character and moral fiber. Rogers has been standing up to bullies who beat the snot out of him all his life, yet has never wavered in courage and determination. After convincing Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) Rogers is the one, Erskine and his colleague Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) administer the serum to Rogers, who's instantly transformed into the ideal physical specimen.Yet despite his new gifts, it's not all uphill for Rogers; in a turn of events, he's now the only super soldier who does or will ever exist, so presumably he's unable to help the fight abroad on his own. A New York senator then convinces him to become a propaganda tool. This diversion is the script's strongest non-action sequence because it sours any chance the film could be seen as all ""God Bless America"" and whatnot. Although a musical number written by Alan Menken is not usually how most films follow up the ""now he's become the superhero!"" scene, it strengthens the character long term because he had to carve out his own destiny. By doing just that, he embodies American ideals more than he would have otherwise and also becomes a hero anyone — not just an American — could love.As alluded to, Evans gives a career-best performance, especially miles better than Johnny Storm. Humor takes a back seat in this film compared to ""Iron Man"" and ""Thor"" and Evans puts his heart into his performance as Steve Rogers would. Although it's head-scratching how he develops fighting skills so damn quickly (though we should be grateful for the lack of a ""training montage""), part of scrawny Steve lives in buff superhero Steve. He might not have the magnetic personality of Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr., but he's a billion times easier to love.Speaking of love, Hayley Atwell gives one of the better leading lady performances in a superhero film period. Her classic figure and beauty makes her a perfect physical fit for Peggy Carter, but she comes packaged with equal parts fearlessness and charisma, which make her a truly likable character. Individually, she and Evans have such strong characters, so together their relationship, built mostly on a truly mutual admiration, feels meaningful unlike most of Marvel's films thus far.On the other end of the spectrum, Hugo Weaving could not be a better choice for Johann Schmidt, a.k.a. Red Skull. A rogue Nazi with a God complex, Red Skull earns our respect as a nasty dude. The script also develops him more as Johann Schmidt at first, which makes the reveal of Red Skull more effective. His presence makes the big fight sequences work, because he captures our attention as any great villain does. As long as he's around, the fight's never over, so the stakes of the action sequences hold up well throughout the film.The period garb will initially evoke the comparisons to ""Indiana Jones,"" but the story earns these comparisons as well. The various action sequences in or on moving vehicles is highly reminiscent of that franchise, but the focus on the main characters does it too. Sure, there are many peripheral characters that don't feel important and other weaknesses crop up, namely in the build to the action sequences, but that character focus helps give us blinders to the flaws (as any good action film accomplishes) and helps us get lost in the story and the action.Unlike the best superhero films of today, ""Captain America"" doesn't quite hit on the themes as well as it could, which would have helped it ascend to that upper echelon, but it has heart and character in the literal and more internal sense. Other films that did the same thing? ""Star Wars,"" ""Indiana Jones,"" and to give a recent example, ""Avatar."" If good storytelling with characters we care about truly counts above all else, then praise should be heaped on this film. It might do it the old-fashioned way, but there's a reason those films still entertain years later.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Captain America - The First Avenger
75,arfdawg-1,Not Great,3,8 May 2019,"Meh.
This movie is only marginally OK. The whole Nazi crap has really grown long in the tooth.I know this is now Marvel characters were developed but jeeze do we NEED to see an orign movie? We get it.And after the most recent Avenger flick Captain America is black? Oy Vey.Why not make her Miss America?",Captain America - The First Avenger
76,Vartiainen,Beautiful origins story,9,5 October 2013,"To me, both this and Thor feel a lot alike as movies. They're both movies about the main side characters of The Avengers film. Because lets face it, the main characters of The Avengers are Loki and Tony Stark. They're the heart and soul of the film, they're the driving force behind the plot and Tony's films are the ones that set the tone for the rest of the films. That's not to say that Captain America and Thor are not important characters, hence why they both got their own damn movies, which are both used to introduce plot points that would become important later on. With Thor we got Loki and with Captain America, we got the Tesseract.And yet, they're both very different experiences. Thor happens in the span of a few days, focuses on a single town, mostly, and the scope of its events is rather limited. It focuses more on the chemistry between its characters and the responsibility needed to be a leader. Only the last one of those is present in Captain America. In this movie we are pulled into the World War Two, the fate of the entire world is at stage and there's not a lot of character interactions going on. It's more about what needs to be done, not about how these two will get along as people. And don't get me wrong, both approaches are fine and I love Thor as a film, but I must admit that as a movie, this one is a bit stronger, just because it tells us more about both the character of Steve Rogers and about the rest of the world. It works both as an origins story and as a period piece about the war.The best thing about this film is by far Chris Evans. He plays his role perfectly, at first coming of as vulnerable yet determined scrawny kid, who wants to make a difference. You believe in his blight, trying to get enlisted, but just being too weak to be considered. But as soon as he steps out as Captain America, you'll buy it. He IS Captain America, his sheer presence just screams it at you.And I quite like the rest of the cast as well. Hugo Weaving has the slight problem of being too, well, Hugo Weaving, but that's what you get when you hire the man, and it's not like it's a bad performance. It's just a bit... campy, if you will.The plot itself would work just fine as a standalone film, but I like how tightly they bound it to the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe mythos, while still doing their own thing. You can see how the events of this film would affect the later events and would eventually lead to The Avengers. Though I must admit that the Hydra as the villain organization doesn't work quite as well as it could - I'm sorry Hugo, I know you're trying to be intimidating - but it's a nitpick at best.I like this film. It's one of the stronger Marvel films to date and I have high hopes for the sequels. It works both as a period film and as a superhero film and if you're a one of either, I'd give it a watch.",Captain America - The First Avenger
77,Vartiainen,One of the best early MCU films,9,30 October 2019,"It's interesting to watch this film after the events of The Endgame. Back when this movie came out, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was still finding its feet. The first Avengers films was still a distant dream, one we didn't really believe would come. But, looking at this film now, it's clear that the film makers believed in this project. Sure, it's a standalone film, but so much of what the MCU would eventually become is already present in this film.The story is of course about Steve Rogers, who eventually rises up to become Captain America, one of the most iconic superheroes of the 21st century. And I do like that it takes place in the 1940s. Makes it unique among the MCU films, gives it a different feel. Sure, we still have all those nice little science gizmos and magical whatsamacallits, but they have this nice pulp fiction aesthetic to them, which I really like.It's also notable that this is a surprisingly gory film. Oh sure, it's still pretty clean as far as the imagery goes, but it does take place during World War Two, which allows our shining squeaky clean hero to pick up a gun and start shooting enemies. Because they're Nazis. People can look dirty and disheveled, and so forth.Granted, I can see why so many people prefer the later MCU films. This is still pretty standalone, with a relatively modest budget. It doesn't have those layers of polish and sheer style that the later films have. Still, Steve Rogers is one of my favourite characters in the franchise, and this movie is largely to thank for that.Here's to you, Cap.",Captain America - The First Avenger
78,taylorkingston,Such a good movie...,9,30 September 2014,"I really enjoyed this movie. The several times I've seen it. It's a little hard to follow, mainly because it's based in the 40s.Steve Rogers is a scrawny guy living in the 1940s, who really wants to join the military, and serve his country. Unfortunately, he has allergies and a lot of weaknesses that the military just can't except. But eventually they do. Steve seems to show a lot of things that are a great strength in the military. Such as, when Tommy Lee Jone's character, flicks the pin off a grenade and throws it at the cadets, everyone runs but Steve jumps on it, to save everyone. Luckily for him, it wasn't a weapon ready grenade. Since he's so brave and has so many good qualities, he is approached by a man who tells him, that he can make him a perfect soldier. So Steve agrees. With the help of Tony Stark's Dad, they transform him into the perfect soldier and name him Captain America. He saves many lives and gets totally buff in the process. Many people love him and admire him. He's pretty much the mascot for the military. Then he saves a bunch of people and then he crashes a plan into the ocean and everyone thinks he's dead. Until he wakes up almost seventy years in the future.Overall, I give this movie a 9 out of 10.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Soon, Steve is chosen to undergo an experiment because of his commitment and wanting to do good that transforms him into a physically fit soldier ready to battle evil.

80,Turfseer,Recommended strictly for mindless pre-adolescents addicted to comic books,2,26 October 2021,"First in a series based on the Marvel comic book character, Captain America, The First Avenger's main appeal should be to nine through 13 year old pre-adolescents. Anyone younger would be inappropriate given the high level of violent content. Anyone older should be forewarned that the narrative represents a deep insult to one's intelligence as well as good taste.The film is primarily set during War World II. The main antagonist is Johan Schmitt (Hugo Weaving), a Nazi officer who steals a mysterious relic/artifact in Norway called a ""Tessseract"" which he uses to enhance weapons developed by a Nazi biochemist Dr. Zola (Toby Jones). When a crew of high Nazi functionaries visit Schmitt and try to ""reign him in"" as he's perceived as a loose cannon, Schmitt goes completely rogue and literally disintegrates the group using some kind of enhanced laser gun (or whatever you want to call it).So the protagonist here is not really a Nazi but a comic book super villain who transforms himself into the ""Red Skull,"" who sports a red skull-like face resembling the devil. Meanwhile the Nazis are depicted as powerless against the Red Skull thus giving youthful filmgoers a bad history lesson, ignoring the fact that the Nazis were extremely feared and responsible for untold atrocities in real life.To counter the threat of world annihilation, the US Army calls upon Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci), a German refugee who has developed a special serum which has the capability of creating a super soldier for the Americans. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, the ineffectual but good guy who has been rejected by the Army and classified 4F numerous times due to his lack of physical prowess and medical history, is chosen to be the subject of the experiment in which the serum is injected into his body.Sure enough Steve is transformed into Captain America, the Army superman who has amazing strength, speed and stamina which enables him to just about overcome any opponent. After Army headquarters is infiltrated by the German agent Kruger, he kills Erskine but commits suicide after Rogers tracks him down after a prolonged chase.One must wonder how Rogers is able to hunt Kruger down so easily-after all he is not familiar with his new found powers at all but appears to know how to handle them without batting an eye. A real opportunity is lost for character development here as Captain America could have been depicted acclimating to the new incredible abilities. While the tracking down of the assassin is perhaps the best action sequence in the film, one soon realizes that Roger's abilities are absurd, foreshadowing even more ridiculous machinations to come.Before the film devolves into an ugly shoot-em-up, the newly minted Captain America ends up saving a child while apprehending Kruger and garners a good deal of great publicity from the media. Oddly enough due to the intervention of a US Senator, Rogers ends up performing in USO shows to sell war bonds. There's an enjoyable campy musical number and Evans proves to be a likeable presence as his easy-going character extraordinarily doesn't protest his assignment as an entertainer.The rest of Captain America can be described in a few short sentences. In one excursion against the bad guys, Rogers almost singlehandedly wipes out hundreds of Red Skull's forces and rescues his old friend Barnes (Sebastian Stan) along with a large contingent of imprisoned American soldiers. The second excursion is even more violent and convoluted, leading to Zola's capture after a battle on a train and an air fight in which Schmitt/Red Skull is sucked into a wormhole.The non-stop action in which Captain America blows away one robotic opponent after another using his special reinforced shield, becomes extremely tedious. The extent of the romance here is one chaste kiss by Rogers who is overly shy with women and has no experience (well suited for pre-adolescents). Rogers pines for British agent Peggy Fleming (Hayley Atwell) but it turns out her derring-do using a firearm is far more interesting than what heats up between her and Rogers.Tommy Lee Jones has a thankless role as Colonel Phillips, Roger's commanding officer. The rest of the cast is forgettable given all the comic book machinations.There were two successful sequels to ""The First Avenger,"" in which Paramount Pictures in association with Marvel Comics managed to seduce droves of mindless youth and sell a humungous number of tickets, resulting in humungous profits.",Captain America - The First Avenger
81,elshikh4,From Wow to Yawn !,6,3 September 2012,"Another superhero movie? OK. More than 10 years now, and we're still living the same. Though, what's the problem, since the outcome is fancy action. Here, there was fancy action, however with not one problem, but many!First off, let's be evenhanded. The cast was well-selected. I believe it's (Tommy Lee Jones) first superhero movie, and he stole the show for me, owning the best line ""I won't kiss you!"". The ""digital plastic surgeries"" technique, or the way how (Chris Evans) was pictured shrunken in the movie's first half, was done superbly. I thought it deserved at least an Oscar for its miraculous work. Director (Joe Johnston), who made 20 years earlier one of the best superhero movies and the most overshadowed gems ever (The Rocketeer), did fair job. He dazzled me much during the first half; for example, the first action sequence of running after Dr. Abraham Erskine / Stanley Tucci killers. Plus I loved the last sequence in specific, of ""I had a date"". As you see, mostly the good things lie in the first half. So what about that infamous second half?!Since the first mission of Captain America in battle filed, the events run strangely. Suddenly he has a team of uninteresting, or not taken care of, characters, there is a montage of many missions (read: cold victories), and none of that leads to a snowballing climax, not to mention that none of that alleged team does anything in the finale battle (or else!). That finale battle itself is near to a joke. It has dumbly made chain of fights; the movie transforms there into a video game with someone so used-to-it playing; meaning the lead is having victory effortlessly, killing all without a scratch, going his way facing no danger, and we are watching in bore. And to top it all; there isn't one-on-one fight with the bad guy who, by the way, dies idiotically. In other words; this is the death of thrill ladies and gentlemen!Nevertheless, the biggest problem that this movie has is its emotional core which was explicitly and unashamedly killed. What does provoke much is that the title character was basically meant to generate sentimentality more than many other superheroes, otherwise why the whole line of being sickly, then turning into Mr. superpower?, why the matter of ""We chose you to value power more than others""?, or why Dr. Erskine pointed to the heart while he was dying, as if to assure the noble choice? Actually, the script forgot all of what it already made in the start, and got busy with nothing but the explosions thereafter.And if you think that the sacrifice thing at the end was the possible answer, then let me wildly remonstrate. It was unconvincing with unforgivable holes; the lead could have jumped the plane earlier, and the military could have found him easily later. Furthermore, how he stayed alive after 70 years of coma in the snow? He didn't eat or drink? And I don't remember Dr. Erskine injecting him with a serum for immortality! In brief, that ""sacrifice"" was entirely forced. Clearly they fabricated it just to make Captain America catch his role in (The Avengers) movie, one year ahead, which simply takes place in the 2010s. Gives you a hint that the movie's second half had ""else"" people involved in its writing!Then, the biggest problem ""I"" have with this movie, which sure concerns its inventions. Well, this is a sci-fi that takes place right in the 1940s, however the shown designs, of everything, were so 3000s! OH MY GOD, if Germany had these planes in WW2, they could have not taken over the world alone, rather the galaxy! At one point, I witnessed a Nazi tank in a size of a 3 floors building! And the soldiers of Red Skull seemed like an army of super monsters from the future that needs a doomsday to finish, not one poor Captain America! Even the look of the ""exhibition of future"" was too flashy and hip for 1942!Unlike the hairdo of Hayley Atwell, or the exquisitely nostalgic closing credits-the image of technology seen throughout failed to offer the feel of its era, being too advanced to even make believe that it was anyway near the 1940s. The issue of advanced-weapons-in-older-times has been done before in movies like (Wild Wild West - 1999), (Van Helsing - 2004), or (Jonah Hex - 2010), yet in a way that made them look fit and sort of believable. This round they just looked so unreal, not having anything in common with the 1940s, or bothering to have. It's disgracefully bad when you describe a movie with the word ""unbelievable"" purposing the wrong meaning!The first half has one annoying downside too. There is a lot of talk about the history of the movie's villain, Red Skull, and his connection with Dr. Erskine, however you won't get it rightly, or at all, which pushes you to ask; why not ""showing"" any of that earlier?!At any rate, it's still in the second half. It was uninspired, soulless and routine at best. That caused a sad case of ""Hey, it's cool"", then ""Ok, I was a fool!"". However, you're not the fool, it's other people who had huge amount of money to make a movie, while they're not smart viewers in the first place, because if they were, they could have known better about important elements like thrill, feelings, credibility, and made a more hot, human, effective Captain America, not the uneven, 6 out of 10, movie that I watched!",Captain America - The First Avenger

As it gives no additional nice moments or new angles - unlike movies by e.g. Quentin Tarantino or Christopher Nolan, who are capable of twisting and turning trivial plots into sophisticated art.As for the cast, the main stars are rather ordinary... Luckily, there is a participation by Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones and Tommy Lee Jones, who were pleasant to watch.

Captain America: The First Avenger sort of stank.The problem? Waaaaayyyy too much CGI here. I know it's a Super Hero film, but Cap isn't exactly Doctor Strange and the heavy use of CGI just gave it that sort of Star Wars Prequel feel to it.Remember that part in the Phantom Menace where the Droid army faces off against the army of racist stereo-types of Jamaicans and you look at it and think: ""It's so fake it looks like the stock background for Windows XP."" That is sort of the feel you get when you watch Captain America: The First Avenger.You start singing to yourself ""Fake, that's fake, that's fake too. Too fake, too fake, too fake too, fake too."" It's hard to have a willing suspension of disbelief when everything looks so CGI that it's unbelievable.It's hard to create any suspense when it all feels so much like a program you figure if Cap dies he'll just use his extra life.The good news is, the MCU learned from their mistakes on this one and the follow ups were awesome.",Captain America - The First Avenger
85,freemantle_uk,"World War II, Marvel style",8,7 August 2011,"2011 is certainly the year for Marvel Studio, seeing that Thor came out earlier in the year to good reviews and a healthy box-office considering he is a lesser known hero and Captain America has done even better with critics and a stronger opening. Added to that Fox's reboot of X-Men was able to get that series right after the mess Brett Ratner left it in.Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a small, skinny man with a number of health problems who wants to fight in the American Army in 1942. After numerous times of trying to enlist a German scientist, Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees his determination and good heart is able to pull some strings and gets him into the army. Rogers joins a special unit and is seen as the perfect candidate to become America's first super soldier, giving him enhanced strength, speed and healing abilities. In Germany the Nazi's secret science division, HYDRA and its leader Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) discovers a blue cube of energy and believes it could give him the power of the Gods and likes all mad scientists plans to take over the world. In America Rogers is made into a performing act, encouraging the public to buy war bonds and given the name Captain America. But Rogers wants to fight in the war and is given his chance to take on HYDRA in 1943.I personally preferred Thor over Captain America, but it still a fun summer flick and a solid 7.5/10. Captain America has plenty of references to Thor and the Iron Man films and shows how these franchise should be interlinked. Captain America is able to mix a light touch but making sure it treats the source material with respect and keeps it serious. Joe Johnston wouldn't have been my first choice to direct this film but certainly made it fun and he was more assured as an action director compared to Kenneth Brangh, director of Thor. It was a fast paced actioneer, but Johnston made sure they was enough time to let us know the characters and the set up for the plot. When Captain America first gains his powers the scene of him catching an assassin on top of a taxi reminded me a lot of the first Spider-man film, a film that got mix of serious and light-hearted right. This was certainly a good introduction to character and the start for what should be another successful adaptation for Marvel.The humour throughout the film is deadpan and there are very good performance from the supporting cast, especially Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones and Tucci. Weaving certainly knows how to portray evil characters. Evans was able to instill Captain America's values of determination, freedom, strength and being a force for good. But the thing about Captain America is that he is a classic hero, living in a world of absolutes of good and evil, they is no ambiguity. And well, Hayley Atwell is a token Brit so she gets a free pass.The score by Alan Silverstri it self has an old fashion, grand feel to it and there were reminds to films such as the first Hellboy film, starting during World War Two with the Nazis using mythology to gain an advantage to win the war and classic 60s and 70s war films like Where Eagles Dare.Captain America is an enjoyable blockbuster and necessary viewing if you plan to view The Avengers in 2012.",Captain America - The First Avenger
86,strong-122-478885,"Hey! Like, Who Promoted This Guy To The Position Of ""Captain""?",3,12 October 2014,"If the Capt. America character in this picture was really supposed to exemplify the true grit of the All-American superhero (and because of his red, white & blue costume, I'm assuming that he did), then (after watching this less-than-satisfying action picture) I'd say that this dude clearly disgraced the entire American nation, big-time, with his laughable presence.I had always been under the impression that as a pop culture icon, Capt. America was supposed to be even more representative of his nation than was the likes of Superman. But all that Capt. America succeeded in doing in this picture was to reduce American ideals, and such, to the level of being nothing but a laughing-stock, in my eyes.Of the endless onslaught of mediocre superhero movies that have been carelessly churned out of Hollywood in this past decade, alone, I'd say that Capt. America, along with The Green Hornet, both stand tall as 2 of the most predictable, disappointing, and, yes, embarrassing productions of the entire contrived lot, bar none.Anyways - Besides what I've already beefed about - I thought that this film's PG-13 rating didn't help matters much, either, especially when it came to story coherency and maturity.And to say that the irksome Peggy Carter character (as the ""jealous woman"" angle in the story) was sickening (beyond words), would truly be a bona-fide understatement.P.S.I thought that the ever-creepy Tommy Lee Jones looked, even more than ever, like something straight out of The Night Of The Living Dead.",Captain America - The First Avenger
87,dfranzen70,Nazis. I hate these guys.,7,4 April 2012,"I admit that I don't know what to make of this, that there's been a run of comic-book movies that have managed to be plausible and thrilling, not cheap knockoffs rushed out to exploit a fad. Captain America: The First Avenger is one of the former. It features a terrific performance by Chis Evans as the Cap, a modicum of special effects and CGI, a slimy villain played by Hugo Weaving, and the famous backdrop of World War II. So help me, I found myself liking the movie despite my preconceptions.Steve Rogers (Evans) is a spindly, sickly young man who's full of desire to go fight those dastardly Nazis, but he's just too frail for the military, so he's classified 4F. Several times, in fact, under different names. A mysterious scientist named Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) recruits Rogers to be part of a secret project: he'll inject Rogers' major organs and arteries with a new serum that will turn him into a super soldier. The military, represented by Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), and the CIA, represented by Agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) are very interested in the results. Well, the results aren't too good, as the Nazis grab the serum and prevent anyone from making more super soldiers. But at least the US has Rogers, right? He's now super strong, fast, and agile.But one man is not an army, so instead of leading troops to victory Rogers is instead hired as a sort of USO cheerleader for war bonds. Yep, seriously. But you can't keep the good Captain down for long, and soon he is indeed leading some crazy mission to rescue his best friend Bucky and assorted Allied troops while also looking out for the nefarious Red Skull, head of Hitler's science division.It's well cast. Evans is believable as both the skinny Rogers and the pumped-up Captain America. He's earnest without seeming to take himself or the movie too seriously. Tucci, Jones, Weaving and newcomer Atwell are top notch as well.Even bearing in mind that this movie is merely a setup for the big Avengers film coming out soon (as were other movies, like Iron Man, Thor, and The Hulk), one can easily lose oneself in the great old-time action-adventure feel this one has, reminiscent of 1991's The Rocketeer. You have mad scientists, mythical technology, Nazis, all-American good guys, lots of neat guns. It's not a loud bore like Transformers, and the action scenes are well staged, as are the pyrotechnics. Throw in a believable plot (at least in the realm of comic-book movies), and this one's above average for the genre. I've probably said this before about other movies, but this is definitely one that's what a comic-book movie should be - daring, easy to follow, full of pulse-pounding action, and human.",Captain America - The First Avenger
88,drqshadow-reviews,"Cap's Long Overdue Close-Up Does What it Needs to, No More and No Less",7,1 August 2011,"Easily the most faithful interpretation of the character ever to grace the screen, although it admittedly doesn't have much in the way of competition. Cap's is a story that's terribly tricky to translate from the printed page without slipping into an ocean of cheese somewhere along the way, and though this latest attempt does lose its footing from time to time, it always seems to recover with grace and dignity. It's more a living, breathing comic book than any of Marvel's big screen properties to make the leap thus far, with motorcycle chases, laser beams, crisply uniformed enemy forces and pseudo-iconic freeze frames around every corner. Chris Evans lives his role as the star-spangled Avenger, the white bread everyman with an unnervingly positive disposition, Hugo Weaving clearly relishes his chance to play the thoroughly evil, black leather-clad Red Skull and Tommy Lee Jones enjoys more than just a cameo as the brilliantly-cast drill sergeant in charge of the whole operation. Though I had hoped for a more honest depiction of the period, as I think a genuine WW2 setting is when the Captain is truly in his element, it's tough to maintain that perspective when bright blue lasers are firing from the enemy's hands throughout the picture. This is a solid effort, at least as good as I was hoping it would be, but not the heralding triumph it had the potential to become. Smack in the middle of summer blockbuster season was the right time and place for its debut.",Captain America - The First Avenger
89,alindsay-al,a great film that sometimes doesn't get the credit it deserves,8,19 October 2014,"When talking about the first phase marvel films a lot of people see this film as the weakest I though am not one of these people because I think this film is great. This film is set in ww2 with Steve rogers wanting to fight for his country but being held back because of his size, until he is given the super soldier serum and given the chance to fight for his country. Now Chris Evans has history in comic book films as he was the human torch in the fantastic 4 films, now even though there aren't very good films I thought he did a really good job in them and boy he is even better here. The problem with captain America is that he is a boyscout a lot of the times in the comics and sometimes a joke, but in this film I thought Evans delivered the right amount of heart and action to the character to make even us who aren't American route for him. The supporting cast mostly did a great job too, Haley atwell plays agent Peggy carter and her chemistry with Evans is really good with it feeling so natural and realistic so she did a really good job. Also tommy lee Jones did a great job as the colonel with good comic relief that never went overboard because he kept it serious sometimes. Now I must say Hugo weaving was absolutely perfect as the red skull and he plays the character so well with him being truly evil and looking like he is having fun with the role. The one slight negative is Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes as I felt his character is underdeveloped so the audience don't really care about him. The story is alright with the way cap is treated being great and going different to what I expected. But the overall plot of the villain seemed weak and not enough to convince me That the story is great. The script is fantastic with the right amount of humour and drama to create a really organic feel to the film that should be applauded. The style us okay with captain America looking great and his costume is awesome, but the fact that there is laser beams and sci fi elements in this film really annoys me as it is so against what the film stands for and takes me out of it. Overall this is a great film that will entertain everybody.",Captain America - The First Avenger
90,MBunge,I guess this is what Marvel movies are going to be from now on,6,24 July 2011,"There is a high level of craftsmanship on display in this film. It's packed with funny lines, expertly juggles a huge supporting cast and has some of the best super-hero fight scenes yet. Captain America: The First Avenger is also shallow, superficial and contrived in all the negative ways one used to mean when using the phrase ""comic book"" in a derogatory way. So while the technical storytelling is quite good and entertaining, this movie is not just substantively a step or two below Spider-Man 2 or Iron Man. It's heart and soul also doesn't measure up to far less proficient super-hero flicks like Thor or Ghost Rider.Let me be clear. This is a fun movie and worth seeing. It's basic competency puts it far above thoroughly flawed works like Spider-Man 3 or Green Lantern. But it joins Thor as another indication that Marvel super-hero films are evolving toward commercially adept but creatively barren products. They're turning into a new version of the buddy cop genre where filmmakers never attempt to reach the audience in anything more than a trivial fashion. When done well, they can be a perfectly acceptable diversion. When done poorly, they can be a waste of time. Good or bad, however, they barely even attempt to say something thematically, dramatically or emotionally to the viewer.Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a scrawny kid from World War II era Brooklyn who desperately wants to join the fight against the Nazis. He's too physically infirm for the military, but gets inducted into a secret program to create an American super-soldier. Steve's puny body is transformed into the ultimate of athletic perfection and eventually finds himself caught up in the struggle to stop renegade Nazi Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) from taking over the whole world, though how and why Schmidt is going to do that is pretty foggy.Captain America: The First Avenger is divided up into three sections which are all well written and well framed but have progressively less and less creative worth as they go along. The first part is about Steve's scientific transformation from puny man to superman and it is as good as any super-hero origin in cinema. It gets more screen time than most origin sequences but it is expertly done and is, by far, the best part of the movie. The second part is all about how Steve ended up in his red, white and blue uniform. It spends more time than any other super-hero flick that I've ever seen or even heard about explaining and justifying the main character's costume, which is just inescapably odd given how well established the conventions of the genre have become.The second part is fairly clever and well performed, but to no effective purpose and some cracks start to show up in the script. For example, the general in charge of the super-soldier program refuses to let Steve fight on the battlefield and then mocks him for becoming a USO performer instead. But the only reason Steve is on the stage instead of the killing grounds of Europe is because the general wouldn't let him fight. That doesn't make any sense and is a little window through which you can see that there's nothing going on underneath the surface of this story.The third and final chapter of Captain America: The First Avenger is a constant stream of action scenes that are well performed but with hardly any plot or direction or personal involvement from either the characters or the audience. It's all pretty to look at but has no meaning or impact beyond that appearance.There are two great examples of what I see as the hollowness of this motion picture. First, a very big deal is made about how Steve Rogers is perfect for the super-soldier program specifically because he's a physically weak but morally strong man. The chief scientist behind Steve's metamorphosis essentially says that making a strong man stronger will only produce a bully and it is only the weak man made strong who understands the value of strength. The film goes to great lengths to establish that it is Steve's compassion that will truly make him into a hero. But then absolutely none of Steve's personal qualities have anything at all to do with the rest of the story. He's nothing more than Generic Action Hero #12587 and there's no reason why anyone else couldn't or wouldn't do the things he does.The second illustration of the emptiness of Captain America: The First Avenger is the character of Johann Schmidt, know in the comics as The Red Skull. For reasons I can't quite fathom, though perhaps it has something to do with the upcoming Avengers movie or an expected sequel to this flick, The Red Skull is almost totally de-Nazified and left without even a trace of identifiable Aryan ideology. He's reduced to having no identity or motivation other than being evil, like the worst sort of cardboard villain from a 1940s movie serial. I've watched this movie and read a bunch of Cap's comics over the years and I have no understanding of what The Red Skull actually wanted to do in this story, why he wanted to do it or how he planned to accomplish it. Does he want to take over the world? Does he want to destroy it? Precisely how will his giant flying wing do either of those? I mean, Doctor Doom from the two crappy Fantastic Four movies has a more defined agenda and personality than this Red Skull.I may be a bit too hard on this film because it is a well above average piece of entertainment. It's simply hard to ignore how it is fundamentally less creatively and narratively interesting than the best super-hero movies of the recent past.",Captain America - The First Avenger
91,CubsandCulture,"Launched the best set of Marvel films, stories",10,13 September 2021,"The Captain America films are all more grounded and more concerned with lived reality than most of the other MCU films. I think this aspect really helps make the film stand the test of time. Re-watching it the other day it struck me as a really solid film. The casting is spot on-I would love to see Tommy Lee Jones in another Marvel film-and Evans is the perfect Cap. Best of all they really nail Steve Rogers as a character.Rogers isn't a generic American and his sort of patriotism isn't blind jingoism. Instead, Rogers-in most versions of the character-is a New Deal Democrat concerned with sticking up for little guy and he is very much a guy from Brooklyn. The film nails this aspect of his character. The plot is a bit predictable and like most origin stories a formulaic. But the quips work and Johnson gets the most out of the period trappings. The film is delightfully earnest and sincere; just like Steve Rogers.I maintain that skinny Rogers (in the first ~1/3rd of the film) is the best effect work Marvel has done. The illusion is utterly convincing and the effect is entirely in service of the story and character. Seeing the work in 2021 is as engaging as seeing it in 2011.",Captain America - The First Avenger
92,Fluke_Skywalker,The best of Marvel's 'Phase 1' films,8,28 August 2014,"'Captain America: The Fist Avenger' is currently the lowest rated of Marvel's so-called MCU films on IMDb. I get that taste varies, but I find this to be surprising and more than a little frustrating.The MCU is yet to have a flop, but that doesn't mean there haven't been some misses. 'Iron Man 2' and '3' are both middling efforts, 'The Incredible Hulk' is utterly forgettable and 'Thor 2' is downright bad. That *any* of these films is rated higher than 'CA:TFA' is a travesty.This is a handsomely made, wonderfully acted movie with a heart as big as its titular hero. Everything here--the action, the drama and the humor--is character driven. There's none of the bloat that plagued 'Iron Man 2' and none of the laziness that derailed 'Thor 2' and 'Iron Man 3'.I know 'Iron Man' is generally regarded as the best of the MCU Phase 1 films, but I challenge that notion and submit for your re-appraisal 'Captain America: The First Avenger'.",Captain America - The First Avenger

95,jimbo-53-186511,"""I can do this all day""",6,28 October 2017,"Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has his heart set on joining the army, but is constantly rejecting due to his physical weakness and various ailments. However, upon learning of his determination to help his fellow countrymen scientist Dr Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) approves Rogers to join the army, but enlists him to take part in an experimental programme (which makes him taller and stronger). As a result of his scientific enhancements, Rogers becomes Captain America and with the help of Agent Carter (Hayley Atwell) and Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) Captain America must take on a dangerous Nazi enemy Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) whom is waging a war against the world based on something that he acquires which he believes is a gift from the gods...In its early stages, the protagonist shares many traits with Spider-man; a nerdy kid who finds himself bullied constantly suddenly transforms into a super tough vigilante type character. Like Spider-man, Captain America sets up a nice foundation for its story, but if I'm honest I didn't think the first Captain America film was quite as good as the first Spider-man film...The problem with Captain America is that it spends an awful long time setting up the origin story - it's never done to a point where I became disinterested, but I did keep thinking to myself 'OK I've learned enough now, can we just crack on please?' Once we get past the experiment and we learn of Schmidt's masterplan then the film does become enjoyable (albeit in fits and starts).One problem that this film has is that a lot of the time it is devoid of tension and suspense - our hero and villain don't share much screen time and what screen time they do share never does anything to get the pulse racing. Schmidt's crazy plan for world-domination is interesting, but it doesn't really get much focus and just seems to be there in the background in order to keep the story moving. I also found it amusing that an aerial slide was conveniently positioned right above a railway line - I mean yeah because you see that sort of thing everyday right??The good points of this film mainly lie with Hugo Weaving who makes for a wonderful villain here; he could have easily thrown himself too much into this role or underperformed, but he pitches it perfectly bringing just the right amount of menace to the role. Evans is good here as well, but he's perhaps a little too serious here - although I can possibly understand this as he may have been trying to make sure that he didn't play Captain America too closely to his role as the human torch in The Fantastic Four. Evans is good here and has just about enough charisma to make this work, but he is a little dry truth be told. The supporting cast all fare well, but this film belongs to Weaving who steals every scene that's he's in.Captain America: The First Avenger isn't a brilliant film and is far from the best of the Marvel films but it has just enough about it to make it work. The acting is good, the special effects are good (and more importantly they don't overwhelm the film) and as Steve Rogers/Captain America Evans injects just about enough likability to the role to get you behind him and will him on to save the day, but at the end of the day at close to 2 hours in length Captain America: The First Avenger is padded out and far too long and these things make the film feel like a bit of a slog at times. It's worth sticking with, but trimming some of the backstory would have made it a better film.SIDE NOTE; Where was Stan Lee? I was looking for a cameo from him, but didn't spot him. This was a minor disappointment, but has no bearing on my rating for this film.",Captain America - The First Avenger

98,juneebuggy,"Enjoyed the war story aspect, big budget and (sigh) the ending",7,24 September 2014,"This was a decent movie, better than I was expecting since I'm not really a fan of the comic book superhero adaptions. I was intrigued by the WW2 storyline though and for the most part this is a war story which I liked. I also appreciated that they kept Capt. America's rah-rah patriotism down to a dull roar.Inception stories are always interesting and this sees Chris Evans become the first Avenger (whatever that means) Its 1942 and scrawny wannabe soldier Steve Rogers has been deemed unfit for military service again. He volunteers for a top secret research project that transforms (bulks him up) into a superhero and sees him using his newfound abilities to fight the German forces and a villain known as Red Skull.This is a big movie with a big movie budget so there's lots to enjoy in the form of cool gadgets, cars chases, fight scenes and big explosions. Chris Evans was decent as Capt. A, perfect for the role I guess. ""Mr Smith"" aka Hugo Weaving did a great job as Red Skull and there are a ton of other recognizable faces involved including a last minute cameo from Sam Jackson. As a whole the story was kinda immature (which I expected) but I am still thinking about the ending, just loved it. ""You gunna be okay?"" ""Yeah, yeah, I just...

99,3xHCCH,The Trailer Showed Us Too Much!,6,28 July 2011,"Captain America is probably the cheesiest of all the Marvel superheroes, with his red-white and blue costume and all. Maybe that was why this was the last solo Avenger movie to be released before the big Unified movie next summer. This hero was really very dated, so they had to go ""period"" on him and tackle his origin in World War II era. I do not think there can be a second solo Captain America film after this. I think it will really be difficult to create cool solo movie about the Captain in the modern time.Although the face looked a bit awkward, the computer-edited scrawny body of pre-serum Steve Rogers was the most impressive visual effect in the movie for me. It looked very realistic and Chris Evans effectively captured that character's good heart and gallantry. The rest of the special effects in the movie were merely variations of effects we have seen before in all of these super hero films we have been seeing lately.Don't get me wrong. This is not really a bad movie. In fact, if you like old-fashioned style movie-making, this one was quite a spectacle in set and costume design for the 1940s. The camera work and the color palette was also very well done to bring us back to those war years. Behind Chris Evans, the supporting cast led by Tommy Lee Jones, Dominic Cooper, Hugo Weaving and Stanley Tucci was also very good. Leading lady Hayley Atwell was a little like a young Geena Davis. Their acting with a sense of humor effectively keeps Chris Evans' heroic posturings from becoming completely corny.The main limitation of this film is the very limited story. I felt it was just prolonged by repeatedly redundant war scenes pitting men (led by CA) vs. the robo- cop-looking, laser-gun toting army of the Red Skull. There also seems to be very limited things that Captain America was capable of doing, well, aside from miraculously escaping everything the enemy shot or hurled at him using his mighty shield. Ultimately however, I felt disappointed because I think the trailer already showed us too much. There was nothing much else in the movie that wasn't already seen in the trailer. There was only that exciting ending in Times Square and the Avengers clip at the end of the credits that buoyed up the day.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Their introduction passes the theatrical test, and is well done.There is an Indiana Jones humor attached to this that works quite well, too. Some of my favorite bits are during the ""sideshow"" parts, which are more than extremely watchable.

101,EUyeshima,Seemingly Old-Fashioned Superhero Epic Gives the Marvel Franchise More Life Than Expected,7,1 August 2011,"It should come as no surprise that this mid-summer 2011 entry into the Marvel Comics-originated series would be the most unabashedly old-fashioned of all the Avengers-related sagas, but what is admirable about this particular epic adventure is how committed director Joe Johnston (""October Sky"") and co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (""The Chronicles of Narnia"") appear to be in telling their somewhat revisionist story with such patriotic, good-versus-evil fervor on its own comic-book terms. There is nothing emotionally complex about the tale of this familiar superhero beyond a standard-issue time-travel element to bring all the Avengers story lines together. Bookended by present-day scenes, the bulk of the story focuses on our stalwart hero and his primary adversary, and how they confront each other during the height of World War II. In many respects, the film has a spiritual kinship with earlier retro-style epics like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and the 1977 version of ""Superman"".The historical part of the story begins in Norway where we see renegade Nazi Johann Schmidt uncovering an extraordinary power source which he plans to use for global domination. Meanwhile back in the US, diminutive and physically weak Steve Rogers is trying desperately to serve his country in the military, but he can't get past his 4-F status. His plucky tenacity does not go unnoticed as émigré military scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine selects him for a highly risky experiment that will transform him into a muscular soldier with superhuman strength and speed. He performs a heroic act of derring-do against a Nazi spy that throws him immediately into the spotlight, and the US government decides to use him to sell savings bonds at patriotic USO revues. However, when Steve finds out his best buddy ""Bucky"" Barnes is lost behind enemy lines, Captain America is truly born complete with his indestructible Vibranium shield. Naturally, he not only saves ""Bucky"" but the entire battalion who were given up for dead. All of this merely sets up the final showdown with the evil Schmidt, who has transformed himself into Red Skull, the super-powered head of HYDRA, the Nazi's occult research arm.While the action in the second half is well-paced and impressively choreographed, it also feels increasingly overblown when you consider how Captain America steadfastly remains a beacon of service and loyalty as a direct contrast to the megalomania of Red Skull. The finale feels anti-climactic in many ways. Already familiar to Marvel fans as the hot-headed Johnny Storm/""The Human Torch"" in the ""Fantastic Four"" movies, Chris Evans does surprisingly well playing such an earnest character, especially the first part where CGI effects turn him into the classic 98-pound weakling. Hugo Weaving has a field day as Schmidt, even if his character's motivations start to come across as simplistic. Other actors fare just as well if somewhat predictably given the lack of true dimension they are given to play - Toby Jones (Truman Capote in ""Infamous"") as HYDRA's No. 2, Dr. Arnim Zola; Stanley Tucci as the slyly supportive Erskine; and Tommy Lee Jones in full military bluster as Colonel Chester Phillips. Only Hayley Atwell comes across as too wan to play the tough-acting strategic officer Peggy Carter, Steve's romantic interest which the filmmakers barely have time to explore. No matter since the whole venture has obviously been designed as a springboard for 2012's ""Avengers"" sequel.",Captain America - The First Avenger
102,aharmas,Finally an Heroic Performance and What a Shield!!!,9,26 July 2011,"Joe Johnston was the man to direct this film. It's exciting, nostalgic, patriotic, and a lot of great fun. For a solid two hours, we get to travel back in time to an era where everything was a lot simpler and good fought evil, without, well, many unnecessary and way too clever for their own good, distractions. Johnston has recreated a time, with a good, old-fashioned turn by Chris Evans, playing ""Captain America"", with enough sincerity and bravado to win our hearts and sympathy in the opening scenes of the film. He improves as the story unfolds, and contrary to the usual expectations, here is a film, where the charisma of the protagonist shatters the villain from the beginning. In other words, the formula would have been explosive if the villain had been more interesting, but Evans carries the film beautifully all the way to the end.Throw in a little mysticism, add a touch of Nazism, some bullies, and threaten the country, stir a big dash of patriotism, and a rousing score, and we have a powerful film. This takes me to the rather interesting conclusion. Everything worked very well in the 40's, so what are we doing in another time period? What was meant to be a colorful introduction, becomes an interesting transition, and if you manage to sit through the credits, you'll be rewarded with what might turn out to be the movie of 2012. It'd be interesting to see if Johnston can make lighting strike twice. Whatever happens, he'd better hold on to Evans, a man who now ranks alongside Bale, but without that extreme dark side.""Captain America"" will surely be remembered at Oscar time, and it's good to see that it has not been a disappointing summer.

103,peterp-450-298716,An entertaining beginning that turned into a dull spectacle.,5,6 September 2014,"""Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are, not a perfect soldier, but a good man."" Since 2000 we are literally flooded with film versions of Marvel heroes. Just a small list: X-Men, Blade, Spider Man, Daredevil, The Hulk, The Punisher, Elektra, Fantastic Four, Ghost Rider, Iron Man, Thor, Wolverine, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy ... Pretty impressive. And this year there's the release of ""Captain America: Winter Soldier"" of which I read so many good things everywhere. In preparation for this, I had to watch the first film from ""Captain America"" so I'll be proper prepared.Captain America was introduced before World War II by Marvel and was immensely popular among the American troops. That's because he fought against the Nazis, the Japanese and other enemies of the U.S. After the 2nd World War he fought against communists during the Cold War. After that he sank into oblivion but was summoned back to join ""The Avengers"". Unlike other Marvel superheroes he doesn't have any super powers. He just has those immense muscles to defend himself with.This movie takes place in 1942. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to join the army at all costs, to participate in defeating the Nazi regime in Europe. He is far too petite and has a whole catalog of illnesses. He is rejected while his good friend James ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) is approved and about to leave to the front. At an exhibition Rogers attracts the attention of a certain Professor Erskine (Stanley Tucci) who makes him an offer: joining the secret project ""Rebirth"" where he'll receive injections and radiations with ""Vita""-rays which will stabilize and activate the injected chemicals. His physical appearance changes quite dramatically. That thin, weak little boy changes into a healthy and muscular super soldier. Erskine has chosen him because he's sure that a weak person will continue to respect this gift and still will show compassion. ""Because the strong man who has known power all his life, May lose respect for That power, but a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows ... compassion."" But Steve Rogers is the only super soldier that mankind will know because professor Erskine is assassinated and thus the experiment can no longer be repeated.The first half hour was funny and entertaining. The atmosphere of the 40's was beautiful integrated. A little bit sallow and with that 40's flair achieved by the costumes and decor. It really had that feeling of a pre-war film. The illusion they created seeing Chris Evans transforming from a toddler to an impressive person is wonderfully realized. Tommy Lee Jones (as the drill sergeant) and Tucci take care of some funny moments. Even the part where Captain America is used as a living billboard to attract new cannon fodder for the ongoing war, was reasonably entertaining. And then everything starts to look a bit ordinary and Captain America becomes a parody of itself. The transformation of a schmuck into an invincible someone is obviously something the audience loves to see, but the bland and cartooned second part puts a damper on that grandiose beginning.The fight against the Nazi Johan Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) or Red Skull, who's in possession of some sort of cube from Odin (crucial in ""The Avengers"") which contains a super power that he wants to use to put the entire Nazi regime aside and conquer the world with, is initially enjoyable but eventually decays into a lousy action-movie. I thought it was a poor and incoherent story filled with asinine coincidences. The revue Captain America performs in, happens to move to Italy. Turns out his good friend ""Bucky"" is kidnapped by Red Skull and sits in the castle that the latter has taken over, to expand his organization ""Hydra"" and provide them with devastating weapons which work with the occult forces of the captured cube. But despite that almost invincible power, it really is a piece of cake for Captain America to sweep them together on a pile. He waltzes through it as if he is faced with an army of garden gnomes who are trying to defend themselves with tiny weapons. This really looked rather simplistic. One moment Red Skull inspects his troops and before you know it he's evacuating the castle in a panic, because Captain America came knocking on a door and a German porter on duty became acquainted with his legendary shield. The credibility of the story at that time was like the person Rogers was before he got those chemicals : weak, poor and meager. You can't call it exciting actually. And it's as predictable as the fact that Easter Monday will be this year again on a Monday.The performances on the other hand are of an acceptable level. Chris Evans is superb as Captain America. The transformation of an insignificant schmuck into a savior and example of braveness for the American people, is simply sublime. Unfortunately his character eventually evolves into a third-rate action figure with an uninspired storyline. Tommy Lee Jones was again irresistible in a role that suits him. A humorless, moody loudmouth with a strong opinion and someone who says his unvarnished opinion. Hugo Weaving was perfect for the role as the dictatorial Nazi Schmidt and archenemy Red Skull. His grim facial features and demagogic madness made me forget to get irritated by his English with an exaggerated German accent.But despite the fine performances, this Captain America was no more than an average action movie. No suspense and totally not impressive. Visually it didn't look that bad but the story was of a questionable level. Ultimately, it's only an introduction to the film ""The Avengers."" The only thing I could think of was ""I hope the sequel isn't such a dull spectacle as this ....."".PS. However, I can tell you that the sequel is fantastic ...More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",Captain America - The First Avenger
104,aidanratesmovies,An Incredibly Bland Origin Story,5,24 June 2021,"Tedious, predictable, and formulaic- Captain America The First Avenger is by far the worst film the MCU has had to offer. I love the growth of the character Captain America throughout the MCU, Winter Soldier is honestly one of my favorite films growing up as well, but this incredibly bland adventure of heroism just makes me disappointed more and more every time I watch it. I keep hoping to like it, to give it a chance, a benefit of the doubt- but its just about the most basic superhero story you could ever imagine- and truly serves no purpose other than to introduce the character at hand. Chris Evans really does try to bring this film together, but much of the dialogue is ridiculous and corny. Same goes for actress Hayley Atwell and Sebastian Stan, but as side characters, they hardly get a chance to show off their strengths in this poorly written fiasco. Other performances are incredibly forced, like Tommy Lee Jones's generic drill sergeant character and Hugo Weaving's over the top performance as Red Skull. The makeup on the character is incredibly well done, but his performance is so over the top serious it's really hard not to laugh. The visuals are fun to look at, a classic 1940's vibe which is really suiting for the character- but as i've said before, the film lacks a greater depth, and truly feels bland- despite some cool scenes to look at. In the end, Captain America The First Avenger is a majorly overrated dud from Marvel and thankfully the worst they've had to offer- at least so far.My Rating: 4.9/10.",Captain America - The First Avenger

There are a lot of great moments in this, moments that I still don't believe all coalesce into a great overall movie but there's some fun to be had. There are a number of montage that I don't love but it still all balances out to something above average.",Captain America - The First Avenger

107,Spondonman,Captain America Meets General Mayhem,7,19 July 2014,"What makes this a good movie is that I enjoyed watching it, only looking at my watch once to guess how long the army of credits would be at the end. If you don't enjoy watching it then it's obviously a bad movie and one you should have avoided. Basically these Marvel Superhero cartoons always split opinions depending on how much corn and cgi cartoonery you like and whether you're a superhero story purist or not – a well made film with an entertaining storyline that holds to the end is usually the last consideration.It is utter nonsense of course: puny 4F guy keeps trying to join the Army to fight the enemy, is chosen for TS experiment in instant bodybuilding, becomes 1A Captain America and goes on a personal crusade. He, his shield and a small veritable band of brothers are up against the massive Nazi Hydra organisation controlled by self-styled god Red Skull – who apparently took his attitude cue from Paul Scofield's marvellous art-loving Nazi colonel in The Train, and a doctor who kept reminding me of Peter Lorre's mad doctor in Arsenic And Old Lace. Maybe that makes Red Skull looking like Sam Neill look like Raymond Massey looking like Boris Karloff from the same film? The bit with the flagpole reminded me of Will Smith with the noisy table in Men In Black with Tommy Lee Jones. The cgi used on the weedy Chris Evans at the start is absolutely amazing, the cgi used later for all the explosions is either routine or laughable depending on your mood, or amazing if you're a kid. I have a job lugging a shopping bag about but I suppose it's no biggie for a big strong man to be glued to a heavy metal shield. Jones as usual steals every scene he's in; what a shame the cgi wasn't up to making HIM Captain America instead. The attention paid to normal, genuine period detail is total. The only gripe I had was Red Skull seemed too quick to capitulate – firstly at and in one of his massive complexes he declares he's outmatched, presses self-destruct and skedaddles holding his petticoats, and later in the plane is swiftly despatched to the stars. But this is pure Marvel – with echoes of Raiders Of The Lost Ark and A Matter Of Life And Death – I only hope someone is in charge of Marvel Cinematic/Magazine continuation coherency otherwise I'm going to get (more) hopelessly confused.Well made (Shepperton too!) and enjoyable but completely forgettable - an admirable time-passer with brain on off or standby; fun to watch as all fantasy films should be.",Captain America - The First Avenger

109,Samiam3,Standard Popcorn flick with lots of red white and blue.,6,1 April 2012,"As an origin story, Captain America is interesting in that is takes a surprisingly short amount of time to turn its character into the hero, whereas X-Men first class and Green Lantern (other blockbusters of the same summer) needed almost their entire running length to do this. The problem with the Captain America approach is that once the human becomes superhuman, he ceases to become a character. Captain America is a well executed action movie, relying on choreography not CGI to sell the product, and as a story, it gets from A-Z in a rather fluid fashion. The problem is that it is an action movie full of boring people. Nobody, with the exception of Hayley Atwell (representing feminism in the WWII war effort) is all that interesting, least of all Chris Evans as the hero. As depicted by the unfolding of the plot here, The improbability that this guy would become Captain America is surprisingly high. If the movie took itself a bit less seriously, this might be easier to swallow. The film comes with a lame and rather unsatisfactory ending. Needless to say, it is an ending that opens the doors for a sequel. While I wont argue that Captain America doesn't deserve one, it may be not a memorable enough film to make you want more. It's a standard popcorn flick, no more no less.",Captain America - The First Avenger

111,davidmvining,The most evenly good film of Phase 1,7,25 November 2019,"This is the most Joe Johnston movie that Joe Johnston has ever made. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but it seems to make sense. I mean, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Rocketeer have a distinct feel about them and Captain America: The First Avenger takes those aesthetic and narrative generalities and just ups them.Steve Rogers is just a skinny kid with a big head in Brooklyn who really wants to join the army and punch Hitler in the face after the outbreak of World War II, but he's just too small and too unhealthy for the army. They refuse to take him despite his repeated attempts with fake names just to join up. On his sixth try, he's noticed by a scientist, Dr. Erskine, who sees his good heartedness and signs him up for an experiment within the army. Steve turns out to be the most selfless of brave of the recruits, so he gets chosen to be pumped full of drugs to become a super soldier, with the added benefit of his head being the right size for his body now.After a spy wrecks the scene, kills Erskine, and almost gets away, Rogers gets relegated to PR duties for the army, selling war bonds while punching Hitler in the jaw on stage. It's not really what he had expected, so when he goes on a USO tour for the troops, he realizes the disparity between the public image of himself that he had begun to belief and the reality of war. Everything's dirtier and dingier than the bright reds whites and blues of the stage he had occupied for the last weeks and months. And, to make it all even worse, the real soldiers see him as little more than a joke.Being a super soldier and ready to do his real duty, Rogers strikes out on his own to rescue a group of captured Americans thirty miles behind enemy lines. He breaks in, breaks them out, and then comes face to face with the Red Skull, the leader of Hitler's R&D division Hydra (they talk about hydra and heads and the cutting and the thrice over replacing, but they don't really do anything with it in this film). Red Skull is the victim of an earlier version of the same serum that gave Rogers his super strength, but instead of turning Red Skull into a great man, it only made the bad man worse and drove him to a level of madness. Other than that, he's generic with a generic goal of world domination and destruction.Having proven himself worthy of trust, Rogers becomes a real captain and starts to lead a series of missions with a 21st century approved gang of diversity to destroy a series of factories run by Hydra. It's a grand two-minute montage that feels like a recap of another movie. I really feel like the second half of the film should have been streamlined by removing the extra bases, keeping it to one, and giving us a real men on a mission story. Instead, none of the gang creates an impression because they don't have enough screen time except Bucky, Rogers' friend from New York, who ends up falling to his death and will surely never ever ever come back in this series again. Ever.Then we have our big action finale with breaking into a bunker, energy weapons, flamethrowers, cars chasing airplanes, little airplanes running into a big airplane, and a fistfight with some special effects to end it all. It's all functional and executed with some modest level of distinction.If the movie were just its plot, I would like it a good bit less than I do. The plot feels truncated and typical, but what makes this movie work is Rogers and his nascent romance with Agent Carter. It is Agent Carter who functions first as Rogers' handler. She's pretty and British and the perfect kind of movie woman for Rogers: single. When they first meet, it's before Rogers gets his infusion of delicious blue drugs and Rogers is tiny. It's obvious that she sees him as little more than one part of her job. His transition into beefcake awakens the more primal part of Carter's psyche (I love the moment when she tries to touch his peck and then pulls away). He becomes the perfect combination of aw-shucks charm, good man, and hunk, and the romance feels earned. A big part of that is due to how little ground within the romance actually gets covered. They're nowhere near a marriage proposal or jumping into bed by the final moments in the movie. They're only at the point where Rogers wants to ask her for a dance. It's so sweet and innocent and the attraction between them feels so genuine that as Rogers is making his self-sacrifice to save the world at the end and they're talking about a date that both know they'll never have, it's heartbreaking.Oh, and then it becomes a commercial for The Avengers because corporate synergy.Overall, I think Captain America is the most evenly good of the Marvel movies up to this point. Iron Man's central character arc is jagged and disjointed. Thor is great is spurts but functional for the rest. Captain America, though, is nicely entertaining from beginning to end. It's not a great film, but it is a pretty good one.",Captain America - The First Avenger
112,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Captain America: The First Avenger (2011),8,13 December 2011,"I'm so annoyed that Green Lantern was the worst superhero movie of the summer. All 4 of the superhero films this year were a big risk, involving period pieces, sci-fi, or Norse mythology, and only Green Lantern failed to be great. Anyways, to a lot of people Captain America may seem like a joke. Over patriotic propaganda. Fortunately, the film realises this and plays off it. Once Rogers becomes a superhero, he is simply used to sell war bonds. He's popular with the kids, but a joke to soldiers everywhere. Evans gives an excellent performance as a kid just wanting to do the right thing. He doesn't want to kill Nazis, he just hates bullies. Everything comes together to work in Captain America. Cooper is a fantastic choice as a young Howard Stark, Tucci is funny and touching, Lee Jones is gruff and comical, Atwell is professional and sexy. In fact, this may be one of the best played casts in years. Captain America wouldn't work without its heart being in the right place. We care for Rogers, and see how pure he is, but that doesn't mean he wont blow the bad guys away. The action scenes are brilliant, and throwing a shield has never looked so attractive. All the pieces are together for The Avengers now, and with every film (minus Iron Man 2) being impressive, we are on course for something quite extraordinary.",Captain America - The First Avenger
113,invisibleunicornninja,Entertaining,7,23 March 2018,"Plot - This movie's story is interesting and coherent. Its not as predictable as I though it was going to be - especially considering I had a lot of prior knowledge about this movie before watching it. The script is good. Some people don't like all the action towards the second half, but I thought it was well-choreographed and entertaining. There are a few plot devices that I wish were better explained, everything made sense for the most part. While there are very few scenes that made me extremely angry over their stupidity, there are still enough that they manage to hold this movie back. There are just random scenes where things like the acting and script are lower quality than the rest of the movie. These scenes of stupidity don't ruin the movie necessarily, but they are annoying and slightly lowered my overall enjoyment of this otherwise very good movie. Sights and Sounds - Overall the effects are pretty good. One or two of them are a bit awkward, but nothing too bad. The cinematography is pretty good. The sound design is great. The overall presentation of this movie is very well done. Characters - The characters are likable and well played. At no point did these people feel like actors, they felt like characters. The cast brings this movie to life. Nearly ever actor is involved in one of those low scenes, but for the most part the acting is pretty solid. I don't think that there's much more to say about this movie. Its mostly good except for a few scenes. Overall its fun and enjoyable. It slows down in some bits but not to a crawl. This isn't the greatest Marvel movie, but its not bad. I'd recommend it. There isn't an end credits scene, but at the very end there is a trailer for the first Avengers movie. Its not really worth sticking around for as the movie had already been released, but I thought I'd mention it.",Captain America - The First Avenger

To me, they are too limited in their story lines and with people who can't act their way out of a rubber johnnie. The main reason I considered watching this new version of the ""Marvel Comic"" superhero Captain America,"" is because it is an adaptation of one of the most popular characters in comic book history. In addition, that diverse character actor Tommy Lee Jones is in this film. I was slightly surprised to discover that this ""Captain America"" film was put together with some glimmer of professionalism and imagination. The leading man isn't required to do much except look tough and handsome (not much else comes to mind). I quite like the 1940s look. That was a smart move by the writers because Captain America was created when the United States entered the Second World War, so this film is fairly faithful to the source material. There is a lot of incident here and a few thrills - courtesy of the dreaded CGI! Being a success at the box office, the film that followed this one isn't so good.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Chris Evans did a great job as Captain America. Some of the action scenes are disappointingly unexciting but at least the CGI effects are eye candy. The movie ends with true patriotic heroism and full of heart. Definitely not new but it's still enjoyable.What I do think this movie did right was Captain America's origin. Also actor Hugo Weaving, the person who was bucky and Neal Mcdonough were also very good as there parts. Red Skull's death never made sense to me I hope Hugo Weaving returns as his role in the near future.

119,brando647,The Best Marvel Movie Since IRON MAN,8,19 December 2011,"Here it is: the final ingredient for Marvel Studios' ambitious Avengers crossover film in the summer of 2012. Honestly, I wasn't all that excited in the months leading up to Captain America's big budget induction into Marvel's film canon for a few reasons. When I'd originally read that director Joe Johnston would be stepping in to helm the film, my mind kept going back to JURASSIC PARK 3 and how it had tainted a fun franchise. Combine that with the fact that I've never been a die-hard Captain America fan and the knowledge that the filmmaker's were going to have a lot of story on their hands if they wanted to bring the Captain America story to the point where he's ready for an Avengers crossover (covering his origins, his time in WWII, his arrival in contemporary times, etc.) in one film; I had severe doubts going in. For the non-Marvel fans, Captain America tells the story of Steve Rogers, a young man desperate to enlist in the military and fight for his country in World War II. Unfortunately he's got a list of physical problems that more than ensure he'll never see combat; that is, until he's approached by Dr. Abraham Erskine who wishes to test a new serum on Rogers. The procedure turns Rogers from a scrawny weakling into a super soldier and he becomes America's hero. As Captain America, it becomes apparent that he might be the country's only real hope against the forces of HYDRA and it's leader, the Red Skull.I admit I was wrong about this movie. It's the best Marvel film since the first IRON MAN in 2008. This is because it doesn't necessarily feel as if I'm watching a ""superhero"" movie. When I saw THOR earlier this year (and especially GREEN LANTERN), I started wondering if all these superhero comic-inspired movies were beginning to fall into a pattern where each of them would start feeling like the same tale over and over with different characters. As if Hollywood execs would just create a superhero Mad Libs and fill out the lines with a different character each time and follow the same mold. CAPTAIN America didn't have that feeling. This movie felt more like an action/adventure film in the same vein as the Indiana Jones series that just happened to feature a super-powered protagonist. His powers aren't flashy and over-the-top. He can't fly or transform or fire energy blasts. He's just super strong, fast, and handy with a shield. As a result, the movie feels more grounded in reality (despite HYDRA's future tech and Howard Stark's gizmos). The Red Skull's abuse of the cosmic cube and the power it gives him to create his weapon of mass destruction feels no different from the Nazi's obsession with utilizing the Ark of the Covenant. I wasn't aware how badly I was missing a good adventure film until CAPTAIN America came around. I hope they continue the same adventure vibe with future movies in the series despite Cap's arrival in contemporary times.There were a few major mistakes this movie could've made that would've turned the whole thing into a joke, but they avoid all of them. The filmmakers had a real challenge with this one, keeping the WWII origins intact and creating a style for the Captain that stays true to his design without coming off as too hokey. I love that the designers showed some love for the original costume in the propaganda sequences, and the actual costume was a great combination of the original Captain America with a more realistic style. Chris Evans was a perfect choice for the title role. We may as well forget that he ever played the Human Torch in the FANTASTIC 4 movies, because this is Evan's ideal comic hero role. He gives Rogers/Cap a real charisma and fighting spirit; he is the ultimate ""good guy"". And his villain is just as perfect. Hugo Weaving is a perfect villain for any movie, so it makes sense that he'd make such an awesome Red Skull. He hams it up just enough to be menacing and memorable without going over the edge into comical. With all of these strengths, my only complaint would probably be that the movie had to rush and get Rogers into modern times. I know we've got an Avengers movie to look forward too but I wish we'd had a little more time of Captain America kicking Nazi butt. Otherwise, CAPTAIN America was my surprise hit for the summer.",Captain America - The First Avenger
120,moviewizguy,Discover the origin of the first avenger.,8,23 July 2011,"Captain America: The First Avenger will focus on the early days of the Marvel Universe when Steve Rogers volunteers to participate in an experimental program that turns him into the Super Soldier known as Captain America. As Captain America, Rogers joins forces with Bucky Barnes and Peggy Carter to wage war on the evil HYDRA organization, led by the villainous Red Skull -- (C) ParamountOut of all superhero films that have come out this year, Captain America is not only the best one, but is also the only one that I actually liked. Now, some might argue that X-Men: First Class was fantastic (I am NOT a fan of Thor), but, while not bad, I felt it didn't reach its potential. As for Captain America, its main distinction to other summer films is that it doesn't dive right into the action. I appreciated the time it took to develop its characters, and, gee, there actually seemed to be a story going on here. I also have to warn those of you who might expect a straight up action flick to not get your hopes high. Although it didn't bother me, it does take a while before an action scene actually appears.Another distinction that separates itself from other superhero films is the look of the film, coinciding its setting in 1942. Captain America looks and feels like an old-fashion film, and I really embraced it. This is also due to Alan Silvestri's score, which feels more classic than modern film scores. Our protagonist, Steve Rogers, feels like a real person which adds an emotional weight to the film. We feel for him and want him to succeed in his goal. And once the story is set up and the action finally comes to play, the action doesn't seem to appear for action's sake. It actually propels the story. It also doesn't hurt having a romance brewing between him and Peggy Carter. It was sweet and didn't feel forced to me.Chris Evans plays the title character and he's great playing both the skinny, average Joe and the buff, all-American hero. He certainly steps up his performance here compared to his other superhero character, Johnny Storm. He brings a sort of charisma and puppy dog charm to his role, and it seems like an automatic response to be on his side when we first meet his character. Hayley Atwell is totally believable as his love interest as well. I would love to see what other things she has to offer in future roles. With all good superhero films, there must be a villain to match it. In that case, it's not surprising that Hugo Weaving doesn't disappoint. Just as the person he is, he can withhold an audience's attention without even trying.I also liked the relationship between Evans and Sebastian Stan, who plays his best friend. It felt authentic. Tommy Lee Jones brings a few laughs as well. Playing Tony Stark's father, Dominic Cooper thankfully doesn't feel like an Iron Man character being in an Avenger's flick just to string in the Avenger characters together because Thor and Iron Man 2 felt like films made just for the Avengers flick rather than individual films themselves. Stanley Tucci is good in a small role, although the German accent does push it a little.With a good story, great characters, great action scenes, and an involving narrative, Captain America is definitely a hit for Marvel Studios. The unique 1940s setting also sets itself apart from other superhero films, and Chris Evans is terrific in the title role. Captain America doesn't feel like your usual popcorn summer flick, and maybe it's a good thing it isn't. Also, stay after the credits to see a cool Avengers trailer.",Captain America - The First Avenger

122,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is very good fun, but arguably the weakest entry in ""Phase One"" of the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe""...",7,17 March 2012,"Chris Evans stars in director Joe Johnston's ""Captain America: The First Avenger"", the fifth film in the ever-growing ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"", a franchise that was launched in 2008 with ""Iron Man."" And while ""Captain America"" is a fun little film, it was slightly a bitter-sweet watch. Despite being an interesting effort and a decent entry into the series... it felt like a bit of a letdown.Evans plays Steve Rogers, a scrawny young man in 1942 America, whom desperately wants to defend the country in World War II, but can't because of his various health concerns. While talking with his best friend Bucky about his desire to help out, a scientist overhears him and decides to let him take part in an experimental new super-soldier program. Under supervision of an American general (Tommy Lee Jones) and a gorgeous British Agent named Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), Rogers is eventually given the experimental treatment and turned into ""Captain America""- a muscular, superhuman man whom is first used as a sort-of mascot for the US Forces, taking part in rallies, tours and theatrical films to raise money for the war effort. However, when Bucky's unit is captured, Steve is forced to use the help of Peggy and Howard Stark (father of Tony from Iron Man) to re-invent himself as a superhero.At the same time, the evil Nazi/Hydra commander Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), whom is also known as the deadly ""Red Skull"", is trying to track down and learn how to channel the ""Tesseract"", an artifact of untold power which may or may not be related to Asgard from the Thor films.To give credit where it is due, the acting is fairly strong. Evans makes a great Captain America, and Weaving is an adequately menacing villain, often sounding like a German-ized version of his iconic ""Smith"" character from ""The Matrix."" Hayley Atwell is beautiful and gives a touching performances, and supporting roles by the likes of Jones and Sebastian Stan are all well-played.The direction by Joe Johnston, whom I usually quite like as a director, is very mixed. It is very uninspired, and the camera-work is fairly basic, which cheapened the film. Each of the other directors of the Avengers films (including Kenneth Branaugh, Jon Favreau and Louis Letterier) gave their movies a unique, personal quality to the aesthetics, but Johnston just seems to throw his hands up and settle for the most basic, boring shots. It actually took me out of the film, it was so basic.The script is another huge problem. The script isn't bad, I will say that. But it's severely underdeveloped at times, and the flow is a bit too slow. My main problem is that the villains (particularly Red Skull, whom is an icon in the world of comics) are not developed at all. We are just told in a quick flashback that Red Skull is ""evil"", and that's all the development he gets. His cronies and goons are also just stock Nazi characters. This was my major concern for the film- I didn't care about any of the villains, which meant I wasn't emotionally invested in the heroes struggle against them. It was a betrayal of the audience.Those fairly major complaints aside, I will say this movie isn't a total loss. It's a lot of fun to watch, and has a lot of clever moments. (In particular a hilarious musical sequence in which the good Captain is turned into a glorified mascot) And the action is a bit more substantial than Summer 2011's other Avengers release (""Thor""), and it feels slightly less anti-climactic.But it's still easily the weakest entry in the first-phase of the series. It's worth seeing for fans who are awaiting the upcoming Avengers crossover, but I don't know if it would appeal to others quite as much. I give it a pretty-good 7 out of 10. Good fun, but ever-so-slightly underwhelming.",Captain America - The First Avenger

126,valadas,Old comic strips hero on a new version,6,16 August 2011,"When I was a teenager there were three super heroes of the American comic strips that where unknown in Portugal: Captain Marvel, Superman and of course Captain America. But I had the privilege of reading their stories on Brazilian juvenile magazines I used to borrow from a friend who came from Brazil and brought lots of them. Therefore to watch this movie has brought old memories to me though this version is quite different from the old ones. But sticking to the movie, this is an action movie that adds something more to the story than average action movies usually do: it has an ideology and a healthy one: antinazism. Notwithstanding that the villain here (Johann Schmidt / Red Skull) is some kind of a Nazi dissident who wants to exploit his superpowers to his own profit. The rest is the usual amount of classic brilliant computer made special visual effects, the thrilling action and the no less usual suspense clichés. The ending is a open one and a bit confusing or not fully explained. Any way if you go to see this movie you will spend a couple of hours amused and entertained.",Captain America - The First Avenger

After Iron Man and Thor, it was Captain America, whom everybody was eying for because eventually Captain America leads the Avengers to their Ultimate Journey. The movie is the beginning of Captain America's fantastical journey so it was enjoyable but I wanted more solid action in the movie. Especially while watching in 3D, the Shield needed to be more useful in fights than it was showed. Captain America got one thing right for sure, Chris Evens. His physique and American charm is perfect for the movie. And the most important thing is it was nice to see him leaving the cockiness from his acting and presenting a more vulnerable side. Hayley Atwell is good as strict British lady but I always felt that just like Rebecca Hall she lacks the Super Star Charisma. But for the movie she was perfect. In other cast Dominic Cooper, Hugo Weaving, Stanley Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones and Sebastian Stan are impressive. Since, we have seen Iron Man1-2 and Thor, it's a must see. Otherwise getting into the Avengers without seeing anyone of those won't be a great idea.

129,Screen_Blitz,"Tense, entertaining debut of Marvel hero Captain America",7,22 April 2016,"Marvel Studios is absolutely no stranger to box office glory, and such has been proved since the debut of the Marvel Cinematic Universe beginning with 'Iron Man' in the summer of 2008. Whether the biggest appeal ignites from the charismatic special effects, the filmmakers' enigmatic ability to adapt the comics to the screen, or both of the above; the Marvel Cinematic Universe never fails to grip the attention of millions of fans around America and gained a highly spoken popularity status. And its success is not anticipated to reach stopping point anytime soon. This action blockbuster directed by Joe Johnston is no exception, introducing the patriotic superhero Captain America wielding an American flag- designed shield and where his story began. Set in the 1940s during World War II, Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers, a frustrated short lightweight weakling who enlists in the U.S army, but is consequently rejected due to his incompetence. His life changes when he is later recruited by Dr. Erskine (played by Stanley Tucci) and Colonol Chester Phillips (played by Tommy Lee Jones) for a high-tech experiment that transforms him from a skinny ""98 pound weakling"" to a powerful superhuman suiting the identity of you guessed it -- Captain America. When Dr. Erskine is unexpectedly murdered by Johann Schimdt a.k.a. Red Skull (played by Hugo Weaving), head of a secret Nazi corporation, Captain America is assigned to take him down.This film is about the same kind of popcorn flick you would expect of the other Marvel cinematic entries, and relatively the same appeal. This science-fiction action thriller carries on its charisma with the amazing performance by Chris Evans who stands out with diligence in the role of titular hero as well as the fantastic Hugo Weaving as the prominent villain Red Skull, and it's faithful justice to the comic books. Captain America makes out to be an easily likable with both pros and flaws while less. Unlike most superheroes though, Captain America gives no second thoughts before killing his enemies, similar to his portrayal in the comics. As the story takes place during the height of World War II, the film carries a theme of patriotism with some political commentary dealing with war in the European front, and and it fits with the story somewhat well. The story is decently paced and rarely sports a dull moment, though it has some minor flaws sprinkled throughout its run, most particular the villain Red Skull who's a little memorable than the most of the Marvel villains. Nonethless, the film leaves the rest of its appeal to spectacular action sequences punctuated by charming special effects, and the occasional humor from the supporting cast.Captain America: The First Avenger is a tense, solid, and entertaining addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a soulful introduction to the titular hero. This is as film that many Marvel fans can't be help but be pleased with. Is it what I called one of the best of the Marvel films? Probably not. But it certainly appealing and a fun superhero blockbuster that delivers well and defines the career of the main star Chris Evans.",Captain America - The First Avenger
130,dunmore_ego,"Red, White and Boob.",6,24 November 2011,"In World War II, a patriotic American weakling, Steve Rogers, is injected with a top secret military serum to become a super soldier. Yes, it's Captain America! The red, white and blue avenger, in the best comicbook movie of the decade - and by that I mean, it's lightweight and predictable and aimed at twelve-year-olds.CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER captures all the spirit and action and derring-do of the Marvel Comics character created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby in 1941; just as that blond, blue-eyed super-patriot leaped off the pages in his battle against Hitler, so too does this latest filmic All-American Whitebread prettyboy... Trouble is, besides his interesting origin tale, and despite his iconic flag-wrapped butt, there was never much depth to this particular Marvel Comics superhero in the first place.So I mean it when I say the movie is well made, beautifully shot in ochre hues, with the actors putting alarming conviction into their relatively shallow roles, but Captain America himself (played with body-shaved sincerity by Chris Evans) is just not that interesting a character. All he does is throw his shield and punch people. And leap like Air Jordan, sometimes while throwing his shield and punching people. Thus, after an interesting buildup to the injection of skinny Steve Rogers with super soldier serum, the movie gets down to shield-throwing, punching people and Air Jordaning. Albeit, very nicely.Stanley Tucci is the good doctor Erskine who experiments on Rogers and is killed off much too soon by a German spy. I love The Tucci - what a great actor and underrated director; even in this death scene, his final wordless gesture is magnificently performed - but I think he picked up his ""Cherman"" accent by watching HOGAN'S HEROES.Hugo Weaving's Nazi accent is not much better, as I'm sure he's mixing in a little Elvish. He's Jonathan Schmidt aka The Red Skull, also imbued with super serum, but because he's Cherman, he ended up ""bad."" Luckily, he didn't need any makeup to play Cap's craggy-faced nemesis - those cheekbones, like a Swiss model! Toby Jones is the Red Skull's sycophant, and his German accent is so bad, I'm positive he didn't even watch the HOGAN'S HEROES episodes provided by the filmmakers as homework.Tommy Lee Jones is Colonel Chester Philips, who is here to make snide remarks in his characteristic drill-instructor staccato. Hayley Atwell is Cap's G-Rated love interest, and if it weren't for her magnus 36DD-cups straining against her army uniform, we'd notice she looks like Bill Hader. Dominic Cooper is physicist Howard Stark (yes, IRON MAN Tony's father), who creates Cap's shield, and makes Cap jealous by sharing fondue with the Bill Hader chick.And Sebastian Stan is Cap's pal, ""Bucky"" Barnes - in the comics, the ambiguously gay Robin to Cap's Batman, in this movie, a rugged heartthrob himself when the mighty man-beauty of Evans is not standing next to him. In tights.When Steve Rogers is a 90-pound weakling, it is Chris Evans's face computer-inserted over a skinny guy; an astonishing special effects feat that makes us realize that the era of the Method Actor gaining or losing weight may be past; just keep those computers rendering and those IT guys fed. Gotta admit that Chris Evans looks exactly what you'd expect an All-American boy to look like, and he's playing THE All-American Boy; that guy must get laid like he's the last man on Earth.Director Joe Johnston (THE WOLFMAN 2010, JURASSIC PARK III) is so erratic that the film ""works"" in so many tiny ways (the colorful caricature of Captain America selling war bonds, the gruffness of Tommy Lee Jones disguising his understanding heart, the flip manner in which Captain America refers to himself - and how damn cool is it when he throws that shield?) and simultaneously doesn't work in bigger ways. For example: To intercept a moving train, Cap's squad must slide down a cable - which has no purpose being on that mountain other than to provide their Tinkerbell moment; once onboard the train, they battle bad guys in freight cars with road cases stacked on shelves - with none of the cases strapped down; when the bad guys shoot at Cap and miss (obviously because they've graduated with honors from the Stormtrooper Training Program on Bespin), Toby Jones has to yell at them through their headsets, more than once, ""Kill him! Fire again!"" Really? I thought he was free to go after I missed him the first time... Then the Bill Hader chick turns up with her squad of reinforcements. Take note that all the soldiers are in full battle gear including helmets and body armor - all except for Hader. No helmet or body armor. Why? So we can see her pretty hair flounce and watch her breasts straining against the thin fabric of her uniform, her chest heaving like she's on the brink of orgasm. Such a realistic depiction of the horrors of war.I was almost applauding this movie for its attempt at credible science when skinny Steve was placed in the Manulator and doused with Vita-Rays (which, from the results, seem to automatically body-shave you), but then all the machines malfunctioned with Movie Sparks flying out de side. Sparks?! Really? Add that to the catwalk scene where someone must jump across as it collapses, and the climax scene where two men fight onboard a plane that is going down because no one is at the controls and we're just asking for Brendan Fraser.Movie ends with a promise that ""Captain America will return in The Avengers."" Knowing that that movie is being directed by Joss Whedon (the mind behind FIREFLY) makes me almost wanna salute a flag. Or at least punch someone and throw my shield...",Captain America - The First Avenger
131,pyrocitor,"""I've knocked out Adolf Hitler over 200 times.""",9,27 July 2011,"Considering how fundamentally 'safe' the superhero action film has become in terms of box office and reasonable standards of entertainment, selling Captain America, age-old icon of American propaganda on cinema screens in cynical and economically unstable times could hardly have been a more difficult endeavor – tellingly, the film was marketed simply as The First Avenger in Russia, the Ukraine and South Korea. Indeed, skepticism and uncertainty have riddled the development of the project, which was first pitched as a Jon Favreau ""action comedy"" and later as a brutal, gritty, self-critical postmodern war epic. Such tonal fluctuation mirroring the social/political climate demonstrated that having a successful film with such a politically entwined protagonist, was anything but 'safe' – it's hard to imagine Peter Parker being subjected to the scrutiny of ""military propaganda"" or ""patriotic cheese"" that beset Steve Rogers. With this in mind, all the more credit can be given to Spielberg-cohort Joe Johnson for delivering what is ultimately the first comic book film that properly feels like a cartoon brought to life. Pitching strictly for nostalgia, Johnson bravely girds his film with the unabashed gee-wiz charm and heart of a 1940s Saturday morning adventure serial. In the process, without consistently tripping over political correctness, Johnson neatly circumvents concerns of propagandistic exploitation by delivering a film too bombastic, too colourful, too cheerily old-fashioned to be taken seriously enough as any kind of coy ideological manipulation. It's hard to imagine any contemporary audiences, cine-literate or not, being swayed to join the army by witnessing Captain America's hilariously cringe-worthy war bonds tour, arguably the film's strongest and most self-aware sequence. Even a couple of brazenly Spielbergian montages - conflating Captain America's early triumphs or the Red Skull's past crimes into a series of dramatic snapshots - somehow function as endearing and in keeping with the boldly cheerful feel, as Johnson keeps the pace whipping along with an engaging sprightly bounce, accompanied by Alan Silvestri's soaringly heroic musical score. Indeed, Captain America comes across as more of a vintage science-fiction adventure than war film, as Johnson channels the sort of deliriously cartoonish aesthetic, weapons and technology of 1940s serials, including lavish set design that would do any James Bond evil mastermind proud. Curiously, Johnson's film works in some surprisingly intense action, (including one of the more unexpectedly gruesome deaths in a comic book film), exploring Captain America's comparatively 'grounded' superhuman abilities to the effect of some of the most gripping fight scenes in recent memory, alternating tightly choreographed beat downs while adding the intriguing new dimension of his ricocheting shield to keep the action nuanced. Between the tidily doled out combat (including unique, visually dynamic showdowns between Nazi-scientist sect Hydra and the US army) and the film's encompassing virtually every form of chase scene (car, foot, submarine, motorcycle, train, helicopter, airplane and even zip-lining), there is ample material to appease any expectations for summer spectacle. Nonetheless, Johnson's film is not, despite its glossy cartoon finish, without its faults. Despite the thundering action, the film may prove too over-the-top for those disinclined to filter through a haze of charming nostalgia. Similarly, throwback cartoonish fun and self-aware irony aside, some viewers may still find it impossible to shake the notion of watching a distasteful two hour army recruitment video. Additionally, like predecessor Thor, the film does lose its footing somewhat as it approaches the climax, and its juggling the emotional demands of a stand-alone narrative while still bridging the transition towards the upcoming superhero epic The Avengers may prove unsettling for non-comic fans. Nonetheless, Johnson admirably reconciles the two, grinding the whiz-bang cheerfulness of his film to a halt with a jarring, quietly tragic ending that, miraculously, proves oddly appropriate in spite of its discordance. Either way, if ever there were a film this year worth sitting out the ending credits, this would be the one. Chris Evans as the iconic ""star-spangled man with the plan"" proves the film's greatest boon. Muting his customary swagger without sacrificing his overflowing charisma, Evans concocts an effortless blend between earnestness and underhanded humour, that makes his transition from good-hearted scrawny loser to unexpected patriotic icon somehow feel incredibly believable, sympathetic and appealing, thus selling the whole film. The fact that Evans can tackle moments such as a ""this is why we fight"" speech, saddled with a nearly absurd CGI- shrunken body, with a straight face and without a false note, and transition to asking his best buddy ""Are you ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of hell?"" with a perfect a quiver of world-weary, witty, self-mockery in his voice, demonstrates a masterfully conscious and nuanced performer delivering his most assured work yet. However, Johnson wisely surrounds Evans with a truly impressive supporting cast, each inhabiting their cheerfully one-note characters with enthusiasm to spare. Hugo Weaving masticates scenery with appropriate preening oiliness as the dastardly Red Skull, and Hayley Atwell and Sebastian Stan inhabit love interest Peggy Carter and best buddy Bucky Barnes with laudable presence and credibility. Tommy Lee Jones has a ball wryly clashing with the film around him as Rogers' military superior, and scene-stealer Stanley Tucci infuses the film with warmth and wit as the scientist behind Rogers' super soldier transformation. Dominic Cooper triumphantly bubbles over with charisma, charm and quirky humour worthy of his superheroic son as master inventor Howard Stark, while Toby Jones slithers with welcome relish as the Red Skull's chief scientist Arnim Zola. While the true make-or-break of the character will depend on his exploration in a contemporary context by Joss Whedon in The Avengers, it is hard to imagine a more appropriate or enjoyable character introduction. Consider Captain America as Indiana Jones' square-jawed uncle – bold enough to demonstrate, by example, the role and function of a national icon, yet retrospectively wise enough to stick to its guns and striving for pure entertainment. Such an unabashed dash of fun is worthy of 'recruiting' viewers everywhere. -9/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
132,oneguyrambling,Fun and frivolous in just the proper proportions.,7,20 April 2012,"Imagine my pleasant surprise to find that Captain America is fun and frivolous in all the right ways.In 1942 America's involvement in WW2 was in full swing, with their rude introduction occurring at Pearl Harbour the previous year. Countless brave young Americans line up to defend the honour of their proud nation against the Axis of evil.Unfortunately thanks to a laundry list of health and wellbeing issues, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is unable to be accepted as one of them, despite his best intentions and continued applications, he finds his weak frame keeps him out of the army. He also finds that his big mouth, noble principles and never say die attitude continually gets him into trouble.Then Dr Erskine (Stanley Tucci) identifies this scrappy runt with a heartbeat that keeps time with the Star Spangled Banner. Erskine tells Rogers of a new program which he refers to as his last and only shot of being able to serve his Country, of course Rogers agrees immediately and undergoes a painful procedure that Springfielders might say embiggens everything about Steve.He enters the lab a scrawny 50 kg weakling and emerges more video game hero than man; a handsome, smooth, chiseled buffalupagus with the same super-GO USA-principals and incredible physical abilities. One of the (possibly unintended) side-effects is definitive swooniness.Without too much messing about Rogers is plonked into an army unit where he is written off as a science project by his superior Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) and sympathised with by Soldier Peggy Carter (a gravity defying Hayley Atwell).After a brief delay to promote the cause Rogers is sent to the front line, where his new powers are put to the test against the Nasti Nazis, primarily the fiendish Hydra unit lead by Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), a man with physical secrets of his own, and a man who has aspirations of no less than world domination. He also has the coolest toys – more on that later The strength of Captain America is how it deliberately toes the superhero movie line, the beauties are beautiful, the men noble and brave and the bad guys appropriately back-lit to appear instantly ominous. There is also the obligatory Stan Lee cameo, and of course the Nazis are always good superhero escapist fodder.Unfortunately I can't mention the strengths without the minor weaknesses, for while Captain America is indeed worth watching I can't help but feel it has been a victim to The Avengers success thus far, as the sheer number of big names already in The Avengers universe has resulted in Chris Evans being dragged off the bench for duty.Chris Evans' best role that I know of was his 10 minute character role in Scott Pilgrim Vs the World as a charisma-free beefcake action star moron. Here he plays the supposed antithesis of that guy, but he once again fails to bring the charisma, Evans might be a bona fide buff guy as the first unveiling of his super-modded physique shows, but there must be dozens of guys in Hollywood all better credentialed for the acting part of Steve Rogers – the problem is they are all in Iron Man/Thor/Hulk/X-Men/Green Lantern and so on.Chris Evans is less the leading man for Captain America, he is more the last man standing in this game of superhero pick up.Hugo Weaving and I on the other hand have a long relationship, he played an over acting robot/computer program (I don't care which nerds) in The Matrix and was once again a scenery chewing over-enunciator spitting Tolkien dialogue in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. As Schmidt/Red Skull he claims to have used the voice and accent of renowned German filmmakers as his template, but bugger me if it doesn't come across as 99% Arnie Schwarzenegger to me – the one oft-copied and universally derided by millions. So either Hugo is busting out another crappy accent, or we should lay off the Arnie bashing because apparently that's how all Germans talk! But that aside, the best part of the film though is the prevailing sense of entertainment over all, the fact that this is not historically accurate or scientifically possible is not mentioned. They don't try to introduce ridiculous justifications – radioactive spiders anyone? – and more or less say 'don't ask why, we just can'.Or perhaps more appropriately 'Don't ask, Don't tell"".The Hydra team have some of the awesomest toys in cinema history, with Schmidt/Red Skull boasting a simply insane garage filled with a monstrous car, a slick one man submarine and numerous supercool aircraft. His men also have bad-ass uniforms and helmets and weaponry that other cinema bad guys could only dream of. The Nazis might be the undercard in this film, but they sure look cooler.Watching this film made me realise that the much maligned 'look how fast we've developed and what we can do now' montage is under-appreciated and underused. This leads to a film with one foot in the Avengers camp and the other in Indiana Jones territory, pretty good company I would argue.Final Rating – 7 / 10. If you like your superhero films to be escapist entertainment look no further, I just can't help but feel that this might be an 8 if there were better leads involved, (and it might tip into a 9 with some Hayley Atwell nudity)!",Captain America - The First Avenger

The action scenes they did show were awesome. It had beautiful scenery, a decent cast, some funny moments, and Captain America's costume was really cool. (Hayley Altwell did a great job as Peggy Carter. She was very pretty, and looked like she was from the 40's.) Steve Rogers is too skinny and weak to join the military in 1942. He is offered a chance to be the first in the ""Super-Soldier"" experiment.

135,RNMorton,Parts are greater than the sum,8,23 August 2011,"Let's start with the good stuff first. The basic Captain America story is a good one and makes for a solid movie. Marvel ALWAYS does well with casting, and it's flawless again here. Evans, Atwell (wow), and Weaving (Elrond) are all spot on, Jackson in a limited role and Jones are also good if not at this point overused. In my opinion Stanley Tucci steals the show in his early appearances as the gentle scientist who prefers the spunky but skinny Rogers for his project. And the CG action scenes which crop up during the movie are a little more realistic than the cut-action/rock video Michael Bay style, where you can't even tell what's going on most of the time. It also does well in projecting the WWII atmosphere. That being said, this movie suffers from two major flaws shared with other Marvel entries - it's TOO DAMN LONG and it is too derivative in its story line. These movies really don't work at over 1:30, it often seems like there's filler thrown in to stretch the time for network resale (or whatever the reason is). There's very little flow from one scene to another. The plot turns are almost formula, this one has elements of Spiderman I & III along with some Star Wars and Lord of the Rings thrown in. Maybe II will be better, I'm not giving up on this yet, but they need to step it up a little.

Once he's turned into a weapon, the film shows how the army didn't know what to do with him, leaving him to make up his own mind to stand for truth, justice and freedom in a fight against a rogue Nazi villain, Johann Schmidt, a.k.a. The Red Skull. This is an origin story meant to show new audiences what Cpt. America is all about so threat not if you haven't read any comics, you can learn it all here. Chris Evans plays his role as Cpt America brilliantly, I liked him as Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four movies but I think in Cpt. America he has found something better here. Hugo Weaving is a great Red Skull, menacing vocal delivery as well as appearance. You can literally feel the evil oozing from him at times. Hayley Atwell makes a brilliant Peggy Carter, so much so that she got a spin off TV series which is one of the better Marvel TV series. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes is believable, he lays a great foundation for future appearances yet to come. He's Steve Rogers best friend in the early days and always believes in him which is something that Rogers needs for strength. Tommy Lee Jones (Col. Phillips) should get a mention as he plays the hardened drill sergeant who doesn't want to get involved in super soldier experiments while at the same time secretly wanting it to succeed for the good of humanity. He plays both sides of that characteristic really well and believable. Dominic Cooper makes a suave Howard Stark, easily believable as Tony Stark's father in the already screened Iron Man films. While being full of his own self importance he also manages to be believable as a genius when his interests are peaked. The strength of his delivery made him a regular character in the Agent Carter TV series that Atwell stars in. Stanley Tucci (Dr Erskine) delivers a caring and hopeful performance as the father of the super soldier imitative. His demise (sorry for the spoiler) provides the motivation Steve Rogers needs to be more involved in fighting the bad guys. He's the conscience that Rogers can refer to throughout the film and his death feels almost like the passing of a real father. Toby Jones (Dr Arnim Zola) is creepy and threatening, I practically needed to have a shower after seeing how creepy he delivered his role. Neal McDonough (Dumb Dumb Dugan) plays true to the comic books as one of the Howling Commando's who fight alongside Cpt America, loud, brash and confident. All the cast actually deliver authentic performances and I can't single out a weak casting in this film. While the film isn't a direct reflection of the comic books I didn't find that distracting, like the many multi-verses I just tell myself this is yet another re-imagining of the Marvel characters, in that sense it works. If you went into this expecting it to be exactly how the origin story worked in comic books then you may be disappointed. There are good mix between action and drama with a few giggles thrown in for good measure. The film is not too CGI heavy and has a certain look and feel which makes it come across as a great film. I really enjoyed this despite Cpt. America being one of my least favourite characters. I'm going to give this 7 out of 10.",Captain America - The First Avenger
141,educallejero,"Good movie, but...",6,10 April 2019,"I absolutely despise the musical montage. It should ""work"". But after watching a serious, well paced and with a lot of heart movie, it just stops on its feet and drags for about 25 minutes on ""Rogers is/was used as propaganda"" (without any nuanced commentary, just finger pointing) and his sadness about it, plus a few romantic scenes (all mediocre at best).After that, it gets going again and its fine, not awesome, with a lot of action sequences. All good enough but again, not that great.The ""used as propaganda"" subplot should've been more heartbreaking or deep. Or maybe used on scenes showing Rogers growing up, and/or his relationships with Bucky and Peggy Carter, both underdeveloped.",Captain America - The First Avenger
142,phubbs,Captain America: The First Avenger,7,6 August 2014,"I totally misunderstood the whole plot and concept for this latest Marvel flick it seems. I kinda assumed it was set during WWII with the Cap becoming super and heroic then the film would move into the present and we would have him running around being all mighty in a hi-tech world...so completely wrong there then.I must admit at first I was getting twitchy as the film was most definitely childish and along the lines of a live action video game adaptation, but as the plot unfolded I did find myself enjoying the film a lot more. I think one reason I enjoyed the film is because it runs along the same kind of lines as 'Iron Man'. It does look good and it holds a slight sense of believability with its use of semi realistic technology (well it looks possible) over magic, sorcery and alien type characters etc...Its not an overly exaggerated fantasy in other words...unlike 'Thor' which is a completely different animal, certain aspects could be seen as more realistic.Going back to my live action video game adaptation notion, I firmly believe ideas may have been borrowed from the old video game Wolfenstein. The troops of Hydra with their aggressive intimidating helmets and body armour, the flame thrower troops, certain sets, evil scientists, heavy metallic war machines etc...It was almost 'Wolfenstein: the Movie' but that ultra-tech Nazi combination always did have a powerful intriguing and exciting vibe about it. I'm pretty sure in the original comics the Captain was actually fighting the Nazi's back in the day. I think that aspect was watered down to make this more easier going for younger viewers...I think, I'm not an expert on these matters. Shame really because it would have been much better with Nazi's, 'The Rocketeer' and Indy franchises both worked well battling against those naughty Germans.That aside I think the development of the lead character Rogers was excellent in this film (best yet), really brought out that classic can do spirit that the allies had during the time with all the propaganda...posters TV adverts recruitment ads in cinemas etc...The film was really put together well in this aspect and did the period proud I think with accuracy and visual style. Also we don't just get an eight minute flashback history of how Rogers dons the suit, it takes most of the film to bring him around to that point, learning what he needs from experience in the field of combat whilst piecing together the suit and shield (with Stark). Most of the time he's actually in military uniform and only wears the suit for missions which is much more realistic as you would assume the Hollywood bigwigs would want him in it 24/7.Again much like the other Marvel films the casting has been really good and elevated the film greatly with strong solid performances from Jones and Tucci adding the class. Evans actually is pretty good as the Captain and much more likable than the cocky jock in 'Fantastic 4'. Weaving is piling on the bratwurst as The Red Skull and doing it in his usual decent dastardly manner, Cooper makes a surprise success of Stark senior and finally Atwell is perfectly peachy as the love interest doing a far better job than Paltrow. Must add I loved Rogers hand picked team for his special missions, especially Neal McDonough's handlebar moustached bowler hat wearing tough guy. A really unique looking team of soldiers that kinda has a steampunk feel about them if you ask me, like something out of the classic video game 'The Chaos Engine'.So after the reasonable 'Thor' we are back on track with the Captain but one or two plot niggles bug me. What happened to Weaving at the end exactly? what was the cube thingy? what happened to the cube thingy? how exactly did The Red Skull manage to finance all those machines...win over so many men to be his soldiers presumably from the Third Reich and evade Hitler whom I'm sure would of been after him for deserting? And why did the serum do what it did to Schmidt? Apart from that and some dodgy moments of bluescreen I did like the film. Its cool seeing all these Marvel films intertwine with each other...like the use of Stark senior. A thoroughly enjoyable tongue- in- cheek pulp magazine styled action fest with dashing heroes, caddish evil villains, damsels in distress and of course plenty of good old fashioned Americana.7/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
143,MuviFan73,A nice beginning in creation of the first Avenger!,8,13 October 2018,"It is nice to witness mostly how a super hero comes-brought into existence. The same is a case here, you will love the kind of the said superhero is previously is and his changed avatar for what only he could be.Tone, Script & Story: The story is set in Hitler's time when a lot of experiments were conducted to demonstrate superiority. A superhuman (captain America) is created to fight evil program Hydra. The movie allured me until the time our superhero came into existence. I am not a great fan of the fight that occurred.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: Justified. Music: Justified.

144,KnightsofNi11,Cheesy but fun,6,20 August 2011,"As everybody knows, Marvel Studios is quickly gearing up for their epic Avengers movie. Every film they release just adds another piece to the great ensemble of characters they are assembling for this film. However, I would have to call Captain America: The First Avenger this most important of all these setup films. It's the epic story of the iconic Captain America, set in World War II. Captain America is the symbol of America, fighting Nazis with his red, white, and blue shield. The film tells his story, starting out as the scrawny and pathetic Steve Rogers who is pumped with a super serum that turns him into a muscular hero, designed to be America's first super soldier. He is then sent overseas to fight the insane Nazi general, Red Skull. The film is a lot of fun with nonstop action and excitement. It has its problems, but I really see it as more of a setup for the Avengers movie than anything else.What sets Captain America apart from other superhero movies is obviously the time period. The film is basically a superhero period piece, and the film captures that really well. The costuming, the settings, the dialogue all stays true to the period, making this a very unique superhero flick. Many moments of the the film do have this sepia overtone almost. The colors seem watered down at moments and then replaced by a very light sepia tone, a look which sort of distracts me. I'm not sure why, but it does, and I'm not a huge fan of it. The whole film has an airbrushed look to it that makes it different and interesting looking, but it's not my cup of tea. I prefer grittier and darker while Captain America is more bright and smoother around the edges.I think I also have a slight issue with the idea of Captain America in general, as a superhero. What I find interesting about other superheroes are their flaws. Iron Man is an egotistical prick who constantly has to balance his ego with his obligation to defend the world. Thor is irresponsible to the point where it gets him kicked out of Asgard. Spider-Man battles his own personal adolescent issues all the time. And let's not even get started on Batman, who is more of an anti-hero when you get right down to it. But Captain America is a virtually flawless character, especially in this movie. He is the idea superhero who is more of an icon than a human being. This is something that does make sense for the time period he is in and what he is supposed to stand for as the comics surely outline. But for me, I don't find it nearly as interesting and it bores me to an extent.But, all things considered, Captain America is a fun film. It's got great action with tons of explosions and gunfights. Lots of Nazis get their asses handed to them by the Captain, something we can all agree is a triumphant event to witness. The film is shot well with some very thrilling camera-work in certain scenes. The film moves very fast and it never stops for anything. The excitement always builds and the action never slows down. It's not difficult to keep up with but you definitely don't want to fall behind because you will be left out of something awesome. The film has plenty of cheese and some eye-roll worthy moments, but in a way it's all part of the fun. This isn't your dark and gritty World War II film like Saving Private Ryan. It's your idealistic and empowering World War II film like any ""Buy War Bonds"" video from the time period. Again, I prefer the grit, but can at least enjoy Captain America for what it is.Overall, I don't know that I will remember Captain America: The First Avenger as a Captain America film or a great setup for the Avengers film. Maybe a little bit of both, but as I think back to it now I think more about the fantastic scene after the credits (and if I just spoiled something for you then you, my friend, are quite naive) than what happened during the movie. But regardless, the film itself is fun and it has some great moments. It's not exactly my cup of tea when it comes to superhero films, but I enjoyed it for what it was and don't regret watching it.",Captain America - The First Avenger
145,ivo-cobra8,My favorite underrated superhero action reboot film!,8,27 December 2015,"Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) is a pretty decent film by its own way. It is one of my favorite superhero comic book films. I love this movie to death. Everyone knows that Captain America: The Winter Soldier is one of my favorite best comic book action film. But this one is close and right behind The Incredible Hulk. I love this movie and it has a great comic book reboot origin story of how Steve Rogers become a superhero Captain America. The first time I have saw this movie, I did not like it, I even made wrote a hateful review about this movie, It took me three times in the row watching this movie till, have I enjoy it and than loved it. But I still think Captain America: The Winter Soldier is far superior movie flick over this and way better, tough that doesn't mean Captain America: The First Avenger is awful, it is not every fan should have known that! This film is miles way better than The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron both of the movies. I choose this movie over Avengers movies! I have Age of Ultron and I hate Avengers because they are running stand up alone movies.In this movie Captain America went on his own mission to save his friend and the rest captured man and he saves them all on the end, without any support. He uses his shield to fight the Germans I really love that. In my opinion it was a great comic book origin adaptation that went back to basic, where it all started it. I LOVE the fact about this movie to the explaining in what the main character Captain America became Captain America, not just a documentary, there is a huge difference! He is actually one of my favorite superheroes. Chris Evans becomes America's ultimate weapon against evil in the fun-filled superhero adventure ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". In the 1940s, headstrong Steve Rogers (Evans) volunteers for a top secret government experiment that transforms him from a scrawny weakling into the Super Soldier known as Captain America. Captain America leads the fight for freedom against the evil HYDRA organization and their leader Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who has discover an otherworldly power that will ensure him world domination.Captain America: The First Avenger is the latest comic book adaptation to hit the big screen, and is certainly a playful action-packed flick. Though not a comic book masterpiece, it does succeed in capturing the spirit of what a comic book movie should be. Director Joe Johnston has created a stylish old-fashioned adventure picture with some solid elements of drama, humor and action. The cast also includes Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci. The Red Skull is a great villain. He has every ounce of the evil that was in Hitler, and he has the advanced weaponry and sacred power that Hitler actually sought out. And not to mention, he's a super soldier like Captain America. He's basically Hitler x5, that's the perfect recipe for a villain. Tough the movie did feel a little too rushed, like it was leading up to the Avengers. It's not the absolute best movie Marvel Studios has put out, but it's definitely up there.This movie has a few plot holes and a few movie mistakes, but which movie doesn't have? I think this movie is pretty good on his own way before the Avengers come out. I am glad there was more explained in The Avengers and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. The character development is great and the action is cool with a compelling story. The film is kind a lacking in action, it has action but is more build on Steve Rogers-Captain America character and Red Skull character. Captain America: The First Avenger is the 2011 feature film adaptation of the Marvel comic book series. Directed by Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer), the film stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, a young man from Brooklyn who during the Second World War, desires to join the US war effort, but is rejected due to his undersized stature. When he volunteers to be part of a secret US program, Rogers then finds himself genetically transformed into the world's first super soldier. The film is also part of ""Phase One"" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that includes Iron Man, Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk, and Thor and culminated in 2012's The Avengers. In addition to the 2012 film, Chris Evans returned as Captain America in the standalone sequels Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Captain America: Civil War, and Hayley Atwell would return as Peggy Carter in both a Marvel One-Shot and a 2015 ABC television series. I am giving this movie an 8, it deserves a fair rating.8/10 Grade: A- Studio: Marvel Studios Starring: Chris Evans, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper, Neal McDonough, Derek Luke, Stanley Tucci Directors: Joe Johnston Producer: Kevin Feige Screenplay: Christopher Markus, Stephen McFeely Based on Captain America by Joe Simon Jack Kirby Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 04 Mins.

146,bankofmarquis,Marvel movie with heart,9,9 February 2015,"My favorite of all the Marvel movies (so far), Captain America is a simple story that relies more heavily on character and relationships than it does special effects and villains. True, it has both of those things, but in the end it is a relationship movie about a loser with a big heart becoming a winner with a big heart.The difference? His heart!Chris Evans is terrific as ""Cap"" as are old veterans Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones and Hugo Weaving. Add into that ""newcomers"" like Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan and Dominic Cooper coupled with a simple plot (by that I mean it is a plot that is not overly complicated) and you have a very entertaining movie.9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Captain America - The First Avenger
147,fernandoschiavi,Johnston manages to deliver a great adventure and be very faithful to the comic book superhero,8,5 October 2016,"The phase 1 of Marvel finally ends after the main heroes of his universe being introduced to the general public. The director Joe Johnston, that suited well to the visual style of the film based on his previous work. Is it action films of pure entertainment as Jumanji (1995) and Jurrasic Park III (2001), works with the script the duo Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, responsible for the big screen adaptation of the first three films based on the works of CS Lewis, The Chronicles of Narnia. As the film released in 1990 has always been considered a huge fiasco in all aspects, the expectation generated for a new version of the hero was huge. But now the scenario was different since the very Marvel Studios decided to take ownership of their characters in order to create large franchises to transpose the pages of comics to film. With the recent successes of the previous company, was without the expectation of the fans of one of the best characters in comics. to finally see a version with proper and serious investment in previous and post production. Production on the film began in June 2010, with filming going until April 2011, on location in the UK, in London, Manchester, Liverpool and Los Angeles.Johnston was never known for his outbursts of creativity and unique style of designing their work, serving more as a studio director, responsible to obey the direction of the executives and producers. In Captain America: The First Avenger, we can notice a steady direction and very well resolved in the narrative and visually. One of the hits, undoubtedly, was its design as a period film. Besides bringing a whole charm of the 40s to the viewer, portraying accurately the time and the conflicts that led to better understand the character of Steven Rogers and palpable context of icon creation Captain America. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely had to have several comics in mind when addressing the character, but were based, as well as the actor Chris Evans to study the character, especially in a comic entitled ""Mythos"", which included the entire transition Steve Rogers becoming Captain America.A perfect recreation of the 40s is that it brings the whole soul to the film and this is due to the work of photography Shelly Johnson - who had previously worked with Joe Johnston in Jurassic Park III (2001) and The Wolfman (2010) - who chose hardly wear bright colors, highlighting the gray tones and faded that climate destruction and war, exploring some internal scenarios darker. There is still the ultimate scenes, which take place today, the total contrast of the color palette used, which are more colorful at a time without war. The transition of the environment assembled by SHIELD to the streets after Fulga illustrates this concern visual Shelly Johnson.The visuals have a great challenge ahead, with some great action taken. In total, more than 1600 effects shots, made by 13 different companies. We highlight the chase sequence of Steve Rogers (still no uniform of Captain America) the spy who killed Dr. Erskine streets, where we first see the powers of the new super soldier, ultra running so fast, jumping between cars, holding a submarine during the escape. Another scene is the redemption made by Captain America in the fortress of Hydra, Schmidt organization, freeing Barnes and the other captured soldiers, and having the first meeting face to face with the Red Skull. All fights in the last stronghold of HYDRA that Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt bombard various American cities, and all the final showdown in the plane of the Red Skull. On the other hand, there are scenes in which the use of CGI is not sharp and delivers a satisfactory result as, for example, the sequence of the invasion of the train and capture Zola, wherein Barnes has a tragic destination.Captain America was certainly not easy to be a hero for bringing brought with it a patriotic symbolism very touched, and there is a strong anti-American sentiment worldwide. This patriotism is nonetheless shown several times, but Joe Johnston learned to deal with it and left everything in the right measure. The director knew the show parodying the side used by bureaucrats to sell so-called war credits that financed the expenditure with the American conflict. His figure so far pleased the audience common American, but when this travesty comes forward to the soldiers, it is ridiculed. On another occasion, was recreated the first cover of Captain America, which brought the hero punching Hitler in the face.Johnston manages to deliver a great adventure and be very faithful to the comic book superhero, counting without hurry and with due attention all origin of Captain from the various attempts at enlistment and denials due to health boy, received a chance by Dr. Erskine, the phase of training in the army, the transformation into a super soldier, using the image of Captain America in his colorful costume as a means to inspire and bring confidence to the Americans during the War, and the activeness of the hero in the fields and battle. The romance between Rogers and Peggy is presented subtly and well developed. Johnston missed devote more to scenes of war, leaving the film more dramatic and more memorable scenes, even though the tone of optimism and hope were to prevail. For those who did not know the character, is an excellent introduction to the whole context in which the Captain is inserted, in addition to showing the connections to other films in the first phase of Marvel. It's all very well concatenated and an entertainment must. And, as usual, we should not leave the theater before the credits ended. There's a teaser trailer for ""The Avengers"" next participation Captain America on screen, this time together with the other Marvel heroes.",Captain America - The First Avenger

150,itamarscomix,Better than expected,7,2 October 2012,"It's kinda hard, when watching Captain America, to forget that it's intended mostly as a prelude to the far superior The Avengers; Captain America exists mostly to introduce the character and do away with his origin story. The sub-header ""The First Avenger"" certainly doesn't help to relieve the feeling that this film just wasn't meant to stand in its own right.But surprisingly enough, director Joe Johnston managed to turn a sparse script about an anachronistic and old-fashioned character into a well-paced, even entertaining film. It's not as entertaining or as energetic as The Avengers or the Iron Man movies; Captain America's style is in accordance with its World War II setting. Johnston embraces the anachronistic idealism and patriotism of the character, but never to the point that it feels camp. The film feels like it takes place in the 40's, but it doesn't feel like a pastiche or a period piece, which would have made the transition into The Avengers jarring and painful. It feels like it's part of the Marvel universe, but it also has its own unique feel (something which Thor and The Incredible Hulk, sadly, cannot say).It's still not quite a stand-alone film - not like Iron Man. It shows more than any other Marvel film so far the flaws in creating this elaborate shared universe of characters. It's especially clear in the under-utilization of the villain character, the Red Skull, who promises to be an interesting and mysterious character but gets far too little screen-time, which is all spent on the good Captain's origin story. That story leaves very little room for the film to have any of its own plot. But it has its own atmosphere, it has heart and a sense of humor and an anachronistic, idealistic but very likable hero.",Captain America - The First Avenger
151,mitsubishizero,Awesome!,9,26 May 2019,"A little fun fact: Captain America's not the first avenger it's actually Iron Man, Wasp, Thor, Hulk. With that being this's a great movie. Chris Evans plays Steve Rogers. A man determined to serve his country despite being below military standards. Initially rejected by the army he gets accepted and volunteers to become a super soldier.With great power comes great responsibility as he must use it to protect the world from the megalomaniac Red Skull(Hugo Weaving). Helping him is British agent Peggy Carter(Hayley Atwell) whom he falls in love with. The effects in this movie are awesome. It's amazing how they had to edit Evan's to make him look thinner prior to his transformation.As for Red Skull the makeup looks real. The story's been done before but with an obvious twist to it: Superpowers. The characters are well-developed and interesting. Rogers is your typical good guy with an inferiority complex, Peggy's a sarcastic quick on her feet agent and Tommy Lee Jones as the deadpan General is funny to watch.There's not much else to say other than this's really a great movie.

152,swilliky,A decent start to a character in the MCU!,7,4 May 2016,"In anticipation of the third installment, I've re-watched the previous to Captain America films. The First Avenger gives the origin story of Steve Rogers. The special effects of Chris Evans as a skinny kid trying to get into the army still look a little odd but I gave this film enough suspension of disbelief to go with the flow. The introduction of Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes was subtle and I did not know the comic book storyline at the time so I did not comprehend his significance in later installments.The first movie gets off to slow start as a lot of back story has to be filled in including Stanley Tucci's character Dr. Erskine, the inventor of the serum that makes Captain America strong, finding Steve and recruiting him to boot camp. Hayley Atwell and Tommy Lee Jones are Agent Carter and Colonel Phillips respectively who are skeptical at first but convert over when they see his strength.

155,witster18,Got a little Captain in You? SEE THIS MOVIE!,8,25 October 2011,"I started writing this review four or five times. I was comparing this movie to The Dark Knight, Batman Begins, and Spiderman. In the end, I realized that one of the few things that Captain America has in common with those movies - is that Captain America is a very good comic based feature film.It doesn't have the 'look' of the Dark Knight, or the powerhouse performance of Heath Ledger(although Hugo is good), but Captain America has a truckload-full of comic heritage/homage(and style). The action is furious, and the hand-on-hand combat scenes are jaw-droppingly well-done.The story is totally unbelievable, totally ridiculous, and yet so totally comic-book; exactly what it was supposed to be. But, what really sets this movie apart is the quality and care that went into the feature from top to bottom.The film isn't as predictable or simplistic as many others in the genre.Marvel has really polished this 40's hero into something that will appeal to anyone who is going into the theater/movie to be entertained. The film has everything to offer: Action, Comedy, thoughtful computer imaging, well-developed characters, a deep storyline, and complete and total awareness of what a comic-book audience might want out of a movie.If you don't want to see a story that centers around a dangerous, independent faction of the Gustapo garnering power from unearthly sources, only for the U.S. to harness the same power to create the American fighting machine, only to get revenge, in what still amounts to an American WW2 propaganda campaign enactment - then don't see this movie. That war is over anyway. And if all that nonsense isn't enough for you - then don't worry - there's a lot more, fun 'nonsense' that I left out.BUT, if you just wanna sit down and put a huge smile on your face for the fastest two hours of this movie-season, then jump aboard this new franchise while it's fresh and hot.In recent decades we have had many Batman films, many Spiderman films, many Superman films, many hulk films, and 2 Ironman films. When I heard about the development of this project - I was giddy. Months later when the film was released, and after I saw the average trailers, I missed the film at theaters. Thankfully, the wait for the DVD release wouldn't be long.I went in with moderate expectations. I was aware that the score hovered around 7.0 here on IMDb.Like many other kids, I grew up liking Captain America. The normal guy dressed in red, white, and blue, yielding a shield that resembled the American flag, riding motorcycles... what's not to like. He was always the coolest of the Marvel characters, and it's fitting that we get to enjoy such a cool and thorough adaptation.This movie brought all those likable character traits to life and made me proud to be a fan. The retro look added realism to an unrealistic story. This film looks like it might have been made in the 80's, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.The films subject matter and storyline demands open-mindedness from its audience, but isn't that exactly what we should expect from a comic book film? If you can't put aside those expectations of realism - then you shouldn't see a comic book based film in the first place. Spend your hard earned money on this if you haven't yet, and get blown away from this years best pure-action film.Great little surprise! 84/100 You'll like this if you liked:Batman('89), Ironman, Superman('78), Superman 2('80),Rocketeer, and The Punisher('04).Somehow, with all it's action and storytelling, Captain America also successfully and seamlessly serves as the major platform for the upcoming Avengers project.P.S. I liked Thor, but I LOVED this.Thanks for reading, and I sincerely hope you enjoy the movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger
156,manitobaman81,Good,7,19 August 2014,"It's ""Die Hard"" for the comic book crowd. Captain America has a shield the size of a large pizza but kicks some major buttocks. I love the fisticuffs back and forth. The story is well told and gives you a good idea of how a boy named Steve becomes the hero. The characters in this film have a lot of depth and the realism with which they are portrayed by the actors is surprising at times. As is often the came with comic book movies, from an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Steve Rodgers was a great underdog that represented the pride of the US. I liked that he was used as a propaganda model. Chris Evans was good on the action scenes.My problems with the movie was the straightforward villain, Red Skull, who was just a typical evil dude.

When you look back at the phase one films, this is quite unique and delivers on the campy beats of the era. Hollywood has been attempting pulp heroes, but this is one of the best because it embraces the character. The ending in particular is moving because the storyline and characters delivered. It won't be to everyone's taste, but if you enjoyed the comics and novels of the era, you'll enjoy what Marvel delivered. Underappreciated film.",Captain America - The First Avenger
159,JohnRayPeterson,Slick special effects and a cast worth the trip to the theatre,6,30 October 2011,"What has generations far apart come together? Comic books and screen versions of them, that's what; okay sometimes there's music and other stuff but I digress. Nobody will find much argument in that 'comics' are harmless fun, except of course psychologists with a theory to the contrary; all those recent theories have proved over time to be hogwash, crap for the layman. Marvel and DC productions, for the most part do well at the box office, provide big names actors with a nice income for little effort, help less notable actors gain more traction and fill our existence with a little vicarious outlet for society's woes. I'm addicted to sugar, salt, caffeine, carnal fantasies (beware of those who claim not to be), music and intellectual enlightenment and for some weird reason, ludicrous super heroes; in other words as a well rounded human I now and then need my fix of the likes of Captain America.In the early part of this movie, the character of Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America, played by Chris Evan, is a puny young man, totally unfit physically to join the army; the face of that character at this point is clearly that of Chris Evans but the body is quite obviously not. That bit of special effect blew me away by its flawless, and I do mean flawless, imagery. If the production could be that imaginative and technically innovative, I would have to see the rest of the movie. Hugo Weaving, one of my favourite bad guys was as good in his role as Johann Schmidt as he is in all his more serious endeavours. These are the only two reasons I liked the movie. Adding anything more would simply be 'bs'.",Captain America - The First Avenger
160,tomimt,A bland part of MCU,5,14 June 2015,"Captain America was a movie I tried to like and that is always a bad sign. I didn't try to like it because I'm a Marvel fan, I tried to like it because among the relatively similar mass of Marvel movies it looked like it could be something different, being set during the WW2 and all. But in the end Captain America is just another movie in the cookie cutter style every other Marvel movie is. It has action, it has humor, it has heroes and it has villains. And in this formula it's also bland and unexciting despite all the big action scenes it has going on for it.Those big action scenes might actually be a big part on why the movies does feel bland, at it really doesn't give out the feeling that there's something at stake during it. Sure, there's Red Skull trying to gain the godly powers, but it never really feels very menacing, as the plot itself feels very thin. Instead of more action, the movie could have used more character development, as now people, AKA the good guys, we should be rooting for to stay alive, don't feel that important, nor do the plans of the evil villain either.I guess if you're a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain America will work for you. But if you're not you might come into the same conclusion, that the movie is missing something integral.",Captain America - The First Avenger

162,Darkside-Reviewer,A worthy origin story of a classic hero,7,18 May 2020,"The fifth movie released in Marvels MCU and the first appearance of Captain America played by (Chris Evans) though this isn't the first big screen adaptation of the red, white and blue hero this is hands down the best which isn't surprising seeing as the last time Marvel tried to do a Captain America movie was in 1990 and not only did it fail to capture the awsome comics but it made comic book fans in the 90s look like they read kids comics which simply isn't the case as many people now know after getting into the comics after the massive success and popularity of Marvel and the MCU as a whole in the past ten years.Captain America switched things up a bit with it's storyline instead of introducing Captain America in the modern day the movie takes place in the 1940s during World War II and tells the story of a young, short, skinny guy with asthma from Brooklyn named Steve Rogers who is determined to serve his country become the strong and courageous Captain America by becoming the world's first super soldier with a pure heart and kind spirit in a story that sees him fight Nazi soldiers and take on the evil Red Skull (Hugo Weving) the leader of Hydra a secret evil cult set on world domination and their new weapons of destruction only the shield wielding hero in the red, white and blue can save the day.This movie also introduces us to Agent Carter (Haley Atwell) who is Steve Rogers love interest in the movie who would later get her own TV series Agent Carter where her character gets much more back story and kicks ass like she should she is also one of the founding members of Shield along with Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) who is also in the movie as basically the MCU version of Q from the 007 movies. Captain America also gives us the first appearance of Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who plays the character very well the makeup effects and black leather outfit actually make Red Skull look kinda scary and intimidating sadly the only other appearance of this character in the MCU to date is in Avengers Infinity War which was seven years after this movie and was only in the movie for a few minutes.This is probably one of the best hero origin story's in a comic book movie because the movie shows us Captain America as just plain old Steve Roger's to start with before he got his powers and we get to see the kind of man he is before he gets his powers and honestly it really makes Captain America feel more relatable as a character because we see ourselves in this regular guy who wants to do good in the world and fight back against the bullies of the world again and again and then when he does get his powers we see him stay true to himself the power doesn't change or corrupt him it instead gives him the means to do what he always wanted to do make a difference in the world and stand up to the bullies of the world no matter what form they take and that's something this movie got right about the comics Captain America was always a symbol of strength and courage to people who read the comics as children and gave us a hero to look up to the very first avenger.The special effects are again top quality which isn't surprising after Marvel started to get a much higher budget after every movie before this one in the MCU were such big hits and made a ton of money at the box office.I highly recommend watching Captain America The First Avenger if your a fan of the comics and the MCU as a whole even if you're not interested in watching every movie in the MCU I would still recommend watching this one as it stands out on it's own and is the best movie interpretation of Captain America out there.",Captain America - The First Avenger

164,anselmdaniel,Fun but somewhat messy origin story,6,10 July 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Captain America: The First Avenger is a superhero action movie that premiered in 2011. The movie is directed by Joe Johnston, with the screenplay written by Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely. The movie stars Chris Evans, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, and Hayley Atwell. The movie follows Steve Rogers as he attempts to enlist in the United States military during World War Two.Captain America: The First Avenger is a solid origin story for Captain America. All of the pieces of an origin story are here in this movie. The movie has visuals, action, character, and solid casting. The movie also has a memorable villain in Red Skull played by Hugo Weaving. There are some deficiencies in the movie that detract from the experience.The story in this movie has weird beats. The movie focuses on Steve Rogers but it had to inject the Nazi organization of Hydra. Hydra is the classic villainous organization that the heroes always find themselves fighting against. The movie spends much of the story building up Steve Rogers for the confrontation against Hydra to be over quickly. The rogue organization of Hydra does not have as much characterization for an organization that is so strong in the 1940s. It felt quick that as soon as Steve Rogers entered the scene to fight against Hydra the main headquarters and bases are destroyed.Captain America: The First Avenger, like its previously released movie in the cinematic universe Iron Man 2, builds up the cinematic universe of Marvel. In this way, I felt that the movie had much on its menu to handle. It needed to create Hydra, Captain America, and also the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I would have preferred that the movie handle only Hydra and Captain America in this movie and choose to have the world-building to be more in the background. The movie instead focuses on the Tesseract which is the important link across these early Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.I would recommend ""Captain America: The First Avenger"".Grade: C.",Captain America - The First Avenger
165,DonFishies,A wildly entertaining summer adventure,8,31 July 2011,"Despite going in with incredibly low expectations, I was horrendously disappointed by Thor. It was everything I hoped it would not be, and made me worry about Captain America: The First Avenger. Even with my excitement over that film, Thor's romp through the desert made me incredibly apprehensive to think Cap's adventure would be worthwhile.After a short modern day intro, we are thrust into wartime in 1940s New York. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to fight for his country -- but has been turned away five times for health ailments and his size. Shortly after another attempt, Rogers is intercepted and quickly chosen for a Super Soldier project the US is quietly developing. He is turned into Captain America, the soldier that will help turn the tides and end the war. But while he is selling war bonds, the German science division HYDRA run by Johann Schmidt, better known as the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), is gaining more power behind enemy lines. And obviously, Rogers cannot just let that slide. I will immediately say that Thor does not deserve to breathe the same air as Captain America: The First Avenger. Minutes into the film, you know immediately where Marvel was focusing its attention all along and why Thor felt so undercooked. This film is without a doubt, the best superhero film since the one-two punch of Iron Man and The Dark Knight in 2008. Anyone weary of it being a period piece should rest at ease, as this is one of the most unique entries into the genre to date. The time period only helps bring the characters to life even more vividly than they already are depicted on-screen. But the reason the origin story works so well is because it is so wildly different than everything that has come before it. Captain America is a movie that feels right at home in the 1940s and transcends itself into the time period. From Rogers' introduction on, Joe Johnston frames the film with a sense of wonder, imagination and authenticity. Much like Inglourious Basterds before it, this is a reconstructed history. But it is done so convincingly that you may second guess yourself, trying to picture whether this very real world is actually what really happened. Johnston also layers the film with an aura of fascination and bewilderment, frequently leaving the audience in the same disbelief as the characters. When Rogers is discovering his new abilities for the first time, we feel the exact same way. But instead of embracing this astonishing feeling and letting the film breathe life into a genre that is on its last legs, it fumbles and takes us away from it all too quickly. While the first half plays out beautifully, developing the world and its characters, the second half amps up the gas and zips by without a thought for explanation or near sighted investigation. It felt like the filmmakers realized they took too long developing everything, and decided to just rush through the rest without stopping to think whether the audience would notice or not. But once you notice all of the montages, and how there is zero explanation on who the 'Howling Commandoes' are, you know Marvel may have missed out on a few crucial steps along the way of story development.For the most part, Captain America: The First Avenger is a deeply focused and ridiculously invested story of the origins of an extraordinary soldier who just wants to do his part for his country. Yes, Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) is an important character in the film, but he is the only real tie to the rest of the Marvel film canon. But as the film draws to a close, the tacked on ending starts, and suddenly, Marvel's investment in Cap suddenly turns into just another agenda pushing entry for The Avengers. It is sad and disappointing, but after four films, I should have assumed they would not have suddenly changed tactics.After playing such a great Johnny Storm, I was worried that Evans would not have the chops, charisma or gravitas needed to play Captain America. Was I ever wrong. He is absolutely flawless in the role, quickly shifting from scrawny weakling to beefy hero with ease. He remains throughout as a boy from Queens, and the look of wonder and awe in his eyes never dissipates. No matter what he is doing, Evans maintains the character, and never even considers becoming anything other than a loyal boy scout. He is a true hero through and through, and watching him in action makes me wonder why it took this long for a good Captain America film to be released.While his accent is imperfect, Weaving is exquisitely evil as the Red Skull. He is downright disturbing in some instances, and deliciously over-the-top in others. I cannot imagine anyone being as brooding and insanely evil as he is here. Cooper, Sebastian Stan, Toby Jones and Tommy Lee Jones all give excellent performances in their roles. Relative newcomer Hayley Atwell also shines in her role as the hardnosed Peggy Carter. Her subtle romance and chemistry with Evans is magnificent, as are her ability to effortlessly create a strong female lead. Special mention also must go to Stanley Tucci, whose Dr. Abraham Erskine is a welcome departure from his atypical roles as of late.While it botches any attempts at perfection (and really did not need to be post converted to 3D), Captain America: The First Avenger still manages to be a wildly entertaining adventure that is even more impressive than you may imagine. Evans is amazing in the role, and the whole film is ridiculously pulpy fun. And I dare you to not feel a warm feeling of nostalgia while humming along to the deliriously catchy ""Star Spangled Man"" propaganda jingle. It makes the film worthwhile all on its own.8/10.(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",Captain America - The First Avenger
166,timdalton007,Cap Takes To The Screen,8,5 June 2015,"On the surface, perhaps no member of The Avengers would seem more difficult to bring to a modern audience than Steve Rogers aka Captain America. Seen as perhaps something of an artifact of a time gone by, here was a character whose jump to the big screen had long been stuck in development hell. Despite a somewhat ironic title (the irony being that this would be the last of the origin films released before The Avengers), 2011 saw Cap make the leap successfully in Captain America: The First Avenger, bringing with him an interesting new angle in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.A large part of the success of the film might well be down to the choice of leading man. Chris Evans was an initially controversial choice to play the role, due in large part to his already having played another notable Marvel hero in the two Fantastic Four films some years previously. Yet like Daniel Craig's James Bond, once given the chance to see him in action the criticisms were largely silenced. Evans managed to successfully play not just the almost superhuman commando we've come to know and love but also the man Steve Rogers was before that: a puny, young guy from Brooklyn who seemed to embody the old saying about nice guys finishing last. Evans keeps that good guy aspect of the character in sight throughout the film from his interactions with his fellow characters to his reactions to events. Evans managed to take a potentially clichéd superhero from another time and make him into a genuinely likable character.For that matter, the film all around has a strong cast. Hugo Weaving makes a fine nemesis in the form of Hydra leader Johann Schmidt, bringing a suitably sinister air to the character right from his very first scene in the film to the dramatic moment about midway through when he reveals the Red Skull persona (itself a triumph of prosthetic makeup). Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes is notable as well both for his chemistry with Evans' Rogers which makes their friendship believable even when their roles are reversed but for also firmly establishing an idea of the character in the mind of the audience (something even more important in light of where the character would eventually be developed in the future). Filling in more traditional roles with memorable performances are Toby Jones as Hydra scientist Arnim Zola, Tommy Lee Jones as the initially skeptical commander of the Strategic Scientific Reserve and Stanley Tucci as ex-pat German scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine who recruits Rogers.Though the film's setting during the Second World War means that female characters are fairly few, the character from the film besides Rogers that perhaps stands out the most is Haley Atwell's Peggy Carter. While she does, as she did in the comics, become something of a love interest for Rogers, thankfully there's far more to the character than that. Atwell in interviews described the character as ""She can do everything Captain America can do, but backwards and in high heels,"" and the action sequences in which Carter appears certainly rather prove that point. As a result, it's something that makes her now having her own TV series not the least bit surprising.The film's production values are strong, especially given its Second World War setting. Through its combination of script, production design and costuming, the film successfully blends the technology and weapons of that conflict with aspects of the previously established Marvel universe (both comic and cinematic, the latter perhaps being more as a result of Joss Whedon's uncredited work on the script). In fact some of the seemingly more outlandish designs form the film such as the rocket like craft Schmidt uses at one point or the large flying wing plane where the film's climactic confrontation takes place are in fact based on real life plans drawn up by the Germans during the war (the Triebflügeljäger fighter plane and the Horten H.XVIII respectively). Director Joe Johnston, whose previous films include period set works such as the cult film The Rocketeer and October Sky, was a perfect choice to direct the film which combines period setting and characters with action sequences (indeed The Rocketeer arguably bares some similarities to the film itself). The icing on the cake might well be the score from Alan Silvestri which manages to be exciting and yet timeless at the same time. The results make the film as strong as it is.Despite the film really being done to establish the Captain's origin story, The First Avenger is book-ended by two very important scenes in the present day. The first of which reveal the discovery of a mysterious object between Arctic ice (revealed late in the film to the Hydra flying wing) that sets up the journey the viewer is about to go on while the latter presents us with a sequence where Rogers finds himself in the present day which, as well as giving us the seemingly pre-requisite appearance by Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury, also firmly establishes that other iconic aspect of the character: that he is a man out of time. With that complete, the stage was set for The Avengers and the rest, as they say, was history.First Avenger on its own though holds up quite well. Of the phase one Marvel films it's one of the most successful in bringing its characters back-story to life while also presenting a genuinely enjoyable film in the process. The result is a strong, period based action film and one of the best Marvel films to date.",Captain America - The First Avenger
167,gigan-92,"""There are always more workers.""",6,4 January 2012,"C + Oh boy, Captain America. No, not Peter Fonda from Dennis Hopper's ""Easy Rider"" but the patriotic mascot of Marvel. Yes, in the wake of the big super hero project ""The Avengers"" there's been a lot of hype concerning Marvel in general, not to mention an upsurge in the sales of toys, lunchboxes and pencil pouches. ""Iron Man"", even its sub-par sequel, is a pretty all-right movie, while Thor was just a god-awful mess of a movie. Its jokes were redundant, its action lacking and story pathetically cliché. ""Captain America"" reaches a middle ground. It is nowhere near as disappointing as Chris Hemsworth, but not quite up to par with ""Iron Man"".One big detraction is the on-screen combat of the titular hero and villain. Hugo Weaving is a great Redskull, very spot on, but he doesn't get to do too much. The final physical battle is a decent one, but that's all it is, decent. I enjoy the build-up to our hero's genesis, but its middle is annoying. We are shown an overly-long war bond selling montage, then we go more into his actual enlistment as a soldier, and then we break into a motorcycle flying out of an exploding warehouse. We see an action montage of various battles and I assume Hydra's various factories being blown up. Much of the cast was enjoyable and the majority of the movie prevails to be nowhere near as corny as the Norse thunder god-Natalie Portman love story.It's over all a decent hero flick, but nowhere near a highlight of the genre.",Captain America - The First Avenger
168,griffolyon12,Sometimes you've gotta love America!,9,22 July 2011,"As just a kid from Brooklyn, Captain America makes a name for himself in this extremely entertaining and engaging superhero flick. Like Superman, Captain America is Marvel Comics answer to the Red, White, and Blue, and while this movie could have been a simple set up to Marvel's The Avengers, it manages to be its own movie. Part of this is because it takes place first in the timeline of all of the Marvel Studios' movies, so there are fewer references to the other heroes who come later down the line, but this movie also focuses on showing the transformation of Steve Rogers, from scrawny kid getting beat up in the alleys of Brooklyn, to the symbol of hope for America in World War II.The movie is almost entirely set in the 1940s, featuring the Greatest Generation in all of its glory, with this movie somewhat playing as a love letter to that simpler time where evil was evil, and good was good. When a small fry guy named Steve Rogers gets rejected five different times to be enlisted in the Army, he gets a lucky shot from a military scientist, Dr. Erskine, who tests an experimental super soldier formula on Rogers, and voila! We now have a superhero. But it takes more than muscles to be a true hero, and even though Rogers managed to impress Erskine with his compassion, fortitude, and morals, he must do the same for the big guns at the military if he wants to see actual action aside from being a part of song and dance numbers and movie serials to sell war bonds.Director Joe Johnston plays around with the 1940s setting, with the whole movie filmed in sepia tones evoking the look of the pop culture from the period. The story plays like one long Saturday matinée serial, filled with tons of pulp and improbable science fiction, but those were stalwarts of the adventure stories of the time. What Johnston does best though, is mastering Rogers' journey from zero to hero. As Captain America, Steve Rogers uses his compassion, fortitude, and morals, to do near impossible missions, as is seen in a scene where Rogers saves over 400 prisoners of war all on his own, proving to the Army that he should be on the front line of the war effort and not helping with morale back home. Throughout the whole movie, Rogers bonds with an American agent named Peggy Carter, winning her heart through the same inner heroism that made him Captain America. Carter is a pin up girl in looks, but a girl who can show up the boys in attitude. Add on to this all, a great maniacal villain in Red Skull (played by Hugo Weaving in some of the greatest make up work in a while), and you have a solid adventure yarn.While the final scene left me scratching my head a bit, feeling tacked on, and the scene before giving the real closure to the story, I think Marvel was trying to pump up The Avengers even more, so I get it, though it still deterred from an otherwise emotional ending. Even with this small bump in the road, it's really the only blemish in this extremely well made and polished superhero flick that doesn't reinvent the wheel, but neither breaks it. Solid, entertaining, and heroic, everything a good superhero movie should be, which is exactly what this movie is.I give Captain America: The First Avenger a 9 out of 10!",Captain America - The First Avenger

It's probably the MCU's most underrated movie.The cinematography and production design are a lot better than I remembered. The shot of the Hydra aircraft sinking in the ice is gorgeous, and I really don't know how I never noticed it before.From the moving scenes between Steve and Dr. Erskein, to its loving lampooning of the character's origin as a pulpy piece of propaganda (that song rules by the way), the movie's just a blast to watch and it makes me smile every time.It's very wholesome for a film that has the goriest death in the whole franchise.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Everything was fine from the very start. The story was very interesting. What made this movie stand-out was Captain America's greatest enemy - Red Skull! he was terrific as the villain, and made this movie very watchable. Red Skull looks very frightening, and we're not even sure what exactly happened to him later in the movie. He's one of the most recognizable foes in Marvel. Captain America was also brilliant. He's a true fighter or warrior shall we speak. I liked the ending though where he awakes from his slumber, and finds out where he's at. This movie is like a gateway into ""The First Avenger"" movie the following year. It makes sense I guess.",Captain America - The First Avenger
171,Rickting,This superhero movie isn't a marvel but it offers retro fun,7,20 September 2011,"In this superhero movie, Steve Rogers after being deemed unfit for military service is part of an experiment which turns him into a super soldier. Think your average superhero movie set in World War II, which certainly makes it more interesting than some of the others but it fails to stand out among some of the other MCU movies. This competent but routine action movie delivers punch after punch of glorious retro action without ever delivering a knockout blow, and like with many comic book films: Once upon a time someone decided that every superhero film should have a cartoony villain and a forced love story and this film really suffers from that. Hugo Weaving's villain is bland, while the love story feels forced and one dimensional.The script goes the motions, but the cast do give strong performances overall, even Chris Evans who was a surprise after the ill judged Fantastic Four movies. This movie can feel like it was written with a superhero checklist open at times, but the action is thrilling, the ending is thought provoking and there is humanity amidst the explosions. Certainly overshadowed by its masterful sequel, but this is still a good movie which used 3D well for once and puts an interesting twist on the Marvel formula although it doesn't reinvent it.7/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
172,dilipbts,Captain America the first avenger,9,7 June 2020,"Marvel Entertainment has everything to make it's films survive the standards of conceptual film-making and also knows that secret recipe to make those superhero films fun to everyone. Captain America the first avenger is yet another film which will not change your mindset and also have something unique both in the sense of big on screen action and plenty of WOW moments. So does the World War 2 setting adds to the uniqueness, definitely yes!! The story is just not set during WW2, it reconnects those times with the modern era.The theme of the film is simple and interesting enough to make you stick to your seat. It's storyline is simple yet classic and does exactly what was asked to do in establishing it's lead character as an iconic superhero. The film features Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) a mere 98 pound skinny weakling with strong feeling to serve his country during the dark times against Nazi Germany. Yet another thing that America needs more strong and super soldiers cause Germany already have one, Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). Despite of his weak and skinny body his spirit is not enough to overcome his body limitations, so he catches a scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) who's been working on creating a genetic breed of super soldiers.

Hugo Weaving is also good as the Red Skull. The female lead for once doesn't get in the way like the annoying Pepper Potts or all of the Batman female love interests. Howard Stark is also an interesting character, almost like Tony (maybe too much). That's the good, now the bad. The action is sometimes well over the top and the fight scenes often go way too long.

Not the movie ""Captain America"" itself – that left me rather unimpressed, indifferent, despite being a comic book fan – but the thought: $X millions spent on a film, $XX millions made and XXX bad reviews later, there'll be XXXX sequels! Many reviewers have pointed out the merits of this film – sure, there are merits, if you don't have the highest of expectations, but why bother pointing them out? It's like pointing out that the last ""McDonalds""  you ate was delicious; instead of saying that it tasted just as average as any other McD's burger you've ever eaten.Instead of saying, ""Chris Evans made a great Captain America"", we could just say, ""He wasn't as corny as the Human Torch"".

The wonders of modern technology (I assume the character was voiced by someone called Hayley Atwell)? Sorry, Mr. Lee, there'll be no more bucks coming from this sucker  oh well, not entirely true: I'll stick to the grab-bags at the local comic-store.

180,Al_The_Strange,"""A weak man knows the value of strength.""",8,8 August 2011,"With the imminent ""Avengers"" movie coming next year, only one hero's origin story remains untolduntil now. Falling in line with ""Thor,"" ""Iron Man,"" and ""The Incredible Hulk,"" ""Captain America"" showcases the rise of Steve Rogers as the title character. Unlike the other films, which take place in modern times, this one goes way back to WWII, showing the Captain kicking Nazi butt! With a lot of ""Wolfenstein"" style occult mystique and a slight ""Indiana Jones"" sense of adventure, this movie has a number of solid action sequences, and plenty of imaginative special effects and setpieces. With its references to various characters and concepts of other Mavel movies, it fits into the franchise really well. It might take some stretch of the imagination to believe that Nazis could be this futuristic, but for a superhero movie, it's all good fun.The story in this case is pretty solid. The main character shows strong development, and for most of the movie, you really root for him. There's nothing more thrilling than watching the underdog getting the upper hand. As it goes on, much of the character drama and story development gets pushed aside by the action, but it still works. By the end, voila, we have the lead-in for the ""Avengers"" film.If there's any complaint for this film, it's that there could have been more. Whether it needs a stronger action setpiece or a more invoking sense of drama, I'm not sure, but something seems missing, and nothing really makes this film stand over any of the other superhero films that have come out so far.The film is competently made, with decent (but never exceptional) photography. Editing is good for the most part, but I am not a fan of the montage in the middle of the film that makes the entire war campaign whiz by. A couple of action scenes seemed a little sloppily-edited, but it's hardly noticeable. Acting is swell; Chris Evans is surprisingly strong as the main character, and I enjoyed Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hugo Weaving in their roles. Writing seems pretty good. Production value is high, featuring lots of good (if not overly-slick) sets, props, costumes and special effects. Music is appropriately upbeat and adventurous. In the end, I'd say the film met my expectations, but never fully exceeded them. But it, along with an all-too-short sneak preview after the credits, provide the necessary bridge to the ""Avengers"" film.Recommended.4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)",Captain America - The First Avenger

I figured THE FIRST AVENGER was going to be really bland, a weak story hidden behind spectacular visuals and costumery and set design. But it turned out to be wonderful. Perhaps it's because I love Stanley Tucci and Tommy Lee Jones so much. A movie is made a million times better with them involved. Set during WWII, CAPTAIN America, is rife with patriotism and American pride and idealism. One young man, undersized Steve Rogers (Evans) feels cheated out of being able to serve his country because of his fragile appearance and multiple health issues. After attempting several times to be selected, he is approached by Dr. Erskine (Tucci) who is working with the army to build supersoldiers with a special serum. That's all. Watch the movie if you haven't yet. I enjoy it because it has a strong story, good pace, and memorable characters who are fleshed out. I didn't like THE GREEN LANTERN or THE HULK.

187,kdnor2011,Surprised by how much I liked it.,8,26 January 2012,"It seems Marvel saved the best for last, at least in my opinion. Captain America is my personal favorite of the five pre-Avengers movies. And I think the main reason for that is that I actually really liked the plot of this movie. The other four film's plots were fine, but this one really interested me. Maybe I just love people beating the crap out of Nazi's? Also, I really liked the characters, especially Steve Rogers. He seems kind of like me. Unlike Thor and Tony Stark, this guy isn't a douchbag half the time. He's very likable and you really root for him. And his love interest is good as well, she's a tough female lead in a the time of World War II. But my favorite was Phillips, he was just so stereotypical war colonel that it was funny. And the film has a very good sense of humor without going over the top with it. The villain was cool, and Hugo Weaving was perfect. The acting, special effects, action scenes, and production value, all done well, it looked like the 40s. And I like the way it tied into Thor and Iron Man.So what didn't I like, well near the middle we have that misunderstanding between Rogers and Carter, that's cliché enough, but then it's like they just forget about it as soon as it starts. Also there are some parts where it slows down, and I mean really slows down to where I just turned away and browsed the internet. And a lot of Captain America's team is forgettable, I thought that was his brother, but Wikipedia said it was his friend? So yeah, if you disagree that's fine, but this is my personal favorite of the pre-Avengers movies. And I'm very happy that Captain America is supposed to be the main focus of the Avengers. Or was that just a rumor?",Captain America - The First Avenger
188,cat_ranchero,Good but not great...,7,28 April 2012,"As with all of these films the effects are first rate, I particularly like the way the character of Steve was made to look really weak and scrawny in the early scenes. All the performances were pretty good; Chris Evans did a decent job as Captain America/Steve Rogers, as did Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter. I really enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Chester Phillips, Stanley Tucci as Dr. Abraham Erskine and Toby Jones as Dr. Arnim Zola. I'm afraid I was a little disappointed by Hugo Weaving as Johann Schmidt/Red Skull, but I think that had more to do with the character than his performance. Also worthy of note were; Sebastian Stan as James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barnes, Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark (doing a great impression of Howard Hughes by the way), Richard Armitage as Heinz Kruger and last but not least, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.Although I did enjoy this film up to a point, I did find the focus on America a little off-putting. Yes I know they did try to make it look a little international by drawing in a team made up from other nations that were also involved in WWII, but that didn't quite cut it for me. The bad guy didn't work either I'm afraid; he didn't offer enough threat and so turned out to be a bit of a damp squib.

189,Otoboke,Not everyone can do a Batman.,5,31 July 2011,"Watching Captain America, it's hard to believe that both the Cap and his fellow crime-fighting hero from a different universe, Batman were produced from the same era. Yet looking back, both share the same kooky, somewhat terribly written, pseudo-patriotic propaganda comic appeal that, at least for comic books' key demographic back in the day—kids—was enough to secure a healthy pay-check at the end of the month. Some sixty or seventy odd years on however, and the political landscape, and the landscape of entertainment itself, has shifted dramatically. So much so that even Batman—the same guy that starred in that super goofy TV series back in the day—has adapted himself into something of a cultural phenomenon, making himself matter once again by switching gears and adapting to that change in the way society views a hero, and in turn, what that means. It's something of great interest then to pop into a cinema hall and sit down to watch Captain America. How would, or could they adapt a guy so plainly written, and so intrinsic to the whole 1940's social paranoia and patriotism thing (and ultimately canned air without) without alienating audiences? Surely something huge would have to change—surely he's not going to have a magic boomerang shield, wear the American flag in bright red, white and blues, and shove everything righteous, holy and great about his country's ideals down our throat like its 1942 all over again? Surely not, right? Well, guess again, chump! You see, sitting down to watch Captain America is like subjecting yourself to two hours of overblown bombast with little to no resonating cues. It's a series of one-liners that fall flat on their back and a movie so into making itself look iconic that it loses all of its steam thirty minutes in. Sure, they try to justify all these pedantic details that do nothing but pander to hardcore comic fans, but in the end you get the idea that maybe Captain America isn't the kind of character you want to invest in at this stage—that not everyone can do a Batman.Taking the form of every other origin superhero story that you've seen thirty times already in the past decade, Joe Johnston's adaptation of the Cap's story is something of a blundering mess rife with heartless melodrama and harmless, neutered action. Aside from the fact that nothing happens here that some other superhero hasn't done before in many different, more interesting ways, there's just something about watching this ridiculous superhero in action that never resonates. To be fair, I guess there isn't much that Johnston could have done with Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's lightweight, by-the-numbers script, and blame shouldn't squarely be pointed in his direction. Walking into the movie, I at least expected some decent rapport between the cardboard Chris Evans and the somewhat energising Hugo Weaving—but the very most we get from these two is something along the lines of, ""Don't you ever give up?!"", to which the ever-quick witted Captain America retorts, ""Nope!"" Okay, so he's not Peter Parker, sure, but can't we at least have a little more rebuttal? A little more jazz? A little more, life? Composer Alan Silvestri sure tries, but perhaps too much— punctuating all this nonsense is a bizarrely self-conscious score from 1940's hell. Fight the fight! Save your country! Drink Coca-Cola! This is a super-hero-movie-from-the-seventies score! I guess, in the end, that's the central problem I had when watching The First Avenger; just like those older Golden-Age comics, the general idea here is primarily to make money by being as safe and exploitive as possible—money doesn't require personality, and, well, how else are we going to shift all this popcorn, right? I mean, sure, the movie does have its finer points, yet much of them die alongside Stanley Tucci who plays the only character with any discernible personality traits not soaked in melodrama or silly caricature. Instead, viewers are treated to a romance as tepid as overnight coffee and action written and performed with as much vigour as one would do drinking it. It's the kind of thing that even your average soap or daytime special might do with more feeling and plausibility—indeed, much like the entirety of Cap's origin story, the very idea comes off as a perfunctory afterthought in the wake of something greater—or at least, more profitable—than itself. You see, in the vein of what is actually made watchable in this movie, the concluding ten or so minutes which foreshadow coming events in the upcoming Avengers movie provide what is arguably the only reason the preceding 110 minutes were made (though fail to justify sitting through them, unfortunately.) In the end, despite poor Steve Rogers waking up 70 years later, and despite him not having aged a day, it's a shame that the movie itself feels and looks nothing of the sort; with a character rooted in the forties and movie-making that's stuck in the nineties, Captain America: The First Avenger is a stilted, banal and disappointingly forgettable affair that fails to distinguish itself amidst much more formidable and relevant foes rendering much of the experience entirely forgettable.",Captain America - The First Avenger

192,scottshak_111,Don't watch this one with high expectations!,6,29 August 2011,"Where do I start with this one! (Remember I am not amused at all .. That's my reluctance talking) I must say that the hype the flick was getting as the release date neared was too much. I had high expectations when people started comparing it to Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows -2 (of course, in terms of gross earnings). I later realized that it wasn't about how good the movies were actually but about the 'nationality' quotient that was attached to it. Americans and the British have been a part of this cold war for decades to prove their standards and in an endeavor to prove they are right, have left no stone unturned.We all are big fans of the Harry Potter franchise. There was supposed to be no comparison made because if we had to choose one from any other flick Vs Harry our fingers would involuntarily point towards the wizard's exceptional story.Now coming back to the flick Captain America: The first Avengers I must say I entered the theater with very high expectations (don't do that) although every one on this planet who is a marvel fan knows the story behind the legendary Captain. We all knew that the story was bound to hover around the World War which was contemporary to our hero's heroic deeds.The choice of the actor was most apposite as Chris Evans stepped in the shoes of Captain America. The visual effects were brilliant not to forget the acting and the little amount of action it had. Mind boggling visual effects, as it was difficult to make out the body Chris Evans had, prior to being Captain, was actually shrunk. Skinny Steve was something, I must admit because I was in awe for a long time.Tommy Lee Jones was in the movie while I forget it all the time because his role was so short that it seemed he was hardly there. Nothing was remarkable about the movie. I don't seem to remember any particular stunt that was eye-catching even. Hugo Weaving seemed promising for a while but, out his light blew with a flash, definitely not what I had expected.Story? We all knew! So what was there to offer? Same thing can be said about Potter but mind you, it still had superb action, superb visual effects, superb music, a superb direction and a proper screenplay to offer. Captain America: The first avenger lagged everything except maybe the visual effects part which too was short-lived.",Captain America - The First Avenger

But that's not the plot of this movie. The real plot of ""Captain America"" is about a guy who wants a chance in the U.S. Army, and then turns into this ""hunky"" superhero after a nuclear experiment. Now, ""Captain America"" is a really cool movie, and it's really entertaining, but it's not the best or the worst. Chris Evans was okay as ""Captain America"", because he brings half-excitement for his performance, but he sometimes improves. Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci were pretty impressive, but I didn't like Hugo Weaving in this movie, because he was actually portraying a mediocre villain, and he's not that good at it. But I did enjoy this movie because there is an interesting plot, exciting characters, and there is really a lot of entertainment. The effects were interesting, because I enjoyed how they made Chris Evans become really skinny, and then turn him muscular. I would say that this movie is pretty impressive.

194,tankace,"Little by the numbers, but quit enjoyable ww2 film none the less.",8,7 October 2016,"Having reviewed the sequels of this flick, I though it is time finally close this trilogy with the first one of the group, The First Avenger. The reason why I didn't review it up to now was the fact Winter Soldier and Civil War are so good that completely overshadowed their predecessor, but this isn't right for the film is also good.In short this is the origin story of the most patriotic of all the Avengers, Captain (Wow captain ,my captain!) America, who before this film he was a joke for he was made to fight Nazis and be the poster boy of the Patriotism in USA. As a person who lives in a country in which USA wasn't the best ally ,I should have hated this movie on the spot, but I can't for a number of reasons.1. It is by default an alternate history ,with all the Hydra experiments and Super Soldier program, from were Steve Rogers gained his abilities.2.Although the story-arc is a bit basic,good soldier and friends versus Nazis, for the purpose of the movie works.3. The action scenes are great.4.The attention to detail in order to recreate the 40's setting, one of my favorites in cinema.5.Finally is the friendship between Bucky and Steve.Is every well portrait by Chris Evans and Sebastian Stan, bonus points that they are close to perfect for their roles.In the end the final product was good and even to this day the movie is in the top ten of the highest grossing flick about WW2 and after watching it ,I can't say it earn it with out reason or that critics.In summary is a good WW2 film, with superheroes in it and it is a lot of fun, I recommended with out question. Funny story if you think about it Captain is about nine decades old, man this isn't fair, I am not even a third of his age and I don't look so good!",Captain America - The First Avenger
195,vjnambu,Average film but cap rocks,7,10 March 2020,"Captain america the first avenger stars chris evans as steve rogers in his third superhero outing after fantastic four and push.
Set in 1940s, it narrates the story of steve rogers who is trying passionately to join the US army but is constantly rejected due to his poor physical condition. At this time, he's spotted by Dr. Erksine who at that time is working on a super soldier experimentation program and chooses steve for his experiment because of the latter's pure heart. Steve joins the army and falls in love with agent peggy carter. Steve is sent for the experiment and turns successful giving him super physical strength. But few minutes after the experiment erksine is shot by a hydra agent leading shield in dilemma because without erksine one cant successfully experiment with other soldiers. Hence, steve is reduced as a character actor for army plays. But steve proves his worth by saving american soldiers from hydra camp thus becoming captain america. He fights many wars along with his best friend bucky and lock horns with hydra leader red skull.
What I loved in the film is the character of steve rogers. Such an honest and sincere persons are rare to find. One could understanding his qualities in that fake grenade scene. The transformation of the short and skinny steve rogers to tall and muscular captain america was great. Hugo weaving played red skull very well. Though I didn't find the love track of peggy and steve intriguing but it managed to play an important part in future films of steve. Also his friendship with bucky. In civil war, steve didn't support bucky just because he was his friend but because he was always the one who gave him moral support in his bad times. That's what in one scene bucky says that I am not following captain america but that skinny guy who is so idiot enough to get beaten up. If you have seen chris evans off screen then you will be shocked to see how such a cool and fun loving guy can play a no-nonsense steve rogers.
But the film has some drawbacks too. First is the film's narration is slow which is not good for a superhero film. Second is film lacks humour because of which it becomes the least favorite mcu film. And the action scenes are not upto the mark.
Overall, captain america the first avenger lacks the popcorn entertainment of a regular mcu film but is watchable because of chris evans performance and good presentation of 1940s.",Captain America - The First Avenger
196,Puroo,Could have been even better,7,29 April 2021,"When I had begun watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I was waiting for the movie in which Captain America shows up. For some reason I really liked Captain America back then, because of how his weapon is just a shield; no sword, no bows and arrows, no hammer. It showed how he believes his arms are the equivalent of the said weapons. This logic could have made sense if he was as strong as, say, Wonder Woman (and yet she uses a sword). But he's just as strong as a strong man, and yet he has this confidence. And that's what made him special for me. I had literally no idea what I was going to expect in this movie. I watched it with a complete blank slate. I didn't even know Captain America's real name is Steven Rogers. That's how less I knew of him. I just admired him because, well, I've already said it.The setting of the movie is during the time of World War II. Steven Rogers was just a lanky man back then who was very determined and patriotic. He gets beaten up in an alley by an anti-national and saved by a military man, but even when he is getting beaten he does not give up. He is taken in the army and allowed to train like the rest for the World War. But seeing him jump on the grenade to save everyone, they realise something must be done for him. And so they give him the super soldier serum, thus making him Captain America.Earlier used as a prop to cheer the US Army during the war, Captain America is soon sent on multiple missions where he and his best friend Bucky Barnes fight the Nazis. Bucky faces a sad demise, and soon the enemy commander is revealed to be the infamous Red Skull. Captain America and Red Skull fight, Captain beats Red Skull but soon after faces a plane crash. He is revived years later before the events of The Avengers can take place.There are a lot of things I like about this movie. First of all, the idea of a superhero like Captain America. Like I mentioned earlier, I really liked the idea that the hero has no equipment other than a shield. So seeing the hero fight in close combat while all his enemies have powerful guns is very interesting. The reveal of Red Skull was also a huge moment, and so was his apparent death, which was rewarding in Avengers: Infinity War. The cinematography also looked really amazing, and the message that this movie gives is also very positive. Overall this movie is really fun and wholesome to look at.But there are a lot of things I didn't like about it as well. First of all the audio. Most of the times it was hard to hear the dialogues. The whole time the scientist guy was speaking I was like, ""What? Huh? He is a what? What are you saying about Nazis?"" Same goes for the interrogation scene of that vegetarian scientist. What was his name again? Oh wait, I remember. I COULDN'T HEAR IT! The second problem, like literally every other MCU movie, is the unbelievable action scenes. There is no way I can believe that Captain America sneaked inside one truck, beat up all the bad guys, then hit the guard with his shield while all the other guards have their backs towards him and walk out silently with his glow-in-the-dark shield and no one notices him. And the jump cuts during the action scenes, dude, it's so hard to make out what's going on because of the continuous camera angle change.The post credit scene felt like sequel baiting, and it was unnecessary since that very same scene was also shown in The Avengers. They should have kept it in either one of the two movies. But other than that I enjoyed the movie. Unlike most Marvel Cinematic Universe movies where I find the movies to be a one-time watch, I won't mind seeing this one all over again. It is really a mindless, wholesome, fun to watch family movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger
197,Trevor-Kerensky,Good as a period piece with lots of sci-fi elements,8,20 July 2018,"I remember having a comic book on Captain America that I got from my doctor a long time ago (and I still have it too), though I wasn't big on superheroes back then. But after Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man film, I was hooked. And considering Captain America is part of the Avengers, it really got me interested in all the characters. It was my duty to discover the origins of the members of the Avengers. Set during the World War II era, we get the origins of a young man who is not soldier material but gets certain enhancements due to a super soldier serum. And he gets his wish and becomes the poster boy for the war effort on the Allied side. As a movie, it has lots of familiar faces, including Tommy Lee Jones (from Men in Black), Hugo Weaving (of Lord of the Rings and The Matrix), and Richard Armitage (of the Hobbit films). Plus there are lots of science-fiction elements in this movie that fit in nicely with the period. I wasn't bored in the slightest. Plus, I like World War II era period pieces. This movie is part of the puzzle that makes up 2012's Avengers film. See it just to see how Captain America fits into the story. It's really good.",Captain America - The First Avenger
198,x_manicure_x,Cringeworthy,4,24 August 2021,"It starts decently but drags way too long for its little content. At least they spent enough time on the development of the main character for once. It's not easy to portrait Captain America in the 2010s without ending up looking ridiculous, and it was actually cool that they started him off as a cheesy fictional propaganda character before shaping him into an actual superhero. Just, nothing relevant happens afterward. The story is not interesting enough to make this worthwhile as a story-driven film, and action sequences are dull. I'm surprised no one mentioned the ridiculous CGI backgrounds that make the whole movie look like a cheap-ass music video more than a 3D sensation. I also hated their rendition of Howard Stark. They just tried to make him look and act like Tony so that they could have an interesting character but failed miserably.",Captain America - The First Avenger
199,dockerykelli,A Wonderful & Great Film,10,25 June 2019,"This film was unbelievably good plus it has Chris Evans!!! The storyline line is amazing!!! Sadness, gratitude, love, action packed!!! What's NOT TO LOVE about this film!?!",Captain America - The First Avenger
200,bluesman-20,1941 A World at war and Steve Rogers is about to become Captain America.,10,13 October 2011,"CAPTAIN America. is that rare film that makes you feel good. the story follows the comic book. The Story is this. 1943 America is at war and the United States government is banking every thing on the Super Soldier formula. Steve Rogers is the test subject who was selected out of a small group of men to test the formula. The Serum works and Rogers becomes the world's first American Super soldier. Then a German spy kills the inventor of the serum and Rogers goes after the killer when he does so in public and pictures are taken of him the Government decides he would be more useful selling War Bonds on a USO tour. Rogers is angry because this is not what he believes he was given the super soldier serum for. Then he finds out a friend of his Bucky Barnes is trapped behind enemy lines along with most of his unit. Steve Rogers now code named Captain America disobeys orders and rescues Bucky and the Howling commandos. once he does this the government sees the worth in him fighting the battles that need to be fought. His greatest challenge is the evil mad Red Skull who was given a earlier version of the serum which disfigured him and gave him immense power. The rest of the film is the conflict between the Red Skull and Captain America and how Cap is trying to stop the Skull's ultimate plan to destroy the allied forces. It Ends up with Captain America defeating the Red Skull only to be thrust into suspended animation for over 75 years and when he awakes it's to a strange new world. Not a bad movie I enjoyed it greatly,Chris Evans proved to me he can carry Captain America's Shield and Hugo Weaving oozes evil as the Red Skull. Tommy Lee Jones gives a strong performance as General Chester Phillips. The movie's biggest strength is the fact that it adheres to old style film making values it felt like watching a old style action film from when they really did know how to make films. Joe Johnston is a old style film maker right up there with John Ford and Howard Hawks and he never seems to get the credit he deserves. With Captain America he makes his best picture yet. The film's moral is believe in yourself believe in your country and never give up. Something we can still believe in today.",Captain America - The First Avenger
201,Meven_Stoffat,He's the star spangled man with a plan,7,31 July 2011,"If you've paid attention to the shape of cinema recently, you'd notice that we are sort of living in what we could call ""The Superhero Age"" of cinema. Because starting in 2008, anticipation for the upcoming Avengers movie had started with the stellar flick Iron Man, with the mediocre Incredible Hulk following. Then, of course, in 2010 the just as spectacular as the first Iron Man 2 followed, with the credits holding a teaser for Thor, which would come out this year, with Captain America following just a few months later. That, plus Iron Man 2 held plenty of secrets regarding The Avengers.And so me, the comic book nerd I am, waited for every movie with great patience, and voila, they were all great... And believe me, Captain America is a fun as hell movie. While it may not be as great as Thor, it's still plenty of fun to be had, and it's overall a great time. I was initially worried before this though, because for one it was directed by Joe Johnston. And mind you, I've got nothing against the guy. In fact I gave a 5/5 review of his Wolfman remake. It's just that I was worried he couldn't pull it off, and he did it. Another thing is Chris Evans. I thought he was initially too much a bishonen to be convincing, and he surprisingly pulled it off. So in all, I was pleasantly surprised!The movie, like Iron Man and Thor before it, is more of an origin story. It takes place in 1942 during the second world war, and Steve Richards, a small and skinny shotaro boy with a laundry list of medical problems, has been dying to join the American army, to help serve, and fight for his country. He has been unsuccessful in every attempt, and furthermore, he is completely jealous of his buddy, who is already in the army. One night, he manages to successfully get in, thanks to the help of a German doctor Abraham Erskine, although it isn't without difficulty in training. However, the handsome and smart, not to mention very tech savvy Howard Stark has a plan for him: a serum that will give him a he'll of a physique, amazing strength, and furthermore turns him into the super soldier under the name Captain America. After this procedure, the transformation into Captain America begins, as he manages to do many things, such as free imprisoned soldiers from the jaws of death, somehow manage to make the smokin' hot British army general Peggy Carter fall for him, and get on the road to overthrowing the evil German doctor Johan Schmitt, who has terrifying plans for the war.So really, let's begin with the fact that the 3D was surprisingly great. I wasn't going to bother since it was filmed in 2D and converted in post, but reading CinemaBlend's review of the 3D and further research that Joe Johnston had 3D in mind from the very early stages and carefully shot each scene for the 3D convinced me. And yes, it is totally worth it. While it's no Avatar or TRON Legacy, this is the best post conversion I've seen since Piranha 3D. Very few films shot in 3D looked better than this, and that's saying something. Maybe I'm over exaggerating, but if this is a sign of things to come for the current boom of 3D, maybe post conversions in the future could look as great as TRON Legacy or Avatar. So yes, do go for 3D!As for the film itself, wow. Great performances abounds in the film. I wasn't expecting Chris Evans to be as great as he was, and boy did he thrill. He had great comedic timing, looked the part, played the role just the way you'd expect Captain America to be played. Tommy Lee Jones was great too, and so was Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark. The script is very intelligent and filled with humour, action, and great dialogue too. The action as well, is simply amazing! Why can't all action movies be well shot, with camera shots lasting longer than a few seconds? Transformers, despite 3D, still has the quick shots syndrome, so thankfully the action here did not disappoint.Another surprise is the use of CG is very limited- thank god! The thing about Joe Johnston is that he's been known to use CG sparingly, mixing CG with practical effects. As you could imagine, this film takes place during World War II, and not on Asgard, as well as it doesn't have a man in an iron suit, so for the most part, the effects are practical and in camera. However, when he does use CG, you almost don't notice it, it's that well used. So I gotta say, it's great that we have a blockbuster that makes use of mostly practical effects. Maybe it's just my inner child speaking, as I grew up with a man in a suit playing Chewbacca, or people holding the doors open on the Enterprise to give it the sliding illusion, or Keanu Reeves sitting on a train writing his journal with a map of Europe projected on his face, but I was pleased with this.If I had one complaint, it's that the movie is slow in a few parts, but that is just a teensy quibble. Otherwise, this movie is a fantastic blockbuster, and a sign of things to come for the Avengers. A total recommend, and I also advise you to stay after the credits, as there's a teaser for The Avengers!Overall: 8/10Pros: Captain America is a surprisingly very great superhero action flick, with awesome action and performances by Hugo Weaving and Chris Evans. It also looks great in 3D and makes awesome use of practical effects.Cons: it is slow in the middle, and Dominic Cooper's underuse is just a teensy bit disappointing.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Captain America is not one of my favorite heroes somehow I couldn't warm it up.

204,patches89,Fitting origin story to the first Avenger,9,14 January 2021,"Theres no Avengers without Steve Rodgers and in Chris Evans they have the perfect fit. Set in WWII we start with a small Steve trying to enlist to the military but being so small and weedy he kept getting knocked back until Howard Stark's machine turns him into a super soldier and he enters the war and finds himself in a fight against Hydra led by Red Skull helped by his best friend Bucky and Agent Peggy Carter.

205,eshwarmail,"Watch it if you are a fan of the Marvel Universe, it huffs and puffs to just cross the line",6,9 January 2017,"Reviewed February 2012The greatest strength of this movie is it's makers clarity on it's limitations. So all along, it never shies away from making a joke on itself at the same time presenting a fast paced fun ride. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a pint sized man with a huge heart who is passionate about joining the army and serving the country during IInd WW. Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) a bio-scientist working on a super soldier project from the Hitler's Hydra team escapes Germany and reaches U.S. to stop the atrocities of the Fuhrer. The head of Hydra Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) is hell bent on capturing Erskine and also in pursuit of a mystical power for dominance and achieves latter. Erskine chooses Rogers for the experiment for his passion and good heart, and makes him Captain America. As expected from the first product of the franchise, there is enough character building for Steve Rogers before he becomes Captain America and Chris Evans does enough to give a held back performance. There are a string of talented actors playing well known characters from the Marvel Universe and they do their part well. A breeze screenplay and well induced humor can only do a bit for it's flaws of inconsistent visuals, a lack of fresh plot and a lengthy runtime. The hype on it's set up for Avengers is a little overrated. Watch it if you are a fan of the Marvel Universe, it huffs and puffs to just cross the line.",Captain America - The First Avenger
206,Ryan_MYeah,"With a nice cast, exciting action scenes, and a retro visual vibe, Captain America is the funnest movie of the Summer.",8,1 August 2011,"As I walked out of Captain America: The First Avenger, I felt the gleeful aftermath of a truly great popcorn flick. It's safe to say that Captain America is THE most fun I've had with ANY 2011 movie I've seen, thus far.Chris Evans stars as Steve Rogers, a true patriot if there ever was one in the 1940's. Though he has the selflessness and bravery of a hundred men, he's forbidden to join the armies of World War II due to his 90 pound body frame. But, with the help of a caring Scientist named Abraham Erskine (Played by Stanley Tucci), he's recruited for a special super soldier infantry, and through the power of science, successfully goes through an experiment that gives him the muscles to match his heroic spirit. But, trouble arises when the USA are facing a threat from an underground organization known as HYDRA, lead by a disfigured Nazi named Johann Schmidt (Played with hissing intimidation by Hugo Weaving). Growing tired of his celebrity status, Rogers decides that it's time to take action, and fight the good fight. Captain America is born.It's not often when visual effects designer turned director Joe Johnston makes a good movie, let alone something as great as Captain America. The movie is a refreshing return to a retro vibe not seen of Johnston since The Rocketeer. He and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely manage a consistent tone, and never make the exciting action sequences feel like they're one too many.As you would expect, Johnston's tech crew have crafted the film very well. Mainly through stylized, but era appropriate sets by Rick Heinrichs. Costumes specific to character and mood by Anna Sheppard. An exciting, and glorious return to past form for composer Alan Silvestri. And last but not least, prosthetic makeup of Red Skull by Lisa Westcott that is so good, it's scary.As for the cast, Chris Evans is especially of notice. Steve Rogers is a highly likable character from the beginning. He never does anything to make us dislike him, and though that threatens to make him feel one note at times, Evans has no problem with keeping the character feeling fresh, a highly beneficial trait. Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving are delightful in their roles of Col. Chester Philips and Johann Schmidt (aka. Red Skull), and the beautiful Hayley Atwell gives it her all as Rogers' love interest, Peggy Carter.It's not always perfect, but the film also features some really exceptional scenes. A daring raid on the HYDRA facilities, a claustrophobic tussle within the confines of a train, and an amusingly creative musical montage of Captain America's celebrity status, set to the original song ""Star Spangled Man"" with lyrics by David Zippel, and music by the LEGENDARY Alan Menken.The movie is a pleasant addition to what has been a surprisingly good Summer. Certainly better than last year's. So I hope just as many people going off to see Potter's final bow, or the Transformers' final war will pay just as much attention to Captain America.Before I sign off, I must note two things. My rating, which is *** out of **** Also, I must remind you to stay for a special scene after the end credits, which then leads into a teaser for the upcoming movie, The Avengers, due out in the Summer of next year. If you walk out before that, you're missing too much. My anticipation for the film is now at an all time high, and I can't wait to see it.",Captain America - The First Avenger
207,williampsamuel,Captain America is Good Old Fashioned Fun,8,6 December 2014,"Good old fashioned fun; that's what Captain America promises, and that's what it delivers. With Bullets, explosions, and fisticuffs aplenty, instantly recognizable good and bad guys, and a big side of gung-ho patriotism, Captain America is a throwback to the morale-building war films of Hollywood's golden era, only with higher production values. Highbrow it ain't, or especially original, but it's not trying to be.The story is a familiar one, but well worth telling again. Steve Rodgers (Chris Evens), an asthmatic ninety-pound weakling from Brooklyn is turned down every time he tries to enlist- until scientist Emile Erskine sees something in the young lad and enters him into a top secret project to develop the perfect soldier. And with an injection of super-soldier serum, Rodgers becomes the courageous, muscle-bound hero Captain America and plants his shield right in the face of Nazi Germany- after staring in a nationwide bond drive that is absolutely side-splitting in its cheesiness.This movie isn't much on nuance or complexity. There are no stunning revelations, no moral wrangling, and only simply drawn characters. Cap and his buddies are brave, selfless, and believe in freedom and standing up for the little guy, while Johann Schmidt, the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) is a power-hungry megalomaniac who seeks to conquer not only the allies but Hitler and the Nazis as well. It might have been nice to see Rodgers developed a bit further, but I suppose the whole point is for him to be a simple, wholesome everyman, and Evens has no trouble conveying this with his natural energy and innate charm. Expect to see a lot more of this kid in the coming years.Weaving is likewise perfect to play the Red Skull. He's had plenty of experience playing the bad guy, and I got a feeling that he was enjoying himself, even if he didn't find the role very challenging. A more interesting casting choice is the inclusion of Tommy Lee Jones. He might seem an odd pick for a superhero movie, especially considering his rather sedate performance as Two-Face in Batman Forever. But here he is perfect a Cap's no-nonsense, tough-as-nails commanding officer.The action scenes are well staged and generally exciting; even if they do become a bit repetitive towards the middle, and it really is cool the kind of tricks Cap can pull with his shield. I also enjoyed the blend of war movie and sci-fi type elements. This is WWII fought with ray guns, rocket planes, and tanks as big as a house- although it is worth noting that the Skull's one man rocket-copter was an actual German design.I will admit that some of the supporting characters are introduced too late for us to really get to know them. And the romance between Rodgers and Peggy Carter is so under-developed as too be perfunctory. There are also a fair number of clichés, from the talking villain to the always reliable self destruct sequence, but these play more as homage to the movies and serials of yesteryear than as evidence of a lack of ideas.Despite some flaws, Captain America is still rousing entertainment. And while I understand that things can't always be black and white, it's still good every now and then to see a movie that lets us root unequivocally for the good guys and be proud that we're American. Captain America is that kind of movie, and it's great fun for all ages.",Captain America - The First Avenger

213,martinrobertson300482,"Isn't this ""The Avengers"" movie yet?",4,10 August 2011,"Watch out! Spoilers ahead. He becomes a superhero in the movie.I personally think they've screwed this up royally. In their desperate bid too get too an ""Avengers"" movie, ""Captain America"" feels more like the pilot episode off a series, and one that jumps the shark way too soon at that.I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Captain America is already the lamest superhero I can think off too begin with. He is super strong and throws his shield at people? I mean come on! When I first heard who was going too be in it I was less than thrilled too. Chris Evans as the star? Hasn't he already been a superhero? In fact the whole cast reeks off no effort. We need a bad-ass army captain. Oh lets get Tommy Lee Jones. We need a cross looking villain. Oh lets get Hugo Weaving. These guys are good in their roles I guess (even though they bring nothing surprising too the parts). I think the film wouldn't off been that great anyway, whoever was in it! Things start off promising with the 40's setting, and the pace seems too be building up too something awesome. But when Evans finally dons his costume, the film starts too rush through 70 years off back-story, relying on shamefully crammed montages (Americaaa! F**k ye!) before returning too more boring chat! They even screw up the bad-guy Red Skull. They don't show us his real face till way after the half way mark, and then briefly show us his evil antics, before he has ONE battle with the captain, before supposedly ending up dead. But in a way in which he can return for a sequel off course. I also found his nose too be seriously distracting. How much money has been put into this film? Couldn't they even get his nose too sit straight on his rubber face? Like ""Iron man,"" the film has a nice sense off humour too it, but that is not what I wanted too take from this movie. At least ""Iron man"" took some time in getting too a point where an ""Avengers"" movie seemed reasonable, and it took 2 whole films too get there. ""Captain America"" shamefully rushes too get too that point, and the hero is already in the present day by the (terrible) end off the film. In fact the films whole plot links with the others way too much, with the whole evil plot being embarrassingly linked with ""Thor,"" and did we really need Robert Downey Jnrs grand-dad or whoever it is in here? No!This, as well as ""Thor,"" wants me too be excited about forth coming ""Avengers"" instead off itself. If it's going too be like the sum off its parts though, its just going too be yet another super-hero movie. I just wish more effort had been put into these films individually. They just feel like filler episodes off a series too me. Roll on ""The Dark knight rises"" is all I can say too Marvel.",Captain America - The First Avenger

215,RealLiveClaude,Does Justice to Cap ! Amen !,9,6 August 2011,"As I remembered the versions of 1979 (TV movies with Reb Brown) or the lame version of 1991 with Matt Salinger, I was just hoping this time, this movie will do good with Captain America as the main subject.And what a ride it was. I know that Captain America (Steve Rogers) was a soldier, so expecting some war movie along with the superhero fare. Joe Johnston not only caught the essence of the American Hero, but this time, no bulked up effects nor fake violence. This is really the Marvel hero and first Avenger who we are seeing here...All the actors were good in it. Very surprised to see Hugo Weaving doing a believable Red Skull (I remember the one in 1991 was horrible...) and when you see Tommy Lee Jones doing army stuff, we gotta believe it, he gives depth...Chris Evans gives Steve Rogers/Captain America a brand new perspective, far from Reb Brown's botched up costume or Matt Salinger's bland personification. Hope he keeps the momentum in ""The Avengers""...And of course, the ""Stan Lee"" moment is not to be missed with a quip from the creator himself...",Captain America - The First Avenger
216,galahad58-1,One of the Best,10,24 July 2011,"I was always into artwork. This passion for artwork led me to read comics and graphic novels and I self-taught myself to sketch. I bought comics more for the artwork than the story, but the stories would help. There were quite a few good artists in the 70s and 80s -- today there are very few -- and they helped to expand my sketches. Along the way I became a fan of Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Batman, Spawn and Conan the Barbarian.In the 70s Richard Donner made the Superman movie. At that time superheroes were largely on cartoons or series (Wonder Woman, Superman, Batman and The Incredible Hulk). Casting Christopher Reeves was brilliant the the first big superhero movie became one of the greatest of all time. Since then many have tried and many have failed. Spiderman opened the door again with it's quality of movie. Iron Man and the Christian Bale Batman movies showed that you can make a great superhero movie. The sad part was that you had The Fantastic Four (below average), Iron Man II (awful), The X-Men (average--all 3), Wolverine (a dog), Daredevil (less than daring), Electra (the worse ever), Michael Keaton's Batman I and II (average), Val Kilmer's Batman (average), George Clooney's Batman (almost killed Batman entirely) and the Superman Returns bomb.Green Lantern and Thor hit the theaters this year in 3D and both were less than spectacular. It was disappointing that two of my favorite superheroes were portrayed so poorly.Now came Captain America. I was hoping it would at least be better than Green Lantern, but I was skeptical with the last couple of superhero movies. I was not a fan of Chris Evans in the role and I felt that may kill the movie. I watched Evans in the bad Fantastic Four and the god-awful The Losers and all he did was play a cocky smart-mouthed punk. This was not what Captain America was to folks.I was so pleasantly surprised. Captain America exceeded my expectations and was on the level with Iron Man I, Superman, and Batman Begins/The Dark Knight. Evans was actually fantastic as Captain America and did justice to the role. From start to finish, there were so many positive moments in the movie that I would highly recommend Captain America to everyone.",Captain America - The First Avenger
217,Chalice_Of_Evil,I think it works...,9,28 July 2011,"What sets this movie apart from the continuous stream of comic book movies we've been getting so far this year? Well, for starters, this one takes place mainly in the 1940s during WW2 (except for the WTF opening, that makes you wonder if you've wandered into the wrong film). Aside from the beginning and ending, I enjoyed this film immensely. It's this change of scenery/time period that gives Captain America a different sort of tone and makes it stand out from the crowd. It's like a good old-fashioned action adventure movie. A rollicking good time - which you would expect from Joe Johnston (who directed, among others, the classic film The Rocketeer).Another large part of the film's success is the cast. To any who doubted Chris Evans, he more than adequately fills the shoes of Steve Rogers. Yes, with some excellent computer-aided trickery, we meet Steve as a scrawny ""90 pound asthmatic"". He's a nice kid, with a great never-give-up attitude, who sadly no one takes seriously when he wants to join the fight against Hitler. Evans is truly convincing as this character. He brings heart to the film, which is what counts. With the help of a serum and a kindly scientist, Steve gets to be the first in a planned long line of super soldiers. He is transformed into the epitome of physical perfection. And so we see Scrawny Evans turned into Steamy Evans, a musclebound man with enhanced abilities. No, he doesn't have a robotic suit doing all the work for him, but what he *does* have is the ability to finally be the best that he truly can be. Evans proves the right guy for the job, as he makes you believe in this zero-turned-hero. I also appreciated that he wasn't yet another wise-cracking smart-arse, as a lot of 'heroes' seem to be lately. He actually has an earnestness & naivety about him which makes him likable, and it's this endearing quality which catches the eye of Agent Peggy Carter, played by gorgeous British actress Hayley Atwell, who does quite a lot with what she's given. She's not just the ordinary run-of-the-mill damsel in distress in need of rescuing. She handles herself exceptionally well, being handy with a gun, and gives Rogers a run for his money when it comes to never backing down. Atwell brings a lot to the role, much of it being in the looks that she gives. That's not to say she doesn't get some good lines. I thought she was actually one of the best female leads in a comic book movie to date. Her and Evans play off each other well.Tommy Lee Jones is really good as the gruff Colonel Phillips. He's a bit rough around the edges, but manages to show that he's not entirely without heart. Stanley Tucci is also excellent as the doctor who sees in Steve something that not many do. A real friendship develops between the two, and it goes a long way to making sure that when Dr. Erskine exits the film, we feel what Steve feels. This isn't the only loss, though. There is one other significant casualty, that actually packs an emotional punch when it happens. As Steve's best friend Bucky, Sebastian Stan plays another likable character. Their friendship feels very real and believable, as Bucky is one of the few to stand up for his friend in the early part of the film.Lastly, Hugo Weaving does some major scenery chewing in the role of Johann Schmidt. Not everything goes according to plan for the crazy Nazi dude obsessed with becoming a god (when will these bad guys in comic book films learn NOT to experiment on themselves?), and he winds up the disfigured red-skulled villain his name would suggest. I actually liked how the reveal of Red Skull was approached, with only very vague hints to what was lurking underneath the surface early in the film (like with the painting of him whilst he stands in shadow). Once we do finally see him in his full Red Skull glory, this is when Weaving seems to really cut loose and relish the role. His face, and nose cavity, are quite distracting.The film has several standout sequences and the action is handled with expertise. Though one sequence that I especially liked in the film isn't action-based at all. It's early on, before Capt. America has even gotten a proper costume. Instead he's dressed in laughable tights (all those moaning about the update of the Captain America costume need only see this nod to the original version to realise that changes did indeed need to be made) with little wings jutting out from the sides of his cowl. What makes this scene so memorable is the fact that we are treated to a performance by a gaggle of star-spangled dancing girls dressed in red, white, and blue, who perform a catchy ""Star-Spangled Man"" song whilst Captain America travels around the country to boost morale and sell war bonds. It really was a delightful surprise moment.Thankfully, Cap eventually gets upgraded to much more practical star-spangled duds (which resembles a tricked-out airman's jumpsuit), complete with a mask which looks to be adapted from a WW2 helmet and a handy shield which doubles as a kick-arse Frisbee. And so Captain America is able to kick butt without looking stupid.The only slight negative I found in the film was the ending. Due to how things have to end up, the ending to this movie stinks of merely being set-up for The Avengers (of which there is yet more set up for, plus a teaser trailer of, at the end of the credits). And sadly, the relationship that was blossoming between Steve and Peggy hits a rather large snag (though their goodbye scene is emotional/quite effective). Here's hoping for a proper sequel to this film, so that we can get to see Steve show up for his date.",Captain America - The First Avenger
218,Bruce722,Not as good as the critics claimed.,8,29 May 2013,"I thought this movie was really good but it definitely wasn't the ""best superhero movie ever"" like so many people have proclaimed. They could've developed some of the characters beyond Steve and Peggy more and given the movie more depth. That would've made certain character deaths more meaningful. The action sequences, while not as impressive as some of the other superhero movies, were still awesome in their own right and the fight scenes were fairly entertaining. The ending could've been a lot more emotional as well. I'm not asking for sobbing and ridiculous crying but if you actually think about what was happening, having some more emotion would've made it feel more genuine and authentic. Chris Evans is great as Captain America though. His role doesn't call for the darkness of Bruce Wayne or the charisma of Tony Stark but it does call for a certain level of confidence and straightforwardness and arrogance. Chris Evans hits all of those well. One of the few other weak parts was the villain. The Red Skull just wasn't all that terrifying or intimidating. Sure, he wanted to ""take over the world"" but nothing really made him uniquely evil other than his skinless head. All in all though, this was a very good movie and while it wasn't as good as the other Avengers films in my opinion, it is still better than most action movies around.",Captain America - The First Avenger
219,namob-43673,Now a worse movie because of Endgame,5,17 November 2019,"This is a very nice story, and nice superhero movie with a lot of charm. It is entertaining, fun, and create a great background story for what used to be a virtuous good man and leader of the Avengers.Sadly, after Endgame, this is muddier and an almost completely ruined movie.I had this movie at a 8/10, but now I need to lower the score considerably, and I will stick with a 5/10.Why?Because in Endgame (spoilers) the previous good man and Erskine pick to get the superhero serum is now a shadow of his former self and commit one of the worst crimes ever seen in a superhero movie. Steve travels back in time to rip poor Peggy from her husband and pending children and then he stays in the past without helping anyone with anything - just a careless bystander to atrocities while time-raping the girl he claim to love.
Not the only completely ruin character courtesy of Endgame, but the worst and by far the most evil.I still like this movie, but I cannot watch it anymore because I only see evil Steve now. I can recommend this movie, but only if you never, ever watch Endgame.",Captain America - The First Avenger
220,ldavis-2,Stan Lee's Buffalo Chips!,2,30 April 2012,"After suffering through Stan Lee's latest offering of buffalo chips, aka Thor, Epix finally got around to showing this last night.I have a lot of problems with this, namely how we're supposed to buy that a scrawny runt who couldn't cut it in Basic turns into Rambo the moment he's pumped full of some radioactive crap. That he always know exactly what to do. That he never hesitates, never has a ""my bad"", and the crap coursing through his veins doesn't affect him one bit. In real life, Scrawny Runt wouldn't have had a clue, his body would have attacked the crap coursing through his veins, and he would have been dead by the time he was popped out of his pod!The Bad Guy, a Nazi gone rouge, has a ray gun that, literally, evaporates everything it's pointed at. So, he builds this complex deep in the forest, houses 400 Allied soldiers, goofs on Wagner, and waits for the right moment to unleash Hell. Makes sense to me, too. Moreover, the Good Guys know all about Nazi Rouge and his plans to unleash Hell. Huh? If Hitler had gotten his hands on the ultimate Weapon of Mass Destruction, do you think he would have been holed up in the forest somewhere, goofing on Wagner, and biding his time? Hell, no!After nearly two hours of this ham-fisted nonsense (and Tommy Lee Jones looking really, really constipated), we are treated to a close-up of a pair of eyes with the longest lashes you have ever seen. Is this a Maybelline commercial? No, it's Scrawny Runt lying on a cot, waking up as if from a bad dream! Moments later, he's running down the streets of present-day Manhattan (my idea of a bad dream), and runs smack into Samuel L. Jackson, who informs Scrawny Runt that he's been ""asleep"" for 70 years! So, why isn't Scrawny Runt at some a top-secret location being defrosted and debriefed? Because that would make way too much sense! Besides, Mr. Lee needs him to peddle his newest bag of buffalo chips, The Avengers!",Captain America - The First Avenger
221,rparham,Standard but strong comic-book origin story,7,27 July 2011,"Since the release of Iron Man in 2008, Marvel Studios has been slowly moving towards assembling it's various superheroes in the upcoming super group film, The Avengers, to be released Summer 2012. The last piece of the puzzle in introducing the key members comes with the release of Captain America: The First Avenger, the oldest Marvel superhero, first introduced in comics in the 1940s. The film enjoyably keeps that original setting as part of Captain America's origin story in this film, and proves to be a solid, if not very inventive, introductory tale to Captain America.As previously stated, the film is set in the early 1940s, where Steve Rodgers (Chris Evans), a 99 pound asthmatic, has tried 5 times to enlist in the U.S. Army, failing each time due to his health. During his last attempt, he catches the eye of Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci), a German scientist that escaped Hitler's Nazi Germany to bring his super-soldier serum to help the U.S., designed to genetically enhance an army recruit to give him impressive strength and agility. Rodgers is successfully transformed by the formula, but a German spy kills Erskine and destroys the formula, leaving Rodgers as the only super-soldier to be produced.When the commanding officer of the super-soldier program, Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), wants to send him to be studied for replicating the formula, a U.S. Senator gives Rodgers an opportunity to support his country, but as the central attraction of a rolling U.S. War Bond tour, where the moniker Captain America is coined, as well as several staples of the Captain's outfit (the mask, a shield). When the tour takes Captain overseas, and a chance opportunity comes about to save his best buddy, Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), from a POW work camp, Captain America takes on the challenge single-handedly, rescuing soldiers who end up forming the core of his team, the Howling Commandos, and also coming face to face with a villain far worse than Hitler: Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), also known as the Red Skull, who had used Erskine's serum before it was perfected, and while it gave him strength also, it has led to facial deformity that looks like, well, a Red Skull. Schmidt has hatched a scheme that will see him conquer the world with the power harnessed from an ancient artifact, and the military chooses to loose Captain America and his team to take Schmidt down.Captain America proves to be somewhat unique visually in context with recent comic book adaptations, set in the 1940s America and Europe, with a gorgeous looking style to it that differentiates it from the crowd. Director Joe Johnston, who directed The Rocketeer in the early 1990s, captures much of the same feel as that earlier film, brimming with a sense of timelessness of that era that proves charming. Captain America also capitalizes on the patriotic energy from World War II and embodies it in the character of Steve Rodgers, which almost seems impossible to imagine coming from any political climate since then. Overall, however, Captain America is generally a by the book comic origin story film, moving through the standard paces of this tale: introduction of the character in advance of his transformation of a super hero, set up the changes of him/her to their eventual alter ego, revelation of the villain with a connection to the hero, then a series of set pieces that lead to a showdown against the villain. Captain America doesn't really deviate from the path too much, but while it won't win any awards for originality within the comic book standard, Johnston and writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, still deliver a solid entry in this sub-genre.Captain America does suffer a bit with its secondary characters, especially Rodgers friend Bucky Barnes and his other Howling Commandos, portrayed by reliable character actors such as Neal McDonough and Derek Luke, but they are all given the most minute amount of development, providing very little impact to the narrative at large, merely filling in parts of the screenplay that needed to be present, but living on the periphery of the story. Also, while Red Skull is one of the cornerstones of Marvel's pantheon of villainy, as presented here, he has a nice degree of James Bond-esque world domination to him, but doesn't come across as a villain that you can really develop a strong desire to see put down. Again, as with other parts of the film, he is presented as throwback to an earlier era of storytelling, but isn't quite as strong as expected.Captain America is helped along by some good performances from its main cast. Chris Evans gives Rodgers a strong sense of patriotism and a belief that he must step up to help his country, mixed with naiveté around women that gives him a nice streak of innocence. Unlike Tony Stark from Iron Man, Rodgers is very much a straight arrow with good intentions, and that feels right for the time the film is set in. Tommy Lee Jones practically steals the show with his delivery of the dialogue written for Colonel Phillips, using his personality best made famous from The Fugitive to give Phillips a degree of cynicism, but with good intentions beneath the curmudgeonly exterior. Haley Atwell gives her best interpretation of a Katherine Hepburn-like heroine from that era, although admittedly perhaps a bit too modern to be completely realistic. And Hugo Weaving provides the reliable over-the-top, but not too ridiculous, turn as Schmidt, making the Red Skull an appropriately megalomaniacal vibe.Captain America works for the most part, albeit falling a bit short of the top tier of Marvel movie, such as Iron Man. It is a good film overall, perhaps not groundbreaking, but still a nice introduction to a character that should live in The Avengers film and several sequels for years to come.",Captain America - The First Avenger
222,FairlyAnonymous,"Good first half, mediocre second half",6,13 November 2011,"Captain America is one of those movies that SHOULD'VE been good. The whole first half of the movie was very well done and seeing a weak kid turn into a buff dude was entirely awesome. Seeing him in training was also kind of funny and interesting at the same time. But that was the first half. The second half was much less interesting...The second half of the movie suffers from some surprisingly boring action. While action isn't awful, seeing all of the futuristic sets and high tech weaponry is really dull. When a movie has the WW2 scenario, usually expect seeing as least ONE historically accurate weapon, gun or heck even a building that looks accurate for the time. I think the whole WW2 scenario was entirely wasted. There wasn't even ONE tank in the movie that wasn't futuristic or that didn't exist.Another problem this movie suffers if entirely annoying sets. The sets that are with the Americans are fine, but the sets with the Hydra are entirely futuristic and everything they have is this annoying silver color. What is the point of it being in WW2 if there is not one scrap of evidence that what is happening is actually happening in WW2. I know its based off the comics which have Captain America in WW2, but still very little of WW2 is actually seen in this movie.Seeing Captain America fight was also a little sad as well. There is some slapstick action... slapstick action? Yes there is some. I guess the movie portrays him as being really powerful, but never does it show him being an unstoppable machine. His shield NEVER kills anyone, and if I remember correctly his shield is supposed to be able to cut through people. Violence in this movie is kept to a very minimum. While there are some mildly violent parts, you never see close-up action of Captain America bashing peoples skulls in, or breaking peoples legs and such. You just see him toss people around and him throwing a shield. The gun action is also very weak, and I really expected more guns to be used that WEREN'T laser guns.The final action sequence was OK, but it could've been a lot better (just like the rest of the movie). The biggest issue throughout the entire movie besides there being no WW2 weaponry or sets, is that this movie has crazy messed up physics. I know its a super hero movie and I know that they are using high tech stuff, but still. Those flying helicopter things were entirely silly (and yes I do know that those did really exist but never worked). Also the giant plane when it performs a dive bomb and corrects itself at an 80 degree angle? It would've been torn to pieces.I guess my review sounded pretty picky, and you might ignore what I'm saying because you honestly don't care about accuracy. Which is fine. If you don't care about that kind of stuff then you may love this movie. But to me I can withstand a few inaccuracies in a movie, but when the entire movie is filled with back to back inaccuracies and issues it becomes almost unbearable to watch without talking to commentating.6/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
223,virindra,A bit dull movie.,6,1 August 2011,"I like those superhero movies. I heard a lot of negative ideas about this one; it's all about America. That's fine, I din't mind that. America can be proud of all the superheroes that came out of the comic books.But there's something I do mind. And that is when a superhero movie becomes dull. The movie begins where a man enters a spaceship and asks ""What is this?"" Well, what do you think it is? First half of the movie ain't spectacular. I was waiting for the action. The idea of the funny suit that the Captain wears is not original.The second half of the movie is predictable. Captain America enters the airplane of the red skull and leaves with a smaller plane. You know he has to come back to the bigger plane to beat up the red skull. This movie takes place in 1941 or something like that. I already knew that Nick Fury was in this movie, so Captain America has to enter the future. With knowing all these facts, I had the idea that this movie was built around those ideas for the next superhero movie The Avengers (2012).That's why I could not see this movie as a movie itself, but a warming up for an other movie. Action wasn't that great, yes it's all about America, Hugo Weaving acted just like Ralf Moeller, so why didn't they cast Ralf for the role as the Red Skull? Weaving didn't add much to the movie.It was nice to see Stanley Tucci in a make over. Tommy Lee Jones acted well.",Captain America - The First Avenger
224,Tcarts76,Captain Corny,6,15 September 2012,"I know a lot of people out there still read and collect comic books but I am admittedly not one of those people. I do, however like the newer comic book based Super hero films. I watched Captain America because I had not seen the Avengers yet and wanted to make sure I had all the stories. I felt this one was a giant step backwards for comic book super heros. It was corny and comical and not in a good way. I get what they were going for, and if we lived in the 50's or 60's and this movie came out I would have loved it. That being said, I think they could of made this movie in a much more adult way. It just felt too much like an old comic book. I was hoping it would be a little bit darker and more humanizing. The acting was somewhat Blah, and way too over the top for my tastes, as was the entire movie.It was a 6 for me.",Captain America - The First Avenger
225,Ziya90,"Outstanding production, average movie",4,2 September 2011,"As I see, people like Joe Johnston, believe in him, it seems that Marvel and the producers believed in him too, but why they didn't choose a more successful or a master director for the project? And another question, why they didn't think much about the actor who would play Captain America? I am not sure about the director, but I have had a name in my mind from the beginning and he is Chris Pine! What a coincidence that both of the actors' name is Chris. At this point, I have to say that I like Chris Evans and hearing some news about his reactions towards the negative criticisms saddened me and I know that we, you, whatever, like him too. And I have to say another thing, as you know, Chris Evans played another super hero before in Fantastic Four, Johnny Storm which creates another problem itself, because simply it is a bad idea, but what I am going to say at this point is that he was great as Johnny Storm, the chemistry between Evans and his character was flawless. In Captain America, I couldn't buy him as Captain America and believe me it was a really bad thing! As for direction, the production quality, technical quality, art direction etc. are outstanding and if you say if an entertainment movie is really entertaining, that's enough, that's OK, but don't expect a Byran Singer, Tim Burton or Ang Lee. And the negative hype about the action is partly true. I couldn't see any great action scene here. The action is satisfying, yet standard. It doesn't leave an impression on you. As for the problem with the script, this is may be the biggest problem of the movie, the movie has a very long introduction which is good, but a short and fast development and conclusion. This has a negative effect on action either unfortunately, because you know, if you focus on the origin story too much, then you can't find a lot of time for action and adventure or Captain's powers. Tommy Lee Jones just shines in the movie and with cliché terms, he steals the show in the scenes he appears. There is not any problem with Hugo Weaving and his villain too. May be the only problem is that we can't learn much information about his background story, but it is fine. One of the good sides of the movie, at least for me is that the movie is not a propaganda movie (there is a big difference between heroism/patriotism and propaganda) or it does not try to give the audience some political messages and it is not a populist movie like ""Battle Los Angeles"" for example, I loved this, I appreciated (I don't know is it important for anybody but) As for some details, I know, they had tried to make the costume realistic and they did, which is not a bad thing, but as a person who seriously gives importance to costumes and appearances, I didn't like Captain America's costume very much. Yes, I don't hate campy or kitsch super hero costumes. In conclusion, the adaptation might meet the original work in terms of production and entertainment, but not in terms of spirit.",Captain America - The First Avenger
226,Christopher_Reid,Entertainment.,7,1 August 2011,"This was an enjoyable movie, although rather frustrating at times. It could have been great but doesn't really come close. I have a theory that most movies can be improved by cutting them down, but I don't like censorship. The great ones, however, are best left untouched. This one has so many unnecessary clichés. Men in coats randomly turning knobs, arrogant army-people, weak people stereotypes, relationship stereotypes. But really, the problem is the *cinematic* clichés. The way these sequences and ideas are filmed the same way they've always been made as if it's the only possible way.The movie got more interesting when it poked fun at (or satirised or whatever) 1940's American war propaganda. Still, Superman seems more of the squeaky-clean all-American hero, giving friendly tips and speeches after each rescue. Captain America is not as noble or as much of a leader. He's a good guy who was given powers and who takes ages to figure out he should use them. He never questions the process. A classic quality of a hero is that they never choose power.Chris Evans is likable and convincing I reckon but seriously, all these ""hot"" celebrities playing ""ugly"" or ""weak"" is weird. Guess they didn't have a choice. But Steve Rogers could have been one of the most interesting movie characters ever. The thing is, I think people with his level of dedication and who have been through all those beatings develop a high level of discipline and end up strong. Especially psychologically but also physically. They're kind because they know how it feels to be hurt. Usually, to be really stereotypical, the big strong guys are soft on the inside while the small guys are really edgy and aggressive.This movie basically supports steroids. You know, it's so important that we care about this guy, that we believe he's good-hearted and then they just give him strength and he's like ""cool beans"". Hugo Weaving was cool as the villain, strange accent, a little like Arnie at times but certainly pretty unique and memorable. Shame the role's so one- dimensional. He likes playing mysterious masked/scarred people.As a popcorn accompaniment, this is plenty good. The action wasn't amazing but was consistently good and fun to watch. I liked the overall style, like some forgotten time and place. Also hilarious how they had better technology 70 years ago than now, I didn't realise that. And how love sprouts so rapidly. Plenty to like and plenty to be like ""why?"". His shield was awesome :)",Captain America - The First Avenger

But once our hero becomes Captain America the movie quickly dissipates into a formulaic messThe weak plot is the biggest letdown. The Red Skull plans to wipe out various capital cities across the globe. We are given no explanation as to why, and are left to assume that his motive is simply 'world domination' in the style of Dr Evil. This leads to lots of chasing around ending with a climactic battle between Cpt America and the Red Skull in which his best known comic book adversary is wasted after just a couple of minutes of one on one fighting because.. he drops his magic cube. oops!Other dull aspects of the film include the score, which is one of the most unmemorable I've heard for awhile. I could not recall it even during the movie, and I challenge you to remember a single bar. The audio is repetitive and irritating.. massive overuse of the camera warm up sound ('weeee'), which has now been used everywhere, for every weapon owned by the Red Skull. Customary use of Wilhelm scream, used in spectacularly unimaginative and overt fashion. Very uninspired Red Skulls makeup/cgi looks atrocious by the way and the guy that plays Captain America is thoroughly uncharismatic. This whole film for me was paint by numbers and a money machine for a sequel, kids lunch boxes and the avengers, which I am also expecting to be crap.

234,blacklist-1,"Entertaining superhero movie but it never reached it's full potential, with a few major flaws.",6,27 July 2011,"Captain America: The First Avenger is a superhero movie I was quite looking forward to. But in the end I came out quite disappointed with a movie though entertaining is completely forgettable and didn't reach the real potential it could have with a few major flaws.First though a brief synopsis with the character Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) being deemed unfit for military service, Steve volunteers for a top secret research project that turns him into Captain America, a superhero dedicated to defending America's ideals during WWII. He is aided in stopping a Nazi villain Johann Schmidt/Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who wants to destroy the world. America is helped in stopping Schmidt by Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell),James Buchanan 'Bucky' Barne (Sebastian Stan) Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) and Howard Stark (yes father of Tony Stark from Iron Man).The first hour of the film was the best and most enjoyable with the main characters set up nicely as it was quite interesting. The script though basic did have flashes of wit with some cheesy, but fun comedy. But after an hour and at least eighty minutes into the film just ran out of steam (as another reviewer on here has rightly put it) and I just wanted the film to end. At almost two hours, it was too long. The CGI was impressive, some of the acting was great, mainly Hugo Weaving as Red Scar and I enjoyed Tommy Lee Jones's performance as Colonel Phillips, but I found Hayley Atwell's acting to be mediocre, which is a shame as she showed a bit of spunk in one scene at the start where she punched a male solider in the face for trying to hit on her. Her character just petered out I guess. Chris Evans made a capable enough lead and he had a certain charisma on screen at certain points, which made him watchable. But he was really just boring (though not unlikeable) and quite bland like a lot of the film. He had no spark in him as though he only put in a half-hearted effort.But it wasn't entirely his fault. His character has little character development. Yes we know he wants to do his duty to his country and that is very admirable and be a solider. But an important question which could have been explored and one of the film's major flaws is why? What motivates him to become a solider and ultimately Captain America? This is where the film pales in the shade next to brilliant superhero movies like Batman Begins and Spiderman 1 and 2, where the audience understands why Peter Parker becomes Spiderman and Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, which gives the character more substance, makes them interesting and you can relate to them in some way making you care about them. Captain America dosen't do that. The action as well though enjoyable to an extent had nothing special with it like any great stunts etc. There also wasn't enough of it and felt incredibly rushed as though it just wanted to get to the next scene past the action to the talking. It felt very condensed. In the end though I think this was much better than Thor, Captain America has been overrated. And if they do another standalone sequel of this and when it comes to The Avengers joining of all the marvel comic book superheroes in 2012. They should get a different actor for the part of America as Chris Evans couldn't pull it off. This film entertained me, but it just wasn't enough and didn't do anything for me overall.",Captain America - The First Avenger

2) I thought the acting was really top tier. The film is elevated so much by having ""proper"" actors like Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones
3) Placing the film within the setting of an actual major historic period (World War 2) really added a sense of realism to the film. For example, it felt completely realistic that if America had created a super soldier during World War 2 they would have him going on propaganda tours around the countryNEGATIVES:1) Hugo Weaving's performance as Red Skull was too over the top for me
2) I don't think the relationship between Steve and Bucky ever really lands for me, I never felt like the two of them had a believable best friends relationship

238,BrickNash,Marvel quality all round but sits toward the bottom of the pile!,7,5 April 2013,"First off let's make this clear, Marvel doesn't do bad films, it does Excellent films and pretty good films.Captain America falls into the latter category in that it's no Iron Man or Incredible Hulk but it has it's charms and many of them surprisingly humble.Captain America is a creation of Wartime propaganda. Dripping with the kind of phony patriotic pride that unfortunately makes the rest of the world hate the USA so much, so how could this character be translated to film without reaching for your Michael Bay endorsed Stars and stripes sick bag?There are two types of Americans that I have met. One lot is the intelligent, critical thinking, warm, friendly and funny people that make that land great. The other is the small minded 'patriot' that assumes that the USA is superior to every country in the world and any negative remark about her, even in jest is an act of war.It would be so easy for this film to pander to the second group of people with flags flying everywhere, a shot of the Captain killing Hitler and a note at the end saying this film was based on real events.But no, Captain America plays down the 'we are the greatest' card and opts for a smooth, well played and open minded experience. A 1940's English female manages to knock down a US soldier with one punch, this is the sort of humble non defensive attitude that makes the film shine.Evans is great as the Captain. Encompassing that All American boy look with plenty of heart in his performance and enough bravery as to not be OTT but to actually make you believe this man would take a bullet for you in combat!The film looks sumptuous. The photography and CGI are lush and smooth as you'd come to expect from Marvel and the film has more than enough 'boy' style comic book chases, fights and rescues to keep everyone happy although the film does feature an almost identical rip off of the mountain train scene from the Playstation 3 game Uncharted 2: Among Thieves but it's done well although clearly too close to be a coincidence.All this praise comes at a price though for there are flaws. For all the fantastic visuals and solid performances it really comes down to this.....Captain America just isn't a very interesting superhero. He's a slightly enhanced human, a bit faster and a bit stronger than most but still, one gunshot and it's curtains. Perhaps if his skin was updated to be knife or bullet proof (but maybe still hurt like hell when shot or stabbed) it would make him more larger than life but as he is he's an obtainable character, in that if you worked your arse off in the gym you could probably come close to that. I don't like that. I like my superhero's to be super and absurdly fantastic and Captain America is just too ordinary to make anyone go ""WOW!""The boyhood comic scenario's of raid and rescue are woefully out of date although they are handled with great style in the film and Hugo Weaving's Red Skull makeup reeks of Skeletor circa 1987 and it's a shame that more couldn't have been done to it. Weaving's performance, as usual, is excellent and he is a really good bad guy.Overall a genuinely entertaining film with a really likable main character thanks to Evans which intelligently avoids the ""'murica"" card and was handled with a sense of great style and grace but ultimately loses out on points for just being too everyday a hero.",Captain America - The First Avenger
239,tapio_hietamaki,A childish perspective into WWII,4,1 March 2013,"Not counting Edward Norton's insignificant The Incredible Hulk, this might be the worst of the Avenger films. Even Thor with its laughable family melodrama and video game CGI made a bigger impact than this superhero film set in World War II.Captain America is an actor-turned-supersoldier who must face an evil Nazi scientist, hamfully hilariously played by Hugo Weaving. The villains remind me of Raiders of the Lost Ark, though in this film the evil Red Skull (who literally tears his face off halfway through the film to reveal a red skull underneath) turns on his Nazi supervisors and starts a freelancing world domination enterprise, which made me wonder why the filmmakers had to distance this trivial backwood fight even more from the actual war. I guess the answer is in the comics.The most memorable scene was without a doubt the flashback with a kaleidoscope vision of a dozen grinning Hugo Weavings.",Captain America - The First Avenger
240,Ar_Pharazon_the_golden,"Not for the reasons you may think, but not very good",6,29 April 2016,"Let's start by admitting that when you decide to watch a film about a hero called Captain America, you ought to expect both the corny and the borderline ridiculous.Surprisingly, 'Muricanism is not much of a problem with the film. It has potential: a superhero film in a period setting with the ever reliable Hugo Weaving as a Nazi villain is not a bad way to start. Buuuuuut....whereas Captain America as a character proves quite less propagandistic than expected, the story itself doesn't avoid silliness. World War 2 is fought by Americans with a couple of ""ethnically diverse"" characters assisting them...well, more or less, as what we see is not exactly WWII but something like an American infiltration on European soil exclusively for the purpose of hunting down the Hydra project. The rest of the war isn't there. The villain has a 24th century airplane but 1937 viewing screens (ok, that was clearly on purpose, but seemed a rather pointless and silly curiosity). The US army has (seemingly) non-segregated black soldiers and women officers - although sure, this isn't really the place to confront serious issues.But more to the point, the plot has some 80's action films' solutions. A battalion of bad guys with superguns use them as clubs. A guy who invades a Nazi camp with a huge American shield on his back and just walks around unnoticed freeing prisoners without being armed. A gun that atomizes people but can't scratch a shield (ok, that's a problem with the comic, not the film). The shield attracts every shot fired from a thousand people. A car chases a plane and someone jumps aboard it. I mean, yeah, I know, it's a Marvel film. But then why do I find it more believable when Bruce Willis does it? A scheme to catch the bad guy that relies entirely on Captain America getting captured but not being killed on sight. Because.....well, let's just hope they won't kill him and then we'll just jump through the window..why didn't we do that from the beginning? And last but not least, the hero crashes the plane in the Arctic. For no obvious reason, but that's not what I am getting at. Though he could easily fly the smaller plane 5 minutes before (without any training) and ummm, re-insert it in the mothership, but now he's out of skills. The plane has by the way reached the Arctic after taking off from the Alps an hour or less before. And is headed straight for...New York? Fast and strange route. I don't know. That last part made no sense.",Captain America - The First Avenger
241,MovieBuff11732,Best Marvel Movie,9,27 October 2018,Captain America The First Avenger is about Steve Rogers trying to get into the army. He then is disliked by everybody but one doctor. He makes a machine to make Steve big a strong and then Steve is super famous. He also wants to help the army stop Hydra.This film was amazing. The time that this happened was really fitting. It showed how he became Captain America. The only thing that annoyed me is how futuristic this movie was. The stone made sense but the guns were just stupid. They even looked bad. The acting was great. The casting person did a great job. They hired some of the best actors. The scenery in this movie was also really great. The choices for where they filmed were top notch.Captain America The First Avenger is a great movie. The best Marvel movie to me.,Captain America - The First Avenger
242,Jonathon_Natsis,Marvel's best outing since Iron Man.,7,31 July 2011,"In between the lacklustre Hulk and average Thor, Marvel Studios released Iron Man, a thoroughly enjoyable superhero film driven by perfect casting, tight pacing and well-scripted characters (well, about as good as they can get for blockbusters anyway). I would consider Captain America, the last film to round out the team of Avengers, on par with Iron Man, albeit for different reasons.Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a wimpy-looking young man with the heart of a lion. Indeed, the only attribute keeping him from the military service he so desperately wishes to partake in is his physical presence. Enter Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) and Doctor Erskine (Stanley Tucci), who arrange to have Rogers injected with a serum that gives him speed and strength beyond that of any normal human. Having become the poster boy for the Allies in the midst of World War II, the Cap is tasked with thwarting Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), an ambitious Nazi who has cut ties with Hitler and formed his own army of hi-tech super soldiers. The acting is generally without fault across the board. Rogers goes through the motions, letting his stunts speak louder than his words. Weaving (Australia's second-favourite son, naturally wedged between Geoffrey Rush and Hugh Jackman) seems to have villainous performances down to a tee by now, and an impressive German accent to boot. Tommy Lee Jones has fun hamming it up playing someone who is basically a caricature of Tommy Lee Jones, and Tucci also does justice to his small role as the good doctor. Speaking of role sizes, I was only expecting a cameo appearance from Howard Stark (that's right, Tony's dad) but he goes on to become an almost omnipresent character. More importantly, I was pleased to see he wasn't lazily characterised as a carbon copy of his son. Howard is more a professional than a playboy, and the right decision was made in giving him a subtler demeanour, if for no other reason than the pleasure of seeing something different.The film does a good job of immersing the viewer, which is crucial due to the unusual plot. At the crux, it's still a matter of 'you either buy the story or you don't', but Captain America successfully suspends disbelief wherever necessary, and never forgets what kind of movie it is. It puts a limit on the self-serving American patriotism I expected going in, but in keeping with most other Marvel films, it still sneaks in the odd cheesy one-liner and/or joke. Also in keeping with most other Marvel films, many of these wisecracks fall flat, although some are admittedly saved by the deadpan, sarcastic delivery of Lee Jones' no- nonsense Colonel.Perhaps the only major criticism of the film is a couple of inconsistencies: one to do with the plot and the other related to a character. As one friend pointed out, it seems that the entire war effort has become focused solely on Schmidt's army, and that his defeat will signal the end of the war. Meanwhile Hitler is apparently free to do as he pleases. As for the latter, I find it highly unlikely that a woman would find herself so high up the ranks of the military given the time period. I understand she exists solely to accommodate the romantic subplot, but a career change should have been in order. Regardless of her role in the comics (of which I am not familiar with), there is certainly no crime against taking some slight poetic license for the sake of a better outcome.Overall, though, a more-than-satisfactory effort is made, en route to a good score out of ten. The clincher for me was, despite the film's relatively insignificant shortcomings, the fact that I rather enjoyed the experience. Time just seemed to fly by, which I'm certain was the primary intention of director Joe Johnston in the first place.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

The origins of Captain Rogers are well thought out and make for an interesting first act. Although you need to look past the weird voice/body conflict of Chris Evans (who does become a handsome buff man immediately after). The Red Skull is a worthy adversary of Captain America and is exactly the type of villain you would expect for the time period. Peggy is a very likable supporting actress till the end and along with Bucky together give Steve humanity and make him more than just a soldier for America but also for himself and his friends as well. This also seems like one of the best integrated MCU films because of Dominic Cooper's portrayal of a young Howard Stark, the father of the fan favorite Tony Stark.",Captain America - The First Avenger
244,ThreeGuysOneMovie,a good old fashioned summer time fun movie,8,26 May 2012,"a good old fashioned summer time fun movie. This film is probably not going to win any Oscars or change cinema as we know it. However, it's a good film to grab some popcorn and take your kids to. In hindsight the film sort of reminded me of seeing the Indiana Jones films when I was little.Considering it was based on a comic book character from the 1940's I thought it was pretty fresh looking. The visual style to me was reminiscent of the film Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. I also enjoyed how they showed the creation of Hydra in the film.

245,caseynicholson,A Daring Film by Marvel that is True to the Star Spangled Sentinel's Story,8,15 March 2015,"Full Disclosure: Captain America is my all time favorite super hero. I'm not quite sure that I can answer why that's the case, but what I know for sure is that I grew up reading Cap on a monthly basis, and collected everything I could find that was Captain America related. Maybe it was because I'm a child of the 80's and blind patriotism was in fashion back then. Maybe it was because I'm from a small town that was home to a U.S. President, meaning that the American flag lined the streets prominently year round in my neighborhood long before 9/11. Or maybe it's just simply because Captain America is such a cool character, period. All I know is that this is my childhood favorite, so I can't help but be biased toward this film.Another quick word about that before moving on to the film itself. What a non-comics audience needs to understand about Captain America is that historically he's been presented as not just a guy who happens to be an America-themed superhero. Any character with any mindset could dress up in a flag costume and claim to represent America. But that's not what makes Cap the man that he is.Captain America is a great superhero because he is the man that Americans should strive to be. He's a good man through and through--always aboveboard, always venerable. His character is not representative of a ""my country, right or wrong"" mentality, but rather his character is something that is more pure than any politics or government. He's the paragon of nobility. And it's only because of that that the whole ""Captain America"" thing works. Were Steve Rogers anything less than the personification of a noble, fair minded and just individual, Captain America wouldn't be the hero that I love. But it's those admirable character traits that make him worthy of respect, so that even those of us who take issue with our country from time to time can still look up to Cap as our hero of choice. Wendell Berry has a poem in which he talks about how to live a righteous, noble life, and the poem features a line that says, ""Denounce the government and embrace the flag. Hope to live in that free republic for which it stands."" By that, I think Berry means to believe in and work for an America that embraces and lives up to its mythical ethos that is so often diluted by reality.At any rate, my point is that Captain America is the embodiment of that precept. He lives the myth, even as he is the myth itself. His character is noble and just first, and that's what makes him a legitimately cool character. It's not a blind patriotism--it's a loyalty to working to make our country what it's meant to be. That's what makes Cap my favorite superhero.All that said, the reason I like this movie is that Marvel portrayed that central persona of Cap very well in this movie, along with being daring enough to tell the Captain America story in a way that was very fair to his actual origin story. Comics fans know that Captain America is one of Marvel's first comic book heroes, created during World War Two during the Golden Age of comics--a good twenty years before other heroes in the Marvel stable like Spider-Man, Hulk, and the Fantastic Four would make their debut. Since the 1960's, Cap has been the man with two origin stories--the story of the weakling who signed up for a super soldier program in WWII, and the man who was left for dead floating in the ocean after an airplane battle in that war and who ended up frozen in suspended animation before being resuscitated by the likes of the Avengers in the 1960's. Thus, Cap has always been the Golden Age Sentinel of Liberty, along with a Silver Age hero that was revived to become an even more important figure in the emerging Marvel Universe than he had been twenty years before hand when Marvel (then Timely Comics) was really just coming up with a standalone character that could participate in the ongoing war effort--and capitalize off of it, at that.All that said, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" does a great job telling this intricate origin story and bringing the mythology of Captain America into the 21st Century for a new generation of fans that are just discovering Cap for the first time. The World War II origin, the battles with the Red Skull, the resuscitation decades after the fact--it all comes to life brilliantly in this film. And, importantly, it's done in a way that introduces Cap to the rest of the Marvel Universe, all while expanding on its characters and background stories.I would, however, stop short of giving this film perfect ratings. The movie is outstanding, but it does seem to be missing something somewhere along the way. It's hard to put one's finger on it, but somehow, even though I love this movie and think that it's outstanding in its own right, I don't get the same sense of endearment from watching ""The First Avenger"" that I get from watching, say, the first ""Iron Man"". That may all boil down to Robert Downey, Jr.'s strong performance as Tony Stark vs. a strong but relatively mediocre performance from Chris Evans. Or it may be due to the fact that parts of the movie were a bit contrived and hokey (the whole singing to raise money for war bonds thing). Whatever the case, this film may not be my favorite movie from the MCU, despite Cap being my favorite character. But it's still a strong movie just the same. I give it 8/10 stars.",Captain America - The First Avenger
246,hoernkeem,"Captain America: The First Avenger review(2011, Joe Johnston) Great origin story that gives Evans a career defining role and makes Cap feel vital",8,22 April 2021,"Captain America: The First Avenger (2011, Joe Johnston)
With this movie dropping in July of 2011 the MCU finally gets the last of the major players on the board in their own film prior to 2012's Avengers team up extravaganza that would really cement the MCU as a force to be reckoned with. I was extremely interested to see if this film could succeed. I was never a very big Captain America comics guy, and I couldn't help but wonder in this day and age if you could reintroduce a character like Steve Rogers/Captain America and not make him seem too archaic and out of touch with modern society. Little did I know that Cap's brand of just genuine good guy patriotism was exactly what this world needed and winds up playing as an excellent counterpoint to the likes of Tony Stark and Thor. This is another of the MCU films that, it seems to me, like many people aren't very high on and I really don't know why. I found this a great film and an immensely enjoyable origin story. It does lack a bit in huge action set pieces but makes up for it in some good old fashioned story telling and it combines super hero movie elements along with war movie elements and the Nazi treasure hunting angle gives it a bit of an Indiana Jones vibe as well.The film, like most Marvel films, is impeccably cast especially in the revelation of Chris Evans as Steve Rogers. He just IS Captain America much like Hemsworth is Thor and RDJ is Tony Stark. These are seminal roles that these guys were all born to play. The rest of the cast is wonderful too with Hugo Weaving playing the villainous Red Skull, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and Sebastian Stan as Bucky. This is solidly an origin as we start with a scrawny Steve Rogers trying desperately to join the army amidst the chaos of WWII. He has the heart of a warrior, but unfortunately a very feeble frame. They did an excellent job of making dinky emaciated Chris Evans look believable which makes it all the more jarring when we see Evans bulked up physique after the super soldier serum super 'roids him up. Rogers catches the eye of a Dr. Erskine who offers Rogers a chance at a super soldier program. While scrawnier than every other participant he is clearly the most diligent and non self serving and intelligent in a very humble, straight forward way. Throw the kid into a Stark Industries contraption and out emerges the hunky Steve Rogers we all know and love. Nice to see Howard Stark pop up here too just interweaving those MCU threads all the more deeply. Meanwhile the Nazi/Hydra villain Johann Schmidt and his henchman Dr. Zola have uncovered the Tesseract which is an arcane magic-like artifact they use to create numerous devastating weapons. Unbeknownst to us at the time but this is the first MCU appearance of an Infinity Stone which would come to be very important going forward. Cap eventually makes his way to Europe and with a ragtag collection of soldiers sets out to foil Schmidt aka Red Skull although Rogers loses best friend Bucky along the way in a death scene that is very reminiscent of the comics and would also be very important for the future of Captain America and the MCU. The reveal of the Red Skull is quite cool to behold as well. The love story that develops between Peggy and Steve is also one of the sweetest and most enduring of the entire MCU. Cap eventually foils Skull as he is flying an aircraft on a mission to destroy NYC, but unfortunately Rogers is forced to ditch the plane he is flying in the ocean. He winds up being encased in ice and is basically found and brought back to life in the modern day ready for the Avengers and the next mission although the loss of Peggy to the tides of time is heartbreaking.This film put the last pillar in place to really form the core of what would become the Avengers. Marvel pulled this off amazingly as all these films and all these characters needed to work in order for this entire endeavor to come together. This film solidly stands on its own as a great origin story, but clearly this is a stepping stone to larger things and in fact the next two Captain America films would basically serve as mini Avengers films in their own right. This film solidly plants the flag that Captain America, Steve Rogers and Chris Evans are integral parts of this world moving forward, and I am gleefully onboard for all the excellence to come.Eric's Grade: B+",Captain America - The First Avenger

248,craig-hopton,Disappointing,5,24 August 2015,"A disappointment in the main. Captain America made an unconvincing superhero to me. I'm not sure if it's the scripting, the acting or the directing that's to blame - possibly all three.He is basically a scrawny American picked by the army because of his good moral nature and injected with serum to make him stronger. The serum works but he isn't exactly Superman - maybe two or three times as fast and strong as other soldiers. Fair enough you might think - until he singlehandedly frees 400 prisoners from behind enemy lines. Something doesn't add up.He's then given a shield that is quote 'stronger than steel' - not exactly revolutionary. But it then turns out this shield can withstand any blast of any kind without suffering a dent. It just feels incongruous. Is this guy just a soldier- plus or is he an indestructible superhero?The action scenes themselves mostly feel rushed. There is lots (and lots) of build- up but then when Captain America gets his powers there's an action montage that lasts only a minute or two.There is a decent ensemble cast including Tommy Lees Jones, Hugo Weaving and Samuel L Jackson. They're all OK but no more. Chris Evans who plays Captain America himself is pretty dull.It's just about watchable but overall it's a let down.",Captain America - The First Avenger
249,C22Man,Marvel's middle of the road film,4,21 November 2015,"With the success of Iron Man it made sense that another Marvel heavyweight in Captain America should come to the big screen and the result is a flawed but decent enough old school action piece. Joe Johnston had shown ability to handle highly stylised films in the past and Chris Evans had experience in the comic book field with the underwhelming Fantastic Four films. What we end up getting is a film that manages to put its pulp roots to good use and makes the well- worn underdog story work okay because of how it uses the basic elements. It definitely stutters throughout, but it's a nice to have another comic book film that knows how to provide plenty of adventure.Story: Set during WW2, a frail man named Steve Rogers continually fails to make the army grade until he is given the chance via a serum that enhances all of his abilities. Now involved as the patriot hero Captain America, he goes after a Nazi organisation named Hydra which is headed by Johann Schmidt who has used the same serum as Rogers. The plot is relatively straight-forward as we see Rogers grow from a plucky underdog to the defender of America and even the villains plan is simply to cause havoc with advanced weaponry. The issue is that this is a story that has been so many times that it is entirely predictable and though the film does it well, it doesn't do it exceptionally well and doesn't really add anything new onto the formula.Hero: Chris Evans does a surprisingly fantastic job as the titular hero and is probably the best thing here. He perfectly portrays Rogers as upbeat and courageous, but with a kind innocence in that he just wants to help out. It's a character that is easy to get behind and care about, while Evans also convinces in the suit and handles all areas of the character effectively despite his lack of an arc.Villains: Hugo Weaving does a convincing job as the devious Schmidt, but is let down by no character development. Weaving makes you believe the guy is evil and his expressions alone are great, yet we learn next to nothing about his past or true intentions and his grand scheme is overly convoluted. He simply becomes a very boring obstacle as the film goes on. The Nazi soldiers are pretty much black Stormtroopers and Toby Jones gets little to do as Schmidt's biochemist.Support: Hayley Atwell is very good despite her lack of development as Peggy Carter. She manages to get across the characters sweet demeanour, handles the dramatic moments well and she has excellent chemistry with Evans, but she certainly deserved more time devoted to her. Tommy Lee Jones did what he does best as the sardonic and grouchy colonel, whilst managing to get a few laughs throughout. Dominic Cooper cut a suave and effectively dashing figure as Howard Stark. Stanley Tucci is good fun as the German scientist who recruits Rogers and provides some good laughs, it's a shame he isn't involved for long. Sebastian Stan is just okay as Rogers' best friend. Action: The action scenes are done more in a classic sense. There are plenty of large scale army battles and mass gun fights to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Captain America himself has an impressive fighting style and we get to see him do many things that only humans can dream of, though he does manage to avoid injury a few too many times. The final confrontation with Schmidt is a bit of a let-down and doesn't have the intensity that was needed, but the climax is satisfying enough.Music: Alan Silvestri provides a very forgettable score. I honestly cannot remember any compositions that stood out, the music doesn't build up the fight scenes and the main theme itself is totally unmemorable. It just feels like a typical run of the mill action score and has none of the required bombast for such a film.Production: Visually the film is something of a mixed bag. Johnston shoots the action well enough and there is an atmosphere to certain scenes that works. Everything seems highly stylised during the 1940's and that does lend a comic book feel to proceedings, but then things like the advanced technology are never explained properly even if it will later tie into some of the other Marvel films. The costumes and sets were all very good in making you believe that it was a different era. Yet it does suffer badly from some really blurry frames and some downright weird editing, there were some scenes that literally cut away out of nowhere which was very jarring. This leads to another big issue, the CGI. This film has some truly awful CGI and it just completely takes you out of what is taking place on screen when it pops up. As a result many of the large scale sequences or action pieces just didn't have any weight behind them.Conclusion: So Captain America is an enjoyable adventure yarn, but it is a very flawed film and is just downright dull in certain areas. It has its moments with some impressive spectacle, a solid cast and Chris Evans is impressive as the Captain. However it is weak in too many areas to be thought too highly of as it has an overdone storyline, a bland villain, ropey CGI and some off-putting direction. Many of the elements where in place here for something great and though some of them pay off, many of them fall flat. As far as the Marvel films are concerned this is slap bang in the middle, it's a film which is easy to enjoy but equally as easy to forget.",Captain America - The First Avenger

251,hypestyle,Captain America has star spangled Action,9,11 August 2011,"Captain America has Star Spangled ActionCaptain America: The First Avenger is the first major motion picture based on the venerable Marvel Comics superhero character that first debuted in print over 70 years ago. Since then, there have been largely forgettable cross-media interpretations, including a 1940s movie serial and an aborted attempt at a television series in the late 70s that left two television films in its wake. With the power of Marvel Studios (now wholly owned by Disney and partnering with Paramount Films for distribution), Marvel attempts to return the luster to its onetime flagship hero that matches his mighty shield. Here, Chris Evans (Fantastic Four, Cellular) plays heroic shrimp Steve Rogers, who in 1942 wants to enlist in the military but is determined to be a 4-F. Still, the little guy has heart, as displayed when he keeps confronting local bully. His gumption impresses military scientist Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) and gruff Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones). They put him through the paces of boot camp, and finally reveal that he's the perfect test subject for their 'super soldier serum'—if it works (this shouldn't be a spoiler) then Steve's musculature and reflexes will be boosted to virtual perfection. Alas, the experiment's aftermath has a tragic end, which poises newly buff Steve to be the sole super-soldier for the Allied Forces—thus, 'Captain America' is born. Soon, he is pitted against the nefarious Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), aka the Red Skull—an ambitious Nazi scientist who heads up 'Hydra', a super-science-weapons division of the Nazi army. Schmidt searches for an ancient artifact of power, called the 'tesseract', allegedly giving its wielder the power of the Nordic gods themselves. Heady stuff, this. The film's remaining supporting cast is capable, including Sebastian Stan as Cap's best friend Bucky Barnes and Hayley Atwell as British agent (and nominal love interest) Peggy Carter. The script, credited to Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, features an anti-ironic sensibility here, being fairly straightforward in its depiction of patriotism and earnest heroism as exemplified by Cap. This could have easily diverted into self-satire or camp, but the filmmakers, including director Joe Johnston (Jurassic Park 3, the Rocketeer), wisely avoid this. Presumably to keep its comic-book-reality credentials intact, the movie plays fast and loose with the fictional history it represents (the Red Skull's Hydra troops feature no swastika iconography, and Cap's Howling Commandos team is racially integrated without a blink.) Still, the period designs are convincing enough, including a nod to Frankenstein with the Super Soldier laboratory. Captain America is poised to be the first in a franchise of solo adventures as well as the introduction to the character's featured role in next year's The Avengers. Time will tell whether Cap regains his former fan-favorite glory: his stalwart shtick may seem quaint compared to brooding avengers like Batman and Wolverine. Still, the film gets enough right to stand out from the crowd and in a time of political contention provides plenty of flag-friendly good will.",Captain America - The First Avenger

253,thepriceofpayne,A Patriotic Powerhouse,8,15 April 2018,"Okay I personally love this film. The fifth installment in Marvel's Cinematic Universe introduces us to The Centinal Of Liberty himself Captain America, and in a very good way at that. The visual effects aren't anything truly impressive (except for putting Chris Evans head on someone else's body) but they are so stylized, they look very beautiful and very 40's esque. Joe Johnston (Director of Jumanji and The Rocketeer) really knew what he was doing, he gave us the classic good versus evil story that didn't really feel fresh, but it felt needed and really good to watch. Chris Evans's performance is great! He plays the man many people strive to be, and does so in a great way. He gave us the true American hero. Weaving's Red Skull is very menacing and with great makeup to match, and Hayley Atwell's strong willed Agent Peggy Carter was magnificent. A great film, with true American Spirit.",Captain America - The First Avenger
254,toqtaqiya2,"Eye-catching sets, a highly watchable cast, and a brisk action-packed story make this film a treat.",8,24 December 2012,"The film that could have been one of the worst by Marvel Studios instead turned out to be one of the best. Captain America: The First Avenger gets everything right, but the studio hasn't really released a bad film yet. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers is pretty much perfect here. He's believable as someone who goes through a big transformation, but more importantly he's believable as a righteous sickly young man who wants to serve his country. He's transformed into the super soldier Captain America, and he gets a good-looking costume which looks perfect for its era. The 1940s in this film is an optimistic retro-futuristic time that's important in world history. Director Joe Johnston (The Rocketeer, Jumanji) captured that era very well. The talented supporting cast includes Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan, Dominic Cooper and Stanley Tucci. Jones is great as usual in the role of Colonel Chester Phillips. Tucci gives an interesting performance as the deeply humanistic Dr. Abraham Erskine. And Atwell as the tough Peggy Carter looks just like one of those pin-up girls of the 1940s. Captain America: The First Avenger is an action-packed summer blockbuster, so there isn't a dull moment. One of the highlights is a motorcycle chase reminiscent of the one in Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade (1989). But there's still a good deal of drama, and the film takes an honest look at its hero. Even though the Nazis, or more precisely the terrorist organization HYDRA, have things like laser weapons this still seems perfectly believable. Some people might interpret the film as a piece of American propaganda, but I don't care because it's an exuberant great-looking superhero film. For some reason Captain America has always been one of my favorite superheroes (maybe it's the cool costume and shield), and I'm glad that now there's finally a good film about him. In conclusion, Johnston and cinematographer Shelly Johnson crafted a satisfying colorful adventure film. I recommend seeing it.",Captain America - The First Avenger
255,JPfanatic93,Great comic book fun!,8,23 September 2013,"The last of the single Avengers films, though ironically the 'Living Legend' is the oldest Marvel comic book character of the bunch. Applying a delicious comic-y retro visual style to the Second World War and the introduction of the super soldier, the adventures of the 'First Avenger' resemble their drawn counterparts the most, making for a very fun action film. Eager to sign up with the armed forces during WW II, brave but physically feeble Steve Rogers (Chris Evans, who previously played another Marvel character, the Human Torch, in Fox's Fantastic Four) continues to be rejected for service. However, his strength of will and general boldness eventually make him a good candidate for a secret super soldier project, which turns him into an almost superhuman character, physical and sensory abilities all functioning at peak efficiency. Dubbed Captain America, Steve is initially used only for propaganda performances, but after pulling off a heroic rescue mission deemed near suicide, allied command realizes he's of most use at the front lines, where he soon gets on the radar of the Red Skull (another great villain on Hugo Weaving's resumé), the leader of a covert Nazi organization called Hydra, which dabbles both in the scientific and the supernatural. Meanwhile, Steve also has a hard time finding time for romance with feisty army dame Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). If you overlook the blatantly patriotic American overtones and you don't mind the fact Captain America's battles look nothing like the actual WW II due to their use of near steam punk levels of science (partially courtesy of the Thor influence, continuing to successfully set up a larger, shared Marvel cinematic universe) and the presence of the somewhat silly, overly politically correct, ethnically diverse Howling Commandos (Wah-Hooo!), you're in for one awesome roller-coaster of a semi-superhero action flick. Plus impressive visual effects, including making a tall, muscular man look short and skinny (yes, those were actually Chris Evans' real muscles, but he never looked like that wimpy little guy).",Captain America - The First Avenger

259,martinpersson97,Not that great for Cap's first appearance,5,19 August 2021,"Captain America is one of the most iconic heroes in Marvel, both comic books and movies - in his initial MCU movie appearance, though, it doesn't impress that much.Working as an origin story to not just its titular hero, but to the MCU as a whole, it does serve its purpose in introducing the Tesseract, connecting to Iron Man, Thor and The Incredible Hulk and setting up The Avengers. But as a story, it falls rather short.Speaking of falling short, if you can fathom my pun - is the ridiculus effects in which they try to CGI Chris Evans' head upon a small boy's shoulders. Out of all the incredible effects in the MCU, this just looks embarrasing and forced in terms of sendings its message across.The movie in itself, is not awful, but pretty mediocre. The effects, aside from the one mentioned above, are all pretty spectacular and the actors do a good job, except for Hugo Weaving's over the top interpretation of Red Skull. I like him very well as an actor, but I am glad he was replaced in the sequels, he just didn't work too well here.Overall, it's a rather unimpressive movie, but a decent introduction to a lot of great concepts.",Captain America - The First Avenger

261,julian-mumford,Old fashioned swashbuckling fun in the Indiana Jones style,7,6 December 2011,"Another Marvel superhero, another origin story although this time we have a superhero with very few powers other than being able to jump higher, bash people harder and a 1941 period setting.Equipped with a nifty USA emblazoned shield, Captain America (CA) was always going to be the hardest sell to cynical audiences not weaned on 1940 derring do cartoon strips. The clean cut hero with no flaws and a good heart is somewhat at odds with the many complicated, anti-heroes that audiences have now embraced.Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a weedy guy, stood behind a lamp post you might not see him at all. His is brave though, throwing himself on a grenade to protect his unit buddies and desperate to go fight the Nazi's in WW2. His buddy Barnes (Stan) has already enlisted but Rogers keeps receiving a ""4F"" rejected due to poor health from the medical board, despite numerous attempts using false addresses.Help comes in the form of Dr Erskine (Tucci) recruiting for ""Project Rebirth"", a plan to create super-soldiers using the usual powers you could not possibly imagine. Being the chosen one, Rogers turns into ""Captain America"" replete with ripped body, rather dodgy uniform, not yet the right shield and the letter ""A"" on his helmet.So far, not that different to many other similar movies. However, we do have the best movie bad guys, no shades of grey here, Nazi's and not just ordinary soldiers but Uber Nazi's. The Hydra research unit, headed by Schmidt/Red Skull (Weaving), a man who despite working directly for Hitler, still believes there is wiggle room to be more extreme.Due to circumstances, Rogers endures a lengthy period where he is tasked with selling war bonds rather than socking it to the bad guys. Fortunately, it is not long before he is unleashed with his rag tag self assembled squad, onto the unsuspecting Hydra unit. Stevens unit commander Colonel Phillips (Lee-Jones), offering support, great one liners and dressing down's in equal measure.Rogers is designed as a throwback, a decent man suddenly entrusted with strengths and power that amplifies everything that is inherently good and decent about him. In direct contrast to Schmidt, whose dastardly plans and world domination are stretched to the evil limit, following the application of the unimaginable power source.Unquestionably Uber Nazi's are the coolest villains, with the best gadgets, planes, cars and submarines which can be disintegrated with ray guns, shot and blown apart with little chance of offending a world wide audience. Dr Arnim Zola (Toby Jones), as a Nazi Scientist ticks all stereotype boxes without breaking sweat, you almost expect a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" coat hanger moment to appear at any moment.Evans does not get much opportunity to act but does well enough with what he is given, special effect techniques cleverly displaying him as a man 60 kg dripping wet, then allowing his transformation into the real buff super-soldier, Evans post gym, with few technical hitches.The film is almost old fashioned in it's action scenes, perhaps reminiscent of director Joe Johnson's ""The Rocketeer"" in style and content. Rogers gets a sort of girlfriend, in the shape of Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) whether CA gets even near first base is debatable. Dammit, there is a world to save after all.This is the final piece in the Marvel ""Avengers"" puzzle, the new film due in 2012 incorporating all of the Marvel characters under ""S.H.I.E.L.D"" (Jackson), all of which have been carefully introduced to audiences over the last few years. Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) destined to be Iron Man's father, also gets a look in as mad inventor/billionaire, again linking the intertwining stories together.The studio must surely be pleased at the reception received even for it's ""lesser"" characters, with respectable box office returns for both ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"".Summary Old fashioned swashbuckling fun in the Indiana Jones style, with a straight as an arrow good guy, pantomime villains and exciting well executed state of the art action sequences.Fantastic Nazi villain lairs, awesome B-Wing bombers and enormous Nazi limousines, plenty of explosions and a reasonable story to hang all the action on.What more could one want from a summer superhero movie?http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",Captain America - The First Avenger
262,barbagvido,Warming up for The Avengers,7,28 June 2016,"Captain America:The First Avenger is the fifth movie in the MCU franchise and it's a bridge to the final movie in Phase One of MCU, the one five movies have been building up to, The Avengers.This movie is slightly above average, but it's still nothing remarkable. It's fun, it's very good looking and they nailed the retro feeling. The casting of the hero is perfect once again and Chris Evans plays the role very believable and at the beginning of the movie, when Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America is still all tiny and skinny, I couldn't believe it. It looked so realistic and then suddenly he's huge, but it looked so believable I didn't suspect it for a second. Hugo Weaving is as good as he is in any other villain role and we all know he plays those quite often. And there is also a slight connection to Thor, the Tesseract. And it all just builds up to The Avengers and this movie is probably ignored by many because by that moment people just wanted the avengers to assemble already. And also, one more thing about this movie is that if you're not familiar with the comics, there is a big plot twist waiting for you at the end.This movie is fine, it doesn't really have much flaws in my opinion, but it's just nothing impressive really. I don't even have much to talk about this one, so I guess that proves it.",Captain America - The First Avenger
263,piratecannon,"I'm Giving Her All She's Got, Captain!",3,26 December 2012,"As I've noted in other criticisms of comic-book themed feature films, superheroes have got it rough these days. With competition from the likes of The Dark Knight and Iron Man, it's not easy to distinguish oneself as a stand alone enterprise that paves its own way in the world of masks, capes and super-human abilities.That being said, it should come as no surprise that Captain America was an inevitability. With the recent success of Thor (and a variety of other films that aim to tie together The Avengers series into one ""super"" movie), it was only a matter of time before we were thrust back to World War II and the exploits of the runt-turned-muscle-man protagonist that wields a shield made of the rarest metal on Earth (I forget the name, but, honestly, does it really matter?).Because of the pro-democracy propaganda inherent in the story, I initially identified Captain America as a film with a lot of promise. Early on, the movie makes good on that potential. There are some noteworthy instances that find our newly-fashioned American savior being reduced to a gaudy sideshow whose sole purpose is to sell war bonds. When this sort of real world commentary is effectively interwoven into the story is when Captain America tends to work best. In these instances, there's the sense that the writers have shirked any desire to follow the stereotypical comic book pastiche and have aimed for something much deeper (and, perhaps, more important).Unfortunately, these moments are few and far between. After the first half hour Captain America digresses into an explosion-heavy shoot-em-up that finds Hugo Weaving assuming the role of a ridiculously over-the-top Nazi scientist who has inexplicably transformed into a power-hungry mutant with a red face (and no nose). Things go from barely-likable-B- movie to unbearable garbage in about 2.5 seconds, and the conclusion is equally as tedious, resulting in more eye-rolling than any film I can remember in recent memory. What's especially nauseating about all of this is watching an actor with the chops of Tommy Lee Jones bumble around a CGI-laden environment with utter indifference.For one reason or another, a lot of people seemed to be saying ""O' Captain, My Captain'"" upon the movie's theatrical release. I'm not sure why that is, as the whole production winds up being little more than a numbingly stupid action flick. In the end, it's the missed opportunities regarding the historical implications of a character like Captain America that sting the most.",Captain America - The First Avenger
264,Morejambo54,Solid movie,7,5 April 2021,"I separate this movie into to parts, the first and second half. The first being my personal favourite of the two with the most character development, main plot of the story and best dialogue. The second half being straight and fun action. The character that is Steve Rogers is by far the highlight of the movie, he is so courageous despite all his many flaws and continues to overcome his seemingly limitless barriers. It is wonderful to watch how he uses his new strength to fight his enemies and help his allies. Speaking of his enemies, red skull isn't portrayed extremely well, his is shown as a crazed man with a god complex, no other development or back story is given to the character, you could argue that it isn't really needed though. The introduction to Bucky Barnes's character is quite small but obviously leads to more later in his character arc. Besides this I don't have much else to say besides the action towards the end is quite good, a little drawn out a little silly and over the top but intense and enjoyable to watch. Also the soundtrack is incredible, it fits extremely nicely and is very uplifting. Also Also the comedy in the movie, which there is few, is far better than I remember and isn't just thrown in at the most random places. Overall a good origin story 7/10!",Captain America - The First Avenger
265,haydenluz,Captain America: The First Avenger,5,23 January 2021,"Captain America: The First Avenger, directed by Joe Johnston is one of the most mixed films of the MCU. Coming off of some average to below average films, I wasn't too sure if Johnston was the man for the job. Even though his story telling skills aren't the sharpest, with a lot of unsolved plots being moved around and botched together; Cap's origin story carried most of the load, with the compliment of some of Johnston's direction and style, to an extent. He used a lot of specific framing techniques, with a few certain sized lense' to really capture that 1940's feel; other than that, Johnston struggled to find a steady tempo, leading the film to be messy, and pretty dry. If they embraced this to be just a stepping stone, rather than trying to do that, while also trying to make a great origin story, the narrative would've flowed much better. At the end of the film, it was truly just a by the numbers, super hero film, that didn't take too many risks. The First Avenger had a few moments that were decent fun, but it was overtaken by the cheesiness, and over-saturated comic book feel, although Johnston and the crew did their best to stay as faithful as possible to the comics.The characters of the film were the driving force for me. Hearing the casting of Chris Evans as Captain America was a little odd at first, but his performance put me, and all of the other doubters to rest! He put on a fantastic performance as both Captain America and Steve Rogers, bringing great wit to his character, while really embracing the genuine patriotism the character embodies! Steve Rogers isn't one of those people that are full of energy, but with his mellow tone, mixed with his leadership skills and troublesome background, he is an easy character to be invested in. Hayley Atwells puts on a fine performance as well, as Peggy Carter, but she didn't really have much to do, other than be the inevitable love interest. The biggest issue I have with her character, isn't even Atwells fault, it's the way Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely wrote her character. As important as they wanted to make her, her character development was bare none, being nothing more than a love interest. The biggest upset of the film by far is the Red Skull. It isn't even Weaving's fault; once again, Markus and McFeely completely underdeveloped his character, giving him a basic motive and NOTHING else to do! Weavings does his best with the material he has, but my god, give this man something to work with, please! Toby Jones puts on a great performance, only having a small amount of screen time. With different writers, I feel like this film could've been one the MCU's best! Tommy Lee Jones is literally Tommy Lee Jones. He sleep walks through his performance, bringing little, to no weight to the overall narrative. Sebastian Stan has the same case. He brings even less to the table than Tommy Lee Jones, only being added for his future presence in the series to come.The screenplay was a big miss! Markus and McFeely underdeveloped most of our main characters, while giving us some subpar jokes, and a pretty boring script overall.The action was really underwhelming. With the setting being set during the world war, you would expect a lot of high octane action, but we received a minimal amount of cheesy, comic book heavy action scenes, with a single action montage you can catch in the trailer. With the way the story was structured, they should've trimmed some of their filler, and added one more concrete action scene, so it at least cuts out some unnecessary stuff, and gives us some fun. The final battle between Cap and Red Skull was piss poor. With the abilities of these two beings, you would expect something GREAT, but the sequence was so short lived, and a real let down considering everyone looks forward to this moment in every superhero film.The comic book feel worked in one application, and it was the production design. Johnson and Heinrichs' utilized a great amount of genuine set pieces to really create nice looking sets.The visual effects as a whole really didn't flow great. Chris Evans' CGI in the beginning is SUPER distracting, while the action CGI was handled poorly, having noticeable holes. Green screens and chains & hooks just ain't it.Overall, I don't HATE this film, but on the rewatch, you can see how it's only a silly, set up film for the series to come.",Captain America - The First Avenger
266,maxmages,Marvel's Mulan American edition,7,17 December 2018,"It's just the kind of movie I always wanted to see and wanted to do myself
It has remained a typical superhero story on the ground and not quite so super natural.
That's an advantage sometimes a disadvantage the interactions of the people are the best.
There is a place where a child is kidnapped and then it is thrown into a river by evil our hero wants to go after but the boy says ""no, no, I can swim, run after him""
There is a very dramatic place where the hero and his dear interest have to say goodbye, he goes away she kisses him first. He is surprised and Tommy Lee Jones just looks at him weirdly and says, ""I will not kiss her""
The film is full of little moments that are just typically Hollywood and sometimes kitschy but then skin on the table and says how things are. That's exactly what I love and I would watch if the movie was boring. The movie is anything but boring.
It's basically an American soldier version of ""Mulan"" but without any crossdressing but I mean that in the best sense of the word.
Although the movie is nothing more than thick America propaganda but that was the comics, too
The movie is just a preview of the movie Marvel's The Avengers but those were the comics too ...
and of course you should see how cool and strong the American military is, but I repeat myself too often.
Since World War II was nothing else, I do not think you can complain about it. I think the villain is a little cheap at Hugo Weaving is a very talented actor and has a very angry voice in his appearance and appearance as The Red Skull left a lot to be desired.I hope he survived very much and come back to avenge himself that would be a little bit clichéd and often seen but if someone can do it right then Joe Johnston.",Captain America - The First Avenger

270,BigWhiskers,Captain America is a decent movie but lacks any real punch.,7,28 July 2011,"After watching lots of comic book adaptations movies. I have come to the conclusion that some do not translate as well as others to the big screen. Captain America is one that to me is in need of some punch for the big screen. This movie does deliver some nice action scenes but those are few and far between - a lot of the in between fodder with his origin and back story do get bogged down with some cheesy dialog and scenes of the old USO type shows with beautiful but boring girls glamorizing the war and using Caps image for propaganda. Main thing is , of all the Marvel heroes that have been made into movie roles , Captain America IMO is one that may be a tough sell for a sequel. I mean he has been around a long time in comics but do people really follow him ,not until he was supposedly killed off in a recent storyline did people take notice with even some news stations like CNN doing a whole story on a fictional characters' death. Like with Superman when they killed him off and then of course the character ends up not being dead and brought back which is done quite a lot in the fictional comic book world ,usually to bolster falling sales of the comic book which is what happened for both Superman and Cap when the writers had them both bumped off albeit temporarily. So now people are interested in Cap again but for how long , is he as exciting as some of the other characters. In the comics , I say hell yes but on screen that's iffy . They need to really go no holes barred with him , I mean he has lots of great enemies and co heroes to work with and so much material for stories. If they do it right , Captain America could be a serious blockbuster franchise like Spiderman but if they do it cheesy with a bad director and tepid writing you can kiss it goodbye.

271,kaden_lewis,Captain America: The First Avenger,9,13 June 2021,"The best MCU movie since Iron Man. There is no way this move deserves the 6.9/10 it currently has. I am personally giving this film a 8.7/10. There were a lot of things I liked about this movie. I like the story, the theme, the casting, the acting, and the final battle. I thought this was the best job Marvel had done at a origin story out of all 4 so far. I thought it was written to perfection, the way they took time to show his transformation from a scrawny guy to a huge muscular man, and all of the things that lead to him becoming Captain America like the 107th with Bucky going missing and Steve, against orders, went in all by himself to save them, and that is exactly what he did, he saved all of them, nearly 400, that is what lead him to becoming Captain America. I also liked the theme of the movie, I liked the 1940s feel we haven't had in the other movies so far, and I also liked the WWII side of the movie. I love war movies, and to make it better, this one had the Marvel touch added to it. Just like always, Sarah Haley Finn did a lights out job casting this movie, she never disappoints, and the actors she casts, all play their roles perfectly. Lastly, the final battle was pretty amazing. I think it ties, if not surpasses Iron Man 2's final battle. This one was decent in length, and had some really good action sequences, but this added the touch of the ending that I will not get into. It is the culmination of Captain America's origin story, and anyone who knows it, knows what I am talking about.I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch it, wether it be War movie lovers, marvel fans, or anyone looking to watch a good action movie, this one doesn't disappoint.",Captain America - The First Avenger
272,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn! review,6,2 April 2014,"Captain America: The Winter Soldier is hitting the theaters in my country in a few days, so I decided to (mainly because some characters re-appear in the sequel) look back at Captain America: The First Avenger, the last solo Marvel movie that came out before The Avengers. On my first viewing, Captain America: The First Avenger struck me as one of the weakest and most forgettable movies of Marvel Phase I. I hoped my initial impression would change upon this viewing. Unfortunately, it didn't.Set during World War II, the movie follows Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), who wants to join the army but is rejected because of his health and physical issues. His luck, however, changes when he meets the mysterious doctor Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), who helps Steve join the army despite his disadvantages. During his military training he shows intelligence and bravery, and doctor Erskine enlists him in an experiment, which goal is to create super soldiers. After the experiment is successful, Steve's body completely changes (he gets much taller and stronger), and soon he becomes Captain America.Captain America: The First Avenger can roughly be divided in two parts, with the first one ending when Cap puts on his suit and starts punching Nazis. The first part of the movie, which is almost fully devoid of action sequences, is the origin story and with its interesting character development, setting and plot, is much superior to the second part. Chris Evans (in spite of how silly he looks before the super soldier experiment) is a fantastic choice for Captain America and truly does a remarkable job. Hugo Weaving, who's always great at portraying villains, is (at least before he reveals his true face) good as the movie's bad guy Johann Smith aka Red Skull. The rest of the cast (mainly Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley Atwell) don't fall behind these two. During this part, Captain America: The First Avenger is a decent and enjoyable period movie, which sometimes is more than enough to entertain. And then, the second part of the movie happens.The second part of Captain America: The First Avenger is more or less a montage of dumb action sequences, explosions and people killing each other. During this part, the movie's cheesiness becomes apparent and makes the movie look more stupid than it should. Scenes of a ridiculously looking villain (let's face it – no matter how you portray Red Skull, he'll still be somewhat ridiculous) and a ridiculously patriotic protagonist punching each other in the face, while speaking awful lines of dialogue, come almost as an insult after the movie's solid first part. While there is some lighthearted humor here and there, overall the movie should have taken itself less seriously than it did (for the right amount of serious and unserious, look at the first Iron Man movie). By taking some of its silly elements too seriously (the Red Skull, the Hydra, the patriotism) and by having too many action sequences tightly packed, the movie overall undermines its full potential and it ends up being forgettable and of rather poor quality.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",Captain America - The First Avenger
273,Filmdokter,A rather mediocre film with a dull protagonist,5,26 May 2021,"#MCUrewatcb. After an uber cool Tony Stark and a funny Thor, it was always going to be a difficult task for Captain America to be introduced to the audience as the final member of the Avengers. But it is a good thing they have started with the other two first. Because in this film Captain America is a bit of uninteresting goodie goodie. There is no real character arc here. His body changes rather dramatically but his character stays pretty much the same. Which is in terms of story less interesting. Weaving does a solid job as Red Skull, though it is more his mask and makeup that impressed then his limited screentime. The whole WW2 setting is a nice hommage to Indiana Jones and at times gives the film the same kind of feeling. Just not as exciting or with an interesting protagonist as in Raiders of the Lost Ark.",Captain America - The First Avenger

And tbh in some scenes I felt that the movie is for kids.-Like in the final 15 minutes when he met the evil guy on a plane and the evil guy said you don't quit do you and he answered I don't.
-Like when the German doctor saw Captain America and realize that he was the one for his experiments, then he asked him do u wanna kill the enemies. He answered I don't want to kill anyone. I hate bullies.What type of answer is this?! All ppl hate bullies. If he said something like I want to kill all the bullies. I would've accepted.
-all the laser sound effects and that pio pio....-after the experiments he became a huge man with superhuman power and still nobody had faith in him. (Im ok with that) but after they used him for shows and made him sing and dance. If that is not for kids then I think it's just humiliating and I didn't like that",Captain America - The First Avenger

Not essential to Captain America, but still has a nice cheesy 40's charm. A problem I do have with the movie is that Steve Rogers doesn't become Captain America until the middle of the movie. And the scenes before he becomes Captain America are quite boring to be honest I would like this movie a lot more if he was started punching Nazi's earlier. Another complaint might be that their isn't as much Nazi punching as there should be, its only really in one montage (admittedly a great montage). My favorite part the movie was probably the World War II action and montage. Overall the movie is harmless and does deserve a watch.",Captain America - The First Avenger

279,chaz-28,Script Failure Hurts an Already Uninteresting Superhero,5,11 August 2011,"Superman came from Krypton. Thor came from Valhalla. Batman was at least quite wealthy. Captain America: The First Avenger – he's a Brooklyn kid born and raised. World War II has broken out and all able bodied men are accepting their patriotic duty and volunteering for the military; everyone except for Mr. Steve Rogers of course. The pre-Captain America is a 90 pound nothing with asthma. He even tries lying on his enlistment papers but with no success.Obviously, the kid eventually gets in lest there be no film. His pure heart of gold gets noticed by a top scientist (Stanley Tucci) and BOOM he is now the superhero with the worst uniform of them all, Captain America. What kept gnawing at me as I was watching the film is that Captain America as a person and as a superhero is rather average, not necessarily boring, but definitely on the uninteresting end of the spectrum. There is no anguish or emotional torment which many other superheroes endure. There is no single force which is his foe ala kryptonite. There is just a very physically fit guy who expertly flings his shield at the bad dudes.Speaking of the bad dudes, Nazis always have and always will make fantastic villains. Nobody is ever pulling for the Nazis to win or sympathizes with them. They really do make the perfect antagonists. Hugo Weaving turns out to be Captain America's alter ego and has a vague resemblance to Hellboy who also happens to get his start in World War II but is a bit of an anti-superhero in comparison. Two other things also work well in this film which is the Colonel played by Tommy Lee Jones and Captain America's romantic interest in Agent Carter (Hayley Atwell). Tommy Lee Jones is a great choice to play a grizzled and annoyed person no matter what the film is about.Unfortunately, the awesome Mr. Jones cannot save a lackluster script which includes an awkward showbiz interlude early on in Captain America's career and somewhat repetitive fight sequences. This whole film appears to be a setup for next year's The Avengers but as a prequel for that, it does not set the bar too high.",Captain America - The First Avenger
280,evilnigga,Captain America : The First Disaster,4,28 September 2021,"I know this is a superhero movie and its not supposed to be realistic, but I can't fathom some of the action scenes, they are really dumb. I love a movie when they completely contradicts itself in the most obvious way. Howard Stark specifically mentioned that Captain America's shield is vibration absorbent but when Bucky uses the shield its no longer vibration absorbent somehow.Being a superhero movie of course its packed with CGI, some looks worse than the other but overall it looks alright. One thing that I do like about this is the aesthetic, I like the WWII settings. The story has a little bit of depth but not like its the main selling point. The main selling point itself as I've mentioned is poorly executed, the action scene is just not convincing enough and some of them are really dumb.",Captain America - The First Avenger
281,TheSeaLion,Middle of the road,4,23 March 2014,"Before the Marvel film ""The Avengers"" came out in 2012, there had been buildup for the movie for the past several years. In Marvel's numerous cinematic releases during that time, the films were used to introduce the heroes who would be in ""The Avengers"" and to give the audience little glimpses and Easter eggs of what was coming. ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" was the forth Marvel movie, the third one used to set up a character, since the release of ""Iron Man"" in 2008 to get people ready for the film that everything was building up to.This may sound strange, but this is the first superhero movie I've ever seen where I did not really know what to think of it. ""Captain America"" The First Avenger"" was not a great superhero movie like ""X2"", but it was not terrible like ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". It rested somewhere in the middle of the two films. For every positive, there was a negative and so on and so on. This film is the perfect example of a movie that is in the middle of the road.The Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) discovers the Tesseract around the same time that America has entered into World War II and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a skinny weakling is rejected from the military due to being deemed unfit. Steve is given a chance to be in the military because of a secret project overseen by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci). There, he meets Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones), and the father of Tony Stark, Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper). After Steve is turned into Captain America, he is used mainly to boost morale, going from location to location giving shows for the troops. Cap learns that his friend James ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and a number of other soldiers went missing in action, Cap goes to rescue all of them, proving his worthy to the military as a soldier.As I said earlier, for every pro that the movie has there is an equal con. Chris Evan's Captain America is a fun character to watch and get invested in, while Hugo Weaving's Red Skull is a comical, generic villain with nothing interesting to his character. Some of the characters are very bland and forgettable like Atwell's Peggy Carter, or have no character but are only interesting because of their actor or actress such as Jones' Colonel Phillips, while others like Stan's Bucky and Tucci's Erskine are interesting and fun to watch and you get invested in them. The effects, editing, and story both have equal amounts of pros and cons to them. When it all comes down to it, the movie is not terrible, just unmemorable and kind of bland. It has some good elements to it, some interesting characters, and some good effects, but for each of these positives is an equal negative.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I liked the 1940's style and art. It's just like watching a serial film from the 1940's and it's something like in the Indiana Jones franchise. Chris Evans is awesome playing Captain America. Hugo Weaving is scary as the Red Skull. There were people saying that the film was not good but I know there are true Marvel fans who enjoyed viewing the film.

283,Treyroo,Not great,6,6 December 2012,"After a brief opening sequence revealing a startling find in the Arctic, we find ourselves taken back to the height of World War II. A Nazi officer (Hugo Weaving) and his men lead a raid in order to steal an object of great power and mystery. Simultaneously, in NYC, we see Steve Rogers (played in 98-pound-weakling form a la Benjamin Button by Chris Pine). Rogers (Pine) is being denied the opportunity to serve his country in the military due to various physical issues. Not long after this, however, a mysterious man (Stanley Tucci) offers him the opportunity to be a part of the Army's new super soldier program. And, with a little delay, Captain America is born.Having never read the original comic books, I can't speak to their endearing qualities. And their timely inception no doubt did a great deal to inspire its readers, but the tone of the film is campy, and I don't believe it was meant to be. In addition, Pine (Captain America) doesn't really have the gravitas to pull of the role. I liked him and his co-stars in The Losers, and he was near brilliant in the irreverent, tragically-underrated masterpiece Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, but both those films had there roots planted in comedy.

Seems like growing muscles transformed him into Captain Forgettable. Meanwhile, I still remember some arcs from the comics I read as far as decades ago, and I never really cared for that character one way or another.I can understand good notes pouring in soon after the movie's release. Brains work that way. I can understand praise from patriotism-afflicted viewers. Spinal cords work that way. However, technically, artistically or whateverly, this film has very little to offer. From the action scenes, I can only recall that the pictures were always too dark, as dark as a low budget piece trying to hide its special effects. This is a shame considering the insane amount of money used here, and a very, very common occurrence in corporate Hollywood.Worse yet, I didn't even remember any of the cast until IMDb refreshed my memory.

288,drawlife,A near perfect soldier.,8,5 January 2015,"This, in my opinion is my personal favorite Marvel Phase 1 solo film. I'm aware the first Iron Man(2008) is considered to be the best, but this one did it for me. Joe Johnston is no stranger to period pieces, like The Rocketeer and October Sky, and in the case of Captain America, Johnston delivers everything promised in the trailers. Johnston is able to capture that patriotic spirit that permeated the US during WWII. The film has an authentic feel to it and combines elements from films like Indiana Jones mixed in with Saving Private Ryan and a touch of 007. The set pieces are fantastic, due to the fact that this film was shot entirely at London. The film crew did a very good job disguising it as the 1940's New York City. Aside from October Sky this is Johnston's second best effort. The film starts out very strong. The beginning to the middle is solid. Here we get a story of an underdog, very skinny, small, and sickly Steve Rogers trying to do whats right. From then on Steve is chosen from the super soldier program to become the world's first super soldier, aiding the United States war effort in WWII. Eventually the film looses steam in the second act, and goes a little crazy with montages. The musical montage in particular is great and clever, but then the other two montages just try to shoehorn most of the story and the conflict and it gets very generic. The supporting cast overall was excellent as Tommy Lee Jones (Colonel Chester Phillips) and Stanley Tucci (Dr. Erksine) steal every scene they're in. Tucci in particular has a very enlightening speech on why he chose Steve Rogers and give him a pep talk to remain humble. Hugo Weaving has a natural talent playing villains, and he knocks one out of the park as the Red Skull. However, the heart and soul in this movie rests on Chris Evans playing the titular hero. Evans during the hype train got a lot of hate, but I was actually one of the few who supported this casting, and man he does not disappoint. He gives the story right amount of everything it needs in every scene, and he only gets better, especially in the sequel Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Haley Atwell plays a believable and lovable ally/love interest. She's not a damsel in distress which is great and the chemistry between Atwell and Evans gives Marvel's most solid and satisfying romance on screen to date, I would say even better than Tony Stark and Pepper Potts. I found the ending of this film to be quite moving. A lot more moving than I thought it would be. The weak spots in this film were, as I stated above the rushed montage, Johnston's very calculated and sometimes soulless action sequences that just feel bland, and the Red Skull's lack of development. Hugo Weaving gives a good performance, but his character spends most of his time building his plane and reminding us that he's evil, rather than emerging as a worthwhile threat. This film does have a lot of characters, so it also comes within the territory that Cap's team The Howling Commandos don't have too much to do. One could argue that Sebastian Stan's role as Bucky, Cap's friend and sidekick was trivialized, but he got his due in the sequel. I admire this film, I like how it does send a decent message without being too preachy about it in the beginning. I liked the set pieces, I liked the cast. It's very old fashioned, as it should be and it will pleasantly kill off two hours of your time. Good music in it too by Alan Silvestri. Evans is great in the role and has a lot of charisma. 8/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
289,robinski34,Captain Courageous,8,2 August 2013,"Woa there, hang on a minute, Chris Evans is Johnny Storm a.k.a. The Human Torch, what the heck is going on here?! Initial concerns are quickly swept aside however since Mr. Evans was clearly born to play the iconic Captain America, whether in initial pint-sized and weedy form, or once transformed as if he's been chiselled out of Mount Rushmore. Great turns from an excellent cast, especially the hard-bitten Tommy Lee Jones; the deliciously frosty Haley Atwell; a gloriously malevolent Hugo Weaving, and the myopically intellectual Toby Jones – and not forgetting excellent work by Dominic Cooper as 'old man' Stark. The film is chock full of glorious rock 'em, sock 'em comic book action, and 'Cap' hits all the nails square on the head, from the frustration of his employment as a War Bond figurehead, to his fearless forays into the heart of enemy territory with his own band of brothers, all present and correct.It's actually quite refreshing to meet a hero who is not flawed, as seems to have become the norm over the decades. Steve Rogers isn't dark, he isn't conflicted, nor is he guilt ridden (yet), he's just out to punch old Adolf in the eye – although as it turns out he has bigger problems to face. The emotional centre of the film is nicely handled, not overplayed, there's a war on after all and duty comes first, but there is still time for some brief, tender moments that add a romantic strand which is nicely played by Atwell and Evans.The toning down of Cap's costume is a wise move and allows the use of a more muted pallet of tones that helps to root the film firmly in the forties, and the production portrays the period beautifully. All this helps to set the film apart from the Marvel fare that we have been served up to date, and adds all the more to the enjoyment of it. One of the greatest pleasures however, as with 'Thor', is the anticipation of something greater, and there is a jarring closing sequence which is very well handled, another promise of things to come. Good, solid, square-jawed fun.",Captain America - The First Avenger

This story is cool because it brings some real-life historical aspects to MCU, with American patriotism and WWII, and chronologically is the start of the ""enhanced individuals"" they'll call heroes. I love Peggy's character, she's very important to the story and one thing Marvel remembers to do is to make the women more than just your average ""love interest"": they're strong and pull their weight just fine.

291,StonedMagician,Good: 7.5,7,27 July 2019,"The next chapter in the Avengers saga has arrived. And, like Thor before it, it is dumb, big, and loud. However, this is slightly less dumb than most action movies these days, because of two main factors. One of these is the film's style. In an uncommon twist of the comic book subgenre, this is an undeniable period piece. WWII-style dialogue, cinematography, and technology are everywhere, and could not have provided a better backdrop for the action taking place on the screen. However, it is at this point that I think the film could use some improvement. The action scenes simply were not that compelling or entertaining. Honestly, this is the last complaint I expected to have about this movie, given that Thor and Joe Johnston's previous film, The Wolfman, both had this as their selling points. However, the dialogue was one of the finer points of the film. It was better-written than I had expected, and that's no small thing. The other main positive factor of this film is that it has a message. Unlike the last two Marvel movies, this one has a theme that most, if not all, people can get behind: simply that, no matter who or what you are, if you try hard enough, you can make a difference. This is something that the lead actor, Chris Evans (Scott Pilgrim) exemplifies extremely well. He plays both the pre- and post-op Steve Rogers with great emotion and deftness. Oh, and for all you Marvel fans, there are A LOT of little nods to Thor and Iron Man, as well as other (read: non-Marvel) stuff.",Captain America - The First Avenger
292,mjplysaght,Standard origin story with good morals,7,30 March 2017,"So this is the MCU's introduction of Captain America. Some naysayers will say that this is just filler for The Avengers, and in a sense they're kinda right.Putting that aside, it presents to us the story of Steve Rogers, a puny weakling with a heart of gold, wishing to enlist in the US Army to fight in WWII. While his peers see him as worthless, a German scientist loyal to the US Army sees great potential in him and uses him as a test subject for a super soldier programme. Sure enough, he undergoes the experiments and emerges as a beefed up strong man. Joined with the US army, along with his best friend Bucky Barnes, his goal is to take down Hydra, a fascist regime similar to the Nazis and it's leader, the Red Skull, who has taken control of the Tesseract, an artifact powered by an Infinity Stone.So, putting aside the comments that this is just filler, it's actually a decent stand-alone flick. Rogers' patriotism defines him as a loyal and noble character. The sets and scenery make this a pretty good period piece, and it combines the genres of WWII and superhero/science fiction quite effectively.I wouldn't be gushing over this film going ""IT WAS AMAAAAAAAZZZZZZIIINNNGGG!"" or anything, but it's still fairly decent. It introduces Captain America to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that's all you need, really.",Captain America - The First Avenger
293,austin-takahashi,Captain America: The First Avenger - 3.5 Stars,7,22 December 2012,"The early 1940's represents tough times. A horrible war is being fought, and Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) strongly believes that sweet victory will be embraced by the side that places more confidence in men than in weapons.The United States of America needs the best soldiers they can find, and in comes a young man with an unparalleled desire to serve his country. His name is Steve Rogers. He is an asthmatic and weighs less than a hundred pounds. If he's also missing half a toenail, then he'd remind me of myself five years ago. At home, he is constantly bullied, bad- mouthed, and beaten up.Steve may not have the muscles that are required for the ideal soldier, but he has the heart. Thankfully, Doctor Erskine (Stanley Tucci) sees the goodwill in Steve and offers him an opportunity no 90-pound asthmatic could resist.

294,zombiefan89,...It wasn't as bad as Thor...,1,16 April 2012,"Steve Rogers was a bit cliché, but then the movie was about the 1940s, so clichés were common. There's really no way to spoil this movie, if you know anything about Captain America. Also the movie is mostly gun fights and explosions, just like a Michael Bay movie! The premise is an American made Superman through science. A lot of experiments when on during the 1940s, we invented the atom bomb, etc. So a scientist making a super soldier would have been on their ""To Do"" list, if it were an option. As for characters, Steve Rogers wasn't that cliché, or at least, I didn't think so. He didn't have too many emotions though. He's not witty or charming. He's just your standard save-the-day super hero.I did enjoin the scenes where he used his brain instead of brawn, but those scenes are scarce indeed. The other characters were so bland, I can't even remember their names. There was ""Uncle Ben"" as the scientist. ""Lois Lane"" as the only female main character. Tommy Lee Jones as a stereotypical colonel( it was his dialogue, not his fault!), and there was the best friend. Not a whole lot of character development. Actually, now that I think about it, there wasn't any...Steve Rogers stays exactly the same through out the movie. He doesn't reach some profound understanding of anything. He just fights a lot and blows things up. I'm not joking, the movie is 70-80% explosions and gun fights. The whole movie is just to set up the back story for that Avengers movie, just like Thor!

296,blackwidowis7cool,The cheesiest one so far,10,7 August 2019,"I just finished watching this and I absolutely love it!
Steve Rogers is a short, skinny guy with several health issues - but he is desperate to get into the army and fight in World War 2. He tries several times, but is rejected due to his health issues and his shortness. Then, he is approached by Dr. Abraham Erskine, who works in the military, and is drafted. While he is nowhere near as fit as all the other soldiers, he turns out to be smarter and a bigger heart than all the rest. He is chosen to be the guinea pig, so to speak, of a serum that Erskine and Howard Stark created, that will make him bigger, more muscular, stronger, and his senses, bodily activities and abilities are at least 4 times more enhanced than a normal human. It is successful, and he becomes Captain America.
Instead of going on to fight in the war, he is simply used on TV to try and inspire Americans to fight against the Nazis - which isn't as successful as they would like. After the 107th is attacked by Germans, and most killed or captured, Rogers goes alone to one of the Hydra bases and rescues the survivors, among whom was his best friend Bucky Barnes.
Meanwhile, the movies villain, Schimdt (I think I'm spelling that correctly) or Red Skull, harnesses the Tessaract's power to power his weapons to take over the world. Catching wind of his plans, Captain America must try and stop him.
(Sorry for the soppy plot description).
This film is set in the 1940s, and I found it rather refreshing. It seems to be accurate with it's historical setting - the costumes, the vehicles, etc., etc. I like how the lighting effects reflects it's time setting. Chris Evans, Sebastian Stan, and the woman who plays Peggy all do an awesome job in their roles as Cap, Bucky, and Peggy - well, everyone does, but they are the most notable, alongside Dominic something or other who plays Howard Stark, Tony's father. The saying like father, like son strongly applies with Howard and Tony, if you get my drift.
The action scenes are awesome and one-hundred-percent preposterous - but you'll still love it. You just have to laugh, though, at its unrealism and cheesiness.
Hugo Weaving does a stellar job as Red Skull, the villain. I like the Garden of Eden references and the Raiders of the Lost Ark parallels - particularly something in the climax, which I will not spoil. The mystical themes were quite an interesting addition, as well.

It has a perfect balance showing the journey that led to Steve Rogers becoming Captain America.Steve Rogers, played by Chris Evans, had always wanted to make a difference. Despite being the smallest man in the room, Rogers always stood up for himself and others. Even when his odds were stacked against him, he would not stop fighting for what was fair and right. His lack of physicality and health kept on getting him denied into the U.S. Army. Dr. Abraham Erskine, played by Stanley Tucci, recognized the pureness in Rogers. Erskine was the one that created the formula that would make a super soldier. It was going to be used on Rogers.Captain America was now created. Although Rogers was now much stronger, faster, and bigger, he still had some of the same challenges that he did as just Steve Rogers. He still had to face odds that were stacked against him. The U.S. Army did not recognize his abilities and deemed him not worthy of fighting in the war against the Nazis. But after his heroic actions that saved countless men in the war, Captain America was put on the front line to take down Hydra.The Red Skull, played by Hugo Weaving, was the head of Hydra. He too had obtained similar powers to that of Captain America. The Red Skull makes Hitler seem sane; the Red Skull wanted to destroy the entire world.It is good to finally have a super hero that is an actual hero. Captain America is one that will always find a way to save person that is in danger.",Captain America - The First Avenger
299,TheCasualReviewer,The moment we knew Evans was Cap,7,17 May 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) and a group of US scientists come up with a serum to create the perfect super soldier to defeat the leader of Hydra.REVIEW:
I've seen all of these Marvel films a few times now and this is one of those that I seem to like the more I come back to it. I absolutely love how they displayed Steve Rogers' (Chris Evans) selflessness and courage even before he became Captain America. Specifically, I really enjoy the scene of the ""test"" when Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) when he thrown a fake grenade into the group of soldiers and Rogers jumps on it in attempts to low the blow while everyone else ran away. Very small part, but I think it was very crucial. The acting in this film really goes a long way as well. Everyone played their part to a T. Tommy Lee Jones was great, Stanley Tucci was great in his pet as head scientist, Sebastian Stan as Bucky, the absolutely breath-taking Hayley Atwell as Peggy, Hugo Weaving played Red Skull perfectly and of course Chris Evans. Between this and Iron Man, I believe are a couple of the best origin stories for any Superhero film to date. This film had a great mix of emotion, heart, a love story that wasn't sappy and I believed 100% and a good amount of laughs although not as much in this film as the others. I know it's not everyone's favorite, but I did really enjoy this one. 7.8/10.",Captain America - The First Avenger
300,brent_or,"A Nice Film, Considering How Many Hats It Wears",7,29 September 2013,"I am a fan of the character and really wanted and expected this film to be good. Initially, I was disappointed, but subsequent viewings have greatly improved my opinion. I have enjoyed Captain America: The First Avenger more each time that I have watched it, which I think speaks well for the film. It clearly is not perfect, but in my opinion is not deserving of some of the very harsh reviews that others have given.First of all, CA:TFA suffers from being used as the most overt prequel to The Avengers. An ideal Captain America film would not be so concerned with setting up another film. The tessarect plot angle is the most obvious element in this regard - such ""cosmic"" themes do not come to mind when one first pictures Captain America. However, when you accept the franchise-building role as part of the package, this film is not a bad effort, and really quite likable.The Good - Chris Evan is very well cast in the lead role, earnest and believable. The score is inspiring and nostalgic. Most of the supporting cast members work well, particularly Stanley Tucci, Hayley Atwell, Tommy Lee Jones, Toby Jones and Dominic Cooper (as a Howard Hughes-inspired Howard Stark). The retro-40s aesthetic design work is generally enjoyable to see. Some of the ""vintage sci-fi"" HYDRA technology is very gee-whiz cool-looking. The story has a lot heart, even if it is stretched thin.The Not So Good - Visually, there is a lot of faux-3D feel when viewed in 2D, the fakeness of which unfortunately undermines what should be a more rustic WWII aesthetic (not nearly as bad as other weird-looking films like Warhorse and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, though). Sebastian Stan as Bucky is utterly forgettable and uninteresting. The Red Skull could have been a bit more gritty (and realistic) and truly menacing. The pacing is somewhat uneven.Regardless of what you may think of Joe Johnston, I feel that he was a good choice to direct this film. CA:TFA is actually very, very similar to Johnston's earlier film The Rocketeer, and there are some shared virtues with October Sky as well. Again, I enjoy and appreciate this film more each time I watch it, absorb more of its lovingly-crafted details and come away each time feeling inspired and with a smile on my face. It could have been better, but like most of Marvel Studios' productions, CA:TFA is a worthwhile adaption that treats its subject with sensitivity. I find it compelling enough to give it at least 7.5 out of 10.",Captain America - The First Avenger
301,misbegotten,Don't mention the war,4,2 June 2012,"'Captain America: The First Avenger' is sadly disappointing - as a flashy, popcorn action movie it's fine, but otherwise it's quite empty and there's a distinct lack of period atmosphere (especially compared to director Joe Johnston's earlier pulp-era superhero film, 1991's THE ROCKETEER). I suspect the latter is deliberate, as 'Captain America: The First Avenger' actually isn't a WWII movie: although Nazi Germany is referred to a few times at the beginning, Steve Rogers is basically portrayed as a young man desperate to serve his country in A War Overseas. And from about a third of the film onwards, the Third Reich, Hitler, the Axis powers, and the Allies' campaigns on various fronts simply aren't mentioned, and instead the narrative is exclusively about Cap and his band of elite commandos targeting the Hydra organisation. In other words, it's a movie in which covert Special Forces battle against a terrorist network - this is really a film about the War on Terror, with the WWII setting being mere window-dressing. I suspect that the producers decided to take this current/relevant approach due to the fact that all previous superhero movies set in the Thirties or Forties - THE SHADOW (1994), THE PHANTOM (1995), SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW (2004), the aforementioned ROCKETEER, all the way back to DOC SAVAGE: MAN OF BRONZE (1975) - had undeservedly flopped. 'Captain America: The First Avenger' bucked the trend by being a box office success, but in my opinion all the earlier 1930s-period superhero films that I've listed above, together with the previous, low budget 'Captain America' movie that was released straight-to-video in 1990, are considerably better and more enjoyable than 'The First Avenger'.",Captain America - The First Avenger
302,louwburger-42312,Old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment.,8,3 June 2019,"With plenty of pulpy action, a pleasantly retro vibe, and a handful of fine performances, Captain America is solidly old-fashioned blockbuster entertainment.",Captain America - The First Avenger
303,nmholland,A Great Superhero Origin Story With Nicely Filmed Action,9,12 May 2016,"Captain America: The First Avenger is directed by Joe Johnston and stars Chris Evans as scrawny Brooklyn kid Steve Rogers, who has a passion for joining the military and serving in World War II. However, he has a long list of health issues that prevent this, so he signs up for a super soldier program. This program involves him being testing upon so that he can be stronger, faster, and all around better at physical tasks. But, when a Nazi organization called Hydra, led by a man named Johann Schmidt, better known as the notorious Red Skull, comes in contact with a powerful object called the Tesseract, Steve Rogers, now called Captain America, must put his skills to good use.Captain America: The First Avenger is actually a really good movie. Not many people expected much from this movie, but it was, overall, great. There were some issues with it, but not many, and the many positive aspects of the film highly outweighed the negative ones. The acting, direction, action, and script combine to make a respectable film that is Captain America: The First Avenger.There's an old saying that applies to film that goes: ""a movie is only as good as its villain."" This is true in almost every single film, including the first Captain America. Hugo Weaving as Red Skull was a perfect casting choice, and an immensely overlooked villain of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The character is understandable, and well rounded, which add for a great character altogether. Hugo Weaving does great as Red Skull, as expected, and put a newer spin on this older character.Hugo Weaving isn't the only capable actor in this movie, however. Chris Evans, as Steve Rogers/Captain America is not only a great casting choice, but he lives up to the hype of his abilities. His large character arc is expressed in depth all throughout this film, and Cap is a great protagonist to follow. Hayley Atwell also does substantial in her role as Agent Peggy Carter. Her two sided bitter/sweet character was displayed amazingly by Atwell, and her performance stood out as one of the best. Other smaller role actors such as Tommy Lee Jones, Sebastian Stan, Stanley Tucci, Dominic Cooper, and Toby Jones all do fine as well.The way that Joe Johnston directed the action is really good. Each action scene is cleanly cut, with no shaky cam present at all. Wide shots of snow permeated forests are very nice to look at, so props to Johnston and the cinematographer, Shelly Johnson. The score, by Alan Silvestri, is pretty nice as well. The main theme (""Captain America Main Titles"") stands out to me the most as superior to the rest, however opinionated that may be. Despite my having a favorite, all of the themes are great, and add a whole lot to Cap's origin story.Now, my biggest (and only) issue with Captain America: The First Avenger is actually a big one. Once Steve Rogers becomes Captain America, the film quickly montages over many of his cool moments, and it was quite disappointing. After the audience patiently waits to see Cap in action, the film practically skips over a ton of cool scenes, and wasted a lot of potential. Parts of the film that could've been really cool turned into a massive let down. However, once the film picks up, it picks up fast, and partially makes up for its montage sequence.Besides that, I didn't have any major issues with Captain America: The First Avenger. Overall, it was a great film, and I enjoyed almost everything about it. I'd recommend Captain America: The First Avenger to anyone who likes superheroes and well filmed action.",Captain America - The First Avenger
304,jhudson-11704,I'm just a kid from Brooklyn,7,24 July 2017,"Captain America: The First Avenger is a good film that showcases the powers of a superhero and they aren't about physical prowess or incredible intelligence. It's about heart. My favorite scene in this movie that truly shows him as a hero is when he dives on a grenade to save his fellow soldiers, everyone of them being horrible to him in training. When the grenade doesn't go off as it's a dummy, everyone else is hiding but he took it upon himself to sacrifice himself for the greater good. That is a true sign of a hero and the most heroic thing he did in this movie.I loved Atwell's Carter as not being a damsel in distress and breaking gender norms, even in the era it's set in. The villain, Red Skull, was decent, showing off his intelligence, his own physical prowess and evilness but kind of bordered on over-the-top German bad guy. I also liked Howard Stark, his ingenuity and his similarities to his yet-to-be-born son, Tony, with his private life, i.e women.While I did like the film establishing Steve's character and personality traits before his physical abilities I will admit that it took awhile for the action and pacing to actually get going as he wasn't transformed into his super-soldier self until 40 minutes into the film. The cinematography, costume and set pieces did a great job making this look like the 40's but it still could easily take it out and make it look sci-fi and not like a period piece with the tesseract weaponry and especially at the end of the film with the final assault where it kind of took you out of the decade it was set in.+ Established Steve's character before exploits + Side characters especially Carter, Erskine, Stark, Howling Commandos, Red Skull + Made me believe it was in the 40's... - Initially, until it got too obscure - Villain was enjoyable but still got to be too cliché German villain -Took a while for the action to take place. Final Score: 7.1/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
305,thebrandedswordsman-34028,The First Guy,7,26 August 2019,"This is one of the first Marvel movies I saw as a kid and I loved it back then. I still like it now, but I admit it has some meh stuff. The story is pretty good. The beginning is great showing us our hero and how he enters soldier life, his personality, his friends, etc. The middle is okay, showing some cool action scenes, a rescue mission, stuff like that, but not much that's actually interesting. The ending is really good though. The characters are pretty good except for the villain. He's kinda weak. Has a fun apprentice though. Steve Rogers is a great character as well as Peggy Carter. They both have great chemistry and even Bucky. You get a good sense of friendship from him and Steve. The acting is good for the most part. Sometimes it's a little cheesy. The tone is good. It felt like a realistic story with themes of honor and sacrifice. CGI was good and the practical effects were great. The movie looks amazing too. I really believed they were in the '40s. The music was pretty good. The runtime is good. It doesn't ever feel really boring. The comedy was alright. Not all of the jokes land. And the action was great. Lots of stuff gets blown up and it looks good",Captain America - The First Avenger
306,benjaminwest-242,A well-crafted origin story,7,28 September 2021,"Captain America: The First Avenger is a solid introduction of the MCU's first (in chronology) superhero. Evans embraces the role and gives a convincing performance of a hopeless 1940s teenager turned super soldier. The rest of the cast does well, and Stan Lee's cameo is a bonus. The film's downfalls can mostly be attributed to its presence as an origin film with a lot of ground to cover, not allowing time for more character development. The fight scenes are only decent, and the villain of the story does not get enough screen time to truly provide the audience the strongest foil possible to the beloved Captain America. Certain dialogues, either with emotional depth or a spot on comedic tone, assist the film's overall well-progressed plot into becoming an exciting story to be continued.",Captain America - The First Avenger
307,garyvanhorn,A worthy addition to comic movie lore and a great prequel for The Avengers.,8,23 July 2011,"I must admit that I am an avid fan of the Captain America comic book series and as such I was eager to see the big budget cinematic adaptation of my favorite super hero. I must also admit that I was a tad let down by the movie, but only because I am so intimately familiar with the character and history of Captain America and was hoping for a few things that just weren't in the film. That being said, Captain America is still a very good movie and is well worth the price of admission.Chris Evans isn't stellar as Captain America, but his is fantastic in his role as Steve Rogers, the scrawny kid that is all heart. The movie spends a great deal of time establishing and developing Steve Rogers but is a little lacking in the establishment of Captain America as a total bad-ass. That's just me nitpicking a bit, I really wanted to see Captain America wade through legions of German lackeys and take them out with impressive, Matrix-style martial arts moves. There is a bit of that but not to the degree I was hoping for. I also wanted to see Captain America in training, developing his fighting and tactical skills to superhuman levels, instead there was on-the-job training. It worked and the fact that Captain America is truly heroic is evident, I just wanted some Batman Begins training to hone and solidify that fact.When it is all said and done Captain America is a fine movie with a good lead actor and a stellar supporting cast. Tommy Lee Jones is great as the gruff Army Colonel, Stanley Tucci is brilliant as the fatherly Dr. Abraham Erskine, and Dominic Cooper delights as Howard Stark, father of Tony Stark, a.k.a Iron Man. Captain America is funny when it needs to be, action packed where it can be, and grounded throughout. Oh, and stay through the end credits, The Avengers looks like it will totally rule!",Captain America - The First Avenger
308,RolloTomasi,"It's OK but still, this is the best Captain America film we're ever going to get",7,5 August 2011,"I was an avid reader of the Captain America comic up until the mid-nineties, about the time it seemed to be coming off the rails (about the time he got caught in the meth lab explosion). I think it was revitalized later and gained popularity as a result (he was saved by a Red Skull blood transfusion? Bucky Barnes resurfaces as a villain, the Winter Soldier! The discovery of a black Captain America from WWII! a Super Hero civil war--culminating in Cap beating up Iron Man(!?) Wow! I dropped off at THE wrong time, apparently). Still, I was delighted that they were making a gigantic summer movie out of it and getting fully behind it. Top-notch talent was being put together for the project with the SFX to go with. The result is what I expected: A huge, action-packed (though it does drag a bit at times) movie that's immensely entertaining. They really get the character right, as best as a condensed movie version could be expected to. It's amazing how the writers and director deal with how he becomes Captain America, how he gets his abilities, how he gets his name (he's a propaganda piece, selling war bonds). The costume he uses on his U.S. bond tour is just about exactly the one from the comic (sans chain mail). Then, when Rogers chances upon real action, his costume is modified for real combat. There are some bad one-liners in it, which shows that the production may have been more rushed than, say, Thor or Iron Man, which where more polished. But overall I found that Joe Johnston (highly underrated as a director) finds just the right combination of heart, fantasy, and action here. Time should be good to Captain America: the First Avenger.",Captain America - The First Avenger
309,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,The MCU (So Far) Ranked: #15,7,10 April 2019,Way more camp than I remember .Captain America: The First Avenger feels as though it has taken the framework of a more conventional war drama and just thrown in some superhero stuff and I don't necessarily think that is a bad thing. When this film embraces its campness it can be very entertaining. Chris Evans was a prefect casting choice for Steve Rodgers and this film does go in an unexpected direction by making Captain America basically just a mascot but once again the villain is weak and large sections of the plot are forgettable. Overall worth re-watching it is probably better than you remember.,Captain America - The First Avenger

312,madbandit20002000,"The Star-Spangled Avenger Finally Gets a ""Real Movie"" (or ""Where's My Ovaltine?"")",9,16 November 2011,"As a longtime comic book fan, I always felt sorry for Captain America. Co-created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby for Marvel (then-Timely) Comics, the character was a mascot during WW II but quite the anachronism when Mr. Kirby and Stan Lee revitalized the character in 1964, a year after John F. Kennedy's assassination. He was the straight arrow among mutants, radioactive-powered troubleshooters and blood drunk vigilantes, and he seemed to be relegated to fight second-rate costumed reprobates.However, the Sept. 11 attacks brought a new sense of American patriotism (despite some blinded jingoism), giving Cap the chance to be cinematically adapted in a fun, faithful manner. You can finally forget the 1970 TV movies and corn muffin is way better than the 1990 train wreck (Rubber ears? Yuck!).America's in the dawn days of WW II and Brooklyn-born Steven Grant Rogers (Chris Evans, who's been in nearly every comic book film since 2005!!!) is eager to fight the enemy with his already-enlisted pal James ""Bucky"" Barnes (Sebastian Stan), but Rogers's a shrimp (nice CGI) and gets denied active duty. Metaphysical scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine (Oscar nominee Stanley Tucci of ""The Lonely Bones"") gives Rogers a chance to join the Super Soldier Program, despite doubts from its' supervisor Col. Phillips (gruff Oscar winner Tommy Lee Jones of the ""Men In Black"" saga).Erskine's tragically killed, post-Rogers's transformation (Holy Charles Atlas!), under the orders of the dastardly Johann Schimdt/The Red Skull (sneering Hugo Weaving of The Matrix, Lord of the Rings and Transformers sagas), a deformed scientist who leads the Nazi's scientist division, Hydra, but plans to outdo Hitler by unleashing the power of the Asgardian-based (Hint! Hint!) Cosmic Cube upon the world. The only success of the SSP, Rogers's the best candidate to stop Schimdt.Using a sharp script by Chris Markus and Stephen McFeely (the Narnia films), director and George Lucas student Joe Johnston has fun with the film and deserves to, since he has old-school, high adventure movies like ""The Rocketeer"" and ""Jumanji"" on his resume. There's also a sense of satire; instead of fighting the bad guys at first, Rogers is put into a cheap red, white and blue suit and relegated, by a spotlight-loving politico, to be a war bond salesman, doing song-and-dance numbers with showgirls. It's not as deep as Zack Snyder's hard-edged, R-rated take on ""Watchmen"" (interesting how Cosmic Cube is like Dr. Manhattan), but it works. The story's a prequel to the upcoming ""The Avengers"", along with the Iron Man films, the second Hulk film and ""Thor"".The aforementioned actors are well-cast, nicely assisted by Hayley Atwell (""The Duchess"") as fetching British spy Peggy Carter; Dominic Carter (also of ""The Duchess"") as debonair weapons industrialist Howard Stark and Neal McDonough (""Star Trek: First Contact"") as thick-mustachioed soldier Timothy ""Dumb Dumb"" Dugan. Stan Lee has a fun, obvious cameo as a military general, and Sam L. Jackson reprises in his Nick Fury role from the ""Iron Man"" films.A fun blockbuster that doesn't go over the top and recalls the early Indiana Jones films, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is the type of film that will make you scream ""Where's My Ovaltine?""",Captain America - The First Avenger
313,adamsmith-51004,"""I Could Do This All Day""",7,16 April 2021,"Captain America: The First Avenger takes place in the early-to-mid 1940s, during World War II, and Steve Rogers (Evans) is working to enter the U. S. military alongside his best friend Bucky Barnes (Stan). When he's chosen to become the first ""Super Soldier"" for the military, he gains super-strength and takes on the identity of Captain America to fight the organization HYDRA, a Nazi faction headed by the Red Skull (Weaving). Rogers is aided by SSR Agent Peggy Carter (Atwell) and Howard Stark (Cooper; Howard is Tony Stark's father).(Spoilers follow after this.)The First Avenger is directed by Joe Johnston and was the first MCU movie written by Marvel mainstays Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who would later go on to write several other MCU movies. They wrote a great story filled with likable, well-developed characters and plenty of action, which I like in my superhero movies. Another first-time arrival for the MCU in this movie is composer Alan Silvestri, who goes on to compose other movies in the franchise. His Captain America theme is especially fun to listen to, and you can feel the patriotism and time period in the instruments.The ""period piece"" setting for this movie is an inspired choice, and great pains were taken to ensure that the production aspects were reflective of the time period. The costumes, the weapons, the vehicles, even what little ""big tech"" is there is meant to keep the time setting as close to reality as possible.All of the actors are as great as their characters. Evans makes Steve Rogers a character we instantly root for, and his quieter scenes manage to contain a lot of weight. Atwell's Peggy Carter is such a fun character, and apparently, a lot of people think so too, as she goes on to get her own show (which ended way too soon, I might add). And then Stan's Bucky has a great dynamic with Rogers, which makes his return later in the franchise all the more complicated and their later friendship more tragic. Dominic Cooper's Howard Stark is definitely Tony's father, containing all of his trademark intelligence and ""gentlemanly"" behavior. Finally, Hugo Weaving's Red Skull is a favorite villain of mine in the MCU. He manages to really bring that Nazi sense of menace and ferocity, and the prosthetics that make up his red face look very great.As the last MCU film released before The Avengers, there are a lot of things in this movie that set up future adventures in the MCU. One of them is the introduction of the Tesseract, which re-appears in The Avengers and beyond as one of six ""Infinity Stones."" That term becomes important later on, so get to watching these movies already. :D The struggles Rogers goes through in this movie sets up his arcs in future Captain America and Avengers movies, and viewers will love the connective tissue between all these films.Captain America: The First Avenger: a great MCU movie that does an admirable job of setting the stage for The Avengers and future storylines. I hope.",Captain America - The First Avenger

316,FilmFanatic03,A conventional superhero film-in a good way!,8,16 August 2011,"This film had a steady pace, which is great because you didn't feel that Chris Evan's character was fleshed out too much but at the same time it's not like his character was explored like in an Oscar worthy film. You felt like you were on this journey with Chris Evan's character, Steve Rogers, from a whimpy kid with a dream to an action hero who was saving the world. The action had a great balance, there were a couple of strong action scenes where we see Captain America really showing off his moves. All the characters had their reason to be in the film and really supported Chris Evans hold up the film, and as a leading character he did it really well. You liked the characters you were meant to like and dislike the characters you were not meant to like. Also there was no swearing nor any sex scenes which made the film all the more enjoyable and making it a plain cool superhero flick. A great way to introduce the character and especially since ""The Avengers"" (2012) will be coming out next year so we will feel some sort of connection with Captain America. The high rating I have given this film isn't necessarily to do with acting, scriptwriting etc. (not that it is bad because it is good) but I just loved the film because it is a great escape into things you could only wish to do.

317,blackmambamark,Kind of empty if you ask me.....,6,22 July 2011,"With all the chips finally falling into place, there's only one left to go. But can the Capt. fit in with the rest of the already awesome group? Ever since ""Batman Begins"", studios came to realization that an origins story can have an unreal amount of depth and be extremely entertaining at the same time. They have since applied this method to ""IronMan"" ""X-Men: First Class"" and so on. However, other movies have failed to miss this mark. And in it's own little way, to me, 'Captain America' kind of missed it as well. Allow me to explain...For starters, the villain 'Red Skull' played the fantastic Hugo Weaving, was probably the biggest disappointment of the film. No, not by his acting, but by his level of depth, or lack thereof. In my opinion, he is the dullest villain on screen. I guess the writers and director thought that by him being a Nazi, the audience would already buy the fact that he is an evil person, so they just went ahead and explained of his back story, which is summed up in a 15 second flashback sequence. Hmmmm, really......i kind of need more than that.In fact, Captain America's back story was kind of weak as well. Don't get me wrong, there is a great character within, however, they didn't really shoot the moon on this one, which is kind of upsetting, because you could really sense the potential.But once Steve Rodgers gains his super human powers, it's just one action sequence after another, with Red Skull occasionally making an appearance. I guess this was an attempt to remind the audience who the villain was, because he's barely on screen for more than 5 minutes.Don't get me wrong, the movie is slightly entertaining. It was just missing that WOW factor. Marvel tends to do this a lot. They really focus on the 'love' aspect, and they don't pay attention to the battle within both the good and evil characters. You kind of sensed that in ""Thor"", but they obviously made up for it in the long run.Bottom Line.....yes, you get your dollar's worth, but i kind of wanted something more. With the whole team coming together next summer, i have to say that the Capt. is probably my least favorite of the bunch.",Captain America - The First Avenger
318,Tyson14,A good old fashioned superhero film,7,4 May 2016,"Set in 1942 at the height of World War 2, Chris Evans () stars as the puny yet courageous American Gi wannabe, Steve Rogers. But fortune shines on him as Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci -The Hunger Games) who is recruiting for a special top secret experiment, Project Rebirth, see's beyond Rogers physical failings to give him a shot as a candidate, much to the dismay of Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones -) who doesn't see the same as the good Doctor does. Eventually being the chosen candidate, Rogers undergoes an experiment to change him from a puny regular Joe into a super human solider....Captain America is born.Overall, Captain America: The First Avenger is a watchable bit of entertainment first & foremost, but does have it's failings. The Story starts out very well & introduces us into how this physically under sized man with a big heart becomes Captain America, in the opening 30 minutes. But it then drops from 5th gear into 1st gear, as Captain America is used as a propaganda tool for the war. Which is kinda the calm before the storm i guess. As the film then tries to get back into 5th gear with its action sequences, but doesn't fascinate as much as it did at the beginning imo, as it gradually pushes into 3rd & 4th gears.Although we have to respect that the hero will ultimately win out, we could had been respected a bit more with the action sequences. The enemy ""storm troopers"" who look like something out of toting big futuristic weapons, yet have the armour of a gnat, as they fall over like rolling pins doesn't elude too much in the believability stakes. But i guess this is what we have to swallow with it being an action hero flick.I was impressed with the way they CGI'd Chris Evans as a puny looking weakling, then un-CGI'd him, i've not seen much of the guy, but initially i thought the actor was a stand in & then Evans would appear later, colour me impressed. The rest of the CGI was well done too. The 1940's setting also looked good & a nice change from modern based adventures. Now, not being a comic book reader myself, but having enjoyed the recent Marvel film offerings, i did appreciate the subtle introductions/hints of the other Marvel comic characters, like Iron Man's father & Samuel L. Jacksons, Nick Fury(more astute fans may have noticed more than i). Which all lead into the latest Marvel comic blockbuster, Avengers Assemble, which the film made very enticing by it's ending.The acting was pretty good on the whole, Evans was solid but lacks the screen presence of true Hollywood stars imo, Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Haley Atwell, Sebastian Stan & Dominic Cooper all added gravitas to the movie. Hugo Weaving was impressive, or over hammy depending on how you see it, as the villain Johann Schmidt aka The Red Skull.In conclusion, Captain America is an enjoyable watch despite it's few failings, it's not the very best Marvel comic movie i've seen, but it certainly isn't the worst.",Captain America - The First Avenger
319,bgsmall,"Promising premise, good storyline, slightly confusing ending",6,25 August 2018,"Caught this on C4+1 on Saturday on the last bank holiday weekend in August. I enjoyed the premise of the transformation of wimpy enlisted man to super solider. Also 'hydra' as a division of the Nazi war-machines special weapons development division was inspired. I thought there were elements of the film that would have benefited from greater development - i.e. notably the condensing of the 'energy' into cubes? especially at the end.The romantic thread with Hayley Atwell's character ('Agent ...') also add's an angle that doesn't stray (too often) into over-sentimentality. All in all, an enjoyable and 'retro-fitted' comic book genesis of a superhero.",Captain America - The First Avenger
320,michael-3204,Good movie about a good man,7,23 April 2016,"I could not have been less interested in a film about Captain America before seeing this, which I did only because I remain interested in Marvel's project of building its own cinematic universe and did not want to skip film #5. As it turned out, this is the first in the MCU seamlessly to tie the disparate elements together and to provide some context for ongoing and upcoming tensions and conflicts. It also delivers a rollicking good time and is easily the best film in the MCU since ""Iron Man.""As embodied (perfectly, including his actual body) by Chris Evans, Steve Rogers/Cap is neither the jingoistic super-soldier nor the ironic refutation of one that he might have been; he is, as Stanley Tucci's Dr. Erskine puts it, simply a good man. The story and screenplay do a great job of emphasizing the core values of what we, in the 21st Century, would want in an All-American hero (including, alas, the fact that he is still white, which might change someday) while also exploring the more cynical or less appealing uses to which others would put that hero. Director Joe Johnston's visual style deliberately recalls wartime propaganda films from both sides of the WWII, including the masterpieces of Leni Riefenstahl. Cap's chaste, tragic romance with Bucky ... um, Peggy Carter (beautifully played by not-so-secret weapon Haley Atwell) adds the right amount of pathos and reinforces the period sensibilities without overwhelming or distracting from the main story. If there's a weakness here, it's one common to Marvel films: the villain, Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), is too cartoonishly evil to take seriously as a threat. Weaving has a grand old time playing up Red Skull's megalomania, but as written the character lacks the cunning and cleverness that made Tom Hiddleston's Loki so formidable in ""Thor,"" the only film in the MCU so far to have a worthy villain. It might have been more interesting to spend more time with Hydra -- the film only hints at the threat Hydra poses to the established world order. Of course, there will be time for that in future movies and TV shows, but if these are the origin stories of both an important hero and a fiendish threat, the film ultimately delivers the first in spades and doesn't quite manage the second as effectively as it could have.",Captain America - The First Avenger
321,byrann_gowan,"One of Marvel's weakest, but still a good setup for an amazing hero",7,26 August 2018,"1942. America has just entered the war and Steve Rogers (played by Chris Evans) wants to join. However, he is skinny, small and extremely sick, so he is constantly rejected. That is, until Dr. Erskine (played by Academy Award Nominee Stanley Tucci) recruits him for a science experiment that turns him into a buff, healthy young man - namely, Captain America. Although initially used as a propaganda tool, he proves to be more than just a soldier when he rescues 400 soldiers from behind enemy lines, including his friend Bucky (played by Sebastian Stan). They, along with no-nonsense Colonel Chester Phillips (played by Academy Award Winner Tommy Lee Jones) and the beautiful agent Peggy Carter (played by Golden Globe Nominee Hayley Atwell) plot to take down Hydra leader Johann Schmidt, aka the Red Skull (played by Hugo Weaving), before he and the entire Hydra army unleash havoc on the world.Honestly, it's pretty typical origins story stuff here. There's nothing new and that's kind of a problem. We know what's going to happen; we know that the hero is going to save the day, fall in love with the girl, and become a true hero, etc. Director Joe Johnson kind of plays it safe and that's the films weak point.However, the actors all bring it up from mediocrity. Chris Evans, who was still reeling from his disastrous turn as the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies, finds the true hero that he was meant to play in Captain America. He is good; he is pure; he is ready to fight for the good of the people. Evans brings out that patriotism that Captain America imbues, proving that he was right for the role all along. All of the supporting actors are great as well. Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter is not a damsel in distress, but rather a woman of action in a time where women still stayed home during the war. She is more than capable of proving her own. Sebastian Stan is the best friend that everybody wants to have in this movie. Tommy Lee Jones, who also encountered a bit of failure in the Superhero genre with his disastrous turn as Two-Face in ""Batman Forever,"" more than makes up for that in his portrayal of the Colonel. He does have a couple of comical moments, but he is never loony like in said Batman film. And finally, while Red Skull isn't exactly compelling, Hugo Weaving has had a history of playing bad guy roles - looking at you, Mr. Smith - that he clearly relishes playing the over-the-top bad guy. Safe to say, he does it very well here. Like I said, not compelling, but definitely memorable and fun.Overall, I'd see this movie. It's not new territory, but it's fun and the actors are all having a good time doing it. It is a good set-up to The Avengers, as well as to the future Captain America movies.",Captain America - The First Avenger
322,pninson,Deja Vu All Over Again,3,29 January 2012,"Through most of this excruciatingly dull picture, I felt like I had seen this movie before. It brings to mind such duds as The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. It started off well but quickly became tedious. The same old stuff I've seen in a dozen superhero movies.Of the three Marvel adaptations released this year, I liked this one the least. Thor was fun; X-Men First Class was a bit overlong but not bad; but this one was tough to sit through. I played a couple of games of Words with Friends while I was watching, and was really glad I didn't get stuck in a theater with this one.Nice try, I guess, but the story doesn't engage your emotions on any level and is strictly by the numbers. If you haven't seen this yet ... you probably already have.",Captain America - The First Avenger
323,jafar-iqbal,A solid addition to the Marvel film collection,6,19 September 2012,"Maybe it was coincidental, but it's quite funny that the last Avenger to grace the big screen before the epic group project was the First Avenger. The film tells the story of Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a young man who agrees to take part in a top secret military experiment after being declared unfit for military service. The result? Rogers become Captain America, a super-soldier of sorts dedicated to fighting for America.This is a good film but, in some ways, what happens for 95% of the movie is irrelevant. A little harsh, yeah, but all I really wanted to know was how Captain America moves from the 1940s to the present day. And we don't really find that out until the very end. Until then, Captain America is busy fighting Nazis, especially the equally superpowered Red Skull (Hugo Weaving). Evans gets ample support from the likes of Tommy Lee Jones, Dominic Cooper and Hayley Atwell. That's all well and good, but everything is just a very long interlude for that interesting final five minutes.Still, it's an enjoyable enough movie that does a solid job of telling the Captain America story. I would happily watch a sequel, which is in the works.",Captain America - The First Avenger
324,BiiivAL,"""Captain America - all hysterics"" ©",8,8 June 2018,"For a long time I did not write reviews with sarcasm. So the skill is not lost for long ... And just then a worthy candidate came out - the concentration of Pathos in it is the same as the calories in the cake.A bit about the previous set of pictures. When gangsters ravage America, masked people begin to clear the streets and return the money of depositors to savings banks. When in America there is a desire at least somehow to take part in the European military conflict - masked people make landing operations into the deep rear of the enemy, demonstrating that only the star-striped forces know how to fight. Actually, the original idea: we have a very correct morally and physically strong soldier, and you all hide behind his shield - safely migrated from the old comic book into today's movie.It's fun to watch how the directors mask political agitation. Even the name removed the post with a residence permit. As if to the Russian spectator who is not in the tooth with his foot, what kind of ""Avengers"" are out there for 2012, it's not possible to reach the Wiktionary. No, in advertising materials it was necessary to move as far as possible ""Uncle Sam"", which in the film is so much that it becomes ridiculous. Eloquent posters ""I want you"", ten pieces of proud flags, a song and dance number in support of morale - but with emphasis on the strong will of the rickety ""simple guy from Brooklyn,"" he is recruited by the international (from the continent to the subject) , and the plot is torn down, before reaching May 45th. Why was it so easy to blame and reduce the degree of humor? Ideal picture for the final tape: SC, accompanied by a company of elite handsome Americans, thundering the Berlin bunker of Hitler and killing him, forcing him to listen to the US anthem.
Then the template story would fit perfectly: the evil nehrist finds an ancient and powerful artifact (the top of originality, right?) And tries to direct its power to the destruction of the old world. Massively stamps Tesla-guns, power tanks, mopeds, submarines, ""stealth"", the first tests are conducted on the sagging superiors, and all this for a couple of weeks at seven military sites scattered throughout Europe. The production is multi-purpose, since there is nowhere to screw the workpieces - the main hero attacks the bases, breaking everything down to the foundation, and, most importantly, the workshops are always ready to explode. But everything in the factory is environmentally friendly - it burns, it flushes, but no carbon monoxide is released, and the heroes breathe normally, they talk (super-people, yes, they can not).The main villain has a clearly worked out plan based on a technology that no brain can comprehend. There is a legion of soldiers, whom I can only call ""stormtroopers"". So stupid and harmless for the protagonist of the Nazis was not even in the ""Indiana Jones"". Here, at the first appearance of the correct guys with guns, they pretend to be hoses and stacked in stacks. The first assistant is ready to pass strategic plans for a plate of food. Is not it brilliant idea that a bad supermund in his lair to his soldiers pushes a speech in English? After all, they will soon be imbued with those great ideals of their underground organization.Generally funny inconsistencies in the movie car. A single submarine sailed behind a group of bad saboteurs (and logically, all but one were shot in advance). In the newspapers there is a picture of the hero with the door from the taxi, which, given that the cameras of the 40's is not a modern figure, but the tables on the legs, and the action-scene lasted about fifteen seconds, no one could do it, especially so clearly.Usually actors engaged in comic sets, even to praise for nothing - they just serve time in the frame. But this time a pleasant exception - the basic composition of familiar surnames perfectly rasproboval comedy stuffing tape and tried not to spoil it. Chris Evans was supposed to play a warrior with a code of honor and a sympathetic heart, and he qualitatively makes a frozen face in a heroic setting, but thaws with facial expressions and gestures during dialogues. Haley Atwell is responsible for the romantic component (symbolically arising after the acquisition of the hero pumped biceps), and in the romance the main thing is to look good. Therefore, the case is bright red lipstick and other mandatory make-up, successfully diverting the viewer's attention - it does not matter to him that in places the emotion is not reached to the level required by the stage.Shikaren Hugo Weaving with his falsh accent, which, most likely, will disappear in dubbing. Yes, if it remains, the voice will still not be the same, but it was the voice of the Australian that ""animated"" Agent Smith from the ""Matrix"", Megatron from the ""Transformers"", ""V"" from the same neonoire ... The main villain will lose a lot when localizing, alas, this inevitably - we will only have to look at the red computer face (well at least only from the second hour of the film). Tommy Lee Jones noted in the role of a kind and adequate colonel, in the view of which there is always a sparkle ""yes, yes, I understand everything"". Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones appeared in the image of German geniuses, separated by the front line, and Stan Lee ... Well, he as always, somewhere in the picture appeared for five seconds.
Three-dimensional graphics ... Music ... It was all, but it was not created as a separate layer of glaze, but as a cellophane package - just like a package that does not deliver any pleasure. It's not necessary to go to 3D, except in scenes where a round shield flies along a closed path, it's not impressive. Understand where the good, and where the ""storm troopers"", you can and on a simple screen (thanks to the sane operator and sane editor). According to the stylistics, the stellar composition, the absurdity of everything that is happening in the frame, the tape is very close to the Cobra Brooch, and even closer to the League of Outstanding Gentlemen. So with the preliminary assessment (go / do not go) I recommend doing a retrospective on these pictures, and also not to lose sight of the fact that all this is a preparatory stage for the ""Avengers"", where already there will be solid berries ... Continuous cloudberry ...",Captain America - The First Avenger
325,Small-Screen-Superman,"Okay, but hits an unhappy medium between cheesiness with taking itself semi-seriously",6,3 September 2015,"I watched this movie expecting it to be really great, as I'd heard tons of good things about it and I love the concept of Captain America as a character - a guy who captures feelings of patriotism, do-goodery, and somewhat old-fashioned ideals, and is relatively underpowered but still impressive, with a unique gimmick in his shield. Suffice it to say I was disappointed. It's far from being horrible or anything, Cap was certainly fun to watch at times, and I still like the basic concept. But overall it just didn't quite work for me.I'll confess, it's been a while since I watched it, so I don't remember a ton of specifics. But what I do remember is that overall, it seemed like it was trying to take itself at least mildly seriously, when in reality it felt quite cheesy and fake, without a hint of genuineness or true depth. I know asking for realism from superheroes can be stupid, and sometimes it's better to not even try and instead go a relatively cheesy route, but if you're going to do that, you have to actually EMBRACE it. This movie doesn't do that. I mean, it incorporates some humor, but overall it has the feel of generally ""playing it straight"", but not the movie to back it up.When it came to feeling a realistic sense of tension, I feel this movie fails. Like others have mentioned, Captain America comes across as invincible, despite the fact that his powers only consist of normal human attributes heightened to their absolute maximum capacity, but not actually pushed beyond that. You can complain about Superman, but at least his ""overpoweredness"" is internally consistent within the rules of the character himself. If someone existed with his powers, of course they'd be extremely powerful and successful. With Cap it doesn't make sense. This lack of tension was made much worse, though, when the normal soldiers were involved, as it felt like it was making real people's sacrifices into something rather cheesy. I'm not sure if it would be going too far to call it mildly disrespectful, but at best it didn't make sense. The overall pacing to keep up the tension was also pretty bad.I also remember the villain didn't really work for me either, probably thanks to the really cheesy mask and the overwrought Nazi- who-rebelled-against-the-other-Nazis premise. Why can't Cap just fight the regular Nazi group? Certainly Red Skull could just be working with and for the rest of the Nazis. Wouldn't that be more fitting and appealing? Having the character essentially be working against the rest of the Nazis puts the viewer in an awkward position, as we tend to see the Nazis as the ""ultimate"" bad guys, especially since they were actually REAL. It doesn't work as well for a movie with this premise and feels ""wrong"" to me.I think my overall problem with the movie was that it was in a realistic setting and seemed to want you to take it to be something relatively non-cheesy, but it failed in doing so. They even had an in-universe ""parody"" of sorts of the fanciful aspects of Cap by making Captain America start out as a character and a symbol rather than actually saving the day, and having him perform in front of people and comic books be made out of him. This seems to set up the movie itself as something different from those ""juvenile"" interpretations. And yet, it probably would've been a better movie if it hadn't tried to be realistic at all and instead been a goofy tribute to simpler times all the way through. Either that, or it could've been a ""deconstruction-reconstruction"" sort of deal, e.g. showing how life isn't all that simple and victory doesn't come so easy, but we need that purity, idealism and optimism embedded in the seemingly simplistic, or something along those lines. But it was neither, and ended up in a place where I can't really take it seriously but I can't just relish the over-the-top fun either.To be clear, I'm not saying this movie was terrible or anything. It was competently put together overall. It had enjoyable moments and some things were well-done. I'm just trying to express why, for me, it didn't ""click"".One last note: I won't spoil it, but the ending of the movie was really abrupt and not connected with the prior movie as much as it was setting up for a sequel, and really wasn't very good at all. But even worse than that ending is what comes afterward, which is almost literally an advertisement for The Avengers, except it's actually technically a part of the movie. That was the worst part of the entire movie for me. I absolutely hated it. Obviously, movie-makers want to make money, and there's nothing wrong with that, but I don't want to be slapped in the face with, ""Heyyyy, go check out this other movie we're making!!"" It takes me out of the movie itself and reminds me that this experience, this story, is a product made to be sold. It just comes across as shameless. It's the exact same sort of problem as excessive product placement, except worse because it's actually a short scene to itself, not something unobtrusively (or hopefully unobtrusively) sneaked in.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.""",8,24 April 2017,"As far as the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes it's hard to top its origin stories. With Iron Man,the incredible hulk and this taking the top spots. I always adored this film and I find it to be the one of the best origin stories regarding Marvel Studios'.In the simplest of terms Captain America: The First Avenger can be classified as a 1940's period piece. I think that's why the film works why it does. It takes it self as a war flick rather than a superhero movie. Sure it's regarded as one but I thing Joe Johnston did that on purpose. He directs with such an authentic and realized way that has every element falls into place perfectly. The set pieces he uses are absolutely fantastic and used well with practical effects to make this a technical achievement.Out of the entire Avengers team my favorite was always Captain America. He embodies Ameirca in every way, shape, and form. I love the character so much thanks to Chris Evans' stellar performance that shows all heroes are just trying to do the right thing. With Marvel films the villain is most likely always the complaint, yet in here Hugo Weaving's Red Skull is the second best in the MCU. He has motive, character, a reason for doing what he's doing, and it all works wonders. Need I say anything about Tommy Lee Jones or Stanley Tucci? They're perfect choices and play off of each other perfectly. Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes is my second favorite thing about the film. He is brought to life so well and he really just resonated with me on a different level.Clocking in at just over two hours, Captain Ameirca: The First Avenger finds it self to be highly rewatchable and entertaining more and more. The time flies and that's thanks to the great story. It's riveting and grabs your attention right from the start. It's quick humor moments land every time and make an impression. The fantasizing elects of myth to stick well with its time period and never feels out of place.On an overall scale Captain America: The First Avenger sits high and mighty among not only the superhero genre but any genre",Captain America - The First Avenger

""Dangit"" I had that type of feeling. Cap'in was dang fun, and awesome. If the producers would have just gave it a more simple vibe (keep one or two good action scenes and focus on the story) This all would have worked.Than there's a twist which attempts to make up for all this, which I respect. I can't go into detail as it is a spoiler. But this gives you another reason to watch. Overall I had a good time, but I did feel like this was Forced just to get the Avenger movie out.

But to my surprise ""Captain America"" turned out to be a solid and well made film. Honestly, I am not a Captain America fan and I was under the presumption that the film was going to flop. But the film is fun, well-written, and delightfully three dimensional fun that is reminiscent of old matinée action films but with a deeply felt message. Chris Evans is engaging and well-cast as Steve Rogers a/k/a Captain America, a plucky scrawny kid from Brooklyn trying to join the Army until he is selected for a top secret experiment where he genetically transformed into a superhero. Armed with a cast of strong supporting actors Stanley Tucci as the brilliant and wise scientist, Tommy Lee Jones playing his usual tough guy as he can only play it, Hugo Weaving as the bad guy, and Hayley Atwell as the lovely and brave love interest (yes, I love a good comic book movie where women are not objectified damsels in distress!).",Captain America - The First Avenger
329,fritzlang,The little engine that could,7,22 July 2011,"Just got back from seeing Captain America.First, the good news.They FINALLY got the origin story right for a change and kept to Kirby and Simon's plot! VERY accurate and Chris Evans was PERFECT to play the scrawny Steve Rogers. (with 2 exceptions I will note later).The humor was on point. I would say >95% of the humor worked, which is VERY impressive.The references to other Marvel characters were truly wonderful, and were seamlessly in the film. That is not a small feat! The action scenes were decent.Now, what I didn't like (SPOILERS!!!!) 1) Chris Evans was all wrong to play Captain America. I can't be 100% sure if it was his inability to play the part accurately, or if it was written like that in the script, or if it was the direction, but he played essentially the SAME character after the change!! He was STILL a scared, clueless kid from Brooklyn when he became Captain America - he was just stronger and had a cool shield. At no point, did he exude confidence or leadership qualities - which were the hallmark of CA in the comics.The only quality he had was 'the little engine who could.' he never gave up! Well, that is a very admirable quality but Captain America was far more than that. He had the kind of personality that would make anyone want to follow him. Evans never exuded that. And you always felt that Captain America could take on anybody and anything single handed. In the film, I felt that he was helpless without his elite team watching his back.2) Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull also suffered the same fate. He was an extremely weak villain. Any Nazi from any 1940's based war film was more terrifying that this guy. In fact, his Agent Smith from the Matrix was more intimidating than his portrayal of the Red Skull. Having a weak villain is never good in a super hero based film.3) I can accept some of the changes to the story, (such as the costume change actually made sense in the context of the film), but changing Bucky Barnes to be a grown up didn't make sense, and greatly lessened the impact of his demise.4) I think having CA as a secret identity worked better as defined in the comics. Having everyone know that Rogers was CA took away a major plot device in the comics that always added a nice touch of humor and mystery..5) The whole major plot twist of having him frozen in ice was not clearly made. Some people in the theater thought that the whole movie was a dream, and that Rogers was simply asleep for 70 years after the transformation. Showing Rogers in ICE would have been a much clearer choice, and drop the whole movie as a flashback device, which just had the film start off on the wrong foot (I actually had to double check my ticket stub to ensure I was in the right movie!! the tone was that 'off' to me).6) the ""Chorus Girl"" segment just went on WAAAY too long. The point was made in a few minutes, but it seemed to drag on to about 15 minutes or more and really slowed the film down for me.7) Too much of the film struck me as a sequel to ""The Rocketeer"" that the director did years ago. I appreciate the reference, but that was a very different movie that I didn't think need to have it look-n-feel ported over to this movie.In the end, I found myself nitpicking the film to death more than liking it, yet I also really enjoyed myself and would recommend it as a fun summer film. So at that level, it succeeds.But it could have been SO much better.Oh, and yes, you really should stick around after the end credits. Those few scenes were worth the price of admission.Unfortunately, those post-credit scenes show that Evans will once again be playing Captain America. I, for one, was hoping someone else would take his place in future movies.7/10",Captain America - The First Avenger

Captain America is played by Chris Evans and he just just perfect for the role i can't think of anyone else to play the lead role his sidekick Bucky Barnes played by Sebastian Stan and he is another person perfect for this role. the minor characters like Peggy Carter played by Hayley Atwell and Armin Zola played by Toby Jones who in there own were amazing minors with the addition of Tommy Lee Jones an Iconic actor. the villain the red skull is played by Hugo Weaving and he is the best version of the character.

331,slayerjmk95,The First Avenger,8,17 July 2011,"I was truly lucky to catch a preview screening of Captain America and i am ever so grateful because Cap is without a doubt one of the best Marvel-hero films of all time. Chris Evans was a great choice for Captain America, having his extremely heroic tendencies and his weaknesses (you see them progress from the beginning of the movie). He has no terrible lines and, coming from a comic-book fan, knows how to fill the shoes of a superhero without any real powers, during WWII. Joe Johnston was a fantastic choice as the director, with a pretty good 'track record' behind him (Hidalgo, Jurassic Park III, Jumanji, October Sky). Joe truly knows how to show us a sci-fi story during a historic time period without having any hiccups or mistakes that could bring the movie down greatly.Captain America is one of the greatest Marvel comic-book adaptations of all time and should not be missed, even if you aren't a comic book fan because Cap has everything any action/adventure movie would have to make it great.

333,andrewnmiller,The original American hero.,10,24 March 2015,"Growing up, I was never into Captain America, nor did I ever read the comics, so when I sat down to watch this film, I had no clue how it was going to turn out. Was it going to be a great action film or a schlocky mess? Well, I will say that while Captain America didn't blow my mind like Iron Man, Thor or Guardians of the Galaxy did, I still found it to be a very entertaining and engaging movie, from it's 1940's theme to it's great acting and fantastic action scenes.The film starts off in the frozen Arctic where a Russian oil team discovers something strange buried in the ice. They call up the Americans who slice through the ice and find a large aircraft under the snow and uncover a round read, white, and blue shield with a star upon it. The scene then cuts to a Norwegian village in March of 1942 where Johann Schmidt aka Red Skull seizes a mysterious item known as the Tesseract which boasts limitless power. Meanwhile, over in America, the U.S. army deems draftee Steve Rogers unfit for military service due to innumerable health problems, but Rogers doesn't give up and soon gets picked as a test subject for a ""super solider"" experiment and is injected with a unique serum. Following the experiment, Rogers emerges feeling taller and more robust but an undercover Hydra agent kills the doctor preforming the experiment and runs, but Steve chases and catches up with the agent but he takes a suicide pill before Rogers can get any information out of him. Now, Rogers dons the outfit of Captian America to order to take down Hydra's operations.Joe Johnston may not seem like the right man to direct a film like this, but given what he did on The Rocketeer, I can't think of a better director for the job. What he does is rather than make Captain America a dark, heavy superhero film like what Nolan did with Batman, he goes for a more fun call back to films like Riders of the Lost Ark, something the MCU has become so well known for and Captain America: The First Avenger sure doesn't hold back on it. The writing is truly fabulous with a mix of both humor and heart, the romance between Steve and Peggy feels natural, the pace of the movie is great and never once did it feel padded out or boring in any way nor did any of the humor. As with the other Marvel movies that I've seen so far, the casting is perfect. Chris Evans plays an excellent Captain America, bringing a lot of sincerity and heart to this character and he does it perfectly. During the first half of the film, Johnson slowly builds momentum to allow us time to get to know Rogers as a courageous little guy who suffers from the fury of bullies. This pitiful weakling through never lets anyone knock him down, and it's enjoyable to watch because Evans makes it look so genuine even with the computer effects. It's also very exhilarating to see a hero was isn't spending the whole movie moping around and play a true hero and rather than having Chris play Cap as a parody, the writers and the director take the character seriously and it pays off beautifully. Steve comes across as an incredibly interesting character, proving that the belief that an old-molded hero is lower to his anti-hero counterparts just isn't true. Hugo Weaving always plays a great villain and here, he is fantastic as the dark and menacing Red Skull. Tommy Lee Jones puts out a very convincing performance as Captain America's supervisor and even has a few humorous lines in the film. Haley Atwell is attractive, aggressive and just pain beautiful as Peggy Carter and the chemistry between her and Evens just trickles off the screen and makes for one of the MCU's best romances. Toby Jones is wonderful as a pitying, almost agreeable Arnim Zola. Stanly Tucci plays Dr. Erskine perfectly well and Dominic Cooper does a solid job playing Howard Stark as does Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes. Even Samuel Jackson makes a small cameo at the end of the movie teasing what is to come for the MCU.The visuals are fantastic and while they may not look realistic or look a bit too much like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, they are still impressive with some great usages of immense lenses help to make the movie look far more realistic then something like Transformers that use a massive amount of CGI.The action in this film is fantastic with a lot of slow-motion shots being used to great effect during the battle scenes with some stand-out action scenes for me being the car chase, Rogers rescuing the prisoners, and the final showdown between Cap and Red Skull. The visual effects look pretty good and really work well when it comes to the action scenes and when it comes to the musical score, Alan Silvesteri kills it once again by giving us one of best superhero scores in recent years and it hits all the right points that it has to. All and all, I would say Captain America: The First Avenger is definitely a great action thrill ride with a lot of heart thrown in and should be watched by any comic book film fan. Go give it a watch if you haven't already, you'll enjoy it.",Captain America - The First Avenger
334,SebMoz,"Great start, weak finish",6,11 November 2020,"Captain America: The First Avenger is a good film. Nothing less, nothing more. The first act of the movie is great, introducing us to the character of Steve Rogers and his struggles. Unfortunately, after he becomes Captain America, the movie loses a lot of its focus, and becomes a mindless action movie. On top of that, the action isn't especially well-filmed. The characters are overall pretty good, and the story itself is fine. Unfortunately, the Tesseract felt too much like a MacGuffin, and it didn't interest me much. The villain also felt a little boring, even if Hugo Weavings performance was good. All in all, the only thing keeping this movie from being mediocre after the first act is the character of Steve and his interactions with other people.",Captain America - The First Avenger
335,Badmoviessuck,It could have been something great,7,16 October 2018,"The first half of the movie was great.
It really managed to develop Steve rogers as a character and his motivation to why he wants to fight the war.
But after Steve rogers gets buff then the movie becomes decent if the second half was as good as the first, the movie would be a 9/10 cause the second half felt rushed.The characters in the movie where... eh.
it felt like they where just there, many of them never got developed.
the characters didn't make the movie better or worse.But the scene i despise is the scene where The blondie kisses Steve.
The reason they had that scene is so that there could be some problems with the relationship Steve and Peggy have but they just put the blondie in the movie never mentioned her before or after the movie and when Peggy was mad at Steve all got forgotten because Bucky died.
So there was no point in having that scene.Red skull was bad he was the generic super villain that wanted to win the war nothing special about him.The movie is good i feel like they needed to make the movie longer so that it could have been better but its overall a good movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger

When your film is like 15% montage you've got a problem then covering it with cringe dialogue and boring action sequences you have the worst MCU film.

339,Reel_starz,Captain America: First Avenger fights superhero fatigue - and wins,8,2 August 2011,"In many ways, Captain America: The First Avenger resembles its title character, that iconic symbol of good, ol'-fashioned, American patriotism. Like the Cap, this movie has been embellished with all the bells-and-whistles of modern-day technology, supported by state-of-the-art special effects and blatantly high production values, but just as Captain America is, deep down, still the scrawny, scrappy Steve Rogers, at the heart of the film lies the simple, noble intention of telling a good story and, hopefully, entertaining the audience while it's at it. It's this modesty that helps Captain America succeed where others have failed, or at least fallen short.Much has been made of the recent glut of superhero and comic book-based movies. There are only so many origin stories, prequels, sequels, spin-offs and reboots most people can take before they all begin to look the same. While I would argue that this genre is as valid as any other (romantic comedies have seen little internal change even though they've been around for decades, but do you ever hear someone demand they no longer be made?), the truth is that, though they may now be high in quantity, the quality of the majority of these superhero films has been sub-par. Perhaps this stems from the difficulty of balancing the needs of the comics' vicious, passionate fan bases with those of the average movie-goer. Regardless of the reasons, not since 2008's formidable duo of Iron Man and The Dark Knight has any superhero movie made a real impact; even box-office returns have largely been nothing special.Just when it looked like we'd have to wait yet another year, along comes Captain America. Though it is nowhere near as weighty or transcendent as Chris Nolan's Batman movies, it follows closer in the footsteps of Jon Favreau's surprise hit, which similarly took a B-list comic book character and turned him into the star of a wildly enjoyable blockbuster. Like Iron Man, Captain America works because, despite some flashy visuals, cartoonish action sequences and mythic gobbledy-gook, the film-makers and writers never lose sight of the characters or their motivations, keeping the story grounded even in its most fantastical moments. Recent Marvel films, like Iron Man 2, have felt like nothing more than superfluous and lazy marketing gimmicks whose soul purpose was to set up next year's The Avengers, which will unite all of Marvel's heroes in one film, but while studio execs probably had similar intentions for Captain America, Joe Johnston and his colleagues do not approach it as such. They treat it as a stand-alone film and, for the most part, the story arcs feel self-contained; the viewer's enjoyment is not dependent on prior knowledge or attachment based in separate movies or in the comics, though there are plenty of Easter eggs that will no doubt please those fans.The writing is unfussy, never overreaching in unnecessary attempts at grandeur, and the plot is easy to digest: basically, kill Nazis, or, more specifically, H.Y.D.R.A. soldiers, who are like super-Nazis with guns that shoot blue lasers instead of ordinary bullets. Though there are a few recognizable names and faces in the cast, Captain America benefits from a relative lack of true A-listers who might've made the production feel too crowded or chewed too much scenery. As our central hero, the very Aryan- (and buff)-looking Chris Evans does a fine job. Whether he is portraying Steve Rogers or his more muscular alter-ego, Evans never lets go of the heart and stubborn determination that drives his character from beginning to end. Among others, Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci and Toby Jones provide solid support, and Hugo Weaving still makes a mean villain, even if his German accent often sounds more like a British one. However, the real surprise here is unknown actress Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, who, in a breath of fresh air, is the first superhero heroine I can remember who is never forced into the role of victim or damsel-in-distress. Bearing a striking resemblance to Scarlett Johanssen, albeit with brown hair and a light British accent, Atwell plays Peggy Carter with grace and poise, more than holding her own against her more seasoned male counterparts.The film's only significant misstep comes at the end with an epilogue that is tacked on after the story's surprisingly emotional climax. Though comic book fans will be familiar with the twist, the conclusion lacks the closure needed to be truly satisfying. Fortunately, like Marvel's other movies, Captain America features a post-credits tag, and for the fanboys (and girls) out there, boy, oh, boy is it worth the wait.",Captain America - The First Avenger
340,Jona1988,Just a good movie,6,29 August 2011,"Let me start by getting one thing clear, Captain America is not a bad film. Just a major let down at least for me. It is actually quite alright movie overall but that is overshadowed by the disappointment streaming from because of what it could have been. It felt like it could and even would succeed in being more than just the average Marvel superhero movie. The trailers seemed really promising but after having seen the whole film one realises that there was nothing more than what was shown in the trailers and also stuff looked like being great turns out to be not quite so much. The set up is practically the usual becoming a true hero idea but still gets some fresh feel being set during WWII which I feel is not just a set piece and works fine. Even with the serious tone it sets there are some standard superhero silly stuff but never that it takes the overhand, it works quite alright. The tone, settings and old fashioned war music are the good parts of this. But sadly the lesser good parts seem to weigh over. The action which not seldom are the central parts of superhero movies feel really weak. Some critics have pointed out and enjoyed the kind of old time fight scenes, comparing them to Indiana Jones. OK they are old styled but that doesn't automatically make it great. The problems are a total lack of suspense or thrills, one never ever gets any feeling of excitement of what will happen and what cap will do next. Yes I know he is the hero and can't be really defeated but still one can create interest in action scenes involving those also. The cast is kind of good. Tommy Lee Jones is best not surprisingly. But Chris Evans just does not quite catch it, he looks cool once he's become Cap but the charm and substance in the performance to create any real relation between him and the audience is missing. When one is supposed the feel some sympathy or whatever I just give it a shrug of the shoulders. Red Skull is another failure. He seems to just fill the role that a hero needs a enemy. Hugo Weaving doesn't do a bad performance the problem is rather the directing or script. A villain in this kind of film is not scary but Red Skull is neither interesting, he is just there because he must. He is doing some evil stuff but at the end I've just forgotten what it was and why. A weak bad guy doesn't really create any thrill for the good guys fight against him. The rest of the minor roles are however perfectly alright, Hayley Atwell, Toby Jones and Stanley Tucci all very good. None of the Joe Johnston movies have had much of character development. I was worried when I first heard he was making Captain America. So I understand almost all I've pointed out here is negative but the thing is that the movie was such a disappointment and could definitely have been better. It's a alright movie but nothing more. It's better than THOR but my anticipation for The Avengers has declined again, which began with Iron Man 2. Not a bad movie but nothing more than just a good one, 6/10.",Captain America - The First Avenger
341,alanrayford,The colors in this movie don't run.,10,22 July 2011,"Here, in the States, we've an increasingly right-wing movement in the government that borders on being fanatical. Unemployment and underemployment are reaching all time highs. Corporations are pulling it in hand over fist while the average dude is losing out. Hell, if Congress can't figure out a way to raise the debt ceiling, by 8/2/11, the country defaults. Well here's ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (CATFA), to show what the USA used to stand for before all of thisother stuff.This is more than a good comic book movie. It's more than a good WWII movie. While CATFA involves themes such as bravery, compassion, love, integrity and strength, which are in no way exclusively American, this is still one hell of a good American movie.It's the forties, and ultra anemic Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is trying to enlist in the Army. He doesn't want to rack up a tally of confirmed kills or blindly surrender himself to the will of Uncle Sam. He only wants to do what he feels is right—even if it costs his life. However, while brave and true to a fault, he's too frail to be anything other than lightweight cannon fodder. But a chance encounter ultimately leads to Rogers becoming the epitome of human, physical potential. However, due to a tragedy, he's relegated to the USO circuit and not the front. He's a hit on stage with civilians, but the grunts in the field hold him in contempt. Then he hears Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), his old buddy, has been captured behind enemy lines. This leads to Rogers finally embracing his potential and saving not just the life of Barnes, but over 400 other POW's. With this, he finally earns the right to serve, the respect of his brothers at arms and the title of Captain America. Yes, the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) and Arnim Zola (Toby Jones) are present and in full effect. But this is much more about the shield slinger than they.I was distressed when Evans was announced as Steve Rogers. Well, that was a mistake because he smashed it right out of the park. He connected with the character in a way that made everything feel fresh and heartfelt. I knew the dude would end up on ice. But seeing it play out to the reactions of both Peggy Carter (Haley Atwell) and Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) took me by surprise in its power. Then, when Cap does wake up in 2011, I couldn't help but feel sorry for him over all he'd lost. That's about 35% script and 65% Evans' portrayal. The same can thankfully be said about every actor who worked on this film.As for the script and direction, they're also hitting homers. I was doubtful about the whole USO storyline. However, it showed how Captain America is more than muscles and a costume. It was also refreshing how the script ramped up the soldier over the super. Seeing C.A. and the Howling Commandos waging guerrilla war on Hydra was dead on and sold the military aspect of the story. It also showcased what makes this character unique in a sea of brightly colored, spandex clad characters that can fly, swing and slice through steel. This well crafted screenplay is complimented by Joe Johnston's surprisingly deft direction.It seems all the goodness Johnston didn't bring to ""The Wolfman"", he delivered, and then some, to this. When Cap was in action, every punch, kick and bounce of the shield was shot clearly for the audience to see. Certain scenes were shot in a way that non-verbally conveyed mood. The USO montage was effortlessly comical, yet disheartening. Contrarily, Rogers sitting in the remains of a bombed out bar visually expressed the extreme loneliness he felt over the death of his old friend. If I had to pick a highlight of Johnston's direction, however, it would be the final confrontation with Hydra.It goes from action (a motorcycle chase, Cap smacking down a handful of Hydra agents); to somber (Cap's outnumbered and taken before the Red Skull); back to action (the Howling Commandos assault, chasing the Skull down); to romantic (Cap and Carter sharing a kiss); back to action (Cap b-smacking more Hydra soldiers, an aerial dogfight, the final battle with the Red Skull); and then to morose (the sight of the tundra drawing nearer as Cap kept that plane in a nosedive). These shifts in tone never once felt jarring or forced. In the hands of ""The Wolfman's"" director, this would've been a mess. In the hands of THIS Johnston, everything was smooth sailing.Yeah, they probably could've shown how a post serum Rogers went through a grueling tutelage fit to make Bruce Wayne puke. They probably could've put more emphasis on his mastery of martial arts and acrobatic fighting style. They probably could've found some way to make the costume from the comics work. They probably could've portrayed Bucky exactly like the comics. Yep, they could've done all of this and more. But, who cares when this is already an excellent movie. The only real fault I can think of is CATFA felt a little short—not that it was rushed. I just wanted to see more. First there was ""Spiderman"" (2002). Then there was ""Batman Begins"" (2005). This was followed by ""The Incredible Hulk"" (2008). Well now there's ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) as the fourth flawless, highly satisfying comic-book based film.Now, on an overly politically minded aside (to tie this into my intro), maybe our esteemed congressman should take time to watch this flick. However unlikely, CATFA might just clear out the cobwebs and focus them on their duty, to their constituents, as opposed to party politics—just like Steve Rogers. At the very least they'd be entertained for 125 minutes, before getting back to the merry business of screwing so many over.",Captain America - The First Avenger

344,RyanEberhart,Great movie! Great special effects! Great Action!,9,16 July 2013,"I thought this movie was very well done. I liked the special effects, especially with Chris Evans as Steve Rogers before he is transformed into Captain America. The action scenes are great. I liked how Captain America rescued nearly 400 POWs almost single handed. This seems to wipe away any animosity Col. Chester Phillips may have had towards Steve Rogers.Captain America's love interest only connects at the end of the movie when Peggy Carter finally kisses Captain America before he jumps onto a plane for the final show down with Red Skull. After defeating Red Skull, Steve Rogers/Captain America has to crash the plane because it is carrying bombs that are due to destroy New York and several other major cities along the eastern seaboard of the United States. He completes his task of destroying the plane but he is talking to Peggy through the radio and promises to meet her for a date.After crashing the plane, it is assumed Captain America is Missing in Action. He is found and revived after spending 70 years in a sort of cryogenic stasis in the Arctic.Great movie! Can't wait for the sequel in 2014.",Captain America - The First Avenger
345,iReviewFilms,Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Captain America: The First Avenger,7,28 July 2011,"Set during World War II, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) a poorly yet determined man has only one goal- to join the army so that he can serve and protect his country. Due to his illnesses and diminished stature though he is rejected and turned away by every recruitment station he visits. A chance encounter with Dr. Erksine (Stanley Tucci) changes his fortunes and leads him to be accepted onto a secret project codename Project Rebirth where his honour and integrity gain him the chance to become a super soldier. He undergoes the transformation and becomes capable of near superhuman acts.Meanwhile in Germany, Johann Schmidt aka the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving), head of the Nazi exploratory research department HYDRA is building and army and technology that threatens to not only usurp Hitler but destroy the world. Captain America is tasked with stopping Schmitt and bringing the war to a premature end.I was looking forward to seeing Evans in his role as Captain America as I'd wanted to see if he had what it takes to be the leading star in a film rather than the supporting roles he's more used to. He passed with flying colours making the character his own from a skinny nobody to the patriotic propaganda spinning Captain America. The rest of the cast also performed well with Weaving a convincing bad guy (despite me wanting him to say Mr. Anderson) and Tommy Lee Jones adding his unique charisma to the hard as nails Colonel. I was less convinced with Hayley Atwell playing the love interest Peggy Carter as the chemistry wasn't there and she never really extracted any emotions from me good or bad.The action taken as a whole was good but I'm not sure that there was enough from Captain America. Sure he swung his shield and sent the opposition flying but I never felt that he was getting down and dirty for his cause. Some of the fighting scenes felt rushed and tended to be over before they had even begun. Also I understand Captain America's improved metabolism/regeneration properties cover up the fact he always looks like he's just walked out from make-up room #1 but I would still have liked to see him a bit beaten up and then recover for the next scene rather than looking as if he's just going for a stroll through the park. He never felt in peril which instantly removes any suspense that I should have been feeling for him.The story of his origins seemed to take president over the action and to a certain degree that's understandable- there is no movie without a plot, but I would have liked a smidge more action and a tad less talking. Luckily the film didn't give off that all American vibe that I thought it might with the patriotism healthily present rather than all engulfing. Likewise, the comedy flowed at a decent level with many short (as in height) jokes and other such one liners hitting their mark. Although for me, I found Red Skull to be the funniest merely for his appearance- he was not scary and just looked like he'd forgotten to lather himself in suntan lotion before a trip to the beach one day.The ending certainly adds its clout to The Avengers film due out next year. (You may want to hang around at the end for another post credit scene and a teaser trailer for said film). So where does this go in my list of Summer comic book heroes? I think it slots in nicely behind X-Men, just pipping Thor into second and is comfortably ahead of the Green Lantern.",Captain America - The First Avenger
346,twbond-00867,The First Avenger,10,25 April 2021,"Marvel Studios' Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) is how Marvel should be. The setting, storytelling, acting, and history is pretty spot on. Chris Evans has come a long way since Fantastic Four (2005) and Fantastic Four: The Rise of The Silver Surfer (2007). The ""First"" Avenger is a great representation of how a hero should be! His patriotism redefines modern heroes, and his long absence from movies signifies a great turning point to modern day audiences.His backstory is impressive. From an anorexic nobody to a leading, muscular somebody, gives cinema and Marvel fans something new. There is no origin including parents, and family, it's just about this one man who wants to do right in the sickly world of war, and with his physical appearance, he cannot! But... he can now after one promise.The film's villain; Johann Schmidt/Red Skull is a great villain to begin Cap's story, and Hugo Weaving does a great job at that. The cool-calculated love interest, that is of Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter is not only the beautiful love interest in the movie business, but her generic way of fighting abilities and her strong wit of heroism in a world where war was everywhere, Atwell sits well in the MCU as that character alone.Marvel Studios' Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) is the final solo MCU movie in Phase One, and it's kicked off the way it should. Chris Evans is the perfect First Avenger, the setting is great also, a hero in the early 20th Century can do just as well as heroes in today's time.Amazing!10/10.",Captain America - The First Avenger

348,brailsford,Finally a Captain America Movie... that doesn't suck,8,29 November 2017,"Looking back at the Captain America franchise over the years going all the way back to the characters creation a series of movie serial started a tradition of a more 40s type of hero, something that had a very hard time getting separated from the character. In the later comics the cap was preserved to be around in the future via getting frozen in ice. Travel forward to the 70s we have a 2 TV Movie that tries follow on the success of other live action TV Superhero shows like The Incredible Hulk and Spider-Man by making a sort of TV pilot for a modern day version of the character at that time. We wouldn't see another adaption til the 90s where we got another movie, that to be frank just wasn't very good.I went in kind of skeptical that the character would get another one of these portrayals going with a friend after we actually rewatched those other series to see what it was getting compared to.We left the theater pleasantly surprised The origin wasn't rushed but also didn't make it boring. It gave a backstory for the characters and in the end resulted in popularizing the Character of Samantha Carter enough to get her own TV Series later on in the franchise.My biggest gripe was it kind of took Red Skull out of the series. I believe Hugo Weaving said he didn't want to do the character again... but given the comic story of him, it doesn't even need to be him, heck at some times he actually uses Steve Roger's body so perhaps they might consider again at some point in infinity wars... but for now we'll have to wait.",Captain America - The First Avenger

350,Medacakathareal,A Solid Origin Story for the First Avenger,8,22 July 2011,"By no means is this film a masterpiece of cinema but at the same time, as a super-hero fan (read NERD) it was a thrilling, action-packed and witty work of fiction that kept me interested from beginning to end.Captain America finally has himself a big-budget Hollywood movie that's not only not bad, it's actually damn good. The origin story plays out exactly as it should. We meet Rogers before the transformation, when he's a scrawny kid from Brooklyn who desperately wants to do his part in WW2. Due to health issues and his pathetic physique and in spite of his strong moral character and courage, Steve Rogers just isn't cut out for combat. Luckily a secret science division of our armed forces (read forerunner of SHIELD) has acquired a German scientist, a defector who offers his super-soldier serum to create a new army. As you may have guessed from the trailer the plan to create an army doesn't work... well it does sort of, in that they create themselves a one man army in the form of Captain America.The strong points of the movie, other than the action sequences, are actually the characters. The movie does a decent job of making us feel for all of them and despite his hulking post-serum form Cap is a pretty normal guy. He's awkward around women, can't dance and is, really, just a guy from Brooklyn. The movie relies fairly heavily on comic-book style science which involves Nazis with ray-guns and metals like Vibranium (makes up Cap's shield). I should really call the villains Hydra agents, Cap spends most of the movie fighting NOT Nazis but an altogether more sinister enemy, Hydra, lead by the notorious Red Skull (Hugo Weaving).The acting is good as is most of the humor though there were a few gags that didn't quite connect with the audience and others that only seemed to connect with some.As for the action it was surprisingly sparse but that's far from a flaw, the movie prefers to focus on its characters and moves at just the right pace with just the right amount of action. I felt like cheering every time Cap bashed a baddie with his shield. I would easily put this film on par, or at least close to it, with Iron Man (2008) and Spider-Man (2002). Be sure to stick around for the scene after the credits, which is more a trailer for the Avengers. As much fun as this summer has been for Super-Hero fans next summer is gonna be a hell of a ride.It's about a 7.5 Out of 10 but I'll round it up to an 8 for managing to live up to my already high expectations.",Captain America - The First Avenger
351,ZuhayrRoha,The best origin story that gets better everything I watch it.,7,23 June 2020,"Steve Rogers, not a perfect soldier but a good man.The start is magnificent, I applaud Kevin Feige for making this movie set in 1940s. Skinny Steve does look a bit CGI now but it gets the job done. His inadequaty as a soldier was perfectly shown and him jumping on the granade was shown for him to be a good man.Steve & Bucky's relation was well planted for future. Steve & Peggy is one of my favourite ships of MCU, this movie has one of the most heartbreaking ending 'I had a date'. It gets better with Endgame.Captain America being shown as a propaganda figure, as a reference to comics, had some great laughs. And this inturn making him to step up to rescue other soldiers was a great storyline. But after that the story feels flat. Mostly because they skipped through a lot of war actions using montages. And the actions they included at aircraft & train weren't that good.Red Skull is just another big villain, they could have had some more character moments with him. Explains why Hugo didn't come back.
Dominic Copper nails the charming Howard Stark. Hayley Atwell is magnificent and she crushed the badass vibes of Peggy, loved her even in her own show.This movie connects well with Avengers and
Steve, the man out of time, just starting his great MCU journey. Love how the great character arc of Patriotism ends.",Captain America - The First Avenger
352,MarcusJ13,A solid superhero film,8,2 August 2011,"Captain America is not the best known superhero but from the look of the previews this looked promising. A superhero in the Second World War can work brilliantly if done properly but can fail if many aspects aren't done properly. The film delivered an interesting look, there was a obviously a great amount of effort gone into making the film look authentic. Altogether it did a good job of conveying the look. Chris Evans was fairly well cast in the role. The scenes prior to transformation were not too overdone event though it took a little while to see Captain America in his full pomp. I do think the writing could have done a better job giving the eventual Captain America Steve more of a personality. Even though characters can easily be mild mannered he didn't feel like enough of a man to be conveyed as much of a tortured character longing to serve his country. He much improved once he transformed and it didn't feel too abrupt like it easily could have done. Tommy Lee Jones despite in a not being in a lead role did well and had plenty of moments that stopped it becoming a melodrama. Hayley Atwell was fairly mediocre and seemed to play the token woman gearing up for the inevitable romance. Hugo Weaving did a decent job with what he was given but maybe it was more to do with the character and the fact that it was difficult for him to come across as genuinely menacing. Action wise it was very good but towards the end they tended to be shot in fairly dim conditions which wasn't great, this was perhaps an attempt to add grit to the film so I can't really condemn it as many big budget films look too clean. Apart from this it was very exciting throughout and even though it was intended for wide audiences the action is good enough and doesn't look like its been trimmed in any way to get a more family friendly rating. The pacing was good and we saw just enough of Captain America to get a sense of the character as well as the back story. I would have been worried if the film was only about an hour and a half because then we would have seen a rushed effort which dished out the action at every opportunity. We really got a plot line which felt compelling and was kept at a premium. All in all it was quite a solid entry into the genre and one of the better Marvel adaptations, better than some but not spectacular.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Evans gives a great performance as the Cap. He's supported by an excellent cast!
Hugo Weaving portrays the villainous Red Skull and while I do wish he had more screen time, he's still the best villain in the MCU Phase 1.I don't understand how this one is rated lower then Thor and Iron Man 2. It's way better then either of them.Two Thumbs up!",Captain America - The First Avenger

355,tgrock,"Very Mediocre, Very Few Redeeming Qualities",2,28 July 2011,"The movie is completely harmless to watch. There's lots of cheesy, feel good humor. The villains seem non-threatening and extremely hokey, as well as the origin of Captain America. How can this technology exist if we don't even have it today? (Laser Guns, Robots, Vaporizers) At one point, they mention Captain America's genetic code is different than his serum. They didn't even know anything about genetic codes and DNA back in the 1940s. Question: Why does the villain, Red Skull, have an actual Red Skull? The action scenes: at no point is Captain America in any danger nor do you really care about his character. He has basically no character flaws at all. Question: How does Captain America's shield come back to him every time?The visual effects: except for the impressive digitalizing of Steve Rogers before he becomes Captain America, the CGI looks basically like the same quality as the Matrix Redloaded at some points.The acting: Okay. No real stand out performances. Love relationship: Why is that woman in the military to begin with? I'm pretty sure that there were no women in that high of a position? At the end of the movie, she even goes into battle. Maybe a nurse would've been more believable. I don't recommend this if you hate the movie Avatar: it's very similar, but a little better than that one as well as being similar to the 2nd half of The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.Rating: Avatar(Rating names are based off of films of the same name that happen to be as bad or as good as the film being reviewed.)",Captain America - The First Avenger

Chris Evans shines in the role and you are rooting for him throughout both before and after his transformation. Tommy lee is great, Chris Evans suits Steve Rogers an the clever shrinking of him was believable in places. The ending had a great setup for the avengers.Chris Evans was great as Captain America. He nailed the character. After watching him as Captain America, I can't see anyone else in the role. The special effects performed on him to make him look skinny for the first part of the movie were absolutely seamless. If I hadn't known about them, I wouldn't have been able to tell they were there. But those effects would not have looked nearly so great if it had not been for Evans convincingly ""acting skinny"". No matter what condition Steve Rogers is in, shrimp or super soldier, Chris Evans portrayed him flawlessly.Before he became strong, his bully yelling ""Had Enough?!"" Steven stands up, holding a garbage can like a shield and says ""I could do this all day."" ""I could do this all day"" becomes a spirit of Captain America and encourage him never give up. ---Yidioo",Captain America - The First Avenger

360,TourettesPersonal,Retro Blast,8,29 July 2011,"Captain America: The First Avenger is a pretty decent film by its own merits. Showing the good old retro style and production design, since this film is directed by Joe Johnson who is capable of portraying the old times perfectly. Chris Evans did a great job as Captain America. Some of the action scenes are disappointingly unexciting but at least the CGI effects are eye candy. The movie ends with true patriotic heroism and full of heart. Definitely not new but it's still enjoyable.The trope of Captain America: The First Avenger has been reused by so many superhero movies. A good guy who is a weakling became powerful then eventually saves the day. It's definitely not innovating even for the people who've never read the comics but it's a relic. Well made production design & the old fashion score. Most battle scenes are montages. The action scenes are large. It can be watchable but some of them are pretty bland and poorly directed.The joys and the thrills mostly goes to the performances. Nothing goes wrong with Chris Evans. He did a decent job as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Hugo Weaving is fun to watch by his campiness and menace for the Red Skull. Tommy Lee Jones is the comic relief here. The special effects are everywhere. Skinny Chris Evans and the background of the 1940s. Well, they are good enough for this film.Plenty of things worked in the end. Captain America: The First Avenger is a relic in its old fashion style but a little messy when it comes to the editing of the action scenes, but it's still enjoyable. Patriotic heroism, full of heart, Chris Evans, and decent production design. Marvel Studios and Joe Johnston really beats the awful 1990s version. The action could have been better but their flaws can be ignored. It's fun enough as a superhero movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger
361,bigcalkenobi,Captain America: The First Avenger is a really good old fashioned adventure movie that will certainly entertain audiences and please fanboys,8,27 July 2011,"Sigh. Another superhero movie this summer? This will have been the fourth major superhero movie this summer and by this point most of us are tired of it. The only shot Captain America has this summer is doing something different than its other competition by giving us an experience we haven't seen this summer. Luckily Captain America does just that. The movie is a period film set in the 1940s that also tries to feel like the serials that were popular at the time. The movie has a very old school feel to it which separates it from its competition, but can its retro style really make it one of the better films of the summer?Check out the rest at http://mastersfilmreview.wordpress.com",Captain America - The First Avenger

363,brodlimmel,Americaaaaaaa!,8,7 August 2011,First off this review may be bias because I am a Captain America fan and this movie is great. Now if you know nothing about the character then you may not like it as much but that is with any type of comic adaptation. So lets start from the beginning it starts with Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) being this small weak guy who just wants to serve his country but he can't due to his physical stature. Now thats great because it shows how this character is full of heart and it really makes him respect his power when he gets it. The middle after he becomes the captain is great he doesn't go straight to war he is selling war bonds and introduces his yes ridiculous costume. Now the villain the Red Skull is not that interesting he is just evil Nazi guy in short terms the actor who plays him does great but his story was just boring. This movie excels at all the little hints and easter eggs it does for the comic fans like having Dumb Dumb Dugan and the original Captain America costume. The end with no spoilers this ending is great the end fight with Captain America and the Red Skull is great. Now sadly no this isn't the best comic movie but it is so worth the ticket price and later even a DVD purchase this movie is just a lot of fun and you will love the ride it takes you on.,Captain America - The First Avenger

365,Fourstrawberries,"They keep doing this, Hollywood Script Writers......",9,10 December 2011,"what do you call a superhero in a world of superheroes? Answer...normal. Green Lantern was totally ruined by making the first and the last movie in one go, same with Thor. Why can't we have a superhero who lives in the real world, dealing with real world problems. We didn't need Red Skull in this movie until at least movie two. A whole world war with both side racing to make atomic bombs was enough for movie one. These super hero movies are too much too quick. Slow down Hollywood. Anyway, Captain America is BY FAR the best of the recent superhero movies. Steve Rogers has much in common with Peter Parker. People you can genuinely like and care about. A great standard of film making throughout. No SFX overkill (Green Lantern) and the wonderful, irreplaceable Tommy Lee Jones. Definitely one for my collection!",Captain America - The First Avenger

None the less the story is nothing special and the pacing is all over the place keeping it from being one of Marvel's several great origin stories.",Captain America - The First Avenger
367,jan_kalina,"""I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.""",7,14 August 2011,"The film business is flooded with superhero films. I think that the audience is being tired of those films too. These movies always have to start with this origin movie - movie where our hero/superhero is introduced and these origin movies are pretty much the same story over and over every single time. They are interesting if we've got an interesting character like Iron Man, Wolverine, Hulk - men with flaws. I've never liked Superman - he was just too (for lack of a better word) good. The same thing is with Captain America, he is such a goodie goodie. That brings me to the main problem with this movie - the characters. The characters in this movie are not very much established, they are very one-dimensional and so the audience can't create any feelings for them.Chris Evans has proved before that he is a good actor, playing this cocky Johnny Storm, or nerdy hacker in The Losers. Here he plays a wimpy and skinny Steve Rogers, a man turned through ""science"" into a superman. He has just one goal to help people fighting in the war. Hayley Atwell is very good looking woman but she has no purpose than just to provide a love story which is very uninteresting in this movie, not like the other Marvel movies. Hugo Weaving is great as usual but again pretty one-dimensional character. Tommy Lee Jones stands out as the Colonel Chester Phillips. He has the best one-liners in the movie. Tommy Lee Jones never disappoints and delivers another grumpy man turned to faith in the main hero. (I've always liked how they incorporated a Stan Lee's cameo into the movie and into the plot but here it was quite unnecessary) When you go see a blockbuster summer movie, you expect great action scenes. Well, you don't get them here. The action scenes are very average and the addition of throwing shield as a weapon is going to change much. The setting of the movie is within this futuristic retro World War II and I didn't like this messing with history, that Captain was fighting this science Nazi division and all that. I know I shouldn't take this movie too seriously but all these futuristic machines in this retro setting were just way over the top.Another thing is this movie feels very rushed, there isn't much happening but it just quickly wants to get to the end, so we would be excited for the next big movie from Marvel studios, The Avengers. Sure, it makes you excited for The Avengers, especially if you wait till the end of the credits as usual for a little teaser, but I wanted high quality movie like Thor or Iron Man. The movie is just too straightforward, full of clichés and it has way too formulaic plot. The film starts out well, in an interesting way but when our main hero is transformed into Captain America it just goes down the same route we have seen before in hundreds of other movies. Nothing new here.",Captain America - The First Avenger
368,JoshSharpe,Highly entertaining,9,22 September 2012,"Have you ever dreamt of being an American hero? Steve Rodgers certainly has but he hasn't yet found much success in making his fantasy become a reality. Steve is small, weak, and awkward. He has tried to enlist in Army but has been refused. After meeting a friendly doctor who decides to give him a try, he joins the Army and soon after becomes part of an experiment to test drugs that will strengthen him and give him a better chance to be successful. While all this is going on, a madman named Schmidt is attempting to take over the world. This film, set in the 1940s, feels more like a war movie than a superhero movie. Either way however, director Joe Johnston pulls it off and does it very well. It is highly entertaining, with perfect acting, grand sets, and a first-class story. I especially liked Tommy Lee Jones' performance as the rough colonel. As it began, I was comparing the characters of Steve Rodgers and Peter Parker, from Spider-Man, who both are week and not at all hero-like but become powerful as the stories go on. However, there couldn't be a bigger difference between the two because Steve Rodgers is so much more of a stronger and likable character altogether. Although it starts out slow and some of it is a bit silly, the entire movie is a joy to watch and everything comes together in an unforgettable picture.",Captain America - The First Avenger
369,anoceanroars,Captain America Needs Help,8,16 November 2011,"The films starts off nicely. The set up is great, in which we can see a puny Steve Rogers wanting to be more than he can be, by trying to join the war to help his country.Unfortunately, the government turns away the scrappy guys, so he cannot get in to fight. Enter Dr. Erksine with an experiment that could possibly changes things for our little outcast. The experiment works and then the doctor is assassinated, so things seem not so good for Steve. He even goes on the road, also starring in some films before he is taking serious when his comrades in war need him. It is the adventure of a lifetime for Rogers, who will become Captain America, then the films falls apart. It becomes a little boring and predictable. The fault is not the cast, especially Chris Evans, who shines in this role as an all American hero. He is perfect for the role. The fault does lie in the writers and directors hands. The direction seems aimless and the story loses momentum half-way through.

371,FloodClearwater,The Beating Heart of Marvel on Film,9,27 August 2015,"This now-beloved film combines the best elements of three wildly different action genres:>) a superhero film; >) a science fiction film; and>) a World War II caper film. It has a dream cast, and the production team does not whiff on the ball once the cast is dressed, assembled, and ready for the cameras to roll. Chris Evans as Steve ""Captain America"" Rogers is equally good as the skinny kid who gets kicked around and overlooked and as the rippling miracle of expropriated-to-Manhattan Nazi war science who could MMA with Thor. Hayley Atwell positively smolders, then ices, then smolders again as Agent Peggy Carter. The scene where Cap gets kissed by the saucy British HQ girl and Peggy goes 'laser eyes' on Cap is only one of several highlights Atwell supplies that humanize and balance the story.Hugo Weaving is Red Skull. Red Skull! Easily the best villain ever pulled off by a superhero movie, patently the best Marvel Comics villain yet wrought in a Marvel Studios-made film. Weaving surpasses even his benchmark-setting work in The Matrix in this role.The major supporting actors. Are you ready for this? Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Toby Jones. So it's Oscar-Nom City in the second rank. Unreal. Unheard of. Unexpected. But wait . . . there's more. Cap has a ""Top Squad,"" the world's first superhero led strike team. And these actors are also of platinum- coated quality. The favorite is Neal McDonough as ""Dumb Dumb Dugan,"" and Kenneth Choi as ""Morita"" and JJ Feild (who would soon win acclaim as Major John Andre in AMC's TURN: Washington's Spies TV show) also merit special mention. And just when you thought 'A Top Squad? That's so easy, Cap wins, hands down.' Oh, no no no no no. Because HYDRA. HYDRA. A group of intra-Nazi bad guys so bad, and with such advanced stuff (including (MCU nerd bait alert) a shrouded Infinity Stone, that they give Hitler the what-for (so the film alludes)). HYDRA don't care about no Top Squad. And so the film creates collisions of vectored grim machine-gun-on- lasers action, and just enough of it to make a spectacle without making our eyes into a smoking junkyard. Avengers, Shmavengers. This Captain America film is the beating heart of Marvel-on-Celluloid. A group of actors this good may never again appear together in a film this fun.",Captain America - The First Avenger

But it was version well told. Also I think Stanly Tucchi and Tommy Lee Jones take the movie a the next level.

377,Seller7862,Enjoyable action flick,10,6 June 2014,"Many reviewers will be turned off by the politics. In other words, anything pro-American is looked at with disdain.

Not sure when this self-hating strain became a tsunami but I think the 60s would be a good guess for it's genesis.This film should be rated higher than 6.8. It's a nice little WW2 movie spiced up with sci-fiction and spy movie action.

378,benjicaunce-19647,I Liked It Better When It Wasn't Being An Action Film,7,19 February 2021,"In the campy, ridiculous world of comic books, Captain America and the Red Skull have the potential to be some of the most goofy characters in a goofy universe. Thankfully, The First Avenger doesn't falter in such ways, and can actually be rather interesting to watch. The dialogue is overall done well, and the overarching narrative is well written and thought out. In my opinion, the film falters when it is forced to be a superhero movie. Because all the ideas that are brought up are very interesting, and a Nazi cult let by an insane man who believes himself a God could have been an extremely threatening foe if Captain America didn't blow up every fortress and factory they had with ease and beat them up harder than an amateur going up against Ali. I understand that superhero films have to contain a certain amount of action in order to draw in the more casual geeks, but if we've learned anything in the past few years with the explosion of the comic book movie is that audiences are open to experimentation with the formula. And a slower paced film would have much better fitted the narrative that a generic action movie that offers nothing new to that genre. The first third to half of the film was really good, but when it became just another superhero film I lost interest in it. There are a few good moments after that, but all the praise I had for the film was quickly lost after Cap suited up and went off to war with his chums.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I also failed to understand why the Red Skeleton had a stick up his butt and wanted to destroy the world. I would have liked a motive, but it's a comic book story so I understand that characters are allowed to be flat and one dimensional.It's an alright movie, fun to watch on a summer night, turn your brain off, eat popcorn, watch explosions, but not something that I have any desire to watch again or own.",Captain America - The First Avenger

383,kelboy10,Right on Cap,7,2 November 2019,"The story of Steve Roger is unprecedented in cinema until now. Unlike most comic book movies this film is set in the 1940s. Rogers is your everyday nice but skinny weak looking guy who cares about others. A man who would be seen as the last you'd send into battle, but maybe...just maybe, the man with the biggest heard. Chris Evans is a splendid choice as our protagonist Captain America, and the scene where he dives over the grenade makes you feel another level of emotion. Picked to become a super soldier for his uniqueness, intellect and heart, Steve Rogers must lead soldiers into war to stop his ultimate nemesis Schmidt aka the red skull. With the side story of Rogers and Agent Carter slowly falling for each other. Both willing to wait for the right partner. Carter and Rogers must first get through a threat maybe even worse than Hitler himself. Hayley Atwell provides a strong independent woman in Carter and has depths of emotion towards the end. Rogers is rejected from doing his part in the army to begin with for being to small in stature. Tommy Lee Jones character Chester Philips had little faith in Rogers and is mainly standard Tommy Lee probably slightly under used as this character. The red skull is very caricatured and typical of what you expect a comic villain set in World War Two to be. Admittedly Hugo Weaving doesn't really stand out as an amazing charismatic villain or even as of much threat as he could have. Overall the setting are well related to the time and the Visual effects and stunts are fantastic like most marvel films. The props work well with the CGI and this one is overly flooded with computer visuals.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Examples: We know Steve Rogers is sickly, wimpy and weak. There was no need to belabor the point for a good portion of the movie.The ""buy bonds"" scenes. He was being used a a pawn to sell war bonds. Was it necessary to devote ~20 minutes to show him being turned into a caricature? Throw-away HYDRA soldiers. These were supposedly elite NAZI troops converted to serve HYDRA. In battle, they looked like they didn't know how to use their own weapons and were killed en masses. Additionally, foes were were able to easily take their weapons and use them on them.Red Skull's final act at the end was puzzling, it absolutely made no sense. The man is obviously mad as a hatter but is not stupid.Still, worth a strong 7 rating in my opinion.",Captain America - The First Avenger

(which you obviously don't know anything about, it's just a movie for me. xD) It's got that typical Heroes vs Villain theme! And that's what I like about these kind of movies. One bad thing about the movie was that it sometimes was a bit slow, it became a bit boring, and it felt like I trod on the same spot. But when something actually happened it was hard not to follow. I LOVED the action part in it. But that's something obvious if you watch any ""hero"" movie! ;)The costume design is fantastic, and I actually like ""Red face""! I read lots of bad criticism about him which I don't understand! HE IS GOOD, don't believe what you read! So... who should watch this movie? Someone who likes comic-books, probably.

So i made it my quest over this year to watch all of them in order. Captain America is a solid start to this quest and does a good job of setting out the style and substance of these films. Steve Rogers is a very relatable, memorable character and this film really allows us as viewers to connect with him.

It's ever better when it's about a superhero!To be honest, I didn't grow up watching a lot of Captain America, but I have heard of him from friends and family. When this movie came out, I had to watch it because I'm a huge Marvel fan. And this show did not disappoint. It was great to watch the origin story of Captain America, how he became the superhero we know him to be, and to see glimpses of how he could possibly fit in with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Unlike some action films that are fully packed with CGI with minimal story weight, Captain American had both: great CGI alongside great storytelling with strong depth and emotion. I enjoyed how it was more closely tied to reality than most other superhero movies, and I enjoyed how Chris Evans portrayed Captain American as the brave solider who is always fighting for good. Overall, I enjoyed the movie immensely. The only thing I would recommend is that we see more of Captain American's fighting potential in the next film: The Winter Soldier!",Captain America - The First Avenger

Unfortunately he's just not fit enough. After trying several times and being rejected as medically unfit he is spotted by a scientist Dr Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) who is impressed by his relentlessness. He has him recruited to a special scientific division under the command of Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) in the care of sexy English agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). Rogers is picked for a pioneering experiment to create a super soldier. Using a mixture of Erskine's super-soldier serum and technology provided by Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) (Iron Man Tony Stark's father) weedy CGI Rogers turn into a big beautiful pumped-up Chris Evans.Erskine is German but he fled from Germany when his super-soldier experiments there went badly wrong and transformed the Nazi Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) into the megalomaniacal Red Skull. Red Skull is determined to take over the world for himself and to do this he acquires the Cosmic Cube an artifact left by Norse 'gods' which his pet scientist Arnim Zola (Toby Jones) uses to create weapons. He also forms his own fanatically loyal army of followers called Hydra.To prevent the Americans destroying his advantage Red Skull sends an agent to kill Dr Erskine and destroy his experiments. He manages to kill Erskine but is too late to destroy the experiment. However without Erskine the super-soldier experiment is abandoned.Rogers is recruited to front a publicity campaign for war bonds, touring the country with dancing-girls in a cheesy Captain America costume. But it is not enough for Rogers and he wants to get involved in the fighting. When he hears that Red Skull has captured a large number of allied troops including his childhood friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Rogers goes behind enemy lines alone to the Hydra base and rescues almost 400 troops, including Bucky.The story continues with Rogers being equipped with a leather Captain America costume, being given his iconic shield and hand-picking a squad of men to go around Europe wrecking Hydra's bases and trying to stop Red Skull's plans to dominate the world by destroying huge chunks of it.This is film is a fine lead in to next year's Avengers film and it really does a great job of setting up Cap's back story. The wartime setting was pretty well done and I wouldn't have minded seeing another Captain America film set back in that time but I doubt that will happen very soon. Red Skull was a bit of a one-note villain and his only motivation seems to be that he is mad and evil (which just like the comic-book character I suppose). It may not as good as Iron Man but it is better than Thor and the Incredible Hulk and has raised the stakes for The Avengers .

I know its Captain America and its better than the previous versions, but it is still unbearable not to rif on.OK, ignoring one lousy editing shot around the end, the movie has good visuals and feels adequate. It's what many wanted out of such a movie after previous failed attempts.But the main hero is a hypocritical boy scout. He says he doesn't want to kill anybody, yet desperately try's to enlist into the war as a soldier, and in the end deliberately throws enemy soldiers out of a airborne bomber.The first half of the movie is about a CGI man in his 30es, as it's impossible to take that voice seriously with that body. Any skinny stand-in would have sufficed for this, but they decided to dangle CG for 40 minutes in front of us and think we would not notice. And then they make a pro-steroid add outright into a hulk rip-off.The idea to throw the Red skull as an independent German villain during WWII is just insane. His Hydra monologues sound like he thinks being slapped by the enemy makes him stronger. His superweapons are overpowerfull, but never properly utilized because his soldiers are stromtrooper dumb. And where does he get his easily replaceable loyal henchmen in such numbers? Not from the Hitler loving loyalist Nazis that's for shore.But what's really unbearable is how the two powers meet every time. Nobody can see some guy skulking around at a well lit military base, or fire anywhere other than at his shield, which covers only 1/3 of his body. Hell, the badguys even have flamethrowers to deal with the guy, but every time something stupid saves his hide.Oh, and the ending ""I wanted to bring you in slow"" and that's why I even made you a fake girlfriend and put you into an easily escapable facility in the middle of NY, after which you get a very odd looking finger by Uncle Sam.Its too insane not to rif on.

397,Vinegaroon3,Mediocre at BEST....no....it's simply bad.,3,28 July 2011,"I really wanted to like this movie. After all the terrible superhero movies that have been released lately, I was somehow hoping that ""Captain America"" would be different. It wasn't.I liked the idea of the idealistic but physically weak protagonist who was impossibly patriotic, but beyond that the movie completely fails. I have never understood why superhero movies always feel the need to go completely over the top with outrageous super-villains. In this film Hugo Weaving plays Red Skull. The Red Skull mask looks like something a kid would wear for Halloween...it's that cheesy. Red Skull is apparently possessed with powers similar to Captain America, but also has at his disposal an army of minions with very advanced (and largely unexplained) technology weapons. Yet, these laser beam style weapons seem to do nothing for them.I guess I don't get it. Would it not have been enough for Captain America to simply be involved in fighting the Nazi juggernaut portrayed in a fashion similar to what history recorded? Wouldn't the Nazis be adequate villains for anyone? If I seem to be dwelling on this issue, it is because for me the silly, cheesy ""bad guys"" really ruined this movie.The movie also fails because it is obvious from the beginning that Captain America is basically invulnerable. It is very clear early on that nothing is going to happen to him. I was under the impression that his ""powers"" consisted of nothing more than being extremely strong and athletic, yet his antics in the movie remind one more of Superman. Captain America's shield certainly cannot shield everything, yet the protagonist is apparently completely immune to the effects of gunfire and laser blasts. Yawn. Even Superman had his kryptonite....I imagine the superhero formula is more difficult to pull off than it might appear, and this movie fails yet again. It is largely silly and boring.I would recommend that you skip it.",Captain America - The First Avenger
398,jgregg42,Captain America is a Three Star General,6,23 July 2011,"Does America need another hero? Not a dark brooding hero like Batman. Nor a cocky scientist like Iron Man. Certainly not a weenie teenager like Spider Man. But a hero who wants to be a hero because it is the noble thing to do, to sacrifice himself for God and Country. I think we need someone like that to lift our spirits right now. Is that hero going to be Steve Rogers? But who is Steve Rogers? Rogers (played by Chris Evans) is a skinny, asthmatic kid from Brooklyn who is trying his hardest to enroll in the US Army during World War II to fight the Nazis. His intentions are honest; he hates bullies and wants to help stop the Nazis. He is discovered by Doctor Erksine (played by Stanley Tucci) who recruits him to be involved in an new experiment to make a super solider for the Army. Rogers willing accepts. Things aren't easy for him in boot camp, although he has heart, he is still a weakling. Think of him as the Rudy of the super hero world. He also has Col. Chester Phillips (played by Tommy Lee Jones) who doesn't want him in his Army. To fix all of this Rogers is injected with a serum to turn him from a bean pole to a mega man in literally minutes. After the experiment Rogers doesn't become the super hero Captain America we know today. He is in a holding pattern, the Army finds no use of him and he becomes a pitchman selling war bonds in musicals traveling across the US and war torn Italy. Meanwhile, in Nazi occupied Europe, Super Nazi Johann Schmidt (played by Hugo Weaving) is on his quest to find a blue cube of power so he can supersede from the Nazi army to take over the world himself. He even started his own army, HYDRA, who has a strong belief in folklore and mystical powers. While in Italy Rogers finds out that his best friend is trapped behind enemy lines and soon he makes a daring decision to save him from HYDRA. It is here Rogers truly becomes Captain America and leads his troops home. It is also revealed that Schmidt has a secret similar to Captain America, they both were experiments of Dr. Erskine. While Rogers became Captain America, Schmidt's experiment didn't go as well and he became Red Skull (I think the name says it all). The director, Joe Johnston (Jumanji, The Rocketeer) takes a lazy approach to establish Captain America's heroics by gluing together a montage of fight scenes with no real story to back them up. We see a lot of action for a few minutes then go back to the rest of the story of Captain America on the hunt for Red Skull. Should you see this movie? Sure, being part of the Avengers series makes it somewhat necessary to see it before next year when the Avengers movie is released. As with Iron Man and Thor, it is still a good stand alone movie (Note to Iron Man fans: we are introduced to Tony Stark's father in this film). There is enough action, humor and romance to hold the story together.Jones is the stand-out actor in this troupe with his stern but humorous delivery of his lines. He gives the film some pick up when Evans' lines are falling flat. Spoiler alert: Unlike the other films in this series, don't waste your time waiting for the secret clip after the credits role.",Captain America - The First Avenger
399,mjk280,Pleasantly surprised,7,8 August 2012,"I didn't really have any expectations going into this one. It was released right at the time when I simply felt there were just too many super hero movies being released. I assumed Marvel's temptation to gild the lily meant a decrease in quality, but I found Captain America to be pretty entertaining with a minimum of silliness.I can't begin dissecting the movie without first mentioning the way they handled the physical change of the main character. It was done brilliantly in my opinion. My number one complaint with movies these days is the liberal use of CGI, a lot of which I find very distracting. In this case however I think it was about as seamless as you're going to get. When I logged on to IMDb to learn more about the film I was pleased to read about the clever body morphing used and actual movie-making techniques that were combined to create what I feel is a masterful success. Evans has a bit of a deep voice so that was a little distracting to me when he was a small guy early in the film, but other than that I really don't think they could've done a better job. I was already impressed at that point, but the rest of the movie is pretty good too. It could be accused of taking it's time but the story arc of Cap was rich and thorough which I appreciated. Tommy Lee Jones was a pleasant surprise and was a good choice for his role if you ask me. It was also nice to see Hugo Weaving in a role that's unique to his usual Mr. Smith or Elrond shticks which I was afraid he was getting too comfortable with. On a random note, I thought they did a good job with the costume as well. The mask was a little goofy but it actually fit right in when you think of the 1940s war motif so overall I thought they pulled it off. Lastly I really liked the ending. I knew Cap was frozen originally in the comics so I was wondering where they were going with that and they didn't disappoint.I was so very glad I took a chance on this one, but I will admit to having some slight criticisms. The ""super weapons"" that Hydra was carrying around create some issues. It seems like their guns can penetrate pretty much anything, but during the prisoner escape scene our heroes have no problem mowing down bad guys and blowing up enemy vehicles while you don't even see a Hydra soldier even fire at them. Too much of a shooting gallery, and any time Cap got in some trouble the bad guys happened to have flame throwers, not the all powerful guns they usually carried around. I also groaned a little when Howard Stark showed up, but I understand they're trying to tie all the franchises together so whatever no big deal.To summarize Captain America is a fun ride. The story is pretty tightly wound and I was never really bored. I think trimming 15 minutes or so off of the run time would've have hurt, but at the same time there were no scenes I minded in the least. A nice super hero movie that's pretty solid overall.",Captain America - The First Avenger
400,JoeC345,Full bodied comic book movie.,6,22 July 2011,"Captain America joins the list of great comic book movies. It has been fascinating to watch Marvel bring these characters to the screen from Iron Man and now to Captain America. I'm going to admit when I first heard that Chris Evans was going to be portraying Steve Rogers I was a little worried and even after the first couple previews I didn't know what to expect. I was 100% wrong, he was a great choice for this role.Hugo Weaving as Red Skull was an obvious choice and worked out perfectly, Weaving has a knack for giving off a sinister demeanor. Tommy Lee Jones is one of my favorite actors and has his role as an Army Colonel is amazing. In most movies I've seen with him he has a personality of commanding authority so to choose him as a Colonel seems like a right choice.Now to the plot of the movie. Steve Rogers is a skinny weakling who really wants to join the Army and go to Europe to serve his country. Unfortunately he keeps getting denied enlistment. Until his fifth try, Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) gives him a chance in a new unit that is trying to find a subject for an experimental procedure.After this he's a public figure for a while until he can no longer sit on the side lines and does what he was meant to do.Since I do not want to spoil this wonderful movie experience for you I am going to stop there. However I will say this, I was very pleased that, like with Iron Man, these movies are taking there time to give a good back round for these characters instead of just plunging right into the action incoherently.This is a great movie, I have no doubt about it. I would recommend this to anyone, even if you are not a comic book fan. This is one of the rare ones where you don't have to be, you can just sit back and enjoy this movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Nothing to see here.Fortunately, for me, I wasn't expecting too much; therefore I wasn't too disappointed. I can't, however, say the same for my friends that had been waiting all year for Captain America's release.For a superhero film, I guess it does its job. It contains all of things you'd expect to see in a film that involves a good looking hero parading around in a ridiculous costume to successfully thwart the plans of an evil villain. But the problem is, if you have a heap of die-hard fans expecting a rewarding depiction of their superhero on the big screen, it better go more than just ""doing its job"". And that's where Captain America (CA) fails, in my eyes. Having no intentions of differentiating itself from other superhero films, CA decides instead to be just another one to cross off on Marvel's long list of comic book adaptations.The superhero, the villain, support acts, action, story, etc, is all just average. Nothing to make you sit back in awe, or to even encourage a smile in recognition of doing something clever. It just runs its course showing baddies with ridiculous suits and guns being overpowered by a man blocking everything with his shield. Compared to X-Men First Class – which I thought was brilliant – this movie disappoints badly if you're a hardcore fan. And I'm seriously baffled by its current IMDb score of 7.7.

402,danielloe,Classic fun,8,10 June 2015,"*WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* Captain America: The First Avenger is a fun movie with lots of action, and a touching story line. We as the audience grow to care about Steve Rogers because we see him as a guy who is down on his luck. That way, when he does become the superhero, we feel a sense of triumph, because we see this little guy becoming the ultimate fighting force for freedom. This is a common theme in superhero movies, but this movie nailed that perfectly. The choice to set this in the 1940's and show us Cap's golden years before he came to the modern day may have been a turn off for some, but I thought it was handled excellently. The fact that this guy really believes in the good o'l fashioned American ideals is hard to swallow for every character in this movie. And they play off of that really, really well. The final scene where Cap is forced to crash the plane and ultimately send himself into the present day is very tragic, and Peggy's reaction to hearing him die over the radio is heart- breaking. As I've already hinted, I think Chris Evans is really good as Captain America, and I think they handled his character next to perfectly. The supporting cast is great, we have Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell as Agent Carter, and Howard Stark. We also have a villain for parts of this movie: The Red Skull. I like Hugo Weaving's Red Skull, but I don't think they handled him all that well in the movie. The Red Skull should just be the anti-thesis of Captain America, and he is, but they don't ever really drive that point home. It's just there, and it doesn't really go anywhere. Really, he just feels like a generic Nazi super-villain with super- strength for Cap to fight. I still like the character, but I just have a few gripes with how he was handled, that's all. In the end, Captain America: The First Avenger is a good, fun movie, with a great cast, some great action, a great theme, a good tone, and a good story.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I really don't get why some people hated this movie. Maybe because of its advance technology even from the 40's? Well this is the Marvel Universe and that is something to consider.At first, I enjoyed watching it. But then when I was mature enough to watch it again, I realized that this movie was only made just to set-up The Avengers movie. The same thing goes for Thor. But Thor lacks the origin story that it became an obligatory movie. But this movie tells us the details of the story of Steve Rogers from when he was still skinny until he became the super soldier. Captain America The First Avenger is better than Thor. In conclusion, Captain America The First Avenger is somewhat an okay movie.

404,gallae,Perfect retelling of the Comic,8,28 August 2011,"I'm highly impressed with this film. Like Thor, the writers have done their research and I think the film captures the character of WWII Cap almost perfectly. Of course some changes have been made to the origin story, but it is essentially intact. The point of a film like this is not to mimic the original comics exactly, but to get across the basic idea and flavour of the stories. What I quite liked about this film was how deftly it wove several Marvel characters and groups together. Not only do we have the Captain fighting the Red Skull (Weaving is perfectly cast) but with the appearance of the Howling Commandos, Agent Carter, and HYDRA. (and their uniform now actually makes sense in a WWII setting).The look of the film seems just right, and the Nazi hi-tech kit is either based on real designs (in the case of the aircraft) or has the feel of the period. I also liked how we see the Kirby-Simon costume (including patriotic poses which could have been lifted straight off the covers of the comics of the period), and later the Ultimates costume versions. Not only that that but there's at least one scene featuring tricks and hi-jinx on a motorcycle, which is a tip to the otherwise terrible TV show! I loved it.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I thought it would be impossible but I actually did it... I saw ALL 3 Marvel Hollywood Blockbusters of 2011 in cinema! And they ALL kicked major ass! So, without further a dew, let's dunk our heads into 'CAPTAIN America: THE FIRST AVENGER.' PROS: The biggest positive aspect of this truly wonderful film is the action. There are only a few small scenes when there's no fast- paced action, but most of the time, KABOOOOM!! Something is blown up. This is one of the most action packed films I've ever seen. Another thing is the perfect cast, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers was very awesome, as he was very heroic and funny too! Hugo Weaving was cool and sinister as Red Skull, Tommy Lee Jones was awesomely awesome, I wouldn't have cast anyone else! Hayley Atwell was damn hot as Hell! And did a good acting job. The comedy was great, with a nice fun musical number that I did NOT expect! This is the 'Rambo' of Marvel films. I enjoyed Alan Silvestri's musical score, it was patriotic and enjoyable to listen to.CONS: Nothing bothered me about this film.This film is excellent, it is the most passionately made Marvel film since Spider- Man! Paramount Pictures takes great care in their films and I am very disappointed that they are not continuing with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as they've sold it to the Walt Disney Company, but I'm sure they'll do a great job! Forget about 'The King's Speech' and all that other bullshit, this film is the nuts and should win the Awards for 'Best Movie EVER!'

407,maharousewagdi,A good Starting for Steve Rogers,8,24 June 2021,"In CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER, it's 1942, and World War II is raging. Despite the fact that he's frail and asthmatic, all that Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants is to join the Army so he can have a chance to fight Nazi bullies. That chance comes in the form of Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci), a scientist who's developed a special serum that turns scrawny Steve into brawny Captain America. After being sidelined by Col. Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) and turned into a one-man recruiting ad/war bond salesman, Rogers gets back into the thick of things when a rescue mission uncovers intelligence about the nefarious plans of HYDRA, a Nazi experimental science division led by evil Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). With the help of a motley crew of soldiers and lovely-and-capable Agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), Rogers focuses on stopping Schmidt before the villain can unleash his mysterious, extremely powerful super weapons on the world.If you crossed Raiders of the Lost Ark with Hellboy and added a dash of Pearl Harbor and director Joe Johnston's own The Rocketeer, you'd be well on your way to creating this movie. It's well-paced, patriotic World War II adventure with an undercurrent of sci-fi/fantasy mysticism and a hero who's very easy to root for. Rogers/Captain America is such a good guy, in fact, that he's sometimes a little bland -- he's definitely a great role model, but you might find yourself wishing he had a bit of Wolverine or Tony Stark's snark. (The movie's a little short on humor overall, actually; Captain America's ragtag team of soldiers provides most of the laughs, but they don't get all that much screen time.)Speaking of Tony Stark, those who are well-versed in their Marvel history will enjoy seeing Dominic Cooper as Tony's equally suave/tech-savvy father, Howard, in a supporting role. And there are plenty of other moments that fans of the comics will enjoy, too -- when pre-makeover Steve uses a garbage can lid as an impromptu defense, for instance, foreshadowing his iconic shield, or the way the movie ends (it would be a spoiler to say more). All in all, Captain America: The First Avenger is an entertaining adventure -- rah-rah patriotism and all (it works well within the 1940s setting) -- but it lacks that certain something that could have made it a cultural touchstone.A good Starting for Steve Rogers.",Captain America - The First Avenger

But is that a bad thing? Nope. Instead of being a bland story it acts more as a homage to the pulpy action stories of the Golden Age of comic book heroes where they were clean cut good guys fighting bad guys with world domination on their minds. The better part is that the film actually adds more to the simple story by having well written characters; I honestly do not like Capt. America the character that much since he's way too patriotic for my tastes but this incarnation of the Capt. is well done as he is more of a good intentioned ""kid from Brooklyn"" who was given the chance to serve his country. The cast isn't as flat as one would expect from a story this simple and they do their part in helping move the story along.The action though wasn't as good as I expected. I can forgive the fact that the some of the action (soldiers just running at their opponents guns blazing without any sense of strategy) and even the enemy soldiers looked too cartoonish to properly fit a World War II setting (hey it's abased on a comic book) but the action, which was used sparingly in the film, wasn't impressive at all. I wish I could've seen the Captain fling his mighty shield more often like he does in the comics or even more gun based action on part of the regular soldiers on both sides; maybe that would've been better. Also, more screen time for the badass Howling Commandos would've been appreciated since I highly doubt that they would return in any CAPT. America sequels as the sequels will most probably be set in modern times.So yes, while it's not the best of the AVENGERS movie ""prequels"" (THE INCREDIBLE HULK is still the worst for me and the first IRON MAN is the best) CAPT. America does its job of entertaining the audience and setting up the future Avenger's story. The film doesn't have much to set it apart from other superhero movies but it's a decent one nonetheless (though I have to admit that superhero movies are getting kind of tedious for me). If this is the start of a franchise for the character, then this serves as a good start for any future Capt. America adventures.",Captain America - The First Avenger
409,yvonneshusband,The Best Superhero Origin Story Yet!,10,9 March 2017,"Sorry, Nolan. Your Batman origin movie is very good, but this is far better. First and foremost of the reasons why: it doesn't take liberties with the comic book version to facilitate its own plot. Second, Chris Evans is absolutely spot-on casting for the brave, righteous but sickly young man who becomes America's living secret weapon in the fight against the Nazis; despite his limitations as an actor he projects all the qualities the role requires without resorting to a ridiculous growling bellow while in costume. Third, it's set in a period in history we've all come to believe (or would like to believe) when a global conflict really was about 'good vs evil'; 'Captain America' fits perfectly into the role of a hero for that age, giving his subsequent projection into the modern world, with its relativistic moral view of conflict far greater force. Fourth, the character established in this origin movie remains constant in his future appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, unlike the subsequent iterations of Nolan's Batman. It is the constancy of Cap's character that 'assembles' the superhero team in 'Avengers Assemble', unites it in 'Age of Ultron' and ultimately destroys it in 'Civil War'. By contrast, Nolan's Bruce Wayne grows weary of his crusade against crime in 'The Dark Knight' and seeks to pass the task on to Harvey Dent so as to preserve his relationship with Rachel Dawes (all three developments contrary to Batman canon). In 'Rises', the character is portrayed as an imbecile who understands neither the basic principles of tactics nor elementary detective work. Fifth, Tommy Lee Jones. Sixth, its ending isn't shamelessly ripped off from the train fight in 'Spider-Man 2' (a better movie) and the subway train crash sequence from 'Die Hard with a Vengeance' (an equally good film, but with a far better executed 'crash' sequence than 'Begins').Production and costume design are first rate, particularly Cap's 'operational dress', the interiors of the SSR HQ (clearly based on the actual Churchill War Rooms)and the Valkyrie bomber, the 'exteriors' of 1940s New York and the Red Skull's six-wheel automobile. Overall, one of Marvel's best efforts to date, if not the outright best, IMHO.",Captain America - The First Avenger
410,TomConnors,Enjoyable 3D Blu-Review,9,24 July 2013,"Captain America: The First Avenger's 3-D presentation is almost as good as the ""Avengers"" presentation. Chris Evans plays the World War II genetically engineered superhero, as the story begins in that era. Steve Rogers was always small, but wanted nothing more than to serve his country like his friend 'Bucky' Barnes (Sebastian Stan), and finally got his chance when a German scientist, Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) offers him the chance of a lifetime, only to have the project fall short of a ""Super-Soldier Army"" thwarted by Nazi ally HYDRA research department headed by Johann Schmidt, also known as the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving). Leaving Rogers the loan subject to be paraded around the country to gain support for the troops, until he gets word that his friend Bucky has been captured, and even though Colonel Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) tells him not to, Rogers saves his friend's life along with several other troops. In the wake of this event Rogers is awarded his own team to lead as they go in to clean up Nazi Germany. The film's climax is made up of events that lead up to modern day, and ushers us into the ""Avengers"" film. It is still a very satisfying film on it's own just the same.Captain America is a top notch thrill ride, and is what we have come to expect out of Marvel headquarters. Along with a good looking 3-D Blu- Ray, it is well worthy addition to your library.",Captain America - The First Avenger
411,MisterMxyzptlk,"America, F*@K Yeah!",6,24 July 2011,"Captain America is one of the noblest of characters. With the most recent flooding of superhero films for what has seemed like a decades worth, what we get this time around from Marvel is nothing short of...pleasurable. Which might seem like faint praise for those who want to analyze the term pleasurable when referring to a superhero of his stature. Like a visit to a great aunt's house. A late night snack while watching an old western. Pleasurable has it's place. And this First Avenger has definitely found his.In fact good ol' Steve Rogers is so gosh darn pleasurable, that he in fact is quite... colorless. Sure the cannon fodder outfit is a solid costume. But when you start holding the mirror up to the Captain is when we start to see cracks. One could be quite confused as to what exactly the scope of his powers are. We aren't really introduced into his capabilities or where he actually stands morally. We are told he is good. What that means and how far that actually gets investigated is of no importance I guess. What I'm suggesting is that while Evans does his best Norman Rockwell painting impersonation, he just doesn't over ride us with charisma. He is just good. Good at looking good, good at fighting and just all around a good guy. There is no depth here. No conflict. The contrast between a man like Tony Stark played by Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans is night and day. And yes, Captain America is supposed to be banal. But surely the serum can tap into the small part of his brain to crack a joke, a smile or even flirt properly. Joe Johnston has flirted a little more successfully in this genre, with a very toned down Rocketeer and a wonderful character film in October Sky. But action is not where Johnston shines. I felt cramped watching most of the action play out. It felt busy but underwhelming. I almost hoped the action wasn't so generic because as I left the theatre I was more confused to what exactly Captain could and couldn't do with his new found powers. He can run fast, I gathered. But how fast? He can jump, but how high? Where does the limits of his strength run? So far this all probably sounds highly negative. I assure you it's not. It's a solid base hit for the likes of Marvel films who have really let me down more than they have succeeded over the course of their blockbuster onslaught. While the film plays on the kooky levels of an old 1940's serial with large organizations, spies and laser guns, it does so with at least a solid vision as to what tone they were aiming for. Something DC failed with Green Lantern. The supporting cast add much more richness to the characters and storyline, and that helps Evans at least keep his noble nature in check. Captain America's strength is the 1940's back drop and while I can't see a second film centre specifically on Cappy himself, it's a solid move to surround the Marvel boy scout with a more interesting cast in The Avengers. And that's pleasurable enough.",Captain America - The First Avenger

413,Andrew_M1911,Underrated,8,1 November 2018,This movie is actually really good. Steve Rogers is a small guy and wants to enlist in the army. (Btw the CGI on Chris Evans and the other guy is great) he becomes a hero and experiences war and it's action packed and even at some points violent. This movie is one of the only marvel movie before 2012 to feature bullet wounds and effects such as the scene were Steve uses a car door as a shield and gets grazed through the door. The only problem is that there is a huge montage in the middle that seems out of place. But the ending gives me chills every time. I won't spoil it so you got to watch it. The relationship between Peggy and Steve is fantastic and Howard Stark is hilarious and feels like Tony.,Captain America - The First Avenger
414,benjamincallinicos,Underrated movie of the MCU,8,25 October 2018,"The first film in Captain America's trilogy is often glanced over by the general public ever since the sequels came along.I for one love this movie as it first introduced me to the character of Cap back in 2012 when I watched the PHASE ONE movies in prep for the Avengers hitting the big screen. Mainly because I knew nothing about the character. I've mostly been a Spider-Man and Batman guy.I love Chris Evans' performance in this. He is extremely likeable and he gradually improves in the sequels which made me love him more and for me he has become the PERFECT Captain America. The definitive take if you will.On the whole, while I agree the film does lag in places, it's still enjoyable and I love films that go back in time which is why people compare it to the Wonder Woman movie (2017). A great origin story, an interesting new take on the character of Cap, great acting and fantastic score by Alan Silvestri who created the now ICONIC Avengers theme tune.This is an underrated gem that should be given more credit.",Captain America - The First Avenger
415,khfan250,Best Marvel movie since original Iron Man.,9,11 November 2011,"The final set up movie for The Avengers now reveals itself, and I am proud to admit that it's an enjoyable experience. Much like Thor, this movie, despite all of its implausibility, takes itself so seriously that we, as audience members, start to buy into this world that Marvel has made for us.The story is surprisingly intriguing. It's got a lot of action, but behind it all, lies a heart of gold. The first act does a good job of introducing our heroes and villains so by the time the third act rolls around, we are ready to see them go toe to toe in combat.The acting is actually pretty good as well. Chris Evans, thankfully, doesn't play Steve Rogers the way he played Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies. That was my biggest fear, but I'm proud to admit that I was wrong. Evans plays the role of Cap not as a reckless, proud leader, but more like a lost soul that just wants to do right. Hugo Weaving is a great Red Skull. He and Cap are completely different people so, in the case of this movie, opposites do not attract. The supporting cast is okay, except for one weak link in the chain: Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark. For me, it seemed like he just wasn't too invested into the role. It's almost like he had the idea to act like Robert Downey Jr., but somewhere along the way, decided to drop it. To me, that was a disappointment.The special effects are loaded with tons of CGI and impressive stunts. Being a comic book movie, it's chock full of implausibility, but strangely, as I said before, since it takes itself seriously, we take it seriously. It pulls us into the drama of the characters with such ease that I was utterly at awe.Final verdict: While it's not as good as other Marvel movies like Iron Man and X-Men: First Class, this is one of the better comic book movies. It's energetic and successfully hyped me up for The Avengers movie. Don't miss out on this one!",Captain America - The First Avenger

417,fawazsaadat-77930,Best movie in MCU so far,9,9 December 2018,"After the seeing the first four movies, this one stands out the most, as well as seeing an underdog becoming a superhero is absolutely amazing.",Captain America - The First Avenger
418,IllusionOfLife,Best Marvel Studios Film to Date,9,23 July 2011,"Full Disclosure: I have yet to see Thor, so when I say Captain America: The First Avenger is, in my opinion, the best Marvel Studios film to date, it is without Thor being taken into consideration. That being said, with all I've heard about Thor, I'm not inclined to believe it tops Captain America. So yes, Captain America is the best Marvel Studios film to date (and by Marvel Studios I'm specifically referring to everything after Iron Man, although, this film is better than 90% of the Marvel films that came out prior to 2008 as well). It's a wonderfully old-school action film that tonally feels akin to the likes of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Last Crusade, the performances are top notch, and it's just loads of fun from beginning to end. One of the things that most impressed me about this film was the character of Captain America himself. The character can essentially be summed up in two words: good guy. In many cases having a lead character with such a one-note personality could be a detriment to the film and could come off as corny or boring (much like Superman in Superman Returns), but here, it miraculously works. And it doesn't *just* work, Steve Rogers, despite his lack of dimensionality is really the driving force of the whole film who you root for and empathize with. He never comes across as anything less than believable, and I think a large part of this stems from the way that Joe Johnston and company portray him from the get go. As the film starts, Steve Rogers is the epitome of underdog; he is scrawny, down on his luck, and unable to accomplish the thing he most desires. The film sets the character up in such a way that the audience connects with him as the underdog and that connection lasts even after he becomes Captain America, the biggest, toughest, guy on the battlefield. He still reads as the same character because his core goodness doesn't change. It's the rare case where a character without any kind of traditional arc is actually the right choice for the film, and Chris Evans' performance absolutely makes this character. The first half of the movie, by itself, is better than just about everything else that has come out this year (excluding Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows). After that point though, the film starts to hit a minor case of the Second Act sag, where I started to feel a bit of action overload with no real pressing plot issues. However, this is resolved fairly quickly and the climax of the film works really well, and leads ultimately to a fantastic ending. Another element of this film that works very well is the integration of the Avengers continuity. Many people have complained that since the Avengers initiative was announced at the end of the first Iron Man that many of the Marvel films have suffered, to an extent, by trying to force continuity between the different characters into every film, Iron Man 2 was the worst example of this. However, Captain America works wonderfully in that none of the Avengers continuity elements feel intrusive or forced, it all fits very naturally into the narrative, and, in fact, would have actually hurt the movie if it had not been present. This is the way I wish the rest of the films had been handled, because this film, more than any other, has made me excited for seeing The Avengers next May. There's also some fantastic fan-service in this film, and even though I've never really been a comic book nerd (I'm a nerd, by all accounts, but I've never fit into that variety) it still had me grinning from ear to ear. My biggest complaint with this film, aside from the aforementioned Second Act sag, would be the character of Red Skull. Like Captain America, Red Skull is very two-dimensional, but it doesn't play as well as it does for our hero. Red Skull just was not a particularly compelling villain, and while it's not necessarily damaging to the film, it's one of the few dull elements that, when compared to everything else, stands out a bit. We may have had to wait a while, but 2011 has finally started to turn up in terms of excellent movies this month. Captain America is an amazing summer blockbuster with great talent both in front of and behind the camera. The cast from Chris Evans to Tommy Lee Jones to Hayley Atwell give great performances, the writing from Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is great, and it's all headed with wonderful direction from Joe Johnston. I definitely recommend this film. A-",Captain America - The First Avenger

422,franciscoraposo72,"Good, But Not a Marvel Classic...",7,26 April 2012,"I liked it, it was just a matter of time for Marvel release a movie about a Captain America, and since we're close to watch The Avengers, it had to be done. I'm looking forward for The Avengers and I'm sure it'll be pretty good. Captain America: The First Avenger (By the way, I have no idea why did they call it The First Avenger cause Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Hulk, The Incredible Hulk and Thor were all released before Captain American, so it should be called Captain America: The Last Avenger, but whatever...) is just an attempt of an extraordinary movie, I mean, it provides fun and entertainment, it also brings action and some other good stuff, but it's just not that great and Iron Man is out of its league. I liked Captain American pretty much, it's entertaining and enjoyable, but, I didn't like many things about it, first of all, I hated the fact that the movie's bad guy is a guy with a red and weird head, second of all, I hated that Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) was a weak kid with a very low height and he was always being beaten up by people and he was accepted to go to war, one day, he's sent to try an experience that will give him super abilities, when he tries it, he grows up (on height) and he gets huge muscles and then, right when he owns those powers, something bad happens and all the certain, he starts running like crazy, throwing things, swimming inside water to catch a submarine and later, someone asks him something and he responds ""I'm just a kid from Brooklyn"", like if he was awesome just cause he got muscles, I mean, how annoying is that? But whatever, despite the fact that it's very flawed, Captain American is a good superhero movie about war and stuff. I liked it's concept, I liked its concept and I liked its cast. Here's a simple superhero movie that entertains and leaves you enjoyed, I don't highly recommend it, but I do recommend it, it's an okay movie that leads the countdown to the beginning of The Avengers to its end.

425,tjsdomer2,Old-Fashioned Heroes,6,9 August 2016,"I feel like Captain America: The First Avenger could have been a lot more. The cast of characters does an admirable job. The use of time period set pieces is quite effective and a refreshing throwback for superhero film. At the same time, the film lacks a certain ""je ne sais quoi"" and ultimately presented the biggest challenge for me to describe.After some distillation, one of the film's weaknesses, in my opinion, is the slightly straightforward plot. I understand that Captain America is one of the original superheroes and can lay claim to some of the superhero tropes, the use of an octopus-branded rogue secret society with claims for world domination sure does sound familiar. (Yes, Hydra merely comes across as a knockoff of James Bonds' nemesis group Spectre.) Again, I enjoy the use of World War II as the time period, but still dock a bit for originality, but I feel they should have done more to make Hydra their own.The relationship between Steve Rogers (Captain America) and Bucky Barnes seems a bit rushed, especially given its importance later on. I guess I was not totally convinced that the two were best friends; instead they come across as military comrades and friends by necessity, but not best pals.My final problem with Captain America: The First Avenger revolves around some of the realism, or lack thereof. At times the movie is really violent, even showing gunshots and blood on screen, earning its PG-13 rating. Other times, the film glosses over the cost of the war and leaves the titular character as a bit one-dimensional and hokey. As a result, the movie seems a bit wishy- washy and tries to have it both ways and muddles the message of the film, which is (I think) that every person can contribute during tough times.All that said, I loved the awkward and old-fashioned relationship between Rogers (Chris Evans) and British agent Peggy Carter (the lovely Hayley Atwell). Tommy Lee Jones plays a delightfully crotchety military office and shows once again that he is such a consistent actor (just forget about Batman Forever...). Finally, the appearance of Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper) helps relate this to the other Marvel films and gives you the impression the filmmakers know what they are doing.For the most part, they do, but I'm not as enthusiastic about this one. The Cap'n gets 2.5 out of 4 stars.",Captain America - The First Avenger
426,commander_zero,Who'll hang a noose on those goose-stepping goons?,9,28 July 2013,"I confess that despite his jingoistic origins and his embarrassing costume, I've always had a soft spot for Captain America, whom Marvel revived during the short period, ages 12 to 14 or so, when I was reading their comics. As a bookish adolescent trying doggedly to get in shape, my favourite Marvel characters were those who had to work hard to exercise their super-powers, such as Daredevil (who aside from his sensory abilities, gained his powers from workouts in his private gym), Spiderman and the X-Men's Beast (who had to stay on their toes when battling stronger enemies like Rhino or Juggernaut) or Captain America (who in addition to his ""super soldier"" treatments, had developed uncanny skill in using that cool frisbee-like shield as a weapon).As a Canadian, it was not always easy to maintain my affection for the Cap in the face of his name, costume and persona. Although I was reading about his exploits during the 1960s, I don't recall him ever questioning what the heck his country was doing in Vietnam. At the time the blanket answer of ""fighting communism"" was used readily to justify any US act of overseas aggression—just as nowadays the answer is ""fighting terrorism""— and despite his crises of conscience and identity, Captain America's first loyalty was always to American troops—often as not supporting them on the ground, right in the front lines, no matter who they were fighting. At the time, Marvel was always glad to seize upon communists as convenient super-villains, since popular American discourse depicted all communists as imbued with an insane and insatiable lust for power, making Chinese generals and Russian inventors into characters who—unlike American politicians, generals or oil magnates—could be easily shaded into supervillains.I must say that I was not completely taken with the film on first viewing. Captain America: The First Avenger seemed a bit low-key to be a great superhero film--perhaps in its lack of a full-fledged monster villain like Dr. Octopus, the Abomination, or the Evil Mutants of the X- Men movies, but nonetheless it impressed me with how perfectly it was made. The amazing transformation of big Chris Evans into little Steve Rogers; the period sets and costumes; the wonderful design of the Raymond Loewy-styled ""streamlined"" 1940s hi-tech inventions, and even a classic swing-era musical number: the film's artistry was first-rate on every level. This is big-budget Hollywood filmmaking at its best In fact, on repeated viewing The First Avenger's assets appear more clearly to be those of any classic feature film. It is wonderfully written (and better-structured than its successor, The Avengers) by screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely and impressively acted, balancing the younger Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell with veterans Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, Hugo Weaving and Toby Jones. Above all, it is directed by Joe Johnston, whose talents have been evident to me ever since the third Jurassic Park film made its predecessors look like plodding religious epics, so quickly it moved and so skillfully it blended drama, action and humour.With the introduction of the super soldier formula, the tesseract cube and Red Skull running wild with his Nazi splinter group Hydra, Johnston segues us smoothly from the real war of recruiting centers, boot camps, stretchers and bombed-out London to a comic-book war fought with acrobatics, ray guns, Howard Stark and a Hydra airplane the size of a football stadium, launched from an underground hangar that is about two miles long. WWII history tells us that not much of the European war was actually fought in the Alps by guys with machine guns on zipwires, but this is the world of Marvel Comics, a world in which Johnston is perfectly at home, with the result that there is much in the film that is perfect. The growing empathy between the frail but plucky Steve Rogers and the statuesque Agent Carter takes a new turn when Rogers emerges from the Super Soldier pod sporting acres of muscle—""gee, can I touch this?"" Carter obviously thinks, sublimating these new urges in the name of professionalism, but she is the first of many, and during the musical montage of Captain America's career in show business, the eager face of a female autograph seeker, and Roger's interested response, indicates that by the time he and Carter start to cement their attraction, he may not be the sexual innocent he once was. Carter's burst of jealousy, expressed by firing a gun at Rogers and his new shield, is a romantic signifier that Howard Hawks would have been proud of: perfect. Steve's misunderstanding of the word ""fondue"": perfect. The final shot where, having missed his big date by over half a century, Captain America wonders if maybe the Red Skull might have been right, and they have transcended humanity (though Steve Rogers has never wanted to be anything but an ordinary man): perfect. And don't forget the big musical number, its tone and message exactly fitting the period, expertly crafted by Alan Menken and David Zippel—""Who'll hang a noose on those goose-stepping goons from Berlin?"" Perfect.",Captain America - The First Avenger
427,jeffrey-utley,"Like 'Thor', 'Iron Man 2', and 'The Incredible Hulk', Another Disappointing Setup Film for 'The Avengers'",6,24 August 2013,"I have not seen 'The Avengers' yet, so I decided to see 'Captain America: The First Avenger', the only setup to it that I have not yet seen. I went in there with not-very-high expectations, and this film did not meet them.How was the acting?The acting was good in this film. Chris Evans did well portraying Captain America. His performance wasn't great, but it was good. Hayley Atwell did well playing Peggy Carter, the love interest. Sebastian Stan did very well playing James Barnes in the film. He stole the show and was the best part of it. Tommy Lee Jones also did very well playing Colonel Chester Philips. Hugo Weaving did well overall as the antagonist, Johann Schmidt. I couldn't really pick out anyone did poorly in this film, so it had overall good actingHow was the writing?I thought the characters' dialog was average, but nothing special. Sadly, that's the only thing I can say about the writing that's not bad. The obviously choreographed action sequences were not thrilling. Even towards the ending of the film, with the not-so-good character development already in place, they had no background tone for action sequences to work with for a level of emotion to make the sequences more thrilling. There were also very illogical, unrealistic, and/or unexplained things. This is a superhero film, so I'll let things in that category that all superhero movies have slide, but there were many, many more incredibly ridiculous aspects than even 'Thor' had. For example, in this film, Captain America was not allowed to get hurt at all. There are also many more things where that came from. In the beginning of the film, they didn't make me like Steve Rogers (Captain America) nearly enough for me to care about him. It was the same with all of the other characters. So for me, the emotional parts were just slow parts. Also, adding to the unrealistic things, the characters make extremely unrealistic choices, do illogical things, and the romance between Peggy Carter and Captain America didn't build up at all, didn't make sense, and just came out of nowhere in a second. Lastly, for the majority of the film, the events weren't interesting.Did it have an interesting premise?Sadly, this film did not have a very interesting premise. I didn't like the idea of the smallest, skinniest kid ever and turn him into Captain America, using this energy that comes out of nowhere. The antagonist. doesn't have any layers. It's just one simple villain. The protagonist does have about two layers though, which is better than none, but doesn't make for an interesting premise.Was it entertaining or boring?The reason this film has a 4/10 and not a 1/10 is because for the second have of the film, it was good if you didn't watch it seriously. It had interesting aspects but did have many of the annoying little things that took me out of the film. It was enjoyable and entertaining. The first have, though, was not exactly boring, but was a little slow. The uninteresting premise contributed to its slowness, but it wasn't the only contributor. The characters weren't deep enough for me to want to know what was going on with them. The character development was somewhat interesting, but that's because it didn't last that long.How was it overall?In the process of writing this review, my rating changed from a 5/10 to 4/10, because the more I think about it, the worse it gets. The film overall was somewhat interesting, had its ups and downs, had good acting, a somewhat good second half, and not bad dialog. The film did have an extreme amount of unrealistic and/or illogical aspects and minor events. Each of which pulled me out of the film. It also didn't have any like-able characters, poor events, simple characters, entertaining but not thrilling action sequences, Many slow parts, and an uninteresting premise. It was even somewhat hard for this film to be enjoyable. I say that 'Captain America: The First Avenger' is not a good film. I give this film 2/4 stars and give it a C on the grading rating scale.Do I recommend this film?Even though it did have some interesting parts and some enjoyable/entertaining parts, as a whole it was somewhat hard to enjoy. I do not recommend a film that would be even somewhat hard to enjoy.Will I buy this film?Since I don't even recommend this film, there is no doubt that is not worth owning.",Captain America - The First Avenger
428,thedudeabides-2,Admirable effort for a rather dull superhero,7,31 July 2014,"When you take a look at the line up for Marvel's Avengers Assemble it's easy to see where a lot of the fun and excitement is going to come from. You have Iron Man, with a suit of armour that can do almost anything including fly – The Incredible Hulk, who turns into an oversized green giant with superhuman strength- Thor, who is an actual God with the ability to control lightening. Then we have Captain America, who has a shield. And so it is perhaps inevitable that, of all Marvel's origin movies, Captain America:The First Avenger feels the least exciting. That is not to say it isn't enjoyable, or even fun, but it often pales in comparison to what came before it. A lot of this is down to the fact that Captain America, as a character, is actually rather dull and his overly patriotic manner can be a little grating when it's being digested in the cynical 21st century. Still, Chris Evans does a wonderful job of portraying Steve Rogers as a wannabe soldier with a heart of gold and the body of Where's Wally. Due to his extreme physical shortcomings, Rogers volunteers himself for an experiment in which he will become a super soldier with all the skills associated with it. It's a solid origin story and makes up for an enjoyable first half with director Joe Johnston's decision to frame the action in a 50's setting also allowing Cap to retain his goofy patriotism without it ever feeling out of place. The problem comes when Marvel realises it also needs a supervillain with a suitably evil masterplan for Captain America to foil, leading to Hugo Weaving's woeful interpretation of Red Skull and some nonsense involving alien technology. It makes little to no sense, it wastes not only Hugo Weaving, but also Toby Jones and it all leads up to the most anti- climactic ending that Marvel have ever produced. This was always going to be a tricky prospect for Marvel when you consider the rest of their line up. Yet, despite a number of flaws, Captain America is by no means terrible and will certainly whet your appetite for some fun superhero action.",Captain America - The First Avenger
429,Cs_The_Moment,Action-Packed Family Adventure,8,13 March 2014,"Captain America tells the heart-warming, action packed story of Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), a weedy but determined man desperate to join the military and fight for his country in World War II. After being turned down for military service repeatedly he receives an offer he can't refuse from Dr Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) who promises to change his life and make him a hero.This is a great action packed family film that tells the heroic story of Captain America. The film uses some impressive digital technology to make Evans look small and skinny, a far cry from his superhero self. The special effects are reasonably impressive and add to the overall action impact of the film. The story in itself is like the other current Marvel films: lots of fast-paced action scenes with some heart- warming moments scattered throughout, and it flows between the softer and punchier scenes enough to capture your attention constantly. Chris Evans takes on the role of the iconic superhero convincingly and is the perfect antidote to the evil scheming of the enemy Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving). The film's supporting actors Hayley Atwell, Sebastian Stan and Tommy Lee Jones add to the overall appeal of this film.This is an enjoyable, if occasionally cheesy, punchy superhero film that charmingly displays the classic comic book story in a way that all ages can enjoy. Whether you're a Marvel fan already or this is your first taste of it there is something for everyone in this action-packed adventure.",Captain America - The First Avenger
430,hakrames,A great start for the now forming Avengers crew,8,14 March 2018,"Captain America: The First Avenger is the start of the future avenger movies and the big jump into the now known MCU officially. With the biggest budget and most special effects in the MCU when it was released and a strong cast and stronger performances by an A list cast. Man of the performances in this film come off amazingly and establish their roles very fast and strongly as well. Chris Evans starts does an amazing job as Steve Rogers/Captain America with the before and after the serum is injected into him. Giving this warm and comforting performance throughout making the audience feel like he has everything under control and contained. Similar cast members as well give just as good performances like Hayley Atwell as Peggy and Sebastian Stan as Bucky both. Playing important people in Steve's life and giving him different drives for his actions throughout the film. Even the more minor characters like Stanley Tucci, Tommy Lee Jones, and Dominic Cooper give amazing performances with their varying roles. MIne still being Cooper's performance as the ego driven, slightly mad genius Howard Stark. And of course Hugo Weaving surfacing again for yet another A+ Villain performance as Red Skull. Giving this feeling of constant concern and making the audience want to bite their nails throughout like his iconic performance as Mr. Smith in 'The Matrix'. Directing wise this was Joe Johnston's first and last directing job with marvel but I personally think he did a good job overall. The direction in 'The Winter Soldier' and 'Civil War' though fixed any directing issues I had with this film amazingly though. I did feel that the overuse of fast cuts in many fight scenes got boring and repetitive especially towards the third act minus the final fight of course. And some of the shots of the shield anyone with basics in physics could look at it and question 'how is that shield bouncing particularly in that direction out of nowhere?' type of situation. But many shots were done beautifully by Johnston like the first act I thought was beautiful especially the motion capture work done on Evans to make him so small and weak. Writing wise the script is overall very strong. Some lines of dialogue could've been a little smoother and not so exposition like. An example would be the first scene in the 40's with Red Skull retrieving the Tesseract. But the other scenes play very well with either providing lines of comedy to excellent storytelling provided with great visuals to tell it better. The special effects look the best in The First Avenger by far in the MCU movies coming out over time. A few scenes with small Steve though shows wear and some lacking points of the special effects crew but the rest of the film looks beautiful especially the explosions and various hits done by Cap's shield. Captain America: The First Avenger is a great film and a positive start to the now trilogy for Steve Rogers/Captain America.Captain America: The First Avenger gets an 8.25/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
431,phlbrq,I can't believe this got so many major critic good reviews,4,25 October 2011,"I liked Ironman less so 2, liked Spidey, less so 2, couldn't watch 3; Thor was OK but only on Earth; in short, at 58, I can still dig a comic book movie. However, this particular entry is insulting to any mature intellect. I really hated it and resent the reviews of critics I follow, who to a man and woman praised this movie. Their praise is so heavily qualified as to be non committal but nevertheless there's Ebert, Denby, Scott, Puig, Rickey all praising this dopey piece for not being terrible...It's terrible. The waste is so saddening I can't bring myself to itemize the squander. I really feel compelled to dismiss all beings who can enjoy this travesty. For reference sake I wrote much the same upon the release of Kill Bill. How far are we to go indulging this adolescent pablum? I gave it a 4 rating for being in focus and reasonably coherent in telling its ludicrous story. I really resented it and am still in disbelief that the critical establishment viewed the same thing I did and wrote any admiring sentences. This is as bad as the last three years('08-11) of Nicholas Cage movies. Come to think of it, he was attached to this turkey several years ago...He couldn't have made it worse.",Captain America - The First Avenger
432,gardeniapalms,Couldn't Wait To See This Movie...I Should Have,9,27 October 2011,"When watching a ""fantasy"" or ""sci-fi"" video, there is a lot that can be incorporated and, in most cases, forgiven. The use of 21st century technology in 1942 really stretches things but the acting, special effects, writing...it was all good. Even the villain of the movie...""Skeletor"" look-alike character I was accepting. Stretched the credibility quite a bit mixing the stealth bomber with WWII, but I was forgiving a lot because it's not supposed to be real...it's a fantasy. I just let it all go, accepted it, and was enjoying it.Then came the last 2 or 3 minutes of the movie. What were they thinking? Were they that far over the desired running time they had to just end it? Or was it for budgetary reasons? The ending felt like it was something from a different movie...it didn't connect or resemble anything even remotely close to the previous 2 hours. Or did they accidentally give us a sneak peak at a planned sequel? I'm not really sure the character and movie has anywhere to go? They used up the awe with the use of stealth bomber, laser guns, and very futuristic tanks and motorcycles. They guy didn't get the girl. He has no family or friends left to really care about. Because of the way it ended, it negated any forgiveness I may have felt towards. But one thing it did make me do, I realized how much I enjoyed Chris in the Fantastic Four movies and wish they'd come up with another installment.",Captain America - The First Avenger
433,magicmuffinman12,Good Movie. Could be better.,7,17 March 2020,"Amazing backstory of captain America. The first hour of this movie was amazing but it got slower and than montaged through WW2.

434,pascaloetterli,Not bad for an introduction a new superhero,7,11 September 2014,"I'm no fan of US patriotism, but ""Captain America"" played indeed a role in US history. If you can't accept this, don't watch it. In this movie he battles Nazis and an evil antagonist named ""Red Skull"". The technology level of both sides in the conflict is high and it gives you the feeling of an alternate universe. The quality of the production and props is state of the art and Chris Evans isn't a worse superhero as others, although his acting is not going to win against the likes of Robert Downey, Tom Hiddlestone or Jeremy Renner, to name just a few other actors in the superhero genre. Someone said that Hugo Weavings figure looks ridiculous and there's some truth behind, but hey - how about ""Hellboy""? Speaking of ""Hellboy"", the connection between Erskine and Rogers could have been displayed in a more deep, more emotional manner, although I have to admit, that ""Hellboys"" relationship to Bruttenholm is one of many years. The romance level is thankfully small and Hayley Atwell reminded me so much of Kate Beckinsale. I'm not used to reading any DC or Marvel comics, but I enjoyed all the little hints to the Marvel universe. As an introduction to a new superhero for cinematic use, ""Captain America"" is well narrated and gives plenty of opportunities to go deeper into character development or just more action with more bad ass antagonists. Sam Raimis ""Spiderman"" is a better introduction to a superhero, but this movie is entertaining too. 7/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
435,silliohooie,Marvel first impression,8,15 September 2021,"I liked the movie! My husband had seen it before and he told me it would be boring, but I thought it was full of action and very interesting. I also really liked the aspect of the underdog becoming the hero!

But overall, I give it an 8/10!",Captain America - The First Avenger

The actors played their roles well, but none are over the top fantastic. The story of Captain America I'd kind of a sad one at first but then it gets better. Steve is a wuss with a big heart to day the least, then he gets the super soldier serum and gets shredded and is able to go into war. The beginning is good and the middle is stronger. We see Cap fighting Nazis and then we're shot to the finale to quickly with Red Skull.

438,rbmaclachlan,Good but good is not enough.,6,30 July 2011,I saw Captain America the first avenger yesterday and I have to say that it was not good enough in my eyes. It started off really good I really got the sense of the 1940's but that was all it was just something to look at nothing else. One of the things i found very boring and also needed to be shorted or taken out was the part where captain America was promoting war bonds and rallying up the troops in the old costume it went on for far to long and I was sitting there thinking can we get to the next bit. Another part I found really underused was the bike chase scene I feel that he should of used his shield to take them out it would of been quick but it would of also been entertaining to watch. The characters were also a let down extremely but the worst was the red skull didn't find at all evil or menacing what so ever he cared to much about world domination and less on crushing captain America and the hydra which made no sense. But the worst part of the entire film was the final where Steve rogers wakes up in the modern age but we don't know what year because they do not specify anytime in the film besides the 1940's and the the avengers tie in was just ridiculous and rushed it seemed like they just wanted it out the way and it was like they were saying to us the avengers is coming dumb and stupid.,Captain America - The First Avenger
439,zackeryburgedd,The reason why I love Captain America,9,14 August 2011,"Next to Spider-Man, Captain America is my favorite character in Marvel comics. At fist I had low expectations, but I was shocked. This movie reminded me on why I love Captain America so much. The character is as iconic as Superman. Someone you can look up to. He was once the little guy, now being the big guy standing up for the little guy. He's willing to sacrifice his life in order to save millions and that is why I love Captain America.This movie did a great job of development Steve Rogers. At first I was suspicious about Bucky and Cap being childhood friends since Bucky was between 16-19 in the comics, but here it works because when he falls of the train and we assume he's dead, you feel Steve's pain. Hayley Atwell is great as Peggy Carter. We see that she is willing to fight and can kick some butt. Tommy Lee Jones is hilarious as Col. Phillips. I'm glad they added the Howling Commandos, they were just awesome. Hugo Weaving did a great job as Red Skull and didn't tell much about his origin. I know some people complain about that, but remember the Joker from the Dark Knight when they didn't tell much about his origin and made him more interesting.Overall this was a great movie. This beats the 1990 film by a longshot and I cannot wait for the Avengers movie. In closing this review here's the Captain America theme song.""When Captain America throws his mighty shield. Let all those who choose to oppose his shield must yield. If he's led to a fight and duel is due then the red and the white and the blue will come true. When Captain America throws might shield""!!",Captain America - The First Avenger

I really liked the idea they promoted: the one who hasn't got power will cherish it once he has it. Another good idea was that the serum used made the evil worse and the good great. Many scenes showed great patriotism, of corse. In the end, it's entertaining but not that thrilling",Captain America - The First Avenger

442,MJL_Uncensored,A Respectable First Outing But Not the Spectacle Cap Deserves,6,1 April 2018,"With Avenger's Infinity War around the corner, I decided to revisit every single movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 18-reviews in 27 days. And I'm reviewing these movies within the chronological order of the MCU, so instead of starting out with Iron Man-the first film released by Marvel Studios-I start with none other than Captain America: The First Avenger.What's not to love about Captain America? This guy embodies everything we want to believe about America-even when our nation doesn't always live up to its promises. It's a harsh reality Steve Rogers will have to confront in time, but let's not jump ahead to the darker years ahead for our America's hero. Instead, let's embrace a simpler time when men were sexist, chauvinist jerks looking to die in the theater of war for country and honor.Captain America: The First Avenger, takes place during World War II. In the film's prologue, we are introduced to Johann Schmidt-the head of HYDRA's special weapons division and legendary Marvel baddie, Red Skull. In the tradition of MCU villains, Skull has world domination ambitions and very little motivations for us to care about. What we do care about, is that in the opening of the film, he has tracked down the Tesseract, the first of several important artifacts we've all come to know and fear as Infinity Stones. A student of mythology, Skull alludes to a future Avenger's cultural history when he describes the Tesseract as the prize treasure of Odin's (Thor's father) collection. It's little nuggets like this that make watching all the MCU films such a treat the second time around. Meanwhile, in America, a skinny young man named Steve Rogers is catching a beatdown in the alley after calling out a rowdy moviegoer. Despite being outmatched, Steve's determination to fight-on is already at superhero status. It's the first time we see his famous battle-weary catch phrase, ""I can do this all day."" It's at that moment that we realize this guy is special.After an argument with a close friend and military enlistee Bucky Barnes that reveals Steve's inherent good nature-Abraham Erskine and Howard Stark (Tony Stark's father) decide to use Rogers for their super-soldier experiment. Abraham's search for a man of good character to entrust with these powers is such a valiant archetype that I get all warm and fuzzy knowing that they couldn't have found a better pick than Steve Rogers-our disillusioned good guy. But a HYDRA spy disrupts the experiment and makes off with the serum after killing Abraham. Immediately, a newly powered Steve Rogers and the ultra-badass Agent Peggy Carter springs into action to ""avenge"" Abrahams death. It's a remarkable sequence that turns Steve Rogers into the symbol of America's military superiority. Yes, Captain America is propaganda. But it's the kind we like so who cares.And while Rogers will spend a good deal of his time as a figurehead for the war effort, he eventually demonstrates his true worth when he stages the rescue of hundreds of POWs without the support the military. The rescue operation makes him a real hero, and he's promoted to the official rank of Captain. Later on, we're treated to more Easter eggs, when we learn about Cap's vibranium shield which seems to be unaffected by the Tesseract-powered guns (that sound a lot like Iron Man's repulsion weapons) that HYDRA is using throughout the movie. That's fascinating subtext if you're curious as to how Wakanda will play into Infinity War. The final act of the film involves a pursuit to stop HYDRA and avenge the loss of Bucky Barnes who seemingly dies is combat. Keep in mind, Cap is utterly unaware of the more significant dangers the Tesseract imposes upon their world, and it's hardly a focus of his efforts, which makes the introduction of this weapon in this film, somewhat odd. I love the idea that no one really knows what it does, but I also hate the fact that no one really knows what it does. That's because it's reduced to an arbitrary bad guy weapon for the sake of showing of some CGI. And sure, we all know now, that it's not, but this is a wasted Easter egg in that respect.As for the actors, Chris Evans-much like Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr.-was made for this role. After a missed opportunity as The Human Torch in the non-MCU version of Fantastic Four, Evans dons multiple versions of Cap's red-white and blue uniform (even a version of the horrific 80's-movie version) and embodies the role completely. Chris Evans is Captain America, and there shall be no other. It's a shame Agent Carter's character was never fully realized in her own series because she is one of the stand-outs in this movie. Of course, it's not a spoiler at this point to state that Captain America will emerge from a deep-freeze decades later to find himself face-to-face with Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury. But it's also a miss in this film how loosely they handle Captain America's introduction to the 21st Century. Come on guys, do better.Captain America: The First Avenger isn't as stylized as Cap's next outings, indeed not as action-packed and the storyline is relatively mundane. If we're being completely honest, the first time I saw it in the theater, I drifted off. But now that the vision of the MCU is fully realized, I've acquired a greater appreciation for this film solely as an origin film for one of my favorite MCU characters and the first bridge towards Marvel's most prominent story-Infinity War.My MCU Rank: #17",Captain America - The First Avenger
443,hamadah-68360,Not good,6,19 October 2021,"Just another cliche movie about an american underdog becoming a hero because he doesn't give up
Too boring unfortunately....boring and too predicable....almost like a kid's movie...also the whole surveillance cameras and all this is by no means 1942 even for a superhero movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger
444,neji107,The Star of Summer 2011 Missed it By that Much,7,21 July 2011,"By all accounts, Captain America: The First Avenger should have stolen the spotlight for all of 2011. The special effects consisted of easily the most impressive batch of explosions, gunfights, and fantastical vehicles so far this year. There were no complaints in the acting department: Chris Evans was born to play the Captain and was strongly supported on each side by the talents of Hayley Atwell as the gorgeous Peggy Carter and veteran actor Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Phillips. And as well all know, Hugo Weaving, perfectly capable of delivering the most dreadful of villains, had his shot at the infamous Johann Schmidt (or Red Skull). Adopting one of the most classic American stories of our time, and across the fascinating historical backdrop of WWII, this film had all the elements perfectly aligned and was geared to set the bar for all superhero movies to come. Don't get me wrong, Captain America: The First Avenger was solid in almost every aspect and incredibly entertaining, but a groundbreaking superhero film it is not. What went wrong? Warning: Criticism and minor spoilers lie ahead!Film adaptations of comic books are notorious in their development of the superhero. In many cases the film waits until its latter half before fully empowering protagonist, and the confrontations with the villain are squeezed into a rushed conclusion. Captain America actually reverses this timing decision, and Steve Rogers' transformation into the American hero is one of the first events that happens in the movie. But the remainder of the film STILL manages to feel miserably rushed. Superheroes are typically given a couple chances to gain a command over their powers; they practice, experiment, and sometimes even fail, but the hero is developed as a result of the learning process, not instantaneously established. Captain America is at fault here. The moment a relatively inexperienced Captain America decides to leap past enemy lines he immediately, and miraculously, becomes a human wrecking ball, knocking away everything in his path from Nazis to high-tech tanks. In fact, all of his 'missions' to destroy the enemy bases - except the first and last - are shown within one frustratingly short montage full only of Captain America glory shots. Montages can work, when timed correctly, but Captain America utterly fails to build up to this sequence - Steve Rogers is simply thrown into the fray... and wins. Another major miss can be attributed to the character of Johann Schmidt. In my humble personal opinion, a superhero movie can only be as good as its villain. Apparently the writers did not share my sentiments, because Hugo Weaving was awarded a criminally small amount of screen time. Weaving gave a good effort but was unfortunately not given much to work with. The most 'evil' the Red Skull gets is expressed through a couple angry snarls and intentional friendly fire during the action montage. However, the most impacting flaw was the film's conclusion. I won't say exactly what the ending entails, but I will say it is frustratingly ironic. After a sudden and abrupt cut in the action, instead of wrapping up any of the romantic or historical plots of the movie - in fact, instead of wrapping up ANY part of the movie - it suddenly shifts to a drastically different setting in order to set up the future 'The Avengers' film. Whether or not The Avengers will take care of the loose ties remains to be seen. It seemed like a tragedy that the original story was not concluded at all to my satisfaction, but when I remembered the full title of the movie I chided myself for expecting anything different.I left the theater feeling a bit divided over what my opinion of the film should be. On one hand it was an improved Marvel work that everyone seemed to enjoy, but on the other hand it betrayed my expectations for the 10-star superhero masterpiece I had imagined. In the end, I'll give the movie the benefit of the doubt; while it still has flaws, Captain America: The First Avenger may still come out on top of the Marvel pile. 8/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
445,shatteredrifle,Salutations for Captain America: The First Avenger,9,28 July 2011,"Yes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?Captain America: The First Avenger is an action-adventure movie that shows us the transformation of one Steve Rogers from a scrawny but patriotic man during World War II to Captain America, the star-spangled icon of freedom. Equipped with the Super-Soldier serum and his desire to do good, he finds the strength to combat Hydra, a Nazi offshoot, and its deranged leader, Johann Schmidt.To a great extent, the First Avenger succeeds in translating the essence of its title character to the big screen. Captain America is portrayed as a humble guy who just wants to serve his country, so much so that he goes to great lengths to do it. Although there are minor changes to his comic book origin, who Captain America is is preserved. Steve Rogers may have said that he's ""just a kid from Brooklyn,"" but he is definitely so much more than that. He is the hero whom people look up to, and whom superheroes aspire to be. Captain America may not have the coolest powers but is relatable in so many levels.It is becoming a trend in movies today to have a complicated plot in order to tell a good story. However, the First Avenger's approach, which centers on Captain America fighting the good fight, is pretty straightforward. The film proves that you don't need gazillion mind-boggling things to tell an inspiring tale of an extraordinary soldier on the frontlines. Being a superhero movie set in a war zone, it offers a healthy dose of action and involves Captain America bashing enemy heads and throwing his signature shield more times than you can count. Scenes of romance and humor help the film to become balanced and entertaining to watch. Steve is also a nice break from the morally conflicted heroes we usually encounter. He is simply someone who is moved to do what is right—nothing more, nothing less.Aside from the excellent character development and story progression, the film also boasts a solid cast. I honestly had doubts about Chris Evans playing the captain because he was such a fit for the cocky yet strong-willed Johnny Storm aka the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies, but he gives a convincing performance. Hugo Weaving as the menace Red Skull doesn't disappoint either, although we are still sure to remember him best as Agent Smith in the Matrix trilogy. Hayley Atwell's portrayal of Peggy Carter has a sense of both hardiness and elegance which makes the character easy to love. As someone who consistently follows Captain America's exploits in comic books, my admiration for the character has increased even more because of the First Avenger. The film gives fans everywhere a good show. I especially liked that they were able to incorporate the printing of a Captain America comic book in a world where he really exists. The punching of ""Hitler"" in the face never gets old!During the course of Captain America: The First Avenger, viewers are shown how to be a patriot through Cap's positive demeanor and outlook. In the end, we come to realize that the film deals with fighting for the things we love – freedom, country, friend and even one's own potential to do great things. The ending of the film may have been a bit abrupt, but it definitely points to a sequel. In this case, The Avengers (2012) is just around the corner, and it is something that we should watch if we want more of our Captain America.Yes, another high-production, superhero movie invades the theatres. Should you watch it?Of course. There is no other option.",Captain America - The First Avenger
446,adam-scrivner,Not quite what I expected,6,1 August 2011,"***May contain spoilers*** But, then again, may not. After the crushing banality of Transformers 3, I had been desperately hoping for something less appalling to appear at the cinema. I didn't have to wait too long, as Captain America appeared shortly after the latest Bay disaster, so I rounded up some gym buddies and went to our local Vue.Plot: There is one, and it is quite interesting. Set in WW2, we see that our hero is a big-hearted but small-framed young man, saddened by the departure of his friends for the front line while he is forced to remain back home in the USA. After numerous failed attempts at enlisting, he is finally spotted by a German scientist who can see his inner potential... Basically the plot is entertaining and will keep you hooked until about 75 minutes into the film, at which point it degenerates into a frenzy of special effects and action sequences. Following this I was rather bored.Special effects: Abundant, and handled pretty well. At the beginning our hero has been digitally slimmed (so I read), and for a few minutes this is not too obvious. I did notice after a while, however, that his face and throat do not move correctly (or indeed very much) when he is talking, and once I had noticed that I found it rather irritating. The laser guns, explosions and aeroplanes all look fairly convincing. I didn't bother seeing it in 3D as 3D is generally disappointing.Acting: Good. No wood here.Cast: Chris Evans was appropriately cast, Tommy-Lee Jones performed admirably, Hugo Weaving was unintentionally hilarious, Dominic Cooper was spot on, but my attention was distracted throughout the film by the absolutely delightful Hayley Atwell.Overall: Not bad at all for a superhero / comic book film, although a little (unsurprisingly) formulaic. Watch out for the vast quantities of ""I love America!!!"" cheese that literally flows out of the cinema screen at certain points...",Captain America - The First Avenger
447,veensepeper,"Decent, but not mind-blowing",7,24 November 2014,"It appears that every phase in the MCU has its weaker link. In phase 2, for obvious reasons, it was 'Iron Man 3'. Phase 1's weaker movie was 'Captain America - the first Avenger'.Why it was called 'the first Avenger' remains unknown. After all; Iron Man was the first one to be drafted as an Avenger, and Thor was the first born Avenger by a couple of hundreds of years. And Cap's team in this movie was called 'The Howling Commando's' and not 'The Avengers'. One's best guess to why this was called 'the First Avenger' is simply for commercial reasons. And it becomes pretty obvious that this one is pretty much filler, to kill time until 'the Avengers' was released.Even if I wanted to spoil the movie, it's quite impossible not to. Not only is it commonly known that Cap was encased in ice since the end of world war 2; it is also the beginning of the movie. After a team of assumable SHIELD agents retrieves him, the movie flashed back to the forties.A meek Steve Rogers wants to do his share in the war, but is refused to do so for being to small and sick. Then, a professor thinks he has potential and puts him up for the Super Soldier Experiment, turning Steve into Captain America. Meanwhile, Red Skull gets his hands on the Tesseract (which will be the major MacGuffin in 'the Avengers') and uses it to gain world domination. It is up to Captain America to stop him. By doing so, Cap gets trapped in ice for seventy years or so.The way Steve turns into a 'capsicle' is through a plot-hole of Rosebud proportions. Obviously for the purpose of selling toys, the plane where the final fight takes place, is filled with means of escaping. The inevitable ice-crash was plot-wise unnecessary. That stings.Of course, it's not ALL bad. The 'super-running' in this movie matches what Blonsky does in 'the Incredible Hulk'; CA:TFA has lots of fun details and easter eggs like that. And the characters are really promising. It's sequel, 'The Winter Soldier', proves that the character of Captain America lends itself to make really good movies.Honest Trailers called this movie 'Captain America: The First Avengers Trailer', to which I have to admit it is. Plus, a commercial for Captain America toys. Those elements cloud its potential that is has to being a really great movie. Now, it is still decent, but not mind-blowing",Captain America - The First Avenger

Truly, I think this MCU movie is one of the best origin movies of them all and starts off what I believe to be the greatest MCU trilogy so far! This movie has so many connotations besides just being Captain America's origin story, especially with the political undertones and historical background of WW2. Chris Evans is spectacular as always as Captain America, and seeing his transformation from skinny little Steve to hunky Steve is just...wow. Plus, you've got a genuinely menacing villain in Hugo Weaving's Red Skull and the start of the infinity stone (tesseract) story within this film. I also love at the beginning of the movie when they show Ygdrasil, the tree of life from Norse mythology, which nicely ties into the Thor movie which came out not long before this one. The supporting cast is also excellent, with Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci bringing star power to the film, and then Sebastian Stan is wonderful as always as Bucky (later the Winter Soldier!!!) and Hayley Atwell is also excellent. I think the naysayers need to revisit this movie and see how good it is compared to some of the other MCU films - like why is this rated just above the god awful Hulk movie?? And it's also FAR better than Thor: The Dark World which has a higher rating than this! Come on guys! This movie is GREAT!

454,ryokan_wc,Entertaining to its core! Way to go!,9,28 July 2011,"One of the reasons i went into the cinema to watch Captain America is that i wanted to watch the last hero that completes the run of The Avengers next year. I came out the cinema more than pleased.To begin with, i thought Chris Evans perfected the role of J Storm/Human Torch in the Fantastic Four, leaving him to be named after that character as he played it well. I thought he fitted the character. But i was certainly wrong- because he was the more Captain America material. He portrays a character, very convincingly, of a warm, courageous man with a big heart that is worth idolizing as a hero. Steve Roger/Captain America is a man that values friendship and though he may be lost in the love world, that doesn't make him a man without feeling. One scene in particular that showed his bravery was the fake grenade, where he held it to himself in an attempt to save from explosion. Besides, Chris Evans managed to capture my attention, unlike Ryan R in Green Lantern, with his comical scenes. It has been a while i last laughed this loud- and the entire cinema too, watching Captain America. If Chris Evans comes to mind, it's Captain America he made proud of!Watching the trailers, i didn't expect much. And i thought all i was brought into was an action, Marvel movie. It was more to that. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It has the ideal blend of comedy, action and heart, a combination i find difficult to bring out for its true essence. The movie was fresh, original to a certain extend that what i thought wasn't what i watched. In every typical hero movie, the hero saves the civilian and in here, when he was chasing after the villain and a child was thrown into the river, i thought 'He will go save the kid, and the villain runs away'. But like i said, this is not the ordinary movie, the following scene was truly unpredictable and hilarious. In another scene, where he kisses his love, i least expected the line by Colonel Phillips (by Tommy Lee Jones). The cinema rocked with laughter!The acting by its cast are surely to be credits and the scripts written are worth quoting. Unlike in Transformers when the joke is made in passing, i was entertained in this. I was absorbed into the movie, feeling my character as Steve Roger, or his buddy, or anybody. While i enjoyed Captain America's side of the story, i don't really feel the bad-ness in the villain. In that part, it was average. I thought the villain could be developed further, making him more evil. If there is something i wanted more, it was the end. But then, it is already 2 hours- and any longer might drag the show. And as i have said, i watched what i least expected. I thought it will end with Peggy Carter (by Hayley Atwell) at the bar, dressed to kill, waiting for Steve Roger in his top suit.Then, this is the final build up to The Avengers.No doubt, Marvel skyrocketed another comic-movie adaptation on screen. With the right cast- Chris Evans and the others, and heartfelt moments with sprinkles of unpredictable comical scenes, Captain America proves to deliver far beyond expectation. I never thought i would be talking much on Captain America, but here i am with a full-fledged review on its successful impact on me.",Captain America - The First Avenger
455,Otterman_MK2,Marvel's Surprise Disappointment,6,9 September 2011,"With the previous two critical and box office hits released by Marvel, Thor and X-Men:First Class, and with The Avengers coming up, it would seem Marvel is back on form. Whilst this fact may still stand, Captain America is now a rare exception. 'The First Avenger' is far from being named a bad movie, it just isn't a very good one. Understandably, this is very disappointing. With a unique concept (superhero's in WWII makes a refreshing change to the bland modern day urban setting), and with a strong cast, this had so much potential. So, just what went wrong? The film starts off strong, audiences being introduced to a likable protagonist with a mysterious and threatening villain. Both Chris Evans and Hugo Weaving provide their best performances, but are sadly limited with a script that refuses to give the characters any room to develop. Once pumped with super-soldier serum, Captain America's character turns into a generic two-dimensional hero, and as the film progresses seems to become less and less interesting. The character started off brilliantly- a man desperate to serve his country- and ends with him still not satisfied. Hmm. As for the villain, 'Red Skull', he was scarier before he ripped off his 'face'. A sort of sweet irony. In truth, there are no actual flaws with this film other than it's refusal to go bolder and take greater risks in order to make a better film. This is hardly a failure, (Green Lantern), but it seems stuck in the past with mediocre superhero movies. That said, both fans and casual viewers should enjoy this on the whole, and if the end scene doesn't make you feel emotional, you must be made of stone! Plus a preview of next year's 'Avengers' at the end of the credits is a lovely treat. For now, a rental only.",Captain America - The First Avenger
456,spikey_jap,The Final Avenger arrives before the Upcoming Avengers,7,7 June 2012,"With the hyped Avengers film being close to be shown, the final entry toward the long awaited Avengers film has finally arrived. I was never a fan of Captain America, since my friend and I always joked around how pathetic and how lame he is toward the superhero genre. However, after watching this film, all my dislikes toward him just went away. Captain America is not my favorite, but is definitely a good hero in the Marvel Universe.I ended up enjoying and actually liking the film more than expected. As a superhero film, it doesn't stand out toward great Marvel classics like ""X-Men,"" ""Spider-man,"" and ""Iron Man."" The film is, however, a good hero film and a good entry toward the Avengers franchise. The feedback and story of Steve Rogers was well told, giving enough characteristic that can allow viewers who are into the film to care and root for the character. I also liked the fact of how this film connects toward the Marvel films that are connected to the long awaited Avengers film. There are certain traits that link to ""Thor"" and ""Iron Man;"" fans and anyone waiting for the super group film next year will enjoy seeing how these films link together.Every actor/actress were pretty good and were cast well as the characters. The performances lead to actually liking the characters that you see on the screen. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Stanley Tucci as the doctor,Tommy Lee Jones as the colonel and Hugo Weaving as The Red Skull. I'm used to seeing Chris Evans playing these playboy/cool type of characters. He was actually pretty good as the patriotic Marvel hero. Rogers is just very patriotic and a great character. Hugo Weaving is no stranger to playing villains and he does pretty good as the villainous Red Skull. Favorite performances were from Tommy Lee Jones and Stanley Tucci. Tommy Lee Jones brings in the humor and really liked the character that Tucci portrays.There was a decent amount of action involving Captain America in the film. Any doubt of his shield of being a lame weapon will be gone as you Rogers in action. What Rogers can do with his shield was pretty cool and fun to watch as he goes into action. The action sequences were fun to watch and presented a good amount that will satisfy viewers. The only complaint I have was in the trailer; all the fun action scenes that you've seen in the trailer were presented in a montage after Rogers forms his team. It felt out of place and was presented in a corny fashion that didn't work out for me. I would have liked it better if the film took the liberty to just portray the tactics that Rogers have done against Red Skull's army. The special effects are nothing special but are not misleading in any way. The CGI and special effects were well used and never felt overused.Captain America is a great entry not only as an entry toward the Avengers franchise, but as a superhero film itself. The story had a great main character, likable characters, good acting by the cast, a nice story and action that was fun to watch.",Captain America - The First Avenger
457,Jdmaxgaming,Not Very Good.,8,12 May 2014,"Captain America was one of the most disappointing films I've ever seen, I love marvel and I was certain they were going to do great on this film (Despite The Fact That I Didn't Like Captain America Very Much Anyways) Marvel has never disappointed fans...I was wrong. The movie's scenery was dull and depressing, Captain America going in the war just did not go right, believe it or not but even the action scenes were bland,the only part I liked about the film was the end. Besides that it sucked! Even if your a Captain America fan, DON'T WATCH. Just thank god that there's a Winter Soldier film, If there wasn't I probably would hate Captain America all my life. My advice, don't watch this one, start with The Winter Soldier first. YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID!",Captain America - The First Avenger
458,Artist_TRS,All Those Who Oppose His Shield Must Yield,9,11 March 2020,"In my opinion, 2011's ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is the best movie based on the titular character.As an avid fan of the indelible Kirby-Simon source comics, I believe the character of Captain America flourishes most when the story is set during wartime. This movie exudes the patriotic charm and stylish ambiance of that era, and to me, the endearing perseverance and bygone disposition of Steve Rogers doesn't have the same charm outside of that wartime era's world; whenever the character is set in the modern era, he's diluted. But hey, that's just my opinion.If 2014's ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" is instead your preference (or ""Captain America: Civil War"", though it's more like an Avengers sequel), that's fine, I just don't agree with it, and can defend my claims; ""I can do this all day.""",Captain America - The First Avenger
459,Nuz_Reviews,The worse Marvel flick of the summer. Bummer.,8,22 July 2011,"I couldn't even tell you the last time I went to a midnight movie showing. My guess is last summer, but cannot recall the title of the featured film.First of all, I just want to get the whole 3-D jabber out of the way. If you have read any of my other reviews, you know I am not a fan of the 3- D film movement. It's just not perfected yet to have a greater impact on the entertaining outcome of the film. It hurts my eyes, it's too dim, and sometimes I get a headache afterwards. My knees hurt enough as it is to sit in a theater for 2-and-some hours. Captain America is no different. The only thing cool to see in 3-D for this movie would be when Mr. America throws his shield as a weapon. That's pretty much it. I'm so glad I saw it in 2-D. Save the four bucks.It's hard to top X-Men: First Class. And, Thor was better by a little bit.On to the actually movie itself.Captain America: The First Avenger is seemingly mediocre as far as a movie goes cinematically, but I did enjoy it and recommend seeing it. If nothing else, view it as a predecessor for The Avengers, which I have high hopes for. Hopefully there will be even more action than Captain America, which could have easily had more; assuming he's part of the military I thought there would be. So the Avengers are a group of Marvel characters such as: Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo, voiced by Lou Ferrigno). They are brought together by the leader of S.H.E.I.L.D., Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), to protect and serve the peace of the world. Only one world describes that situation if ya ask me: epic. The release date is May 4th of 2012.So as you can obviously figure out merely from the title of the movie, Captain America is the first Avenger.Being somewhat of a Marvel Universe nerd, I was a big fan of just the story about Captain America. Before this movie I hadn't had any prior knowledge to the genesis of the Captain America character, except that he was apart of the military during World War II and up against Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. Most of this movie took place in the Marvel Universe-alternative 1940s, which was pretty cool. Reminded me of the setting and situation in Watchmen.What's up with villains in some of these sci-fi/action flicks? If you read my recent I Am Number Four review, then you'll be able to sympathize with me on that question. In Captain America we see the antagonist known as Johann Schmidt or the Red Skull (played by Agent Smith from The Matrix movies, a.k.a actor Hugo Weaving) with a horrible make-up job. Red Skull works for Hitler as the head of advanced weaponry. They really should have made him look better; perhaps by adding more of a skull image with maybe some black like in the comics. It annoyed me. He looked like an even worse version of Hellboy from Hellboy. Also, Red Skull's minions, the HYRDA, reminded me way too much of Storm Troopers from Star Wars. In the comic they are green and yellow, not black. Oh well.I thought actor Chris Evans did a pretty good job portraying Captain America. He really became the small-boy Steve Rogers character form Brooklyn that never gave up to one day ultimately become Captain America.Actress Hayley Atwell also did a fine job with her character of Peggy Carter, an officer of the Scientific Reserve and love interest of Captain America.I'm still not sure if it was intentional or not, but Tommy Lee Jones was hilarious as Colonel Chester Phillips. I still can't decide if it was his dialogue that was funny or the way that he said it.Overall, if you enjoy comic book movies at all then I'd go see this in 2-D. That's just my opinion.8/10 Stars (probably would have been 7 if I saw the 3-D version).",Captain America - The First Avenger
460,ernestoac,A good introduction,7,15 August 2019,"The movie introduces us to Steve Rogers, a character with a below average physical strength but an above average wish to protect others, defend his country. We are shown how Steve can't stand doing less than others for his country, how he can't just stay comfortably at his home while there are people dying to protect others, this determination is one of the best aspects this movie has.
From the other side, the movie isn't able to completely convince me how worthy Steve is, which is the main point of this movie, showing us why Steve Rogers is worthy of acquiring this power, while others are not. It was already decided from the first time the doctor saw Steve he would be the one to get the Super Soldier serum, but the movie could have shown us more of why he is truly worthy. He is never really put in real danger, a situation in which he takes a risk to save others (there is the scene with a fake bomb, just imagine it taken even forward, Steve attempting to save someone even though his strength isn't enough, using his intelligence and even almost dying for it, then I would be completely convince he is more worthy than anyone else, but I wasn't).
The side characters are pretty average, serving the regular rolls: the love interest, the best friend and some extras to keep the plot running. I don't think they are really memorable and the relationship with Peggy Carter came out of nowhere just because it was supposed to happen.
The villain isn't that memorable either, he never attempts to do something that directly harms Captain America, he is just somewhere trying to do something else for some reason. He is supposedly related to the Captain because he also used the serum, but it had other effects on him because it was not ready, and that's all, they don't even have a fight you will remember when you finish the movie.
In conclusion, this is a very simple story that could have been done in less time, or, if they really had to do 2 hours, it could have been better executed. This is a good movie, it just has some points it could have been better at.",Captain America - The First Avenger
461,q-02121-71714,I will love Captain forever,9,26 April 2020,"Faith, brave, tough heart.
In the story, the vulnerable young man Rogers (later captain of the United States) had a strong desire to enlist in the army when he watched Europe be eroded by the Nazis, but he was refused many times because of his weakness and illness, making it almost impossible to enter the army through formal channels, but he still had to take the risk of being arrested to enroll in the army after the advice of his friends. His friend later saw the strong one. He was stupid.A strong belief
Any change will take a lot, and it will be proportional. When Rothger grew up and became captain of the United States, it naturally cost the unimaginable pain of the male (chang). When the doctor wanted to stop, he shouted to continue, he could, and finally made the change. And then all the buddies present were stunned.Brave heart
For war, life is extremely small, and his body can be a legitimate reason not to sacrifice, and he has a hard time to go. This courage is commendable. This courage comes from the kindness, justice and youth spirit in the heart.The general distrustful of this candidate, took a grenade test, the big man ran away, the small man holding the grenade to let everyone run, only to find that it is playful, brave behind is the spirit of kindness, self-sacrifice, admirable.On the sauce purple, a kind ordinary youth has a brave heart, for the United States World War II, and finally saved the whole world. As much as you can, you have as much responsibility as you can. Rogers has the responsibility first and then the ability, which is a good match.One person who is eager to change needs to meet new challenges as he prepares, and he knows that any change requires efforts to break through the limits. With a strong and indestructible belief, you can also be the ""captain of the United States"", but you can be your own captain.LuckysThe conversation with a friend was unwittingly heard by the doctor, and what happened next. His luck may also come from his strong belief, quoting ""cosmic attraction"" to explain that the inner magnetic field will attract people with the same gravity to find you. Dr. Rogers is looking for future soldiers for justice in scientific research, and Rogers has the same gravity-dedication to peace.This is his luck:To the exhibition, happened to stop at that location, happened to talk to friends there so much, and the doctor happened to pass by, and the doctor likes to listen to ""gossip"", the plot is like this, the audience can only bear it in silence.I believe lucky this thing, try harder and insist that a person is lucky, in order to join the army Rogers to modify their own files five times, and after the failure still want to do this thing, the best brother advised himself to remain the same after the initial heart (true TM stubbornness, so you should have such a friend around you, cherish, may be a new hero), finally for yourself to wait for the opportunity.He's a good man.A man can be strong, but if it is a bad person, Hydra, the world may be dangerous. The main reason why the doctor chose him was that he was a good man.""good people can get better, bad guys can get worse.""""that's why I chose you, because a strong man, who is strong all his life, may not take strength seriously.""""but a thin man knows the value of strength and compassion.""""keep your people, not a super warrior, but a good man.""Give this sentence to everyone who is getting stronger. When you have the power to change something, remember that you are still a good person. The world is beautiful, and so are you. Is it a little bit of chicken soup, and it's burnt.I used to watch these superhero movies tirelessly, and I always felt that this kind of plot was just someone who had superpowers to do something good, if I had superpowers. But now watching these movies pays more attention to their superpowers, but to what is really powerful, why they can become strong, and then what they do.As an ordinary young man, I also want to be strong, because then I can do more good things, even if I am not strong now, I have to insist on doing some good things, change myself, strengthen their beliefs, and the original heart will not change.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Whatever you do, ignore those reviews- Captain America is one of the most fantastic films of the year!!! It contains the best storyline, the best actors, the best characters and the best cameo appearance from Stan Lee ever.

466,joetufano719,It didn't disappoint.,8,28 August 2012,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I know almost nothing about Cpt. America except all I saw in this film. When I saw ""avenger"" in the title, my interest was raised. This movie like ""Thor"", ""Incredible Hulk"", and Iron Man 1 and 2, is a lead up to ""The Avengers"" which we got to see this year, and tells the story of Steve Rogers aka Captain America. At first I was hoping it wouldn't be like the Fantastic Four movies since Chris Evans (who played the Human Torch previously) stars in the title role, but I'm very happy to say that I was not disappointed with this film.Story: (No Spoilers) The film takes place during the 1940's during WWII, and we are introduced to Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) who is a short, skinny and frail young guy with a big heart who wants to fight for his country. Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) discovers Rogers and is able to get him enlisted in the Army as part of a new ""Super Soldier"" program. Rogers takes the Super Soldier Formula and becomes more physically fit than he was before and is deployed to Europe to take part in special forces type of missions to fight HYDRA led by Nazi officer Johann Schmidt aka the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving).Acting: Chris Evans is great as Cpt. America and pulls the character off so well throughout the film. His character is exactly the kind of man I want to be, especially since I'm leaving for basic training in the Army National Guard very soon. Hugo Weaving as Red Skull is a really cool villain, Stanley Tucci as always is very good, Tommy Lee Jones as Col Chester Phillips is his usual self: gruff, hard around the edges but really funny and his character obviously is kind deep down inside. As for the others, Haley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Sebastian Stan as Bucky, Neal McDonough as Dumb Dumb Dugan (who I really liked in Band of Brothers) and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark are all very good in this movie.Verdict: This is a really good movie. Yes there are some cheesy moments in the movie, but for the most part I really liked it and I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is interested.",Captain America - The First Avenger
467,ioshadha,A good effort,8,9 August 2011,"I think most reviewers have underrated this movie. Remember, Captain America, Thor, Iron man, Hulk and all of Avengers are all Marvel comics... they are all comic books... and bringing these characters to real life on the big screen satisfying every viewer's expectations are not an easy task. I would have expected a little more from all of these movies if they were supposed to be standalone. But from the point of view of forming the upcoming The Avenger I think all of these movies have done very well. In this regard I thought Thor was done the best.Did I enjoy Captain America? Yes, I did... Do I feel it could have been little better - I sort of do. Captain America feels a little rushed... although I don't blame the makers of the movie because there is too much detail that needed to be emphasis in that short period of the movie all the way from being Steve Rogers to present day Captain America.All in all I feel it is a good effort for a Marvel comic series. Do yourself a favor - don't expect a ""The Shawshank Redemption"" from any Marvel comic movie - if you do, just don't watch marvel comics ;)",Captain America - The First Avenger

It was better than expected.The movie is about a sickly Steve Rodgers and his journey to be one of the greatest heroes in history, Captain America. He captures the attention of Dr. Abraham Erskine, a German scientist working for the SSR. Erskine chose Steve for a test subject for the Super Soldier Serum that he created because he believes in the good man that he sees in Rodgers. The serum transforms Rodgers into peak human condition at the cost of Erskine's life. Along the way, Rodgers goes up against Johann Schimdt, aka the Red Skull, who is the leader of the Nazi science division, HYDRA. Rodgers also has friends like Peggy Carter, Bucky Barnes, and the Howling Commandos to help.First Avenger does a great job capturing the vibe of the 1940's. It has an engaging story. The music was great. It's hard getting the Star Spangled Man song and the Captain America March out of your head. The movie had a great cast. Hugo Weaving and Stanley Tucci was great as Red Skull and Dr. Erskine respectively. Loved Tommy Lee Jones in First Avenger. He had some great lines in the movie. Chris Evans was an awesome choice to play Captain America. I still remember him as Johnny Storm/Human Torch from the Fantastic Four movies. He still did an amazing job as Steve Rodgers/Captain America.",Captain America - The First Avenger
469,deborahjwood,Rah Rah Rah Red White and Blue,8,7 August 2011,"First, and perhaps most importantly, remember -- it's a comic book character – bigger than life, written at a time when America needed heroes in every size, color, shape and gender – and this is one of the most likable heroes of all time. He's the skinny weakling, brunt of the playground jokes, Mr. Nobody makes big. He has just one dream, to kick Hitler's ass, to serve his country, to be a part of the war effort like the playground buddies he is losing to the war – but he can't get into the military, and is a 3 time 4F failure at enlisting until a scientist (Stanley Tucci) Abraham Erskine recognizes his greatest asset, his heart. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has the heart and soul of a hero and is recruited into the super-soldier experiment to become Captain America – a muscular and cellular enhanced super fighting machine. However, to his chagrin, his first assignment is to ""wear tights"" in a silly super hero costume and be a walking talking breathing ad campaign for war bonds – the money used to fund the war is as needed as soldiers according to higher ups but upon learning that his childhood friend is trapped behind enemy lines that all changes and Captain Rogers comes into his own as a warrior – fighting for truth justice and the American way – cliché and the movie is cliché but that does not detract from its broader appeal. Everyone needs a hero –The strength of this film is the hero – local boy with a great heroes heart makes good on promise to kick butt in Germany or some such – he doesn't even need the fancy equipment the magic vibranium shield or the super motorcycles to win our hearts – he did than when he threw himself on a dummy grenade in training and showed everyone what a real hero is made of. I wish they'd had more character development between Rogers and Hayley Atwell (his main squeeze) because she did an outstanding job as a 40s bombshell in uniform – and they could have used less fighting – after all, and again, we were already won over to him in the first 15 minutes – he had nothing to prove to us – fall in love, kill Hydra –the creation of a failed experiment by the same doctor that created Captain America - (the great and gruesome antagonist played by a heavily made up and unrecognizable Hugo Weaving) and come home to live happily ever after but and no buzz kill here, the ending leaves a perfect prequel set up (what a shock) perhaps for next year's Avengers? Always yummy Tommy Lee Jones plays the gritty General who is expected to make the scrawny kid into a soldier and as always he plays his role with believability, wit and his fabulous southern drawl – again I wish we could have had more interaction between Rogers and Jones. Nevertheless, Jones role helps the whole thing gel and he is no matter his age, raw masculine eye candy.The storyline is good – not great – but not a wet comic book – very retro and very rah rah rah red white and blue but it's a comic book – if you see it with that in mind you'll enjoy it - it's worth the $10 bucks for an afternoon of escape at the local mallThe directors and writers do an excellent job of tying the beginning to the end and following a story line – flows very well and does not leave you wondering what just happened – the writers did a good job – not great – this is not an award winner but is good solid enjoyable film making and perfect summer entertainment for the kids and the kid in you.",Captain America - The First Avenger
470,holker-127-845774,"No surprise, no disappointment",6,4 September 2011,"I watched this flick, because I want to see all the prequels to the highly anticipated ""The Avengers""-film and I suspect that's why most people will have the same motivation to see this movie.Story was familiar, since they used the exact same formula as in all the other Stan Lee superhero movies. To be honest it is starting to become boring and I hope Captain America is next to the first Avenger also the last Avenger.Hugo Weaving absolutely stole the show with his Arnold Schwarznegger accent and he basically carried the whole film on his back. It was great fun to see him perform the evil governator super-villain and I wish there was more footage shown of him.The rest of the movie is just sad. Of course they have to pick World War 2 as the war where Captain America fought, since every one knows all the recent wars were just fought to obtain oilfields for the corporate world (how noble is that? indeed...). And the rest of the film is just a load of American chauvinism and propaganda with a few entertaining jokes in it. 6/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
471,cinematicheroes,The Star Spangled Man With The Plan ;),9,22 July 2011,"I chose the humorous song from the movie as the title of my review, because truly this film had a plan. They stuck closely to the Cap's origin, and doing it as a period piece was the only plan that I believe would have worked.The 1940s vibe will surround you as you watch the style, dress and politics of the period. The World's Fair-like event, headed by Howard Stark's Car of the Future. The enlistment posters.The nostalgia that was that decade ... that time is a big part of this movie. Combine that with Chris Evans' convincing portrayal of Steve Rogers, the 90-pound weakling that wants so badly to help serve his country. Stanley Tucci's Dr. Abraham Erskine, builds a sweet friendship with Rogers, and his respect for the latter helps form the bond of who Captain America will become.Then, there is Hayley Atwell, who as Agent Peggy Carter admires Rogers - even as the 90-pound weakling version - for his courage, his passion and most of all his character. There is more than an on-screen chemistry between Atwell and Evans, there is a believable, albeit tragic romance. Without revealing the end, I found myself feeling sympathetic towards these characters, as this was not your average, run-of-the-mill comic book movie.Director Joe Johnston brings us another classic period fable in the vein of THE ROCKETEER, one of his earlier works. And screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely do a nice job capturing the vernacular of Rogers and his comrades. Erskine's line, ""Stay who you are, not just a soldier, but a good man,"" is destined to go up there with Uncle Ben Parker's, ""With great power, comes great responsibility."" Johnston gets great performances from everyone involved including Oscar-Winner Tommy Lee Jones, and Sebastian Stan as a rebooted Buck, Cap's pal. Everything from the look of Cap's classic costume, to the shield being a character in itself, just adds to this period classic. The action sequences are not only top-notch, but interesting and do help to advance the story. And, then there is Hugo Weaving as The Red Skull. Awesome.Without revealing just how, the movie opens and closes in a TITANIC-like fashion, and I truly enjoyed the way it was presented. Truly this film, did have a plan, and I for one, love it when a plan comes together. ;)",Captain America - The First Avenger

The rest of the cast is good, but not really spectacular. The action does keep the movie going at a good pace, so your never bored. It even has a few good comedic one-liners.Here are the downsides: The story can feel really un-realistic, especially near the ending.

479,lil_mexx31,Great Mix of Drama and Action,7,4 September 2012,"My only negatives with Captain America were the annoying montage's. I understood the purpose behind them, but I thought one would be enough, not three.With that said, I thought Captain America was an Excellent movie. It balanced drama and action really well. I felt that the pacing of the story and how it evolved was really well done. It allowed me to invest into Steve Rogers a.k.a Captain America (Chris Evans). I loved the vulnerability he portrayed in the opening act's and how it remained consistent throughout.The cast was excellent and were phenomenal in their performances. Tommy Lee Jones who played The Colonel was exceptional and provided some good comic relief. Hayley Atwell did an fantastic job playing Peggy, who was Captain America's love interest. She portrayed her as an equal to Steve Rogers especially in the earlier moments. Joe Johnston (director) did a good job of setting up the future sequels and tying up some of the past tie's in the Avenger's universe. The integration of Tony Stark's (Ironman) father, Howard Stark, was handled perfectly. You can see the immediate resemblance between Tony and Howard, ""Like Father Like Son"" I suppose. Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull was awesome. Wish i could've seen more of him on screen, and be more menacing. Still though, i felt that he delivered. The action sequences were incredible. I liked how they were spaced apart. It really added to the tension. The final action sequence's were spectacular. Apart from the montage's, Captain America was a great watch. There were a few flaws, but they are minor in the grand scheme. I was entertained and engaged for the majority of the film. Can not wait for the sequel.7.5/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
480,seannasuti,Probably the most underrated of MCU's Phase 1,10,12 September 2016,"As Screen Junkies noted in their Honest Trailer for 'The Avengers', Captain America was 'no one's favorite hero'. However, I'd argue that his first MCU film, 'Captain America: The First Avenger' is one of the best of Phase 1 up there with the first 'Iron Man' and 'Avengers'. After the disastrous adaptation of the character in 1990 that was never released in theaters, this film does a fantastic job in telling the origin story of Captain America. Chris Evans, in his second major Marvel role, very much shines in the role of Cap, immediately establishing himself as a humble and likable superhero. But he's also backed by one of the best 'ensembles' to ever grace an MCU film; Hayley Atwell as Cap's love interest Peggy Carter, who of course would end up starring in her own TV series a few years later, Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Phillips, Sebastian Stan as Cap's loyal pal Bucky Barnes, and of course Hugo Weaving as one of the best MCU villains to date as the Red Skull.This is very much an old-school summer blockbuster with the modern tricks. The period design is excellent, showcasing director Joe Johnston's talents for period pieces, and I won't lie; the ending in which Cap 'sacrifices himself' by crashing the plane into the arctic, unaware he would only end up getting revived decades later, is quite emotional. 4 words... ""I had a date""And that's why 'First Avenger' is one of my favorite MCU films. It's well-directed, terrifically acted all around, and I'd argue it succeeds in making its main protagonist one of the best characters in the MCU to date.",Captain America - The First Avenger
481,mariajoaou27,Marvel's ruined Captain America for me.,1,22 December 2011,"To start with, I didn't even understand the movie. I found myself daydreaming in the theater, simply because the movie couldn't keep me interested. It was disappointing, since I had very high expectations about this movie. It was a waste of money. If you're a fan of movies where you see everybody running and everything exploding and people screaming and a predictable, soulless love story... (if that can be called story... you don't really see them falling in love, it's like they start loving each other simply because they spend much time together (running and screaming and being afraid). I'm pretty sure the only reason why that love ""story"" was put there to attract to the movie not only men or boys who remember the actual, and good, Captain America, but also their wives and girlfriends. Pointless, let me tell you. It was awful. I found myself frowning when they kissed)... then this movie is for you. If you like good movies with an interesting story, character development, don't even bother to watch this one. It was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. I watched it in the theater with my boyfriend, which are two things that always make the movies better.. but not even the great company and the comfortableness of the chairs and wideness of the screen could save this unbearable movie. I'm the I'll-stay-until-the-end-of-the-credits-because-there-may- be-something-nice-after-them kinda movie watcher, but I found myself rushing to the door even before the credits started. I don't recommend watching this movie to anyone, and I need to thank Marvel *cough cough* for ruining Captain America for me.",Captain America - The First Avenger
482,jamielee_uob,Captain America disappoints,5,17 May 2019,"For supposedly being one of the main faces of the avengers series, this comic book hero movie failed in a lot of ways. Things started well when I realised this was set in the classic world war 2 times...the vintage look and feel of the scenes were perfect. Sadly, that was to be the only thing perfect. The origin of captain America isn't one I can get on board with, and neither is the red headed villain! He looked more like 'The Mask' with very bad sunburn. Whilst the action scenes were fine, and the main body of the story OK at best... the ending was a massive disappointmentSo Captain America crashes an aircraft which looks like it belongs in Star Trek, into what I thought was water, but looks more like a cloud covered ice bath?! Who knows?! And 70 years later...he wakes up?! I'm sorry, but this is a superhero born from a weak and small man...this doesn't wash with me!

So I've been anticipating this film somewhat nervously for a long time. It not only didn't disappoint; it blew me away! Best Marvel movie yet. It has a simple, focused story line that stayed true to the original character; awesome visuals throughout; and perfect casting. Deviations from the original storyline are, as always, forgiven by me.

485,sidekicknick43,It Sure Ain't the 1990 Film,9,9 August 2011,"After all the hype, after all the waiting we finally reach the final avengers movie before the big cahoona. So far, all of the Avengers films have been good. I loved Iron Man, I really liked Thor and The Incredible Hulk, and I also liked Iron Man 2. But, I've been waiting for an Avenger film that rivals the fun I had with the first Iron Man.And I finally found it with. With Captain America, of all things! Even before I walked into the movie, I felt that it was going to be at least good. If you can do Thor, then how hard can Captain America be? I wasn't worried about the Director or cast, and I couldn't wait to see it.The Good-- 90% of it. The casting was great and I loved every actor in the film. Chris Evans does a great job as C.A., selling the whimpy Steve Rogers without taking it too far and making a believable transition from that to Super-Soldier. I was rooting for him all the way. I loved all of the supporting characters, which include the likable scientist Stanley Tucci and the super-sexy love interest. Another strong point to the film is how well it captures the time. It looks and feels like a world war 2 era film, especially during the bond-selling scenes. It even felt like a Bond film at times. The action scenes are top notch and the climax was exciting and emotional. Not to mention that the ending of the film was very exciting and I encourage people to stay through the credits.Bad-- The first thing is probably just me not being a huge Captain America/Thor fan, being that the movies were my first intro to the characters: I would have liked more information on that glowing cube thing. They just say that it's a huge power source and It had something to do with Oden. A little more information would have been nice. Another thing is that I didn't like the Red Skull's makeup. It was too rubbery looking, It was supposed to be a physical deformity and it just looked like a mask with some CG on top. My final complaint is that the villain death was kind of weak. I predicted that it would happen that way, but it wasn't a good execution.In Closing-- It's a great film, go see it. It's funny, fun to watch, and you will not be disappointed by hardly anything. There were even points while I was watching it where I considered it perfect. I'm still debating on whether or not it's better than Iron Man 1.",Captain America - The First Avenger
486,danhollow,"It Ain't The Best, But It's a Lot Of Fun",9,14 May 2012,"What's there to say about director Joe Johnston? He's one of my favorite directors, but I know and respect the fact that he is not (nor will he probably ever be) a great director. Why? Because the movies he makes are too much fun. When Joe Johnston goes into a film, he gives most of his focus to the experience of the film, the feel of it. He makes films he wants us to enjoy for exactly what they are. This is the guy who was a visual director for Raiders of the Lost Ark, and a lot of his films definitely strive to emulate the kind of old-school swashbuckling fun that movie had. At the same time, he is also a director of little guys and little details; all of his films have little scenes or moments that pack more emotional power than you expect, and those moments stay with you.As far as Captain America goes, he's the perfect director to tell us the story of a little guy getting the chance to do something big. Steve Rogers was born a scrawny kid from Brooklyn. His one goal in life was to serve his country the way his parents (an army nurse and soldier) did. His main problem? He's a toothpick. He has the heart figuratively speaking, but not literally speaking. All that changes when he is drafted into an experimental super-soldier program that transforms him into (duh duh duh duh...) Captain America! Fighter for Freedom, Justice and the American Way! Go ahead, laugh, most of the army does when they see him. Captain America is a superhuman, but not truly a superhero. He bruises, he bleeds, he can't breathe underwater, a car can still outrun him with a good enough headstart, any standard- issue bullet can kill him. But at the same time, he is the ultimate realization of a man; as strong, smart, and able as one could ever become without superpowers. But what attracts us most to the character is the person within. Take away the mask and the shield and the muscles, and he is still the same scrawny Steve Rogers underneath; a kid from Brooklyn who doesn't like bullies and just wants to do a good job. Steve Rogers deserves a lot of credit for putting aside his ego and letting us see that weakness and mortality throughout the film.As far as the rest of the film goes, it's a modern-day action-comic-book-explosion movie dialed back to WWII. I can't describe how wonderful it feels to see CGI not for the sake of showing off, but to show us an old-school comic book movie with access to today's computer-graphic technology. The enemies are the Nazis, and they are (I kid you not) firing ray guns that shoot blue bolts of energy which vaporize whatever they hit. The kind of blue energy beams that will never hit their target, but look fantastic when you see a hero dodging passed them and chucking a shield around like a boomerang to knock out the shooter. At the same time, we also see a lot of practical effects; real explosions, dirt flying everywhere, and a good old-fashioned haymaker that would put any Nazi on his back wondering what just hit him.This is a predominantly fun film. If you have issues with this, I'm afraid I can't help you.",Captain America - The First Avenger
487,GeneR777,Good - but not has good as I had hoped,7,22 July 2011,"SOME SPOILERS(?) Not really... (But DO stay for after the credits!) It is quite possible to love Captain America the comic book too much. It is also quite possible to love those trailers with Stanley Tucci as Dr Erskine telling skinny Chris Evans / Steve Rogers that ""It's about being a good man."" And it is quite possible to get entranced by the humility and guts of this young man who would do good. Because at the heart of this comic book hero is a story about a good, pure- hearted man who would do whatever he could to do the right thing... and keep getting back up when bigger and more capable men would have long given up. And that is touching. And for the first half of the movie the story touches this admirably. My only beef is with the second half which seems to ditch the brooding character development of what is essentially a gentle and loving soul learning to finally enjoy his life... and gets too much into the action. Now, GRANTED, this IS a comic book movie. And GRANTED, this is also an action adventure story. But the spine of the story as portrayed in the first half of the story should have played a more central role in the second half. I think that would have made this into a ""perfect"" super hero movie... but moreso a solid, and touching drama. Because at the heart of this story SHOULD have been about a good man, learning his self- worth, and the love of a good woman who would inspire him to move forward even when he far outlived her. THAT, would have made the story thematically and emotionally unified. So maybe if the story was 30 minutes longer with that aspect of the drama placed within the heart of the story I would not have felt so numb and let down in the second half. Maybe. Maybe not. Just one other point: This movie is MEANT to be a setup for next year's AVENGERS movie. It would be a serious waste if they stopped making Captain America movies just to focus on Avengers stories. At the heart is still a man who is discovering his own self-worth. And that is plenty important in this day and age.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Hugo Weaving as Red Skull was fantastic, showing us why the US was so reluctant to use the super soldier serum in the first place. Also liked Tommy Lee Jones popping up in a Marvel movie.My only problem is that only Evans and Weaving had memorable performances, whereas the 4 above this one had great contributions not just from the main roles, but from the side roles as well.

Captain America had a lot of potential with all the WW2 material available but they managed to make it an anonymous movie which left me indifferent.Whenever you make a movie for the sole purpose of leading to another movie which is your bigger target, it usually calls for a poor story with little to show for, and that's what we got here.Allow me some sarcasm first. All in all, the story revolves around Peter Parker part 2 in the 40's. He's weak and girls don't really like him. An experiment makes him stronger. Then goes against a Nazi captain who made magical weaponry with some blue cube from Thor's world (got to build the Avengers don't you). Oh and he gets his shield from Stark's father, so there you got the Iron Man link. That's about it for the story.This being said, I did not expect much from Captain America after the Iron Man 2 disaster, and it did not beat my low expectations.On the good side, Chris Evans does a decent job with the little depth he was given in his role, visuals are OK and immerse us into the mid 20th century (if you can ignore the lasers and magic which are really out of place) and Hayley Atwell is quite pretty in her role as Peggy Carter. And actually, Captain America himself as a character is likable; it's rather what he has to deal with which happened to be an attack on my brain.I wish they would have gone for a more mature movie, with a more serious story revolving around the fight for freedom during WW2.

496,RatingGirl,As a whole this is a pretty decent movie.,7,14 April 2019,"(Pre-Endgame MCU Rewatch) Steve Rogers' pre-super serum days are great, the Howard Stark Expo is a nice and fun addition, and initial post-super serum Steve is hilarious. He punched Hitler in the face 200 times! Once he finally gets to see real action I feel it loses a bit of fun but it's still decent.Both Tommy Lee Jones and Hugo Weaving are excellent in this film and I expected nothing less from them. Agent Carter is a great character and if you like her I definitely recommend watching the Agent Carter series.",Captain America - The First Avenger
497,gedard1,The first taste of an epic story.,8,30 July 2011,"Captain America: The First Avenger.The film tell us the origins of the Captain, The war and the Villain.Story 8/10. Is based in the comic book, but it has some faults. Some deaths that shouldn't exist. Some geographic, time-line errors. But besides that is a great story.Special Effects 7/10. For a Marvel/Disney movie some effects are pure CGI. I'm not talking TF3 CGI but it abuses sometimes. Specially in the scene where Captain meets the Villain. Acting 9/10. Chris Evans has to be, with Robert Downey Jr the best casting for The Avengers. He is the Captain America, his acting as ""Little Steve"" is a great performance (making us forget of the Fantastic Four). Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter is a good actress, Her scenes with Chris are better by far than the Portman-Hemsworth or Paltrow-Downey. Sebastian Stan has a small role but it delivers a great acting as Bucky Barnes. Overall the casting was way good. And they know how to act!!The movie is enjoyable, is the best of the marvel films yet.... Works, is not bored. Great movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger
498,bradleybarker71,Captain Amazing,7,31 July 2011,A really good enjoyable superhero action flick if it had not been for Xmen First Class this would have been the best superhero film of 2011. The plot follows Steve Rogers and there are some great scenes of a puny Steve Rogers and his story is amazing and is not rushed one bit. It is one of Marvels best and a great comic book it is. The action scenes are amazing Red Skull is a great villain but i feel they don't have the right actor in this movie but it is a much needed improvement on the 90's red skull. There are some great links to the avengers and other hero's we have seen and one hero's father. A great superhero outing for Marvel and it has to be another Marvel success. Captain America Is one of the superhero movies of 2011 that you just simple must see the effect of WW2 is good as well. Stick around after the credits have rolled because what you will see will take your breath away it is amazing and i will say i am counting the days sown till the Avengers as i think it is going to be brilliant.,Captain America - The First Avenger
499,guyincognito1,At last - a stand-out Superhero!,7,29 November 2011,"There are many superhero movies, but Captain America is one that has caught my eye, and this alone, with the vast expanse of similarly-themed films, only ameliorates the success of Joe Johnston's adaptation of a comic-book story of a young man who loves his country. This theme in itself is enough, as films such as Glory (1989), Rocky (1976), and Patton (1970) have already shown, but although the patriotism in Captain America is blatant for all to see (just look at his name!), it is ultimately justified. The original 'Captain America' was, as the film explains (in a roundabout way) merely a morale-booster, a propaganda ploy, and Johnston used this to his advantage.By showing how this ploy was nowhere near as effective as people thought it would be this film serves also as a reminder of true American values, not just the petty bureaucratic ones of government officials. But I digress. I don't pretend that this film has any true moral values, other than those of 'goodness over evil' which is the central theme of any superhero film. What I do say, however, is that this film, for me at least, has been an enormous success, not least because of the seriousness with which it took itself. The actors... well, the principles at least, seemed to take their roles to heart, something which is very difficult to do when you are making a fantasy film.Recent franchises such as Spiderman seem to have lost their way. 'Peter Parker', a representation of victory and triumph to geeks everywhere has lost himself in the persona of 'Spiderman', or so was the impression I got from the train-wrecks of 2 and 3, but The Captain remains true to himself throughout, and this is what I think made the movie such a captivator. Yes, bits of it looked ridiculous, but so do elements of all superhero films. It is an unavoidable inconsequence.There is, of course, lots of action, which was beautifully sequenced, and the special effects were predictably stunning, and also fantastically well implemented. Maybe the franchise will go the same way as that of the Spiderman trilogy, but for the moment at least, this is the Superhero movie to beat. Game on.",Captain America - The First Avenger
500,Dragonslayer2000,"After Steve Rogers receives an experiment on his body that makes him bigger and stronger, he must use his powers to fight the crazy and evil Red Skull; AKA, Johann Schmidt.",10,2 January 2012,"This was an excellent movie, very well done. I especially liked the fact that this movie had Captain America as a very good character. This movie also is good because it shows the first half of the movie well. It explained in a very well done way how Steve Rogers became Captain America. The rest of the movie is fun and action packed. Everyone who watches this will enjoy it. Despite the Red Skull's scary looks and evil deeds. I also liked this movie because it didn't completely focus on the violence, like some other super hero movies. Chris Evans and Hugo Weaving were both good actors in this motion picture, and they are so good, they will probably keep you in your seat for the entire film. This movie also attracted many people once it came out. The only thing I didn't like about the movie is the ending. Since this is not a spoiler, I will not reveal the ending. Just watch the ending, and you'll see what I mean. Three cheers for Captain America!!!",Captain America - The First Avenger

All around it's not a bad film but the pacing was a little slow. The movie does show us some cool fights by the end but the trip to the end takes longer then expected. The movie does pay off in the end and is definitely worth a watch. Just nothing outstanding.,Captain America - The First Avenger

Barely any plot. Unoriginal story.",Captain America - The First Avenger
506,nettminder,"From Comic Book to Screen, this one is a winner!",8,23 July 2011,"The Marvel character movies have been a mixed bag. I know when a film is being produced and directed by people outside the comics industry that some things are lost in translation and some things are changed simply so the director can put their individual mark on it. Up until last month, Iron Man was the best movie to capture the main idea of the character and story, in my opinion. Iron Man was a very true to the mythos and great to watch. Captain America is better and that is not taking anything away from Iron Man. Yes, still some aspects of the story was changed, but I felt this was a great translation that captured and added to Captain America. They handled the background story and cast of characters with intelligence. I think the original intent of Captain America's creator comes through and what his values were. They did a great job with Steve Rogers pre-super soldier serum with the visual effects. The plot was very good and moved along well developing the story. I do not even remember any bad language at all which is rare these days. If you like super heroes and want to be entertained for two hours then this movie will do it.",Captain America - The First Avenger
507,Dainius8888,A decent film for Captain America,8,2 August 2011,"Right. So the first thing I definitely liked about the movie was the choice for the role of Caps. Chris Evans truly looks perfect for this role. I saw his ideal face in in the red, white and blue costume, and, as cheesy as it sounds, I actually thought that he truly looks like an Amerian hero. His determined look and serious Brooklyn dialect goes amazingly well with the portrayal of this iconic character. And this is not cheesy (I'm addressing the people, unfamiliar with this character right here) because Captain America is one of the first major comic book heroes in history. He's as equally important, if not more, as Superman. And that is why the film makers made him look so 'flawless'. Because he comes from a REALLY long time ago. Even the story is set in the 40's, when the superhero world was much simpler. Good guys were good. Bad guys were bad. That's it. Not like modern superhero's, where's there's a twist around every corner, and the bad guy turns out to be the good guy, and the good guy turns out to be the bad guy, and so on... I was really glad to finally get a really simple, but quite enjoyable hero in a movie to lay my eyes upon. Of course Chris Evans was not the only star of the film. The cast is superb (Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Stanley Tucci, etc.). Hugo Weaving surely gives an equally impressive performance next to Chris Evans. Probably even more impressive. He really managed to pull of the German accent portraying the German Nazi evildoer. Also a very clear character. A perfect bad guy, with no noble or kind values. Pure evil. The only problem about Hugo Weaving in this picture was that there was too little screen time for his role. His character was really appealing to me. Frankly, Hugo Weaving was actually the first reason, I wanted to go see this film. And it turned out to be a similar situation to Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"". Everyone who loved that film, loved it for one good reason - Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker (of course that's not the only good thing about that movie). And as many times as I see ""the Dark knight"", I can not get enough of the Joker. I wanted him to get more screen time. And it's the same with Hugo Weaving here. He could definitely had more on screen time. It felt as if Hugo Weaving wasn't 'maxed out'. And all of the other characters are really appealing because of their 'simplicity'. The Plot will definitely satisfy the comic book fan. It really resembles the comic story, which I really enjoyed. Because often, when a film studio decides to make a comic hero film, but DOESN'T follow the story in the comic, and makes up their own plot, it usually ends up bad. However. The people who are unfamiliar with Captain America, will probably not be impressed by the plot, because it does not stand out as something new or gripping. You have to know the comic to enjoy the story, because it's filled with details from it. Speaking of which, it was really entertaining how they used pieces and fragments in this film from other recent Marvel movies, like ""Thor"", ""Ironman"" or ""the Incredible Hulk"".So basically it is determined by your familiarity with Captain America, whether you'll like this movie or not so much or not at all. If you are a fan, I believe you'll at least enjoy it, otherwise not so likely.",Captain America - The First Avenger
508,mad_fighter77-86-984114,too long with so little in it !!,5,3 September 2011,"the movie is neither too serious nor too comic !!! they didn't exploit the concept of a super hero properly as the whole first half of the movie is about this skinny ""wanna-be"" soldier which was pretty boring except for a few comedic scenes here and there... not even funny enough. also if you are a ww2 fan you won't enjoy this movie much as it goes half way between a comic and a reality war..the second half of the movie is where the story and action hardly starts to kick in..and suddenly it becomes a super hero movie ! but the plot is a bit stupid that you will find yourself asking this question many times "" why doesn't he just do this !...why don't they just do that !!? "" so it doesn't engage smartly to the audience..OK the good stuff :D, visual effects are well done that you won't even feel them..environment and costume designs are OK, action scenes are not bad but fewer than one hoped",Captain America - The First Avenger
509,gardoma,Superhero movie ruined by unimaginative development and infantile writing,3,7 August 2011,"Superhero movies could be, depending on who writes and directs them, dark (Burton's Batman), cerebral (Snyder's Watchmen), tragic (Nolan's Batman), cleverly funny (Favreau's Ironman) or fashionably pop (Raimi's Spiderman). Unfortunately, some can be utterly stupid, like Schumacher's Batman & Robin and, now, Captain America.I found so many flaws with this movie that it is difficult to begin the list. First, the retro-style, which could have potentially been a plus, was simply tasteless and idiotic. The good care spent on style, clothing, and hairdos of the 40s was out-weighted by the bad taste in designing weapons that lacked any imagination, and looked like colorful glow sticks at best.The jingoist atmosphere of the beginning was downright irritating, with the skinny main character trying to enroll in the Army and being rejected (c'mon, like the army never enlisted skinny guys as spies, clerks, radio operators, mechanics, or simple cannon meat) only to be picked up by a team of scientists for an experiment to create super soldiers.To be fair, Chris Evans is not that bad as an actor. although he had more sparks in Fantastic Four and Scott Pilgrim. But Markus and McFeely must have thought that writing a superhero movies frees writers from any duty to put together a decent plot. They did not invest any effort in creating plausible scenarios (Rogers/Captain America is in Italy exactly where his best friend's division is captured, which is also exactly where the colonel who selected him for the experiment is located, which is exactly where the token girl/scientist was displaced). They also did not spend time introducing characters (The bad guy, aka Red Skull, has a risible back-story, besides a risible and overly cartoonist make-up). They even miss potential opportunities: The McGuffin of the movie is some sort of cubic lava-lamp that the Nazis are after. The lava-lamp has some kind of unexplained occult nature; is retrieved from a church in Norway (wtf???) and is finally used to create... death rays! Yes, death rays, a plot device that (a) was shunned upon in B-movies even in the 50s, and (b) discards the only cool subplot, i.e. the Nazis dabbling in the occult, which was not lost, for example, in Hellboy. As for the adventures of Captain America, let's drop a veil of pity. He is supposedly the strongest/faster super-soldier, but his great adventures basically consist in ziplining through the Alps and opening prisons cells after stealing the keys. That's really all. Not a single combat scene that goes beyond what you could see in the Beastmaster in the 80s. Are the authors maybe going for a sane, raw, realistic take on superheros? Nay---when needed, and even when not needed at all, Captain America shows off his great weapon, which is basically a giant Frisbee that defies gravity and conveniently resists to the Nazi death rays. In the meantime, director Joe Johnston (ok, that's the guy from Jumanji and Jurassic Park III, but even he could do better) is very careful in avoiding putting the camera in any position that might give some edge and atmosphere to any shot. In fact, the movie was so cinematographically dull I was surprised they just did not shoot everything with 3 cameras, like I Love Lucy. I guess that the most original shots were contributed by the CGI guys. Essentially, what comes through is an expensive toy-movie with grandiose and expensive visual effects, firefighter's orchestra music, and lots of advertisement spent to promote a ridiculous man-in-tights wielding a pied metal saucer, and fighting villains whose makeup and depth make Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze look like Shakespearian characters.I want my money back. The only way the movie could have redeemed itself is if Captain America died in the damn Nazi flying plane. Unfortunately (sorry to ruin the surprise) it doesn't happen.",Captain America - The First Avenger
510,vikcyru,1st sucker,5,20 January 2020,I love the avengers series in general but felt this movie - set first chronologically was one of the lamer offerings... I know they are super hero movies but very unbelievable as I couldn't grasp how a scrawny guy now with injected muscles can now run special ops missions with no training...

511,Spiderfan19,Underwhelming in the end,9,2 March 2019,"Another pretty good installment in the MCU. Captain America is probably one of the greatest characters in these films, and to see his beginnings was great. I think that the first half of the film is great with the way they paced the film, and how they did some of the action. This movie falters in the second half though. They go through multiple years through pretty much a 1-2 minute montage, which leads to an underwhelming third act.

513,Mykewood,A nice ride...,8,22 July 2011,"I saw Cap @ the midnight showing. Admittedly, I am a comic book fan, but not a Captain America fan. He was always hokey to me. I wasn't even a real fan of the Avengers.That said, all these movies have been awesome. And CA is no exception. These guys have done an outstanding job of taking material that could easily have been tired & corny, & making in entertaining & funny. The characters take themselves seriously, but are clearly having fun with it. That is a delicate balance that Green Lantern missed. What has made so many of the recent comic book movies good is they've had serious directors & serious actors playing the parts. They take the craft seriously. That has given these stories a credibility they lacked in the past. Captain America had a chance to be as bad as Green Latern, so I was worried. If they didn't do it right, it could have been horrible. Chris Evans does a great job. He is so believable as the endearing little guy who wont give up. You don't feel sorry for him, because HE doesn't. His life mantra isn't ""pity me."" It's more, ""Yea, I may lose, but not without a fight!"" He has heart you cant deny. So seeing what he becomes & what he does with it... You're actually happy for him.Tommy Lee Jones is at his typical straight-faced wisecracker best. If there has been a better actor at being absolutely hilarious while constantly looking like his dog, cat, & wife just died, I'd like to know who. His delivery is so awesome.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I decided to lose all my prejudice and watch the film from unsoiled eyes. I was pleasantly surprised. The actors are fine, the story is solid, the visual effects is very good, the music and cinematography could have improved. The time-period is well brought to life, and believable. Whilst not being able to fully escape the Marvel- superhero film clichè's, the director, actors, writer and crew manage to steer the film away from being just another film. I was able to recognize originality in everything the movie presented. Well worth watching, although just a small step away from being a must-see. 8/10",Captain America - The First Avenger

Yes, I am afraid expectations were high. In comparison, Iron Man 2 (which was a failure in comparison to Iron Man 1 personally) looks like Star Wars to this ""over-inflated flat tire"".The acting is over-driven above tasteful limits, if there is acting at all, mind to say. Story has some nice Sci-Fi elements, and thats the whole reason I gave it 2 stars. Hugo Weaving was way over the top, this is probably his worst role so far.

517,Troy_VA,"Best live action adaptation of Cap so far, but still lacking in some areas",6,28 April 2012,"The cgi transformation of sickly Steve Rogers into muscular Captain America was very impressive and the action sequences were good for the most part. Key actors Chris Evans as Captain America/Steve Rogers, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Chester Phillips, Hugo Weaving as Johann Schmidt/the Red Skull and Dominic Cooper as Howard Stark did a good job of convincing us they knew what they were doing. However, in my opinion, this was the second weakest ""pre-Avengers"" movie, with only the Hulk faring poorer. Not to say this wasn't a fun movie, but some of the flaws were glaring for longtime fans of the comic series. Bucky Barnes should have been younger than Steve Rogers, some of the action seemed rushed and there seemed to be a tendency to substitute cgi special effects for more realistic action far too often. Oh, yeah! Then there's the atrocious casting of Samuel L. Jackson as an alternate reality black and bald Nick Fury. I'm still not sure which Marvel reality this movie series is supposed to be based upon, but then I'm a sucker for consistency. Overall, not bad. I give it a 6/10.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I must say I really enjoyed this movie and was happy to see Marvel treat such an important character with as much care as they did. The red skull was a really fun character and a perfect villain for Captain America's first movie, and they chose the perfect actors for the Captain and the Red Skull. Honestly all of the actors did a great job in this movie, even getting me a little choked up watching Bucky slip away. The story and pacing was also well handled and to see such a believed character treated with as much love as he was I am happy to say I was able to experience it. Truly well done, from the action shots to the 1940's feeling I left the theater much happier then when I entered. I give this a 9/10. "" Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing.

522,ajudki20,Do 'Popcorn Movies' Need to Be this Dumbed Down?,3,25 September 2012,"In some ways the premise of Captain America: The First Avenger is irony deaf. The film has a similar light, fun-loving and stylized tone to other recent Marvel movies. But this film is more earnest and perhaps sentimental. The intended moral of the film could be summed up in a line from the movie---'A weak man knows the value of strength.' The concept of a brave imp with a heart of gold being the center of a film is interesting. The only problem is that Steve Rogers is a less than nobody, a man of little to no value, until he's juiced up on sci-fi 'roids. Once he becomes a hunk with super athletic power, he's suddenly worth while (and only then is his obvious love interest interested in him). Normally I don't really put much stock into how 'movie messages' affect youth. But this movie seems to tell kids they are worthless and unattractive unless they are super-buff Adonises. It also seems to suggest in our supposedly anti-steroids era that it is OK to take the easy way to physical strength and all the power it brings.But, reading less into meanings, Captain America is a rather dull film. It has a used feel because so many of the ideas and forays of the film are second hand. Part of this is only natural in this era of comic book movie proliferation. The movie has adopted a sort of Men In Blackish sci-fi 1940's look that has little to do with history, mixed in with some war and action movie clichés with a bit of Bond-villain over the top evil and souped up Nazi reference bad guys with some Indian Jones sci-fi mysticism. No idea here feels fully original, yet the brew is disjointed as well as stereotypical. The casting is lacking. The cast and acting style takes the audience out of the 40's era the film is supposed to take place in immediately. Chris Evans is blandly earnest, though competent in his role as Steve Rodgers. Hayley Atwell is bland and empty as Peggy. Tommy Lee Jones is, well, distractingly Tommy Lee Jones in his role as Colonel Phillips, although he is one of he few bits of screen presence in the film. And of course who better (or more predictable) to play a souped up Nazi with a red skull face than Hugo Weaving? But it isn't just acting and casting. The characters are written as clichés from foundation to roof. We have the all American hero from modest background (in this case from modest body), ultra Darth Vaderesque villain with Star Wars-like super weaponry (and no real motive or back story), the tough minded babe poised to fall in love with the newly buff hero, the tough but fair military leader, and assorted less used cliché people. Even for a popcorn action film this seems dumbed down.This film is escapism, but do we want to escape here? The film is bland and lacks all but the most simple messages which it still manages to mess up. The action is ample, yet not attention getting. The bounds of reality are strained. Steve Rodgers' new found strength suddenly makes him the most coordinated human ever to live, and soldiers crack unfunny quips to one another at the most intense combat moments imaginable, in the face of new Star Wars type weaponry. Nothing about WWII era look or strategy even remotely concerns itself here. The idea of a comic book film taking place in the 40's is interesting, but the film has no interest in the 40's or WWII in any but the most shallow way. The look of the film beyond some nice art deco looking things is not appealing. The special effects are not interesting to look at, yet are plastered everywhere. The one major exception is the 'wussing' of Chris Evans, which is done remarkably well---it is one of the few joys of the film. Overall this film has a tone of mindless excess which feels like it could have been directed by a computer program. 3 and ½ stars.",Captain America - The First Avenger
523,sharkattack2,The First Avenger,8,13 July 2012,"Captain America is one of our most beloved super heroes, and he needed a good movie. Especially after the disaster from the 90's. However I'm happy to say that this movie is a great super hero movie and worth watching.The two strongest actors in the movie are Chris Evans (Captain America), Hugo Weaving (Red Skull), and Tommy Lee Jones (Col. Chester Philips). They all do a great job and make every scene they're in strong. All the other actors are good as well.The action scenes are great and put together really well. Although there were some parts where the affects were obviously fake.There are a few things that some people are not going to like. After Steve Rodgers gets his powers, the movie starts to move slow and does not pick up again until about 20-30 minutes later, and those parts had a lot of scenes that make you wonder why didn't that get cut.However, Captain America: The First Avenger is a really good movie.

525,mihaitutu7,One of the best superhero movies!,8,12 August 2011,"Being a comic book fan of the Marvel superheroes, this was a movie I was not going to miss and thank God I didn't! Captain America is one the best superhero movies ever made.The movie follows in large guidelines the story from the comic books. Captain America is the result of an experimental serum administrated on Steve Rogers by the Allies. Also, he is the only super soldier, as the scientist who developed the serum was killed soon after it's application.On the Nazi side, there is the Red Skull, or Jonas Schmidt, head of Hidra, the Nazi advanced science department. He tested on himself the superhuman soldier serum, but the formula he had was incomplete.The action is pretty much simple: WW2 was being won by the Nazi, as the Red Skull developed weapons with unconventional firepower (they discover a relic from the Asgard gods which generates huge amounts of power) and the Allies use Captain America to comeback. The Allies organize surgical strike missions with Captain America in front line and little by little, destroy all the Hidra bases.The final battle takes place on the Hidra bombardier, which was heading towards the big cities of USA. Captain America fights the Red Skull in an epic battle, but Red Skull disappears when he grabs the Asgard relic (in my opinion the Asgard relic was a miniature teleportation device, similar to the one used in the movie Thor to get to other planets). Captain America cannot stop the plane and crashes in Antartica, where he sleeps for 70 years until Shield units find him.The CGI used in the movie is balanced, good looking and makes the movie authentic. Many of the stunts aren't CGI-ed, and because it's a WW2 movie, we can only appreciate the props and scenery.The characters have room for development and we can see how everybody interacts with each other, on all layers. Apart from other superhero movies, this one blends the human relationship dynamics with the fast pace very well. There are a lot of jokes that open up the mood but the action is action. The fight scenes are very well designed and coregraphed.All in all, this movie is a must as it is very very good. Also, another reason to see it is to have a complete idea of what the Avengers will look like.",Captain America - The First Avenger

527,lbk99-geo,"Excellent movie, best superhero film in years",10,31 July 2011,"I saw Captain America on its second weekend (in 2D) and while I expected a good movie, I was surprised to watch the best action genre movie I have seen in years. The special effects are excellent, and if you are looking for an exciting, fun movie to watch you need look no further.However, if you want a story with more depth, this movie also delivers on that level. It is the story of one brave man, not gifted physically, but given a second change, willing to fight to make a difference where he could in the world. It is of course a fictional story, but at its core I think resonates, as I think of the many people who have given their own lives sacrificially for others.Chris Evans, playing Steve Rodgers (Captain America), does a convincing job of playing a man who is ""weak"" outside, but made of iron inside. His adversary, Johann Schmidt (The Red Skull) is a bit over the top in his performance, but not so much as to become a campy villain. The supporting cast does a nice job, even if Tommy Lee Jones seems a bit wasted in a relatively small role with little opportunity to give his acting skills the workout they are certainly up to.The movie could be seen as somewhat of a setup for the Avengers movie, as ""Thor"" and other Marvel superhero movies have been. However, I think this movie stands alone very nicely, and the setup part of it is not distracting at all other than perhaps the brief closing sequence that might have been better relegated to after the credits.The movie is set in the 1940's and from what I know of the time seems to capture their atmosphere well. I did not think this a problem for today's audiences since the essence of the story has little to do with the time period and everything to do with heroism. Captain America as a person is obviously a man who is not perfect, but he is a true hero that I enjoyed being able to wholeheartedly root for. If you have not seen it yet I recommended you do so!",Captain America - The First Avenger

If you thought independence day was a load of rubbish then you're going to hate this garbage also. Having wasted the hour or so watching this film I have to say, I want my life back and yes it is that awful. The star of the fantastic four is dressed in a leotard and prancing around and single handedly taking on a large army of superior armed soldiers and winning. Yes he can simply walk undetected into highly secret bases unnoticed while wearing his unconvincing garish costume for all to see. Somehow everyone who shoots at him aims for a small shield and without any noticeable super powers takes on the might of the Nazi power. ""Enemy at the gates"" this is not, nor is it a fun or family film, in fact i would go as far to say that this is nothing more than propaganda of the most ridiculous kind as the world will always be a better place with the good ol' US of A involved. On a scale of 1 to 100 i would vote this marginally above a Tom Cruise film but below any sanitary or worth your while to watch.

531,WaltWiz,One of the dumbest movies ever,5,29 March 2014,"The movie has excellent visuals and a good premise, and Captain America is likable enough as a character, but it rips your suspension of disbelief to shreds, then burns them and scatters the ashes. The bad guys in the movie are an outfit called Hydra, which is Hitler's research division in this version of history, except they don't really work for Hitler, but for their own leader, Red Skull. Why Hitler lets them get away with this, considering the seemingly endless amount of resources they consume, and the fact that they straight up murder the guys sent to inspect them, is a retarded mystery. It might have been explained by the fact that they possess technology decades ahead of its time, including guns that can vaporize a man with a single shot, except that all they seem to do in combat is fall over and die, which is the cinematic equivalent of feeding someone feces.

532,atreus_4971,Nothing special,3,25 June 2012,"OK, so I watched this film because there was nothing else on, and in fairness its overall execution was not bad. It's the standard all American hero/superhero bs we've seen so many times before. A standard 'we are yanks and we love ourselves' kind of thing. There is nothing about this film that makes it stand out, but plenty of truly cringeworthy moments that will make you duck for the vomit bag. Acting: OK. A little boring, and you have to wonder if this Chris Evans guy was ever given a challenging part to play.... CGI: as usual. Plot: None to idiotic I lost interest about half way through in all honesty. Seen it done so many times before going right back to The Shadow. I would rather pick my toenails clean as at the very least I might find something of interest. The thing that worried me most of all about this flick was the idea that many younger kids might actually believe that the second world war actually had particle weapon technology and was won by a fictional superhero, or am I just getting old? :) In conclusion: OK if you had two hours to do absolutely nothing at all.",Captain America - The First Avenger
533,darthchris19,Captain America- the last before The Avengers,7,9 August 2011,"So Captain America!... the last superhero movie before the AvengersAnd how those this all America movie fair? pretty good to be honest. Even though this movie was pushing the whole American war propaganda a little over the edge I never quite felt the ""america"" in the movie which is a good thing. The sight of Chris Evans portraying Steve Rogers before the super-soldier serum was hilarious but it kinda felt real and non cgi. Kudos to Chris Evans playing a wimp for a change even though only for a short while. Chris Evans was perfect for the role of the young and brave Steve Rogers who later became one of the first known superheroes Captain America. Kudos also to Hugo Weaving who very convincably portrayed the antagonist The red Skull. Both characters were believable were so different in their roles that they actually balanced each other out. As for the rest of the cast. Well Hayley Atwell and Tommy Lee Jones did not contribute much to the acting department. both characters were super underdeveloped especially Atwell who was the romantic interest to Rogers. And Tommy Lee Jonses character was also super clichéd. The movie had some pacing issues with feelings that some scenes lasted for too long but the action scenes were excellent especially with Captain Americas shield which made a nice ding sound when it hit an opponent.Overall Cpatin America was an excellent superhero movie which kept me wanting for The Avengers movie even more :)I give this movie a 8 out of 10",Captain America - The First Avenger
534,micahmatt-fcb,Disney fails again.,3,17 June 2013,"Captain America was never a really interesting superhero, but Marvel went all out in pushing boredom. Marvel seemed to care so much about the boring stuff, they forgot that it was a comic book movie. They forgot about the flare of superheroes. If you want to see all the action in this movie, watch the trailer. The entire montage you see in the trailer is the only action in the movie, scene for scene. It was simply one of the most boring movies I have ever witnessed and is on par with the Pearl Harbor movie starring Ben Affleck. The only difference was the main character wore tights and had a fruity-looking shield. If you like this movie simply because it has ""America"" in the title, your argument is invalid. No amount of pushing patriotism will make this movie good. It's like trying to argue that a brick is tasty because it is red like an apple. Marvel should have never sold out to Disney.",Captain America - The First Avenger

In fact, it's lower than Iron Man 2 here on IMDb, and Captain America: The First Avenger is definitely better than Iron Man 2.The actors are all great in their respective roles, and The First Avenger is an enjoyable action flick despite what anyone says. It's not perfect, and it isn't the best Marvel movie, but it's fun, and that's exactly what it needs to be. Compared to its sequels, The First Avenger is different in the terms that it isn't mixed in with all of the Avengers craziness. It's a completely standalone movie, and it's an epic blockbuster that will please any comic book fan.I don't have too much to say about this film, other than it is underrated and I definitely enjoy it.

540,dayspring-one,The First Avenger Reviewed,8,9 August 2011,"Just saw Chris Evans helm the role of the first Avenger, and I must say it was more than entertaining. I immediately got sucked into the movie, leaving no prisoners around. Seeing Steve Rogers as a little puny, yet gutsy guy was one of the best moments, somehow it gave more character to the legend. Even my initial fear of a gimmicky Red Skull was proved wrong, Hugo Weaving and the make-up artists did a great job. Although I did always imagined Johan Schmidt to have a thick German accent. Either way, the story, the pace, the supporting cast (Tommy Lee Jones was a brilliant pick), and the eye candy SFX made it all into one of Marvel Studios proudest moments. Can't wait to see Avengers.8/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
541,Filmbrewer,mindless attempt at entertainment,4,10 August 2011,"To put this politely, this movie is just plain dumb. You'll really have to tune out and shut down the old tinker to thoroughly enjoy this flick,unless you're one of those few who purposely sit through a crappy movie just to make fun of it and snicker silly comments under your breath to your movie-going buddy. SPOILER ALERT! The sad part is, it started off pretty good. In the first half hour they introduce and developed the characters really well and then he turns into Cpt. USA and the movie takes a dive. For reasons unknown, other than the script is dumb, the generals refuse to use this buffed out soldier who can jump over 10 foot fences and take out submarines with his fist. And the kid who has always wanted to join the military and fight Nazis doesn't go back to boot camp? That was his one and only drive; he lied and cheated his way in, why on earth would he be so willing to give up his dream to join a traveling Broadway show??? And he does this for three years!!!! stupid. And when he finally gets the urge to fight, he's suddenly great at everything- -ummm excuse me, but didn't you skip out on ALL of your training? You've never even fired a gun before and you've been singing the past 3 years! Oh and don't expect any Nazis to show up in this WWII movie, that would just be silly. Instead, we have a bad guy who's first plan, if Cpt. A left him alone, is to take out Berlin and probably kill Hitler. Good thing we stopped him, killing is wrong! It seems like marvel is really dropping the ball lately with their super hero movies. I will not be surprised if they reboot Captain America in 2 - 3 years from now just like they've done with countless other failed attempts.",Captain America - The First Avenger

And in the end the villain was killed or better to say disintegrated (like voldemort..!!) by the CUBE, due to some unknown and unexplained Godly phenomena..!!

543,jammin_jam,"First Half Is Good, Second Half Is Awful.",6,18 May 2015,"Captain America: The First Avenger starts out pretty good. Steve Rodgers is a very likable character. He is a small guy who wants to make a big difference. He wants to serve his country by joining the army, however he is too small and physically weak to pass the boot camp training. Lucky for him the good guys have just cooked up a Super Solider Serum. Since Steve is such a noble patriot he is chosen to be part of the super soldier experiment. The experiment is successful and he becomes Captain America. Unfortunately, everything after Steve becomes Captain America is just plain awful. The first half of the movie was pretty good. There was nice sets, the boot camp scenes were enjoyable, and CGI they used to put the head of Chris Evans on that small body was seamless. However the entire second half is terrible. We went from a well done period piece with nice sets and characters to a dumb action movie where a superhero wrapped in an American flag fights Nazis with laser guns. All of the world war 2 centric action is glossed over in a 30 second montage. Instead most of the action is between Captain America and an evil Nazi group led by the Red Skull. Red Skull is an awful villain. Whereas Captain America is pure good, Red Skull is pure evil. He is a very cliché bad guy, his motives make no sense, and his evil plan is laughable. For the most part the second half of the movie is just a bunch of dumb action. Despite it being world war 2 there is no realism or grit to any of the action sequences. There is a funny looking superhero fighting against a funny looking Nazi with a red head, all the while there is a bunch of lasers firing everywhere. The CGI in the second half is so fake looking and is a big part of why the action looks as bad as it does. Overall the second half of the story is nonsensical, the action is forgettable, the villain is a joke, and Captain America just isn't that interesting. He doesn't exhibit any distinct character development because he was already the perfect patriotic boy scout before he was even Captain America. Overall this is a pretty mediocre movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger
544,misha1998,It's predictable but ultimately its a really fun and a really nostalgic trip thru a superhero film.,7,22 April 2014,"I watched the film yesterday and I will tell you something: It's predictable, yet it is fun.My first complaint with the film is the love interest of Captain America. It's so predictable, and it is just not adding much to the plot of the movie. In fact, the whole movie is pretty predictable -- its just you do not know how it happens until they show you what happens. Going back to the romantic interest of Captain America, it doesn't really add up to the plot, and for me the character would have been ripped from the story altogether.Besides from that, I would like to praise this film for being a war flick, for being a conspiracy thriller and for being a general superhero film. Chris Evans brings to life the character of Captain America to the screen, and finally does respect to the character. I mean, remember that 1990 attempt to create a Captain America franchise, we all know how it went.This is a good film despite its flaws.",Captain America - The First Avenger
545,taggard-98527,The heart of the MCU is introduced.,9,16 April 2016,"The good - I feel like this is becoming a bit of a broken record, but the supporting cast in this movie is simply outstanding. Even if we consider Hayley Atwell and Hugo Weaving stars, you still have stand-out performances from Tommy Lee Jones, Sebastian Stan, Toby Jones (as Arnim Zola) and Stanley Tucci, in an incredibly performance as Dr Erskine. This movie gets so much mileage from its supporting players.The excellent - I love Atwell's Peggy Carter and Skinny Steve Rodgers is one of my all time favorite characters from the MCU. Steve is hero even before he becomes one. Hugo Weaving is a perfect Red Skull.The nitpicks - I don't have many...would love to have seen more of the Howling Commandos, but maybe Netflix will give us a series, or more Agent Carter time.Summary - I love this movie. I find it gets me right in the feels in a way that only Guardians can match. Great action, great heart, great drama and great sacrifice.

The movie does a great job of showing the transformation of Steve Rogers into Captain America. I won't post any spoilers, but I think most people are going to be very happy with how this movie was done.Highlight performances were Chris Evans as Cap, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Phillips, Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull, Stanley Tucci as Dr. Erskine, and the whole crew of Cap's Team during WW2. Really, the acting was top-notch throughout.I liked the plot a lot. It kept a nice pace, unless you are an action junkie who gets upset if something doesn't blow up every minute. Cap was believable. Not overblown, not a tough-guy, just a good man who wants to do right. I LOVED how he was portrayed. Major kudos to the writers and director.Overall, I think this is my favorite superhero movie to date.

I got a group of ten friends and showed up hours early with Captain America merchandise and enough caffeine to stay up through Lord of the Rings in its entirety.What happened?Every single person in my group was disappointed. Needless to say, we still enjoyed ourselves, and I wasn't even expecting much, (Jumanji and Jurassic Park III at the top of the director's credentials), but, man, I couldn't help counting the flaws throughout the film.Positive: Chris Evans was surprisingly convincing. Also, our hero was truly inspirational (if not corny). The sets were nice, and the other stars filled their roles well. I was well entertained, and the first half flowed nicely.Negative: Oh, lord. I'll try not to nitpick. Most glaring was the absolute pathetic villain. Hugo Weaving (a great actor who manages to give his character some, well, character) plays a downright cheesy, sappy, crazy, and so un-menacing-its-not-even-funny chum nicknamed Red Skull. His back story is never laid out and only hinted at a few times, his followers are faceless drones with advanced weaponry but the brains and aim of stormtroopers, and his intentions are ridiculously stupid and unexplainable (his target is ""everything""? Oh, please). He was never threatening and never endangered our hero, not to mention his death was as anti-climatic as they come (Voldemort, anyone?)Also obvious is the cliché invincibility of the Captain. He leaps twenty feet as flames engulf him, he fistfights scores of goons, blows up crap all over the place, and never once gets seriously injured. Suspense? Apparently, there's no need when you have patriotism!The technology was just plain silly for its era. Leaving out the cheesy blue-shooting things (something to do with the gods? I don't know, it was kind of weird), there are spycraft, tanks the size of mansions, helicopters that look like spacecraft, single-person submarines, and (my personal favorite) manned bombers in the shape of bombs. Are they suicide bombers? Apparently.There is no attachment to the characters (anyone blink when his best friend died?), there are loads of forgettable scenes (notably the war montage of which the trailer consists, which might have made a good movie, I might add), and clichés (love interest walks in on random kiss, etc.) and downright sloppy pacing galore.I must stop here, but seriously, 8.0? Not even close. Enjoyable fare, but nothing to think twice about. Here's to hoping Joss Whedon improves upon Chris Evan's Captain in 2012.",Captain America - The First Avenger
552,thanhlienanh-vo,Captain America is Private America,6,21 October 2011,"One of the blockbuster in 2011, with the handsome Chris Evens who's been having his good share of being the leads in superheroes movies. Overall the film isn't too bad, but compared to other superheroes movies, it can only received an average weight.The movie takes place in the 40s when WWII were being real bad. However, it has one simple story line. To support war, the American and Germanic scientists was working to create a perfect solider. Steven Rogers (Chris Evan), who was born with an unimpressive physique, is continuously denied to join the army. However, his persistence catches the attention of Dr. Erksine and he let him join the army. With help from Dr. Erksine, Steve goes through the transformation and begins his story of being the leader of American army, fighting against their nemesis – Johann Schmidt Red Head – to protect their country and bring peace to the world. Unlike other works by Marvel, Captain America is unexpectedly simple, with a linear story, 2 sides of good and bad guys, and a predictable ending.Despite being a blockbuster and set for commercial appeal, the movie doesn't get a good cast. Except for the hunky Christ Evans, we have Hugo Weaving and Stanley Tucci in supporting roles. Main female lead (Hayley Atwell) is of little fame, and the relationship between her and male lead is quite redundant, to color off the movie. Characterization is dull and dialogues are unmemorable.Captain America is a superheroes movie, but it lacks a superheroes feeling. The fight scenes are nothing sort of fabulous or spectacular, the powers are not supernatural like X-men, Spiderman or Superman, the technology are not futuristic as in Iron Man or movies like James Bond and Mission Impossible. Fighting scenes with guns and big guns are similar to what you've seen in other action movies, while melee combats are like fights between medieval soldiers. In one sense, this makes the heroes more human and related. Too bad, the characters were developed so poorly that audience can't feel anything.For more review, please visit: http://voicemotion.wordpress.com",Captain America - The First Avenger
553,thulean33,Awful movie,1,24 October 2011,Every ridiculous cliché comes alive in this one. Utterly worthless film. Not even the acting is good. The Nazis are the big evil bad guys because they deal with mystical powers beyond the human and the shiny happy Americans are the saviours of mankind. I couldn't even finish this absolutely awful movie. Dreadfully void of any intellectual quality whatsoever. And not even the special effects are any good. I can look past the ridiculous propaganda if the action scenes and special effects are good. But not even that is good. It's just bad.I'm sure some gung-ho Americans will think it's cinematic mastery. Anyone else with intelligence will absolutely loathe this worthless movie. You literally have to be void of any intelligence whatsoever to find merit in this movie. And I gave it a chance. I really did. But 50 minutes in I couldn't take it anymore. I'm not sure how it's getting a 7 rating. That really compromises my faith in humanity when people in general think this movie is a 7.,Captain America - The First Avenger

Half an hour too long in my opinion, but it is just that.Let's jump into it shall we? Loved the cast, all very convincing with what they were doing, the CG for skinny Cpt was awesome, I found myself tilting my head like a dog not quite being able to work out if it was a really good replica or Chris Evans himself (the actor that is). Agent Smith Hugo Weaving sorry, was brill, always is, totally convincing as a sadistic genius although his superhuman strength was a little underused.Throw in Tommy Lee Jones (always a pleasure for the eyes and ears) and a few other familiar faces and you have yourself a sterling cast of top class actors.I think they did a good job of introducing the character to the audience, all, of course, in anticipation of Avengers Assemble (which I'm yet to see). It went on a little too long perhaps but it wasn't poor by any shadow of the imagination, I just wanted a little more. More shield spinning, more hard hits, more Red Skull and America skirmishes!

I wonder if they felt the same way about the Hulk.

556,BigNadz89,The boring origin story of the least interesting Avenger,3,14 July 2015,"Captain America: The Boring Avenger.People call Superman a boyscout goody two shoes, but this guy really takes the cake.Remember how much you loved history class? Now watch the World War II story told again but with a slight twist, and the real heroes of that era aren't the good men and women who in their own way fought for the world. Nah the hero really was a Supersoldier guy created by some scientist...but we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let's get to this ""interesting"" origin story of no ones favourite Avenger.After being rejected by the military (for being a skinny git, who the Nazis could blow away by simply farting in his general direction) Steve ""Language"" Rogers decides to take part in some random scientists experiment to create ""The Perfect Supersoldier!"" (original story, never seen it anywhere before) after some generic scenes where he proves his bravery (or suicidal tendencies) he is accepted into the program. In which, he is given superhuman speed and strength and other ""super powers"" including knowing how to do amazing things with a shield.He meets Peggy Carter (generic love interest) now don't get me wrong, she is an amazing character and she goes onto star in a Marvel One Shot, and even got her own TV show. The actress is amazing, so is the character, however the love story is the ""generic"" aspect of it all.You meet his generic boring best friend Bucky Barnes (okay he is the coolest person on the planet in Captain America 2, but that's not this movie. He was nothing in this movie) It could be argued that this movie sets up the second one, but I would want to punch that person in the face for even trying to justify that. This movie should stand on it's own but it doesn't. Anyway back to this borefest movies story.Captain America realises that the Nazis are controlled by *gasp* Hydra!! OMG SO BADASS! And Red Skull is the big bad guy, okay now I must admit he actually was a cool bad guy. Not the best but definitely better than the way overrated pretty boy villain/anti hero Loki.You will try to muster up some excitement for Tony Starks dad, but his brief scene hardly means anything but hey who am I to tell you what to get off to.The good guys fight the bad guys in the most forgettable and boring ways possible. Me and my friend (Sorry I mean my friend and I) both walked out of this movie bored crapless. There is one saving grace in this borefest of a movie, and that is the end scene where Cap wakes up in present time. That scene was incredible. The rest of this movie is tripe and unforgettable.My advice is watch the Bucky Barnes scenes on youtube for context when you watch the (undisputedly and ironically best Marvel film ever made to date) sequel. Watch the ending scene on youtube and spare yourself the rest of the movie. You could try arguing that you have to watch for Peggy but no you don't. The rest of her stuff she is in is independent so don't suffer through this atrocity just to understand her story. I'm sure there's gotta be some compilation of her scenes on youtube as well.Don't let this turd turn you off from Captain America movies though because its sequel will blow your mind. It will be everything you could possibly want from a superhero movie, this film is a massive disgrace compared to it.",Captain America - The First Avenger

558,dzejsonv,"Good, but silly",7,14 September 2019,"So I got to the first solo film about one of the main characters of Marvel Comics and all American pop culture - Stephen Rogers, also known as Captain America. I never really liked this character, but after seeing him in ""the Avengers"" in 2012, I decided to get acquainted with his films. And you know, this movie is really stupid, kind of like the first Spider-Man from Sam Raimi. Chris Evans doesn't annoy me as much as Tobey Maguire does... Okay, I got carried away, back to Cap.
Looks the film well. The atmosphere of war and America of that time is tolerably transferred. The effects also do not cause facepalm. The plot, as I said, is a bit silly, just like in the old comics.
The main character of the film, Steve Rogers-a typical hero, nothing more to say.
Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) at first seems like a typical female character, but gradually reveals new sides, and when you see her emotions, her experiences at the time of Steve's ""death"" in the ice, you believe it without question. And in the series she is generally fine. And besides, Hayley is such a woman that... Again I was carried away.
The main antagonist of the film, the Red Skull performed by Hugo ""Agent Elrond Smith"" Weaving terribly caricatured, though it looks good.
Watch can be, but his, as and many films MCU, not very want to revise.",Captain America - The First Avenger

560,dave_caveman,"He's a walking, talking American flag.",6,15 July 2012,"Historically, Captain America was designed to be a walking, talking American flag. He was first released during the second world war as part of the propaganda campaign and his popularity quickly faded away with the war's end. He soon disappeared from the comic book pages all together.Decades later it was decided to try and bring him back, and they made up a story of him being frozen in ice to explain his absence. The film captures his tale perfectly.Our hero is a skinny little guy called Steve Rogers. He spends his days getting into fights with people a lot bigger than him and then letting them beat him to a pulp and dreams of joining the army, so the Germans can give him a proper thrashing. Unfortunately for him, the army keeps turning him down, no matter how much he begs, as he's deemed physically unfit to serve.In summary, he's a bit of an idiot.To cheer him up, his friend sets him up on a blind date. However, while he's out with the girl he discovers he can't take his mind off getting another beating, and ditches her for another try at joining the army.an idiot with a weird fetish...Finally, after all his months of trying, he is accepted. By a German. Who plans to mutate him using a completely untested new drug. Needless to say he jumps at the chance.There's a big debate in the movie as to why Steve was chosen, with the German saying it's ""because a weak man knows the value of strength, the value of power.""Well, that's one theory and here are some more likely ones: 1. The German is being held against his will, and thus chooses the subject least likely to survive the process. 2. The plan is to have an army of super soldiers. Why waste your best men on the first experiment, which will almost surely go horribly wrong? 3. He won the prize for being the 1 millionth army applicant. Hurray!Regardless, they pump him full of steroids and Captain America is born. Unfortunately, the German is assassinated along with any hope of creating any more super soldiers.Still, one superhero is better than nothing, and they put him to good use, to do the thing he was originally created for.They wrap him in an American flag and make him dance around as part of the propaganda campaignand people think Batman is hardcore",Captain America - The First Avenger
561,actodea,Totally overrated,5,19 October 2011,"A Sci-Fi movie of World War II that doesn't bring anything new and even the clichés are not done well. The actors have done a decent job but everything else (including screenplay, directing, costumes) is worthless. I don't want to spoil it and tell you why the script doesn't make any sense, I'll just let you know that it doesn't. If you are expecting a villain with a complex, evil plan and a hero who fights back with an even better plan... then you will be disappointed. For a Super Hero / Sci-Fi movie, I expected some huge special effects. I saw none. I could not believe they even copied the bad guys nose job from Harry Potter. Who does that? Do not waste you money on this (unless you are an American and you want to see your flag all the time)!",Captain America - The First Avenger

If you turn the volume way up while watching this movie, you can actually hear the gears of the Hollywood movie machine turning this one out. I wasn't expecting much, but, c'mon. It's the same cliché one liners, cocky attitudes and corny acting with lots of explosions, high speeds and c.g.i.As far as some of the vitals: Chris Evans in the lead is a bit below the Mendoza line (or, more appropriately, the Christian Bale line). Hayley Atwell is fine as the lead female. Although half her job was to stand there and look good, which she did quite well. Tommy Lee Jones is....Tommy Lee Jones. And Hugo Weaving is emphasizing his ""s"" better than ever as the bad guy (He makes me think of a talking snake from some Disney movie, not that that's a bad thing).

563,hbenthow,"A great, old-fashioned adventure that towers above its flaws.",9,26 October 2011,"As there's something about the the 1930s-1940s that appeals to me, I tend to prefer movies set in the era and made in its cinematic style. And being fond of the adventure genre, I anticipate movies like the Indiana Jones trilogy, ""The Rocketeer"", ""Sky Captain And the World of Tomorrow"", ""The Mummy"" (1999) and, of course, ""Captain America"".When I first heard about this movie, my expectations soared. The director was Joe Johnston, who made my favorite superhero movie, ""The Rocketeer"". It was set during WWII, made in a 1940s style, and scored by Alan Silvestri. Alas, my heart sank after I found out that they were going to do the whole frozen alive storyline I've always hated. But, I reasoned, the only reason they are making it is because of ""The Avengers"". Without that storyline, they wouldn't even be making it. Beggars can't be choosers.Well, after two years of waiting, I got to see the movie. And to my surprise, it surpassed my high expectations. I didn't even hate the ending, although I would have much preferred a happier one more in line with the original 1940s comics (in which Cap stays in his own era, then fights commies in the 1950s). So, here are my thoughts on the movie.Acting.Chris Evans was great as Captain America. He nailed the character. After watching him as Captain America, I can't see anyone else in the role. The special effects performed on him to make him look skinny for the first part of the movie were absolutely seamless. If I hadn't known about them, I wouldn't have been able to tell they were there. But those effects would not have looked nearly so great if it had not been for Evans convincingly ""acting skinny"". No matter what condition Steve Rogers is in, shrimp or super soldier, Chris Evans portrayed him flawlessly.It was refreshing to see a non-angsty, pure-hearted hero for the first time in a while. Instead of portraying Cap with irony or satire, they took him seriously, and it really payed off. Cap, despite (or because of) his delightful simplicity and earnestness, comes across as incredibly deep and human, proving once again that the notion of the old-fashioned hero being inferior to his modern antihero counterpart is merely a haughty assumption.Hugo Weaving's Red Skull was effectively menacing, darkly humorous, and overall deliciously like an old-fashioned serial villain. Haley Atwell was charming, feisty and classically beautiful as Peggy Carter. Stanley Tucci's Dr. Erskine was played to perfection, Tommy Lee Jones was a scene-stealer of the highest order, Toby Jones was very memorable as a sympathetic, almost lovable Arnim Zola, Richard Armitage was effectively despicable, Dominic Cooper was good as Howard Stark, and Neal McDonough made his presence known despite very little screen time. Sebastion Stan was also quite good as Bucky, although he wasn't quite as memorable as many of the others.Visuals and Action.My feelings on the visuals are mixed. I was hoping for a bit more of a photo-realistic feel, but it instead looks a bit too much like ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" (a movie whose visuals I like very much, but would prefer to be a novelty, not the norm). That said, the use of wide lenses did help make it look more real than many other movies with such massive amounts of CGI. The color in many scenes is quite good, or at least by today's standards. I did dislike the muted color used in some of the winter scenes, though. I wish they had gone for more of a Technicolor look, but I'm pretty satisfied with the look of the movie, except for the winter scenes.I didn't like the action montage too much, as it had some slow-motion effects, as well as giving off a feeling that you're being cheated out of some scenes. I also thought that the motorcycle-chase felt somewhat rushed. Other than that, however, I did like most of the action scenes. The Kruger chase, Cap's first mission, and the final fight with Red Skull were standouts.I would have preferred that the HYDRA soldiers' uniforms look a bit more Nazi-like, but the look they have works well. Red Skull doesn't care about them as individuals. He is the Hydra, and they are merely his many identical heads. Thus, their faceless, almost robotic look works very well. Music.Silvestri's score is the best superhero score in years. His main theme unfortunately doesn't have the ""flow"" that some of his better works do, and seems a little clunky at first. But after you hear it a few times, it grows on you. It's now stuck in my head. Overall, Silvestri's score hits all the right notes, and captures menace, adventure, and every other mood required of it, while having actual themes. Media Ventures, eat your collective heart out.Writing.The humor was great throughout. The levels of ""heart"" were set to maximum. The romance, although sparse, was memorable. Everything was portrayed swiftly, without padding, The plot was very well thought out. Memorable lines and scenes abound. Overall, the writing was excellent. Some things that I particularly liked were Steve's journey from shrimp to super-soldier, the USO scene, Cap's first mission, the role-reversal with Bucky, and the romance. I also liked how Red Skull was his own boss. It gave him more menace. Plus, using HYDRA ironically makes it feel more historically accurate. Having Captain America defeat the Nazis would mess with history too much, and having him lose to them just wouldn't do. All I really disliked were Bucky's death and Captain America getting frozen alive. That could work well in some movies, but a 1940s-style adventure of this sort just cries out for a happy ending. Plus, the modern-day bookends detract from the overall atmosphere. Still, the final scenes were poignant, although out-of-place.9/10.",Captain America - The First Avenger
564,jamvetzal,My favourite of the Avengers movies (haven't seen Avengers yet though),9,3 May 2012,"First I have got to say the reason I am writing this is the gut wrenching feeling I got in my stomach of all the bad written reviews of this film by people who just quite frankly don't know comics, understand and from the sounds of it is just the wrong person for anything comic related. This is a comic book movie based on one the oldest marvel super-heroes, a character that was created during the war by one of the legends because she was an exceptionally patriotic man and figured the best way for him to help the effort was make comics about super-heroes and the war. So far most of the bad reviews I've read on this movie focus on a few things which make me face palm. As follows 1. Wtf is this Hydra?! Where are the Nazis?! And similar complaints about red skull being a bad character with no backstory given (even though sufficient backstory is given to his creation) and the movie explains that hydra is a nazi science division, this is not only straight frm comics but straight from the established origin, without hydra there isn't really a captain America 2. Technology too advanced, characters unbelievable in abilities. These people clearly missed the point that this is a marvel comic book movie where the evil villain's plot revolves around a very powerful Norse god energy source....why do you expect realism with that? And really all the weapons did was release that energy in controlled bursts, they didn't develop this new energy source, they found it in the first 10 minutes of the movie. And captain America is a super hero, a super human, that is the point of him, he has unbelievable strength and speed (for a human) if you don't like that, see another movie 3. It's just another America flag waving feel good movie, LAME! seriously I'm a Canadian, and captain America is in my top ten all time favourites, I love my country, my people and I'm not entirely fond of the American military or government, but I love the cap, mostly because he isn't about blind patriotism to the stars and stripes (anymore) and stands for the ideals of the flag, not the flag itself (despite being a walking flag, he more recently went completely against the American government during Marvel's Civil War because of ideals) back during the war this was very much more blatant patriot propaganda basically and very much he was the patriot and if the movie followed that same format I would agree with them , but the movie tries very hard to establish that what makes cap great is his heart, not the flag that's strapped to him and shows the whole captain America thing is literally marketing to sell him. The movie is called captain America, there's a lot of history to the character, respect what he was during the war (also the first comic book movie which was made during the war) Now that I'm done with why not to listen to most the other bad reviews.This movie was great, Im a big fan of movies and comics and know that the two won't visually mix well in modern times, so Im fine with slight changes to costumes and designs of characters for the purpose of fitting better in a real world and loved the new cap costume for the movie, it was practical and maintained the classic basic patterning of the suit. Hydra had the biggest change also but if the comic hydra appeared on screen, well it would be bad they are actively mocked for their look in comics, but they still kept key hydra elements in the costumes and I love that, they did an excellent design job. The story was pretty true to cap, probably a biggest change being the addition of stark (tony stark, his father and iron man didn't exist at all though, captain America came decades before him) and Bucky, who was little more than a gun crazed young teenager sidekick, something however Stan lee didn't like cap having, thinking a kid sidekick was reckless and irresponsible and simply unbelievable, so he was killed off in the comics, in the movie they made him older and kept most of the rest which is understandable and fine. And of course there is the great job they did connecting captain to the other movies and the avengers. Basically I'm just saying, this is a comic book movie revolving around a super soldier fighting a fictional force of evil with a fictional literal god power source, if you somehow find that stupid because it's not realistic (even though it never tries to pretend to be) look the other way and find a different movie. This movie is a great comic book movie and in my opinion one of the best comic book movies, a classic character, classic setting, at the very least captain deserves some respect for the history of the character.",Captain America - The First Avenger
565,vsg07,Perfect Summer movie,8,13 August 2011,"Captain America is directed by Joe Johnston and stars Chris Evans and Hugo Weaving. On the outside it looks like a fun summer movie with all the right dialog and action pieces with it. But when you watch it, you will realize it is about a boy who wont give up. And that's why this might be one of my favorite movies of this year. Chris Evans is cast perfectly as a 1940s young man who wants to serve his country. Stanley Tucci is a German scientist who wants to correct the mistakes of his past and Tommy Lee Jones is a colonel who along with Tucci is responsible for selecting one cadet who might become the strongest soldier of all. Hugo Weaving looks menacing as Johann Schmidt. When he says he wants it all, you almost believe him.Most importantly Joe Johnston and the writers know what makes Captain America so endearing and its commendable that they don't over do it.Before watching this movie, I was a bit worried about how Chris Evans would stand up to Robert Downey Jr and Samuel L Jackson in the Avengers. Now I think he might be able look at them in the eye and get away with it.",Captain America - The First Avenger
566,occupantroom6277,Another Marvel Atrocity,2,26 July 2011,"SPOILER: Gee, what a waste of money. I was unfortunate enough to catch a viewing of this, uh, film on its opening night. And I honestly had high expectations. But, not unlike Thor, it fell very VERY short. Here are a few of the problems I had with the movie. 1. No development. With EVERYTHING. No character development, no plot development, and no emotional development. 2. Mediocre acting. Enough said. 3. It was too over-the-top. And this is coming from a Batman Begins/Dark Knight fanatic. Red Skull was a seriously lousy villain. He was more laughable than frightening, especially his cheap looking face. 4. The plot itself. I was honestly looking forward to seeing Captain America fight the Nazis, not HYDRA. And the dumb Hydra salute made me gag. I also wasn't sure what was going on at times. The magical ""cube"" (Transformers knockoff?) wasn't settling with me. I expected this to be more about WWII itself, not some stupid mystical idea that was more sophomoric and typical than interesting and captivating. 5. The technology. This was the WWII era. And there were little reminders everywhere that said, ""Hey! It's the 40's!"" But then... Hydra's, uh, ""ray guns"" for lack of better terminology were somewhat thrown at us. I didn't like it. And the likely hood that a bunch of drunks with 40's weaponry could survive such combat. 6. The romance. Ugh. You can integrate a romantic subplot in a ""superhero"" movie and do it well, I've seen it done (Spider-man 2, The Dark Knight). But this was much too Thor-esque. I'm sorry, let me specify. You could see the chemistry between Steve and Peggy right away, but it just kind of sat there until, all of a sudden, love! And, of course, with romance comes automatic romantic tension. Blonde kisses Steve. Peggy gets mad/jealous. Wow. Didn't see that coming. 7. The ""theme"". Red Skull believing he's so god-like. I liked the idea. And I figured it would destroy him in the end. Hubris often does. It simply wasn't explored enough, and it really didn't end him. I was left wondering whether it was a good idea to introduce it in the first place. 8. And so we've arrived at Red Skull's death. This was TERRIBLE writing, an asinine story component. You know, when you watch a movie like this, and come to accept that it's mostly just raw superhero element, you want the HERO to kill the BAD GUY. That's a formula we've seen from box office hits to Scooby-Doo. But no, this film neglected even THAT. All Red Skull did was look at and hold the cube, and he burned. What a let down. 9. Captain America's sacrifice. Ah, sacrifice worked so well in The Dark Knight! And it almost worked here. Corny scripting ruined the moment. After Red Skull's demise, Captain America had to get the militarized aircraft far away from the USA, so its weapons wouldn't kill people. So what do you do? Nose dive into the ice caps. Naturally. Well, I guess it was ""his choice"". 10. The ending. Well, it was necessary. And it was okay. I could live with it. UNTIL Steve chose to utter, ""I'll be okay. But I had a date."" or something to that effect. More corny scripting. 11. Hey, all faults aside, at least we had some good old action to keep the grin on our faces. Nope. The action was thrown wayside. The taking down of every Hydra facility was just clips of Captain America shooting a gun or jumping his motorcycle. That, along with generic and easily forgettable scoring. Only a few funny moments and the fantastic CG ""scrawny Steve"" got this to three stars. Please, stop comparing this unexceptional film to things like Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Dark Knight or any of the greats. This film was average at best. Marvel Studios is not preparing well for The Avengers. Based on this and Thor, I certainly am not stoked for its debut. Thanks for reading!",Captain America - The First Avenger
567,mrvnstwrt,Cap complete the Marvel film Puzzle..,7,19 September 2011,"Finally.. the final piece of ""Marvel Puzzle"" completed by the released of Captain America. after Thor and Iron Man 2 kick everybody a**es in their film, now it's Steve Rogers turn to kick some butt. not much i can say about this movie rather than: just an ay okay. it's a good superhero movie from Marvel like usual but it's a little bit disappointing why..? here's the reason:1. okay i know like any other superhero movie, the first main plot is the birth of the superhero itself. how and why he could became the superhero right...? with the right and an interesting presentation, the ""path pf superhero"" could be cool to watch for hours and hours. (just see Thor, Spiderman and Iron Man interesting right..?) in this movie well it's just (again) so-so kind a like watching Hulk again when David Barner became to it. 2. this is the main failure (i think) the primary villain in this movie, Red Skull it's not such a terrifying character like his name. i mean c'mon good superhro would be great when there is good villain right.. just see Iron Man and Whiplash, Spiderman and Green Goblin, etc. the bad guy must be a terrifying, hated yet a threatening character so could make the superhero looks good and lovable to the audiences (especially kids. but in this movie it's kind a like we see a failed Lex Luthor. but i give props to Hugo Weaving for his perfect German accent.. 3. and this is also the main failure (but for the Marvel Comics fan though), The title of the film : Captain America: The First Avenger. but in the reality (of comics story) he is NOT the first Avenger.. Steve Rogers recruited to The Avengers 6 Months after it established.. Thor, Iron Man and Hulk was the first 3 original Avengers.. well for the Movie-Holic who never see the comics maybe it's OK because they don't know about it.. but for the peoples (especially Marvel Comics Fan)whoever read or know the original history of The Avengers, may see this a a such disturbing thing.But regardless those 3 negative point that i wrote, there were also a few standout pint in this movie such as:1. The realistic 40's-50's environment (noire style) 2. Tommy Lee Jones proves that the 65 years movie veteran could still kick some butt.. 3. Hayley Atwell made Peg Carter character looks very strong, a little bit mean yet still charming and lovable.and for the Captain itself, Chris Evans, (for me) it just yeah okay.. he's not bad but a little bit flat.. i still think he should stick as a supporting actor rather than the lead actor..

But after seeing it a few more times, I have come to absolutely adore this movie. Captain America: TFA doesn't try to be as action packed as Iron Man. It's just.. different. It's one man who sincerely and wholeheartedly wants to fight for his country and serve his nation. He will stop at nothing to get into the army to do so. Chris Evans does an excellent job at playing Cpt. Steve Rogers and the rest of the cast does their part extremely well too. Not everything is perfect though, they really could of done a better job at the whole ""mini"" Steve Rogers... he just looks silly.

571,cobyscomics,Captain America: The First Avenger,5,13 February 2014,"(see original at http://cobyscomics.blogspot.com/2014/02/captain- America-first-avenger.html)Captain America. My least favorite movie in all the MCU (yep, liked it even less than Iron Man 2). I don't know what it is about the movie that I found so unimpressive. It was a sleek movie with some big action spots. If I was an old-time movie buff, I probably would've loved The First Avenger. Maybe that's it: maybe it was a little bit too authentic. Maybe it felt too much like the grainy WWII flicks that my grandparents used to watch. This guy hit on it a little bit in his review, ""Whatever happens, wherever it happens, its like watching a simulacrum of reality instead of a fully-realized world."" Which, yeah, that's not bad, but, it's just kinda... dull and boring, I think.Regardless, the movie had some great big action sequences and told a story that definitely needed telling (the Super Soldier serum is referenced in nearly every other aspect of the MCU as the Holy Grail of scientific achievement), so I can't be too nitpicky.Skinny SteveI will be nitpicky about the grotesque body-modification, though. I mean this in more than one way. First, while I appreciate all the work the CG effects people put into going through frame by frame and either resizing Chris Evans or swapping out his body with his skinny body-double, he still looks creepy and weird. I don't know how they could've done this any better (in one of the behind the scenes interviews, they mentioned they didn't have time for Evans to go through the whole ""Tom Hanks in Cast Away"" thing); all I know is, I had trouble seeing this as anything more than a floating head attached to a skinny neck.Second, what kind of a message is this sending to any teenage boys out there self-conscious about their own body? So Steve Rogers has a big heart, is always honest, and is the quintessential America patriot, but he only gets accepted into the Army to be a guinea pig and he's not truly accepted for his values until after he adds on a hundred pounds of muscle? I know this story is nearly a century old, but still, what kinda message is that to be sending to the kids?The Howling CommandosDid you know that's who these guys are supposed to be? They didn't call themselves that the whole time, and not a one of them was ever named, as far as I could tell. Maybe they only made them so recognizable as a nod to the comicbook fans and figured the mainstream audiences wouldn't know or care who they were, but still.... I think maybe the first quarter of the movie (with Skinny Steve) should've been shortened by about half, and they should put some time into telling the story of the Howling Commandos--they should've gotten more a story than a quick montage that focused on Captain America, is what I'm saying. But, hey, at least they left the black guy in and didn't ""accidentally"" re-color him....I did like what they did with Bucky Barnes, however. The way he went from being Steve's protector to Steve's sidekick was pretty cool. The first time I saw The First Avenger, I somehow completely missed the part when he fell from the train and ""died"".I mean, I saw it, I just didn't get the significance of it. Cuz, you know, he's gonna come back as The Winter Soldier, and it's gonna be AWESOME.""I Don't Want to Kill Anyone"" Remember that part? The part where Steve says he doesn't want to kill anyone? Yeah, forget about that. I mean, I won't question the morality of Captain America killing tons of Hydra Henchmen, as I did with Thor and the Frost Giants, because we all know, if anyone deserves to get killed by Captain America, it's Nazis. But, still, he says he doesn't want to kill anyone, but then he kills a lot of people. He even takes a gun into battle. That's part of the whole heroic thing about Captain America, is that he has a shield, not a gun. He goes to war carrying a weapon of defense (which he still uses to crush people's faces in, but, you know, regardless...).So, what's the message to the kids here? If you get picked on and beat up a lot, take some artificial substance to enhance your body, then go and murder all the bad guys in their face. For America!Red SkullFirst of all: yuck. Ripping Hugo Weaving's face off to reveal the Red Skull wins for grossest part of this movie (besides maybe when that Hydra pilot got chopped up by the propeller in a Raiders of the Lost Ark nod).Secondly, I don't understand the Red Skull's motivation. So he wants to blow up the world, but why? Is he just a nihilist who wants to worship chaos, or is there some master plan there where he hopes to rule over the ashes? I guess this villain-for-having-a-villain's-sake is a motif carried over from the original Captain America stories (in one of the featurettes, co-creator Joe Simon even mentions that the motivation for the Red Skull was a literal cherry on top of a fudge sundae, and he created him simply to be someone for Cap' to beat up, fully expecting to only do one issue with him in it). And I guess there maybe there is no motivation for the Red Skull, he's just an evil maniac. Luckily, Captain America murders him stands by while he dies the Tesseract beams the Red Skull up to Asgard.RatingI give the movie 5/10 stars. A little harsh, I know, but these WWII movies aren't really my thing, and the story felt more like something that I needed to see rather than something I wanted to know about.",Captain America - The First Avenger
572,elybuttons,Get'em Cap!,7,20 August 2019,I saw this in theaters and remember being disappointed after all the hype surrounding the release. However after watching Endgame and all the marvel movies in chronological order it made more sense the second time around and as a result I can now rate this title accordingly. It could've used a tad more action scenes but overall it was well acted good cgi and a great intro into the marvel universe we have all come to love. Looking forward to the next Captain America.,Captain America - The First Avenger
573,accounts_only,Good but not wow!,6,4 May 2015,"After seeing the Avengers I decided to delve into the stories of the characters separately and i'm really glad i did. Even though Captain America: The First Avenger was a bit slow i do think it is a good set up since it is the first instalment. You get to know Steve Rogers and you learn how he became Captain America and you even get some action as well but it didn't give me the WOW factor i was hoping for.That said the film is still well acted and it made me curious about Captain America, just not as big of a WOW factor i thought it was going to be after seeing Iron Man. Definitely still worth a watch!",Captain America - The First Avenger
574,owlman-4,Better than most of this genre,7,30 May 2012,"I was really pleasantly surprised at how much I did like this movie. I've read a lot of the criticisms and most of them point out elements of comic character movies that I usually find in this genre. This movie was actually a bit of a stand out for me. The main character's development was much more in depth than I usually find and the story line was decent right up to the concluding scenes of the movie, which I found ludicrous. What were they thinking? I don't care if they had to find a way of linking to the Avenger's movie, they could have come up with any number of other story lines to get it there without the lame ending. I would have rated this move and ""8"" if it hadn't been for that ending.",Captain America - The First Avenger

And i am not talking boring in the sense that the boring scenes where filled in with re-filling the coffee mug, or going to the kitchen to pick up a snack, no.. I fast forwarded... And i never ever fast forward movies..Just before watching this movie, i watched Green Lantern, and Thor. Thor is great, Green Lantern is just fine as well, but this really sucks. You get the worse acting ever, the plot (if there even is any plot) revolves around the bad-guy a former SS Nazi Officer that has been trying to inject himself with some bozo-snot and gets a red skull and some superpowers.

This, however, couldn't even hold itself together. The actors themselves were about as average as any other superhero flick acting. The action, though showy as it was, was clichéd to death. The plot is predictable, even though there were MAJOR plot holes like *SPOILER START* when C.A. crashed one of the supposed nuclear missiles into Red Skull's ship, the middle didn't explode at all. Was it a dud? *SPOILER END* The editing was off when *SPOILER START* C.A. swings on a chain and he starts shooting at the bad guys when all of the sudden the shot cuts to him running down a hall. *SPOILER END* In short, this film had a lot of potential but with choppy editing and more holes than Swiss cheese, it's safe to say just to avoid it at all costs. I'm dreading as to how The Avengers will be.",Captain America - The First Avenger
577,msalmank,An enjoyable movie,7,4 August 2011,"I would probably have rated this 6 rather than 7 but it honestly wasn't that bad either. I loved the movie a lot, but i guess expectations were really high and thus i was left a little bit disappointed.Chris Evans was a surprise as the lead. I was afraid when he was cast as Captain America - Fantastic 4 anyone? But he did justice to the role. However the movie and the overall story left a little bit too much to be desired.It seems like that the movie's unspoken purpose is to be just an installment for The Avengers and honestly after seeing this, i'm kind of starting to worry if Avengers will hold up to the hype or not!Red Skull is perhaps one of the worst villains portrayed, but then again, it kind of brings one to reality - fools with powerful toys at their disposal! The movie also got a tad bit too long and kind of looses interest!One thing that really bugged me - and i know it isn't that big of a deal - but in the end when Captain America wakes up and hears the game on the radio and busts out - So they knew all about Caption America to set up that facade but didn't know such an important tid-bit about exactly when he actually vanished?Nonetheless, it had its ups and downs and overall i enjoyed it for what it was. Just don't expect ""too much"" from it and you'll be fine!",Captain America - The First Avenger

Well, any film should start with 2D, obviously. Showing it on Sky 3d should give it an extra D. Well, if the 3D gave it an extra D then it has 1d as the score. This is a 0D film, made better by the fact that the one dimensional characters can gain an extra dimension through technology. To be honest, the plot has the same advantage. The plot is significantly improved by the presence of the third dimension. It is weak, hard to follow and well, weak.PS. Some of the d's in the review are lowercase when they should be uppercase.

579,movieman016,So this is Captain America...,7,22 July 2011,"I saw a midnight screening of this movie and i walked in with high hopes. I like Chris Evans and so far the other Marvel movies that have been released to lead up to the Avengers movie, have been pretty well done.No movie is perfect, but this movie had so much hype, that it had to be...but i (as much as many others) kinda got disappointed. *SPOILERSSSSSS* The scenes in the movie kinda looked like they were put together a little sloppy. One scene didn't add up to the other, but you got the hint on what was going on. Also the ending was rather weak. The last line in the movie ""I had a date"", then credits roll...that's not a way to end a superhero movie let alone Captain America.Good things, well the acting was great. The jokes were always spot on and the action was pretty well laid out.Captain America was all around a good movie, i was just sitting at the end of the movie a little disappointed and confused. 7/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
580,seka-gaula,It's either worse or equal to Iron Man 2 disaster,3,2 February 2012,"This is my second review of Captain America that I'm submitting at IMDb.I just felt I had more perspectives to get off my chest, pertaining how utterly disappointed I am of this movie, which I will enumerate below; 1. Somewhere in this movie, Colonel Chester Phillips (Tommy Lee Jones) makes a mention of Captain America's genetic code being different to the serum that was injected to him. My problem with this statement is that the genetic codes are much more aligned with the DNA technology & there was no such medical technology in 1941, the era in which the Captain America events took place.2. Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) is the commander of the military army, alongside Colonel Chester Phillips & I bet my whole world that in 1941, there were no women in positions of seniority as males were very chauvinistic. In the military,females were only recruited to work as nurses in military hospitals. So I'd have at least been impressed if Peggy was a nurse who went out of her way to aid Steve Rogers/Captain America.There is also a scene where Peggy is rendering instructions to the army & ends up punching one soldier to the balls. Phillips comes in & orders her to step aside so he could give his own instructions to the army. That left me clueless as to who had more authority than the other.3. Why does Captain America's shield keep coming back to him after he throws it away to fend off adversaries? And why does Johan Schmidt have a red skull? As is customary with part 1 of a comic movie, why was there no significant amount of time spent on chronicling the background of the superhero & the villain? 4. Captain America is well renowned for having assisted America defeat the Germany's Nazi group during the World War. This I greatly anticipated to see, perhaps towards the end. But to my disappointment, it was nowhere close to be seen.Marvel please, can you re-boot this movie prior to proceeding with the sequel? And please bring a good director next time because someone really needs to undo the damage caused by Joe Johnston.Joe Johnston, I despise you for having denigrated the classic legend of a superhero I idolized so much as a child.Seka Samuel Gaula Cape Town, South Africa",Captain America - The First Avenger
581,wyatt402,Amazing Film!!!!!,9,16 August 2011,"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!I saw this a few weeks ago in 3D and I thought it was amazing! Finally seeing the film that is was looking forward to for ages was really exciting! I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole of the film, it has all the elements to be the best film of this year and there are some really good contenders this year! There is a lot of action, suspense and you still have the hint of love in the story line. You have to feel sorry for Captain America when he crashes in Antarctica and gets frozen, then again when he wakes up in the 21st century without his lover. Overall this is one of the best films of year and, fingers crossed, could become the best film of this year!!!!! Also, if you are going to see this film anytime soon, make sure you stay until the very end of the credits as there is a trailer for The Avengers film coming out next year!!!!!",Captain America - The First Avenger
582,dakwamyth,Back together,8,26 October 2011,"OK, after the crap-fest of Thor, this was a very good reprise! The Marvel team got their heads out of their tail-ends, and back to making a movie again.Captain America was well done, kept you watching for what was going to happen next, even if you figured out what was coming, it usually came in pairs, and at least one caught you off guard. Even with the few flaws, the story was solid enough to cover them. A real delight to see one of these comic movies brought back to life, without someone walking around with the ""actor's"" scripts to be read from. And they actually sprung for a competent crew this time.I am hoping that Ironman and Captain America will be the same actors, but that they change out Thor.",Captain America - The First Avenger

584,cthulu17,Best avengers movie yet!,10,6 May 2012,"So where to begin? At first I was a little apprehensive when I found out that they had cast Chris Evans for the role of Cap, since I've never seen him in anything all that serious and lets face it, Captain America is a pretty big deal. But I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by how things turned out.In my opinion this may be the best Avengers movie yet. Blasphemy! I know! Thor didn't offer too much competition, but that really wasn't its fault since Thor has never had the most interesting plots anyway, unless you've got a real thing for Norse mythology or something. Please allow me to clarify though: Thor was not bad in any way really, it just wasn't great either and it just ended up somewhere in what I consider to be a respectable sort of middle area, being better than mediocre, but not as good as great. Anyhow, the Iron Man movies were good, but they didn't have one advantage Captain America uses to the fullest: a little thing called world war 2.The other Avengers movies so far have had to struggle in some respects because they had to generate their in-film realities from scratch to a certain extent. In the case of Captain America, the cinematic reality has already been created many many times, I mean seriously, how many WWII movies do we have? And some of them were actually pretty good too. To it's favor, Captain America essentially has a very well made pre-rendered reality and atmosphere that's been built up from all the other WWII movies that have already been made. There is a wealth of cinematic information about how to make this type of period piece and it shows in the atmosphere of the film which feels both familiar and believable. There is one exception to this: I'm sure WWII history buffs that see this film will scoff at all the inaccuracies in this and every other WWII movie. But in my opinion, the reality of Captain America is very thorough and has plenty of depth.One of the things I liked most about the movie was the casting. Not just the leads, and Chris Evans did pretty well, but maybe that's just because I was scared that he would perform terribly, but the supporting cast was one of the best I've seen in a while and in a superhero movie to boot! The character of Howard Stark is interesting and really helps to build the contiguous reality of the Avengers and I'm really happy for that, since continuity is going to be a big deal for the avengers going forwards. I must say Dominic Cooper was a solid choice for the role, but for some weird reason he reminds me of Leonardo DiCaprio. Hugo Weaving is a terrific choice as the red skull (I am not spoiling anything, if you didn't know, you're just willfully ignorant at this point) as he has proved himself to be an excellent villain before in some other film I just can't seem to recall...........So anyhow, the basic breakdown is this: good atmosphere, believable acting, solid action, and actually pretty good plot. Initially I wasn't sure how they were going to tie it all in with the other Avengers threads, but now it all meshes rather nicely.Important notes: The 3D is pretty good, so it's worth the extra $3 or so in my opinion and you DEFINITELY want to stay after the credits and I mean ALL the way after the credits. It seems like they might have done the same thing that they did with the Hulk where they put the teaser right at the end, but they have a little something extra after the credits and it is AMAZING! Won't say another word about it.So go see it, it's great and check it out in 3D, they did a lot better than they did in Thor in my opinion and being in 3D was supposed to be a big part of the ad campaign for Thor, go figure.",Captain America - The First Avenger
585,allanh91,www.thefilmbuffs.tumblr.com - SPOILERS,6,30 September 2013,"""I don't want to kill anyone. I don't like bullies; I don't care where they're from"" – Steve RogersCaptain America: The First Avenger was the last big summer blockbuster from Marvel before Avengers Assemble (in fact, the typical post-credit Easter egg is a teaser trailer for the Avengers' then upcoming film). Captain America is arguably the most important figure in the Avengers, and giving him a strong footing in the run up was essential to getting the final product right. This was some task for Joe Johnston, whose biggest accomplishments to date were Jumanji and Jurassic Park III (which, let's face it, was a let down). Adding to the pressure of creating the perfect leader in Captain America, my guesses are that Johnston would have been reminded by Marvel of how big a media monster Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man had become, and that Cap' would have to match, or better this monster. In short, he didn't. But Johnston did create an acceptable film, with compelling imagery and a unique tone. It just didn't reach any highs, and descended into normality after a strong start.Steve Rogers is a would-be superhero whose background I can relate to. A young man with confidence in his morals and ethical code, but without any kind of physical stature, often bullied for his meek disposition. He wants nothing other than to stand up against the oppressive Nazi regime and fight for his country, and would give anything to be on the front line. When given the opportunity by an experimental scientist Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) to become the next step in engineered warfare, Rogers immediately accepts. Emerging intelligence discovers that the real enemy to the allied forces (and the entire planet) is Johann Schmidt (Weaving), an experiment gone wrong who has found the Tesseract: an object that can be used as a sustainable energy resource, or a catastrophic weapon. Rogers proves himself to be the only man who can stand against Schmidt, and save planet Earth from his grasp.The first hour of Captain America shapes up to be a very strong piece of cinema. Rogers' story is sympathetically presented, complimented by a sincere, resolute Evans who has come a long way from his performance as the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four films. Evans is supported well by Stanley Tucci and Tommy Lee Jones, and Hayley Atwell's Peggy Sue stamps down a marker as a strong female character, independent and liberated in her position. Unfortunately, cliché takes over in the second hour, and Peggy Sue falls for the hunky Captain America. I felt the strength of her character depleted the more Cap' achieved, his manliness forcing her into romantic submission. Things also became a bit boring, at several points I found my attention drifting elsewhere, but never really missed anything in the way of plot points or of my understanding of what was going on.The brilliant imagery of the World War II setting also faded as the film progressed; Schmidt's futuristic factories and technology looked out of place and too pristine for the time. Alas, had he harnessed the power of the Tesseract with the weaponry of the age, it might not have appeared silly.Schmidt himself was acceptably portrayed by the seasoned Hugo Weaving. His character's story and representation falls far short of other villains of the time (Ledger's Joker, Hiddlestone's Loki and both of Iron Man's antagonists) however, and he never really gets any reaction from you. The ""Heil Hydra"" nonsense was just laughable, and was one of a couple of cringe-worthy things within the film (the other being the embarrassment of Roger's and Carter's flirtation).As mentioned, the imagery of Captain America and the visual effects were both strong points. A murky grey-brown colour palette created scenes reminiscent of the first colour war movies, breaking only for Cap's blue uniform, and for the red in Red Skull's make up and Agent Carter's dress. The camera work is great, especially for the slow-motion action segments, which were really cool to watch, and were unique within Marvel: Phase One. The score complimented the feel of old war films, however nothing was very inspiring, or very original for that matter. Silvestri definitely improved between Captain America and Avengers Assemble.Captain America never really got the film he needed to spearhead him towards his role in the Avengers. Despite some decent performances and a unique presentation, Captain America: The First Avenger suffers from some ""cringey"" scenes that are out of placed in a more serious film, the lack of a commanding villain, and also from at times feeling like an old war film, with the exception of lasers and a costumed hero. Most disappointing however, was the sliding of what was a very promising start into predictability and mediocrity.Captain America: The First Avenger (2011)Allan's Score: 5.5/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
586,jeldridge-28771,A Child's Dream on the Screen,10,31 July 2015,"I will definitely say that this is another film that I feel distinct honor and pleasure in reviewing. I've been a Marvel fan since I was a kid. Sure, I had my Batman bout (with a little RoboCop and Power Rangers thrown into the mix); but, for the most part, I've always been a Captain America fan.After the poor reception (which was grossly undeserved) for Albert Pyun's vision of Captain American (1991), along with the independently produced adaption of ""The Punisher"" (1989) starring Dolph Lundgren, the Marvel superhero film just didn't catch wind in their sails. It was not until Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" (2002) that Marvel finally had a hit. Of course, what could Marvel Studios follow up with other than one of the most iconic superheros in the history of comic books?(Note: I'm not taking anything away from ""Daredevil."" But, the lack of vision from the production company, along with its PG-13 rating, killed any chance of that film being a success. As great of a film that it was, I don't believe that it was Ben Affleck that killed Daredevil. But, that's another review...)This was a long time coming for a fan like me. I was deployed overseas when I heard that the film was coming out and I was excited, but also apprehensive. I was honestly afraid that it would be botched or not live up to what I felt and saw as a child reading Captain America comics.Boy, was I wrong...Chris Evans did a masterful job as Steve Rogers / Captain America, and the introduction of Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from ""The Matrix"" trilogy) was the icing on the cake with his great acting ability as Red Skull. Set during World War II, a frail Steve Rogers has attempted to join the Army to fight for his country and for what was right. After being rejected by every recruiting station, he was finally recruited into a training program to select America's Super- Soldier. Tommy Lee Jones (""Men in Black"") is LTC Chester Phillips, the battalion commander of the super-soldier unit; and he attempts everything in his disposal to weed out Rogers. It's his heart and determination that gets him to the final stage of the training: transformation into the super- soldier.To me, the film is masterfully done. The acting was right, the special effects were superb, and it was released in the best time. In a post-9/11 world, America NEEDED Captain America. As a veteran myself, I identify with Captain America: a man who attempts to do the right thing, no matter the cost; a man who stands up for his country against any adversary, even those right next to him; and a man who keeps his moral integrity, even when the odds are against him. That seems like a recruiting poster in itself, but that's the creed that military personnel live by and thus, what Captain America lives by.As a fan and as a veteran, I can't think of any better representation of what America should stand for than Captain America. Some of what he believes is lost in this new century. The advent of technology and weaponry that was vastly different than what he knew of during WWII is awe-filling and frightening at the same time. However, no matter the cost, he fights on against those who threaten the country he loves so dearly.As a comic fan and a veteran, if you love fun and love to see a patriotic film that has the great mix of action and superheros, please watch Captain America. This was the film that made me remember why I enlisted and why I love this great country. In addition, it made me finally proud to be a comic book fan.",Captain America - The First Avenger

588,yernelg,Something's not right,7,23 August 2011,"i approached the film really wanting it to trash the 1990 garbage for good. and i left it almost not knowing what to say.i like the story for the most part. but not the plot and, although i enjoy a few cheese sometimes, the script was just pelted with too much cliché'. i am someone who takes the dictum ""suspension of disbelief"" to heart but when an element subtracts to the integrity of a film instead of solidifying the piece, then something must be wrong.i never liked the decision to put Chris Evans on the role, not because i doubt his ability to give justice to the role, but because he's already an icon to another marvel franchise as Human Torch in the Fantastic Four. If the Marvel Studio's vision of recreating the marvel universe in the big screen ever gets realized, then i think it would be a bit of a problem. but then that's just me.and evans did the role justice, if only he had better direction and script to work on.i enjoyed parts of the cheesiness of the script actually, but then when put in the context of making the film credible enough to open its own franchise and make it part of the prelaunching series for the Avengers film, it just is ridiculously unhelpful. by opting for a script that gratifies guts more than imagination, marvel risks the viewability of its next set of films, even the whole marvel film universe idea itself.let's just hope that the better half of The First Avenger will redeem itself in the box office in the long run. otherwise, joe johnstone and his team should be banned from marvel forever.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Once later he finally is accepted into a program thats what turns him into a supersoldier called Captain America. There's nothing I dislike about this movie, it would be one I could watch over and over again and would recommend to my friends to watch.

591,snowflakeinyourpalm,Unbelievable...,3,15 April 2012,"... meaning that nothing in the film is believable; not the chemistry between Captain America (Evans) and Peggy Carter (Atwell), not the characters, especially not the antagonist, not even the fight scenes.Let me elaborate:I like action films, I love the over-the-top fight scenes and the ""I can save the planet"" idea. I find them entertaining and fun. But this one made me fall asleep twice. Literally. I kept waiting for something to happen, a climax of some sort, but no. The biggest thing in the film is the transformation from Steve Rogers to Captain America. Red Skull is pointless. They could have had this film without the antagonist. He just finds the Tesseract, orders Zola around and then pulls off his mask. He never even says anything like ""I want to conquer the world"" or whatever. And the way he dies is... I had hoped they would make the Captain the hero, not Red Skull the victim of his gluttony. He's not a genius, no big tactician, no nothing. Just something to fill an empty space. Too bad...agent Carter and Steve Rogers are supposed to bring a sort of chemistry on screen, chemistry that I failed to notice. It's just staring back and forth, a bit of googly eyes and one kiss. I get that in the 40s people weren't as frivolous as they are now, but still...The fighting... well, it could have been WAY better, but it's just very fast, very dark (as in the light is dim) and it basically goes like this ""Pow, throws the shield, hits 2 on the head, the shield comes back, he wins the fight.""And the ending made me feel I had watched a really long teaser trailer for the upcoming ""The Avengers"" (which I can't wait for).

594,Squaremaster316,A Charles Atlas comic given a 2 hour running time,1,21 March 2013,"Ralph Waldo Emerson once stated that life was a journey, not a destination.One could only wish that Jumanji director Joe Johnston would have taken that timeless quote to heart when directing the final instalment of the Avengers' prequels.Instead, he opts to give us a film that was about as winding of a journey as a trip to the mailbox.Steve Rogers' journey from frail young man to, well, strong young man, presents us with the tale of one of the most one-dimensional, uninteresting protagonists in recent memory, as any amount of internal conflict or struggle is tossed to the wayside from virtually the opening frame. The only thing in the film that has any substantial development is the titular character's muscular frame.Along with Evans of lacklustre supporting cast, including Hayley Atwell, who's monotone Carter provides a one-dimensional and particularly shallow love interest (any interest whatsoever in Rogers literally occurs after his CGI rendered frame is replaced with his natural torso), and a ultimately pointless villain in Red Skull (considering Hitler's role in the war at the time) a quickly forgotten about Richard Artimage, and a slumming, emotionless Tommy Lee Jones, all form a rather toothless cast.The plot is filled with poorly executed clichés (the kissing scene with the blonde, in particular, feels so forced that you could practically see Atwell standing behind the scenery waiting for her 'cue'), tepid dialogue, plot holes and boundless leaps of logic (discovering the underground base by going in through an above ground window, wearing a brightly coloured suit when infiltrating a base to rescue soldiers, and the ending, which I'll get to), and rushed pacing.What makes this film seem more of an contrived Avengers prequel than its associated films is the ending, which features Rogers commandeering a plane with a nuke.After taking manual control, instead of jumping out of the plane after diverting it at the last minute to save himself and let the plane crash on its own, or diverting it to a warmer, isolated climate where it would do no harm, he instead chooses to go down with the plane.There is no logical reason for Rogers to do this except for the fact that he wouldn't be part of the Avengers film if he didn't (also to give some forced pathos between himself and Atwell's character).Overall, Captain America: The First Avenger is a paint-by-numbers origin that seems more of a bullet point presentation than a fully developed final product When it comes to the several years of audience buildup and putting the pieces into place for the upcoming Marvel crossover, it's little wonder why The 'First' Avenger, was given the 'Last' slot.",Captain America - The First Avenger
595,BadYossa,Not what I was expecting...,8,1 May 2012,"I have to say, I'm not a big fan of these sorts of movies, but came away quite impressed by the overall quality of this film. Whilst the special effects are excellent, they do not overwhelm, which allows the story to unfold at a good pace and keep you excited. The cast and crew have done an excellent job of creating a seriously good movie that entertains throughout. Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones are both excellent in their respective roles, without having to ham things up. The story line is very well crafted, for its genre, and certainly not as cheesy as I was expecting it to be. Whilst there are some scenes that may frighten younger viewers, this is a proper family blockbuster, very much in the same vein as the first Indiana Jones movie. Good guys, bad guys, lots of action, good story line and top notch special effects that don't distract from the narrative.A great movie that thorough deserves the plaudits it has received. Guess I'll have to change the view habits of 45 years and watch the next crop of related movies. Can't wait!",Captain America - The First Avenger
596,link1907-360-813540,Great start but then..... its a mess!,5,3 May 2012,"I've watched this movie all alone in my room one of those night I had nothing else to do. Wasn't expecting much anyway as I was aware this movie would be an action one without too much scenario. But against all odd, I found the movie quite interesting, for the beginning at least. The characters are interesting and everything is fine. The thing is, once Steve/captain got his super power, the movie pace change and everything start being not that good. Like the director had a good idea in mind but not enough time to put everything on screen.From that point, it's just mission after mission where you only see about 10-15 second of each. And its like that until the very end where Captain America finally face Redskull in a final battle. To me the movie seems rushed and it could have been so much better. Thats why I give it a 5 out of 10. Its watchable as long as you like super hero movie. Definitely not a great movie but watchable. The ending was too predictable in my opinion.TL;DR: Good start, terrible after that, and predictable ending.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Marvel Cinematic Universe #5
Director: Joe JohnstonThe MCU franchise got off to a rocky start in Phase One. Of the first five movies prior too The Avengers Assemble (as it is known in the UK), only Iron Man (2008) seems to have found universal praise as a truly great movie. The following three movies vary in quality, and whilst I personally rate Iron Man 2 higher than most fans, The Incredible Hulk gets little hate (mostly because it seems to have been forgotten, and in my opinion it's not hard to justify why), and Thor appears to have found itself regarded as one of the more middle of the pack entries (not to me though).This now brings me to Captain America: The First Avenger, and the fifth entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Of all the origin stories presented in Phase One, this is my personal favourite. I understand that for some it's a little slow, as I've done some online research to discern how it is viewed by other fans. I was quite disappointed to note that, whilst Winter Soldier and Civil War received universal acclaim, the film that introduced us to the wonder that is Captain America appears to have found itself a little underrated (by MCU standards at the very least).First of all, I want to praise Joe Johnston for bringing a real sense of old fashioned charm to this film. It has the feel of an old school adventure movie, the sort that helped make Steven Spielberg the legend that he is now. With a bit of tweaking here and there, Captain America could be taken out of the MCU and inserted into the world of Indiana Jones. We have, to start, the beautifully realised period setting of 1940's America. What we have is not so much a realistic portrayal rather than a heavily romanticized and heavenly old school Hollwood representation of a Great and Powerful WW2 era United States, one where everyone walks around in their finest clothes, cars are always clean, and people feel positive because ""HEY! we are almost living in the future!""This is very much a comic book movie, but one that also brings to mind under the radar classics like The Rocketeer (1991, another Joe Johnston classic, and surely the reason he was chosen to direct here) and a personal favourite of mine, the woefully overlooked 2004 cult classic Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow. And honestly, in many ways Captain America: The First Avenger owes a lot of its visual and stylistic charm to the ground-breaking work of Sky Captains creator and director, Kevin Conran.The comics, serials, cartoons and posters of the 30s and 40s were used as a visual template to create Conran's movie, which was skillfully made almost entirely with CGI. What Conran and his fellow team created was a larger than life, feast for the eyes every scene, cartoon inhabited by real people years before Avatar did it to greater acclaim and success. Sky Captain is an unashamedly campy and romantic adventure that sought to provide escapism and instil a feeling of empowering optimism in the viewer. Gung ho action scenes involving giant robots, dinosaurs, planes that fly underwater, a very ""Yeah America!"" attitude, the movie never forgot it was fiction and for those who enjoyed it, it remains one of the unsung classics of the 2000s. In so many ways Captain America: The First Avenger feels like an unofficial companion to it.In this film, after a mysterious introductory scene in which we witness the discovery of an artifact named the Tesseract, we meet a young, stick thin man with various ailments named Steve Rogers. Seeking to enlist in the US army, he is rejected because he simply is not enough. Physically but not emotionally weak, it is clear that many resent his ""too nice"" attitude, and no one takes him seriously as a potential soldier. We follow him as he breaks rules by trying to lie his way from city to city to get into the army and fight for justice, all to no avail.Well a few scenes later through the power of comic book technology (naturally funded by Stark Industries), he becomes Captain America! No longer underweight, too short or easy to beat up (early on we see the weak Rogers being beaten in an alleyway in a scene that cleverly foreshadows his future when he uses a bin lid as a shield) he is now the ultimate hero! It's a great scene, one that strives to complement the frenetic, almost pastiche film making style of the era represented, whilst keeping it relatively modern looking as in the scenes in Iron Man when we see the work taking place in the labs. It definitely looks like how one would imagine Stark Industries ought to look during the war era.Chris Evans is PERFECT as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Early in the film, when he is presented as a diminutive and weak aspiring soldier, he plays the role with a run down and yet quietly hopeful sincerity that has the audience rooting for him. It is worth noting as well that the special effects used to make him look so small are still incredible to look at. It makes his transformation into the powerful Avenger even more exhilarating to behold. As for his role as the superhero, he maintains an exceptional focus on what makes this character so relatable. Whether or not he is playing the national hero on television, meeting and greeting adoring fans, fighting on the battlefield or flirting with the gorgeous Agent Peggy Carter (an exceptional, scene stealing performance from Hayley Atwell), he never slips out of character and we always root for him.Just before his transformation, Professor Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) had this to say to him:""The serum amplifies everything inside, so good becomes great, bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because the strong man who has known power all his life, may lose respect for that power, but a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion. Whatever happens tomorrow, promise me one thing. You will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.""Captain America could so easily have been presented to us as a wooden caricature of the ideal all American superhero, another bland, inconquerable Superman. Instead we have been presented a relatable hero, a down trodden, weak but aspirational young man given the chance to prove to himself and to others the value of decency, hard work and integrity. In a later scene up against the main villian of the movie, Johann Schmidt/Red Skull (a fun and campy Hugo Weaving) we have this really great moment of dialogue, in which we see the great gulf between what makes two men of equal strength who are potentially on the same level, so very different:""You are deluded, Captain. You pretend to be a simple soldier, but in reality you are just afraid to admit that we have left humanity behind. Unlike you, I embrace it proudly. Without fear!""This film has exceptional character building, and whilst for many this film succeeds mostly for its worldbuilding (it does really help lay out a lot of details vital for future entries to build upon, and gives great insight to the foundations of the world changing influence that Stark Industries has in this alternate reality), for me it's the characters that keep me coming back. Like Iron Man and Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger is full to the brim with technical marvels and great action sequences, but even moreso than the other two, it's the rich dialogue, the slower pace, and a phenomenal cast that make this for me the best MCU entry yet.Just look at this cast:Hugo Weaving
Tommy Lee Jones
Dominic Cooper
Stanley Tucci
Toby Jones
Richard Armitage
Samuel L. Jackson
Natalie Dormer
Chris Evans
Hayley AtwellThis is a GREAT cast, all working together at their peak level to create an ensemble that helps this world to live and breathe and feel real in ours. After a slight imbalance between the Asgard/Earth scenes in Thor- which at first felt a little disconnected- all the retro-futuristic, comic book loving, old fashioned adventure storytelling elements work perfectly in harmony with the straight faced cast. This is no mean feat, considering they are all up against Hugo Weavings cartoonish Nazi villian Red Skull (who never recieved full credit for being both a magnificent work of art design, looking exactly like he should from the comics, or for bringing a tasty larger than life sense of villainy, the very personification of evil exaggerated via serum the same way that made Captain America the dictionary definition of ""good"").Whilst I hesitate to give this movie a perfect score (for all its charms, this movie doesn't deserve to be held up as high art, rather it should be celebrated for being fine entertainment), The First Avenger is easily one of my very favourite adventure movies, one that, like the first Iron Man and Thor, I can enjoy as much on its own terms as I can as a part of the much bigger picture. I also now long to catch up with the franchise and watch the sequels (both of which I have never seen, and have received even better reviews).9/10",Captain America - The First Avenger

606,Baker-63,A review and a review of reviews.,10,20 April 2012,"I loved this movie. Captain America has had 3 movies in the past, not counting some 1940s ones which can be excused for being good, that were so awful they make movies like Steel or Green Lantern look good. However, I saw a lot of critiques for this movie that were negative. Now I understand differing opinions and all, but they all followed a formula and each one seemed like griping to the point it was just getting stupid. If you'll indulge me here, I have a list of the repeated ones and a rebuttal to each.1. The technology for WWII is too far advanced! This one was the most common and the stupidest in my opinion. It's called ""Fiction"", as in ""not real"". Every time I heard this one it made me think these people have no suspension of disbelief and would complain that Iron Man is a terrible movie because the technology to build a flying robot suit doesn't exist yet. People, it's comic books and it's in a fictional WWII setting. It's allowed to take liberties.2. Captain America is too invincible! That was just stupid. Captain America is relatively weak compared to many other superheroes, he's just a perfect example of a human being brought about by the experiments in the film. Also, he's the main character. He's not supposed to die in a movie that is leading him up to be in a tie-in to all the other recent Marvel films that will lead to The Avengers.3. Red Skull is a terrible villain.There is no sense to this one. He's supposed to be the guy that's worse than Hitler and can get just as many people on his side to do his bidding. On top of that he can take Cap in a fight fairly evenly. Saying he's a bad villain is baseless.4. Steve doesn't go through a character arc/get any back-story.For one, he really doesn't need to. Steve was a good guy from the start, and he did go through an arc. It was subtle, but he did. He gained more confidence and become the soldier he is. He has a back-story but it's weaved in throughout. We know he was bullied a lot, we know he he is from a military family, we know he grew up with Bucky, we know he has had very few, if any, dates in his life, he's a childhood friend of Bucky, and we know he wants to be a soldier because he feels its his duty. I'd rather get it weaved in through the narrative of the story rather than get a huge text dump or just have characters talking for half an hour about everything they've ever done.5. This movie just glorifies America! Not really. It's a good vs. evil story that happens to have a character named Captain America, which was given to him by a publicity stunt. I suppose you also hate movies like Saving Private Ryan because it tells things from the perspective of American soldiers but not the Japanese ones? These were the most common arguments and they are easily refutable. Captain America is a great movie, showcasing one of the best Marvel has to offer and should be in the 7s or higher, not the 6s.",Captain America - The First Avenger
607,Joseph-Stevenson,Average Film for an Average Story,7,28 April 2012,"Until quite recently I was an avid comic book reader. I've read a few Cpt. America, including his origin story and it's a great story, but I feel it's nothing to write home about. Needless to say, I figured this film would be the same going in and I was right. It's a great film and to be honest I don't think they could have done anything to improve it, I especially like Evans and Weaver. So, I would mark this film down as a success. It's a really solid film, I especially like the war themes and I actually like the outfit more than the comic book version. Saying this, if you absolutely love the Captain America story, you'll probably love this film! I think Evans will be great in The Avengers.",Captain America - The First Avenger
608,chase-valleau,"Really good, like every other Marvel film",9,14 August 2011,"I really liked this movie. Saw it last night and I really enjoyed the way they portrayed a superhero that doesn't have any powers. Captain America is not really a superhero, just a super soldier, he doesn't get tired and he heals extremely quick. The acting was very good, what with all the big names in there, and there is always the humor that is enjoyed throughout these Marvel films. Some stuff was unnecessary, like the way they have Captain America just go and be an idol and people not think he can do anything. But I really liked it, and I would recommend it to everybody who likes any of the Marvel films. Anybody who can't stand these films like Spider-man or Iron Man, really shouldn't expect anything more than another superhero movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger
609,TheTrexr,A Fun Movie That Makes Up For the Other Disappointments of 2011,8,23 July 2011,"Captain America is a fun time. It is not without it's flaws, to be sure, but ultimately the movie is defined by a sense of cheesy patriotism and optimistic bravado that does not ask you to take it seriously, promising that if you comply you will have a fun time. I complied. I had a fun time.It embraces it's WWII setting wholeheartedly, and that is what gives this movie most it's charm for anyone with the vaguest knowledge of history. There is a great scene where Steve is in a movie theater watching a propaganda reel advising all young men to enlist and join the army, and the camera pans out to show how emotionally inspired all the women in the theater are (there are few men, because they've all enlisted), and a later one where a pre-hero Captain America tours the country doing a stage show where he tells everyone to ""Buy war bonds; each bond you buy is a bullet in the gun of a good man"" (or something like that). All through the film are scattered little ""I Want You"" posters, some featuring Uncle Sam and some, rather creatively, featuring Captain America in his place. The end credits are made of the most famous of real propaganda posters, and, coupled with excellently trumpet-bound cheesy music, this all adds up nicely to a good half of the movie being an homage to the time period from whence the comic book character was born.Saddly, the other half of the movie is more confused. The villains use laser weaponry, and Captain America's shield is of course composed of more solid metal than anything we have today, and Howard Stark shows off a hovercar. These technological disparities were jarring, and the movie would have been better suited to featuring only the characters using standard issue WWII weapons, as it would have heightened the charm. I make it sound worse than it is perhaps, because none of the above things are bad, but they certainly weren't as good as the propaganda-ey parts.Also, this movie's standpoint on women is exploitive, and not very well handled exploitation at that. On the one hand we have the chorus girls dressed in skimpier outfits than anyone would have dreamed of in the forties on whose barely fishnet-clad legs the camera hovers a bit obsessively during the war bonds promotion sequence. This is degrading and unrealistic. On the other hand we have Peggy Carter, the above mentioned love interest who is nothing more than a ploy to appeal to feminists. She is always shown to be more decisive, more physically capable, and generally more masculine than the men around her despite wearing high heals. She is seemingly above having to dress according to regulations (there is a hilarious shot of her running alongside a bunch of similarly ranked soldiers where they all wear uniforms and she a leather jacket), and is in nearly every other scene without contributing to the story in even one of them. Her character is obviously included to conform to the inane message Hollywood seems so bent on cramming down our throats that women can be feminine and pretty but still do man things, and in the end the message I would like to cram down their throats is that women don't need to be good at the same things men are good at to be equal to men.The villains too need a little work. The Red Skull, the nemesis of Captain America, is introduced well in his first scene, but as the movie went on I found myself asking 'what's so special about him? Anyone can fly a plane, why is it so scary that he happens to be doing it?' Sure he was superhuman (if only slightly so), but him being superhuman never really ends up factoring in to whether or not he can order guys around, which is all he really does. His Cosmic Cube, a weapon/battery of immense power, was never explained well enough for my fellow audience members, even if I already knew what it was from my study of comic book lore, and I can't help but feel it was unfair to them. And where are the Nazis in all of this? The film would have benefited hugely from a scene or two of Captain America helping out at D-Day and such instead of just the bizarre montage it had of him blowing up H.Y.D.R.A. equipment. In particular I would have loved to see a scene or two revealing what Hitler thought of Captain America. No such scene exists, however, and I can't help but feel like the opportunity to marry history and the comic book world was lost.Still, I make this movie sound worse than it is. Or do I? In the end, this film had some severe issues that nearly wrecked almost every second of screen time, but somehow the cheery atmosphere won me over and triumphed over these problems. The momentum of the film and the fact the plot was almost constantly being advanced, even in the action scenes, gave it a wondrous sense of adventure, and is one of my new favourite war films and possibly superhero films to boot, and I am particularly impressed with how good it was considering how difficult to adapt a character Captain America is.P.S. Stay after the credits: there's a rather brief and flashy trailer for the Avengers. It is disappointing in some ways, but I'm willing to cut them some slack because of the fact that Avengers is still filming.",Captain America - The First Avenger
610,Shelly_T,Not just a great superhero movie but a great movie!,9,10 August 2011,"Considering all the recent superhero movies have varied from bad to very good but not great I wasn't sure about this one. The cast on paper was very good but I wasn't sure if a movie set in World War 2 would be relevant in the present day. Well, Capatain Amercia: The First Avenger works and is easily one of the best movies of the year. The cast is outstanding and the story should keep you riveted. The movie has just about everything for everyone action, romance, drama, etc., which is something I think the other recent superhero movies may have lacked. Hopefully, The Avengers and the following sequels, if there are any, are just as good or better.",Captain America - The First Avenger
611,Cardrak,"Wonderful, Exciting, Funny",10,14 January 2012,"I haven't read the comic books, but I do enjoy some big-screen versions of them. This was the best action-adventure comic hero adaptation that I've seen in a long time. Evil villain, nerd becomes hero, beautiful woman, and of course, Stark Enterprises. :) Of course, it is formulaic. They handled it beautifully with just the right touches to make it real enough and funny.Now, the shield as boomerang surprised me, not having read the comics, and I loved it eventually. Almost too exciting for my little self. It was great! Two other action/adventure movies I've seen lately are Thor (GAG GAG GAG) and Green Lantern (lots of fun). Captain American, however, shoots them both out of the water.",Captain America - The First Avenger
612,nicknaseef17,Why is this getting such good reviews?,6,26 July 2011,"When I walked in to see Captain America I wasn't expecting much, I've never been a huge fan of superhero movies. As the movie went on I was pleasantly surprised at first, I really liked the characters and thought ""hey maybe this will be good after all!"" and then it happened, Captain America threw his shield, it hit a bad guy, and it bounced back. At that point they lost me...as if the stupid red mask wasn't enough. There was no development for the love story between Steve and his little British dime. When he crashed at the end I simply found myself not caring at all. There is a reason superhero movies don't work, they don't feel real. The only ones that work is Christopher Nolan's Batman series, and these work because they make Batman vulnerable, you can relate to him by seeing his pain, Captain America didn't have that, I don't think he got a single scratch. It wasn't all bad though, Chris Evans did a good job, and so did Hugo Weaving before he took his mask off and showed his red face. Tommy Lee Jones provided a few laughs, but it just wasn't enough to make it a good movie. Was it a terrible movie? No. Was it a good movie? No. It was simply average, 6/10",Captain America - The First Avenger

This movie tells the complete story from when Steve Rogers is a 90 pound weakling trying to join the army to his awaking in modern day America. The movie perfectly balances the storyline with the action sequences all the while remaining true to the comic book story that I grew up with. They even do a great job with the love interest part of the movie, Rogers unrequited love is perfectly done for a comic book adaptation and perfectly in keeping with the tone of the 1940's in which this movie is set. The last movie I would have given such a high rating to would have been the first Matrix movie, so it's been a long while between drinks.

People warned me of that and I didn't believe it could nosedive so hard, but it did. I loved the first half. They got the tone, with the period setting and Captain's origin story just right... it was really spot on how an origin story should be.But then the second half, Jesus, it went downhill very fast- right when he goes to rescue his friends behind enemy lines. The villain was outrageous and ridiculous in a totally nonthreatening way. All of this futuristic blue lasers evaporating people seemed to come out of nowhere and was completely out of place with the more realistic period setting of the first half, and the whole struggle between Cap A and the ""villian"" became an incoherent mess. Not to mention, and I know I like my movies gritty and with an edge, but for such a ""I'm a patriot, blah blah"" kind of hokey character... it was a little jarring to see Captain America murdering enemy soldiers with no qualms- you know, shooting them, grenading them, and the like. I don't know, it just seemed out of character. And then that ending- it was confusing, completely anti-climatic, and IMO terrible. One of the worst endings I've seen all year.5.5/10 (C)-- it gets points for the first half but could have been a lot better.",Captain America - The First Avenger
617,HogwartsBean,A superhero too far...,6,2 August 2011,"I think if this was the first superhero movie I watched this year then I would have LOVED it, but honestly when compared to some of the others Captain America struggles to get noticed. Bit's were brilliant, other bits not so much. I've read several reviews that state the CG body changes at the beginning are amazing, but for me, that ruined the beginning of the film. Chris Evan's head just does not fit right on a skinny man's body, and his head looks a bit like they stuck him in the stretching machine of Willy wonka fame. As per usual the heroine of the film was about as annoying as they could possibly make her, I just wish they'd find that happy medium between damsel in distress and chick that kicks ass, because until they do, its never going to work in my books!

The action sequences were pretty boring and mainly consisted of Captain America running and jumping around. The soundtrack was extremely generic and forgettable. The villain (can't even remember the his name, or any other character besides Steve Rogers) was the same cliché we've seen over and over again. After seeing this and Thor, I am convinced that the Avenger's movie will be a letdown. And don't even bother watching this thing in 3D.",Captain America - The First Avenger

620,casperfidelio,Trying to get into Marvel... Not a great start,5,27 November 2019,"Lately I've been wanting to get into Marvel to see what the fuss is about. Wanting to watch them chronologically, I watched this movie.I didn't like it. The story is boring amd the characters are lame and predictable. Skinny guy turns into tough guy without having to go through any training and is now a hero. His adversary is the leader of Hydra, a crazed, red... Man, called the Red Skull. We don't get any info as to why he is red, where he comes from. He uses power from a cube that not only contains energy, it also enables him to manufacture very advanced ray gun weapons that vaporize people. In the 40's. Unfortunately these weapons are never more effective than any other military gun, maybe even less, because they aren't capable of rapid fire.How did they manage to make Cap look so lame? His suit is ugly. His personality is that he is a ""good man"" that wants to go to war because he does not like ""bullies"". At first he weighed 90 pounds, then after a transformation he's now a giant, probably weighing around 190 pounds. Never I feel like he deserved that treatment, because everything else he does in the movie is anything special, anything a ""good man"" would do. Any soldier would be able to replace him.Overall I couldn't get into it and the movie became a two-hour long snorefest. The action wasn't anything particular to me, either. I know, this is a 2011 movie, but I've seen better action movies from before. The acting was about average. I didn't think the movie looked interesting either, it does not utilise cinematography to it's fullest.I'll still be watching more Marvel movies, but I was really disappointed by this one.",Captain America - The First Avenger
621,idahovandalfan,Don't miss this one,7,22 July 2011,"I've heard a lot of reviews about this being cheesy. I'm not going to disagree with them, however, there's a reason for the cheese. It's a period piece. That period happens to be the WWII Era in the United States. This is a period of time when Americans probably felt the most patriotic. We were sending our young men into war to save the world. Men signed up willingly and those who couldn't fight, found ways to contribute. I think that if any of us suddenly woke up in 1940s America, we'd find it a very different world.With that said, Joe Johnston, Chris Evans and Tommy Lee Jones capture this era perfectly. Captain America is Steve Rogers, a spirited young man who despite not being blessed with even an average man's physique, still wants to contribute to the war effort. He loves his country and is fearless. It are these qualities that encompass Captain America.The pacing of the movie is perfect. The movie runs just over 2 hours long and it doesn't feel like it. The scenery and environment (some obviously green screened) are perfectly done. And speaking of green screening, there is a lot of CGI in the movie, but it's not overdone and it doesn't draw your attention often. I knew going in that it was an introduction to Captain America so I expected a lot of exposition and character development rather than a lot of fight scenes and action. The movie is similar to Thor for me. We get some background and some cool fight scenes, but we can't wait to see more. The actors are perfect. Chris Evans is so far removed from his role as The Human Torch. It's weird to see him as a team player rather than a hot headed showoff. Hugo Weaving is great as usual. Though I'll always have a tough time not expecting ""Mr. Anderson"" to come out of his mouth at any given time. And I also really liked the young Howard Stark. You get to really see where Tony gets his charm and personality.This movie is a must see simply for the fact that it is the last stand-alone film before they (Iron Man, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Thor and Cap) get together for The Avengers. And speaking of the Avengers, make sure to sit through the credits to get an extra scene and a teaser for the Avengers. Here's my rank for the current Marvel movies so far:1. Iron Man 2. Thor 3. Captain America 4. The Incredible Hulk 5. Iron Man II",Captain America - The First Avenger
622,J-J_Binks,Captain America: The Worst Avenger,1,31 December 2019,"*As you can guess from the title and rating I didn't really enjoy this movie. But please don't let this review stop you from enjoying the film if you did because this is just my opinion and I wanted to have a bit of fun (this is my way of enjoying things I don't like). I mean no offence to anyone who enjoyed or took part in making this film.*I will not bother talking about all of the gripes I have about this film for 3 reasons:1. Because if I did, this review would be longer than the script for Avengers: Endgame.2. I haven't seen this movie since 2016 or something so I have forgotten a few details required for a full in-depth review. What I do remember though is this movie was so violently boring, I could not bear to sit through it a second time.3. This movie is not worth enough of my time to warrant that kind of review anyway.
I have never been a Captain America fan but I at least understand that making the film take place during the second world war is an important part of setting up the character. Unfortunately, as a WW2 film it just makes me groan.The way WW2 is depicted in this film is just insulting. I mean, these guys are supposed to be 'elite Nazis' or whatever and the worst thing they do is shoot a couple of people (and most of the shooting is done with magic guns that most likely don't even kill their victims). In fact I'm pretty sure Captain America has a higher kill count than the entirety of HYDRA. I get the whole superhero flare, but this is just polishing one of the most horrific events in history to a whole new level.So as a WW2 film, it is a complete and utter disgrace. As a superhero film, It doesn't do a much better job.The movie doesn't give you a lot of reason to like the captain besides the fact that he has a 'good heart' or something. Even then, I feel like he is just an annoying *little* patriotic rat who cannot live without a war. Wait, is this guy supposed to be the hero? {stares into the distance with the 'visible confusion' Obi-Wan meme in the background}. I mean it's great that he wants to serve his country in the war, but his motivations just feel wrong and I am not quite comfortable with the fact that America's 'greatest' hero is some little boy who wants to die for his own pride. Also, at the beginning of the movie he says something along the lines of ""I don't want to kill anyone"" yet... {commence montage of Captain America killing more people than the 'bad guys' do}. I just am not a fan of his character at all.Another thing I hated about the film was his romance with agent Carter. I just found it awkward that this little runt who seems to be all about 'THE GLORY OF WAR!' now also wants to impress his crush by... dying? Okay movie, you do you. I don't have to watch it again (thankfully).
So to conclude:
If you want to watch a WW2 film, go watch Saving Private Ryan or something. In fact, Indiana Jones probably gives a more respectful representation of the second world war.
If you want to watch a Captain America origin story then be my guest, you may enjoy (or have enjoyed) it - I can't decide that for you. All I can say is that I don't like Captain America, I don't like this movie and I will never sit through it again.",Captain America - The First Avenger

628,vohnrocks,review,7,21 August 2015,"Captain America. ***1/2/ **** stars Starting Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving. The movie opens up with a group of researchers in the Antarctic, looking at what looks like to be a modern aircraft. They go inside to see what is captain America's shield with the American star logo on it. We move on to Hugo's introduction as Red Skull, the leader of the evil Hydra, as he is searching for what is known to be a potent potion that can enhance a person's trait to it's maximum potential. We then move on to the main protagonist before he becomes captain America: Steve Rogers is a fragile, skinny fellow who often gets beat up. Yet he has a big heart: impatient to enlist in the army so they can fight against Hitler during World War 2. As he gets bullied during training camp, he is acquainted with a female commander, his future love interest wonderfully played by as well as the scientist (Stanley Gucci) as he is eventually chosen to be the test subject for the serum due to his admirably determination. After the experiment successfully turned Evans into a buff, super soldier the scientist is murdered by an infiltrator as Evan chases him off before the man kills himself. The movie follows with Evan's beginning as Captain America: featuring him in propaganda films and posters for recruiting purposes. He is now the admirable American hero with a shield and a costume to match. However, as he enters the war zone the reception is less than friendly. He then goes on a mission to safe his friend who is captured behind enemy line. During the rescue, Captain America faces off against Red Skull for the first time as they both realize each other's true identities. The rest of the movie continues with captain America leading the front line for the Americans to fend off against and ends with captain America's ultimate face off with Red Skull Now this is what I call the ""Batman"" treatment: The director has taken what is a superhero, fantasy universe where heroes defines realistic physics and fight off the bad guys and turn it into a humanized, believable world where the superhero is more humane: He has a past and the story line progresses with a certain authenticity that adds drama and realism that lessens the ""comic"" behind the heroes. This is also a great period piece: Set during the 1940 during the onset of world war 2, the audience truly feels a sense of urgency and menace as Hitler's army slowly but steadily invades Europe. Within this parallel universe and what can be considered as ""alternate history"", the hydra corporation representing the real Nazi regime, and captain America and his crew representing the Allies, adding to the authenticity behind Captain America's myth. Within the marvel universe, captain America possess the pinnacle of humanity's strength. He can lift up to a ton and is stronger than the strongest Olympians to have ever existed: One example is that captain America can survive 60 years being trapped under snow. Chris Evans is superb as captain America: He transforms from a fragile young fellow to the near-invisible captain America with such easy and believably that rival's that of Bale's transformation into batman. One can hardly recognize Evan as he flawlessly transition from a flimsy bully's victim to the quintessential American hero. His facial expression evoke emotions ranging from vulnerability to quiet confidence. You really cheer him on and root for his success. He is likable both before and after. His big heart, hidden behind his flimsy bodily gets brought into tangible reality when he becomes captain American. Just like the re imagining of the dark knight, Captain America takes the authenticity approach: This plays as effective as any real drama as that of a comic movie, due to the deep character development that fleshes out each individual and bring them out of of the comic world into the movie adaptation. Hugo weaving plays a great villain, from his demented motives to his very sinister appearance, you see evil in his actions and intentions. Every time Hugo appears on screen, He is killing somebody, his menace rivals if not surpasses that of Hitler. He is ruthless, heartless and truly evil without any redemption quality and he revels in it. The serum truly worked: as Evan's compassion is enhanced to its every core, Weaving's sin ism is also multiplied. Each time they face off, their innate characteristics seems to increase up until the very climax where the ultimate good is faced off with ultimate evil. Evans' love interest carries a confidence that makes her a worthy companion to Captain America. From the introduction where she gets introduced by punching a fellow's solder, establishes her as a heroine who is competent and supports Captain America through all his struggles. Stan Gucci plays the scientist with such heart that you can't help but weep for his death. He was the man who brought for Captain America as much as Frankenstein's creator. One other hero of the movie is the shield: This is not just any ordinary shield but it's material's is so solid that it more than once brought Captain America out of danger, the shield provides just the right amount of support for Captain America to fight against his enemies. The shield get's introduced in the very beginning, perhaps symbolizing Captain's America's origins and his journey from the very onset. .",Captain America - The First Avenger
629,svgbtz1,A disappointing film.,10,23 July 2011,"I wasn't really hype to see this film, instead I was more interested to see how they were going to show his fall into suspended animation. This film however was a disappointment. but is was mostly due to poor writing and the lack of using all the source material they had to use. We never see Rogers train in martial Arts in fact after his transformation he is automatically a great soldier who single handily pull off an infiltration into the headquarters of Hydra. Having serve time in the military I can assure you this would be impossible for anyone who isn't bulletproof.Understand Captain America has no superhuman powers but because of the Super-Soldier Serum his strength, endurance, agility, speed, reflexes, durability, and healing are at the highest limits of natural human potential. In other words he could be killed by a regular bullet as attempted in ""The Death of Captain America"" storyline.With that this film lack the same thing as the Green Lantern film. The training of Steve Rogers. How cool would it have been to have Steve Train with Sgt Nick Fury. As a fan of comics it is widely known that Nick Fury took the infinity serum which stop his aging. Having Nick Fury as a sparring partner in at least one scene or montage would have added to the films credibility. Instead Steve becomes the ultimate fighter and tactician with just the super soldier serum. He plans the strategy for the colonel???The actors were great and Hayley Atwell does an awesome Job as Peggy Carter and Steve's love interest. Hugo Weaving as always was brilliant as the Red Skull and Chris Evans was acceptable as Steve Rogers. There also was little action for a wartime movie, much of which is seen in the trailers.The best part of this film was the Avengers clips they show at the end of the film. Overall I give this film a C+/B- at best.",Captain America - The First Avenger
630,CulturedLad,So disappointing... Not a great superhero movie at all!,5,9 August 2011,"I'm not a massive superhero movie fan. I don't love comic books, Marvel vs DC is not a topic that can get me debating. I however have been entertained in more recent years by superhero movies. Iron Man 1 was quite good, Dark Knight was fantastic (but to be honest that's by Christopher Nolan, I don't classify it as the normal 'popcorn-y' superhero movie. I loved the more recent X-Men: First Class and it was a very entertaining movie. That's what's essential about a superhero movie. It has to be entertaining. It has to captivate the audience, it has to enthral the viewer. Captain America tried to do these things and quite frankly failed.Captain America stars Chris Evans playing the titular role but in the beginning of the story starts with him being known as Steve Rogers. Steve tries to join the army but of course he can't get in because he's too short and skinny but kind German professor (played by Stanley Tucci) Dr. Abraham Erksine has faith in him. Through various tests Steve shows that he is a loyal and kind person. Now before I continuing going into what the plot is about, let me just say that I thought that the audience would get a no matter what your size is, you have courage sort of moral but that's what we don't get and what annoys me. Steve signs up to be in this research project that injects this hard drug into him that gives him height and turns him into a more muscular build. So, what bugs me the most is that the guy is really not popular and is made fun of when he's skinny and if you've seen the movie or plan on it you know what I mean when I say this, he uses this thing about not going dancing because he can't find a partner but he finds a partner in the end because he turns into a guy from a Gucci advert (Chris Evans is a Gucci perfume model). Essentially the message becomes if you become taller and more muscular you can get a dance partner.Once Captain America is 'born' is where the movie starts to trip. It becomes really dull. There is no attempt at emotion whatsoever and we get action scene after action scene before a little bit of a story is attempted between the brother character. The plot isn't something that you expect to be perfect in a superhero movie but this is pretty pathetic.To mention visual effects, the director Joe Johnston has previously won an Oscar for his work on the final Star Wars movie. They are impressive but of if they weren't I'd be pretty angry. As for the 3D it's non-existent and an incredibly pointless post production job.In a superhero movie what is vital for it to work is a good villain, look what made Dark Knight so invisible. Red Skull is completely the opposite and one of the most boring villains I have ever seen.To be honest, I see this as the last instalment of trailers for the Avengers movie which comes out next year. It's pinned as being the ultimate superhero movie with all the Marvel characters coming together. If you're looking for a superhero movie that will entertain you I wouldn't recommend it, if you didn't mind Green Lantern then maybe this is for you but personally I was really, really disappointed with this.Read more at my blog at http://www.aculturedlad.wordpress.com",Captain America - The First Avenger
631,magpiez_forever,The most boring film to hit the screen in years,1,4 August 2011,Film started out with the story of how this physically inferior guy blessed with great determination and strength of character ended up in the army after repeated past rejections that part at least contained moments of comedy and human interest worth watching but then it took a turn for the worse. How he became Captain America was a bit ordinary his almost sideshow lifestyle was boring and silly and painfully drawn out to the point of total boredom. Eventually he went off on a little escapade that did provide some momentary relief from the stupidity of the story line and boredom of watching that didn't last long before the filmed turned into something that could sold as a sleeping remedy.I would not recommend this film to anyone it is a total of time and money and the worst film I have seen in decades.,Captain America - The First Avenger
632,jouvenaz,Marvelless,3,4 September 2011,"This is utter drivel. It reminds me of green hornet, which was up till now the worst comic book movie of 2011. This however sets a whole new standard and might be a contender for worst professional production with a serious budget, ever. It is impossible to assess whether the characters or the cardboard cutout decors are the thinnest. Arnold Schwarzenegger was frankly a more credible actor in Red Sonia and the Conan movies then the cast of this misbegotten drama. Sebastian Stan proves that none of the Gossip Girl cast can act, and Tommy Lee Jones phones in his performance in order to stay within shouting distance of the rest. Summing it up: there is nothing to the story, the acting is a joke, photography and FX suck. If the cinema charged me per movie I'd sue it.",Captain America - The First Avenger

What i don't understand is why a lot people on IMDb have given it bad reviews. What i mean to say is, from start to finish, this movie was truly epic. Awesome storyline and action. It is the revival of Stan Li's first avenger and the first marvel hero ever made. It is Captain freaking America and i got to say that this is what i have been waiting for.

I know its Captain ""America"" (or more accurately Captain U.S. of the same). Still, too much is too much. I acknowledge that this movie is in Zeitgeist and showing no ""Nazi"" faces, only masks. Still, killing off anyone who doesn't speak English in a WWII movie is long forgone.That's just for my personal interests.For the everyday-audience-flaws: Just wtf? Firstly, if CA was a dwarf b4 becoming the mean machine, please depict him as such and not just shrink the image. No small person looks like this. Secondly, the labs, weapons and such. there heave been numerous films overstating what the Germans could do in WWII. But what with all the black light?

Surprisingly enough, I only knew it was coming out for a little while I knew, for instance, that the Green Lantern was coming out for ages! I wanted to see that for so long, and still haven't mind you, but as soon as I saw the trailer for Captain America I knew I wanted to see it more. I just thought it looked cooler, seeings as I hardly ever watch Sci-Fi's anyway. The best character was Howard Stark, yes he was in it. Something so cool, you would never have seen that in Green Lantern. Sorry I was just excited because Iron Man is like my favorite superhero.

So far in both ""Iron Man"" films, the second ""The Hulk"" film, and ""Thor"" film, we got clues about a powerful super hero team being assembled to fight evil. One more piece was needed to complete ""The Avengers"" and now we have the ""Captain America"" film.I was wondering how director Joe Johnston was going to get Captain America to modern times so he could become the final member of The Avengers. He began the film with a discovery of a downed airplane in Norway. People from Washington, DC were contacted to check the wreckage and discovers the shield of Captain America.So the rest of the film is telling the story about how Steve Rogers a very skinny dude who wanted to fight in WWII but couldn't pass his physical, then a scientist used him for an experiment and it changes his life. The performances of Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Stanley Tucci, Dominic Cooper, Neal Mc Donough, Derek Luke, Kenneth Choi, JJ Feild, Bruno Ricci, Toby Jones, Sebastian Stan, Hugo Weaving, and Chris Evans makes ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" a film you can't miss.

637,Kerry-dan_16,Gee wiz the caps a marvel,7,20 August 2011,Captain America the last piece of the jigsaw for next years superhero team up movie the avengers. but is it any good as a stand alone movie? Its a good old fashioned heroics set in the second world war with skinny wimp but heart of gold Chris Evans getting knocked back by the recruitment centres for being too skinny until a scientist takes pity on him and passes him and watches his training to See if he's the soldier he needs to test the super soldier serum which transforms skinny Chris into super muscled Captain America. when its good its great with big explosions and Nazis getting punched into the air and through walls etc. It has very few characters who are given time to shine apart from weaving as the villainous red skull who works alongside the Nazis but has his own world dominating agenda. Tommy lee jones is hard nosed shouty army type is good in his opening scenes then is later marginalised to comedy side kick! Captain Americas great when it deals with derring do and being the ultimate American good guy but like Thor it is selling us a movie thats coming soon which stops these movies standing on their own.,Captain America - The First Avenger

Overall this movie had no good action sequences to speak of , an almost forgettable climax , all our hero does is throw an olympic discus provided by howard stark and almost always looks like an average superhero with nothing special,either in charisma(contrary to batman) or powers(contrary to almost every other superhero).

643,arthurbanendera,Great Action Movie!,9,20 March 2012,"There are too many comic book action films that have been coming out but Captain America is not only the best one, but is also the only one that I actually liked. Now, some might argue that X-Men: First Class was fantastic (I am NOT a fan of Thor), but, while not bad, I felt it didn't reach its potential. As for Captain America, its main distinction to other summer films is that it doesn't dive right into the action. I appreciated the time it took to develop its characters, and, gee, there actually seemed to be a story going on here. I also have to warn those of you who might expect a straight up action flick to not get your hopes high. Although it didn't bother me, it does take a while before an action scene actually appears.Another distinction that separates itself from other superhero films is the look of the film, coinciding its setting in 1942. Captain America looks and feels like an old-fashion film, and I really embraced it. This is also due to Alan Silvestri's score, which feels more classic than modern film scores. Our protagonist, Steve Rogers, feels like a real person which adds an emotional weight to the film. We feel for him and want him to succeed in his goal. And once the story is set up and the action finally comes to play, the action doesn't seem to appear for action's sake. It actually propels the story. It also doesn't hurt having a romance brewing between him and Peggy Carter. It was sweet and didn't feel forced to me.Chris Evans plays the title character and he's great playing both the skinny, average Joe and the buff, all-American hero. He certainly steps up his performance here compared to his other superhero character, Johnny Storm. He brings a sort of charisma and puppy dog charm to his role, and it seems like an automatic response to be on his side when we first meet his character. Hayley Atwell is totally believable as his love interest as well. I would love to see what other things she has to offer in future roles. With all good superhero films, there must be a villain to match it. In that case, it's not surprising that Hugo Weaving doesn't disappoint. Just as the person he is, he can withhold an audience's attention without even trying.",Captain America - The First Avenger
644,chrisc-o,I can't think of a reason for anyone to like this movie,1,1 May 2012,"To call Captain America a good movie is like calling a Double Big Mac Five Star Cuisine.The plot is simple and archetypal enough: Hero is weak, hero becomes strong, hero proves he's a hero, hero sacrifices himself and hero comes back. Captain America is kinda like Jesus, only with lots of American Flags! The characters themselves are just awful. Captain America's character is totally unrelatable since his only flaw seems to be he's just too darn Heroic! This leads to the question of why the female protagonist fall in love with him, since Captain America has no personality whatsoever. Oh yeah and the female protagonist only exists to be a part of the really terrible love sub-plot, seems Marvel wants to keep the feel of the role of Women in 1940's society. Generic Best friend Character who joins the military dies, but everybody saw that coming and his death is mourned in one scene, after that he's never mentioned again (because giving Captain America semi-complex emotions for more than thirty seconds might make the writer's heads explode). Hugo Weaving performs well as the Red Skull, however his performance is totally put off by how ridiculous the costume is. When I saw the Red Skull's face for the first time I didn't think ""Wow he looks so intimidating and villainous."" I thought, ""That's a terrible mask, Hugo Weaving."" However my biggest overall problem with Captain America is the tone and lack of consistency. This is a movie that wants to be a serious action movie, while the Red Skull looks like Hugo Weaving shaved his head and swam in some red paint. It terms of the consistency it starts off as the usual abused hero story, then it shifts to what seems to be an attempted criticism of the resources wasted in America Propaganda, then becomes a zany action flick (With battle montages and Hugo Weaving), then ends trying to be all serious and dramatic. It tries to be everything and fails at all of them. Even as Super Hero movies go this isn't anywhere near the best (Watchmen and Christopher Nolan's Batman movies take that title).If you're the type of person who sits around in a trailer covered in American flags and actively hates using intelligent thoughts, then you'll like this movie. The idea that anyone else could enjoy this is dumbfounding, since its just so awful.",Captain America - The First Avenger
645,estherladi,WWII + Nazis + a superhero = FUN,7,31 July 2012,"(I know I'm really really really late with this review, but I just can't help myself, I must put this down. So let's begin!)When I first heard about this project I was seriously concerned it'd be terrible, because WWII is a very serious and sensitive subject of history and mixing into this an American superhero story (or any kind of superhero story) would turn out to be embarrassing. Yet it was so good. Not a timeless classic, but a good action and superhero movie.Let's see what was good about it:I think Marvel Studios just knows somehow how to mix history into superhero/sci-fi/fantasy stories. The best example: X-men: First-class. And in the case of Captain America just turned out pretty well. Everything looks like it should look like. Everybody talks how they should. And even for my biggest surprise it's not funny, it (almost)takes itself seriously and it suits the flick. This almost realistic style gives me the chills in a good way.The villain. I loved The Red Skull (a.k.a Johann Schmidt) in the comics, he was elegant, cool and intelligent, so just a perfect Nazi villain. So I was really glad when I found out Hugo Weaving will play him. Personally I'm a huge fan of Hugo Weaving, I loved him in his every role. And he didn't disappoint me this time either. Although his mask looked a bit...well... silly? I guess. But that didn't bother me. I think his costumes were very cool and the Hydra was great SS copy. I loved the weapons they've made. Although sometimes I just couldn't understand why they didn't use them. Oh whatever, little silly plot holes who cares?The portrayal of Steven Rogers. I have to admit in the comics Steven Rogers is not such a greatly deep character. He is just the perfect American civilian and American soldier. He isn't such a hundred dimension character in the movie either, but he is sympathetic, kind, honest, honorable and merciful guy. An Average you can relate to. And I liked him. Chris Evans played Captain America just the way you'd expect him to. It's a mild performance, but satisfying.The cast. Tommy Lee Jones was just perfect for the role of Tommy Lee Jones, and he really did it well. As I've already said Chris Evans was kinda good, and in my opinion Hugo Weaving was excellent. I also liked Hayley Atwell as the love interest. I. Really. Did. Like. Her. Oh my God for a superhero movie this girl was so cool. She was a soldier, she was intelligent, she was strong, she could look after herself and all. Girlpower! Just kidding. But really there should be more characters like her out there, and less characters like Bella Swan from Twilight.The action sequences. Oh yes, these are important for an action movie. And they were pretty darn good. (Although there were some stupid things for ex. How could some hungry tired soldiers defeat hundreds of well trained Nazi elite warriors with laser weapons (or other)? Oh who cares?) these parts of the movie were sorta creative, too.So, I should also write down what I didn't like about the movie. Why did I give only seven stars to it if I can't even tell what was wrong about it? I really can't put my finger on it. I guess it's just that it is just a simple action movie. No deep lesson, though there IS a lesson, no big expectation. It just looks cool, it's enjoyable with little flaws. I wasn't bored by them so much so I could overlook them easily. I've seen this movie like 3 times already and I can still watch it because it's so ENTERTAINING.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Don't be curious.,1,28 September 2018,The things I'm writing in this review are my honest real-time thoughts and feelings right after watching the movies.Just please don't watch this movie. It's really so heartbreaking. I just watched it and I can't express how disappointed I am. I knew I shouldn't have watched this but I did out of curiosity and I just hate myself now. The single worst movie I have seen in 2-3 years and I've been watching so many movies.Please don't watch it... there are tons of fantastic movies out there. please don't look at the rating. this movie deserves an avg of 5 at best. I'm quite sure it has almost 7 because of some 9 years olds and some bots and some 'Murika people.

Not that I hate them categorically, quite the opposite - I actually manage to enjoy some of those candy coated popcorn rides with all their shallow water characters that tend to be the norm for kids films. Same goes of course for most American mainstream fluff and filler films.Captain America then again - make no mistake here - it's only purpose is to rid PG-audiences of their money and maybe make a shot for the future franchises and merchandise. It's really heartbreaking that this is what the modern audiences have come to - mainstream blockbuster entertainment is reduced to pure consumerism and a bad one at that. Plot and screen writing follows basically the same schema as any other nothing-to-see-or-enjoy-here -films of the genre. Only difference is, of course, that here it appears in an even more depressingly lazy, flat and ne'er–do–well form par excellance. Boring as hell - even the action scenes are clearly sub par choreographed and unfortunately not even that well realized.Wouldn't recommend it even for a cheap thrills or a time passer. Take some of the better ones out there - this one is just one of the thousands of clones that is intended for the juvenile or prepubertine audiences and for the sole purpose of making a cheap buck with a lousy merchandise.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I hope to see him more in Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is one of the reasons that Agent Carter series is next in my Watchlist. The plot is good. Very simple, but really enjoyable story. The downside of this film was Agent Carter. Hayley Atwell is incredible, but the character was only a love interest of Captain America. I guess. Agent Carter series will satisfy my expectation that I put in Peggy Carter character.Overall,it was a solid movie and I recommend for anyone who loves Captain America in comics.",Captain America - The First Avenger
649,zarinchowdhury,"action, mystery, and awesome",8,31 October 2017,"The movie Captain America: The First Avenger is one of the best movies that was released in 2011. It is 1941 and the world is in the throes of war. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to do his part and join America's armed forces, but the military rejects him because of his small stature. Finally, Steve gets his chance when he is accepted into an experimental program that turns him into a super soldier called Captain America. Joining forces with Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), Captain America leads the fight against the Nazi-backed HYDRA organization.There were deep focuses in the movie. Which showed the relationship between characters and objects in their environment. For example- Steve Roger, he has his shield to protect himself from the enemies. Also, there were high angles that were shown in the movie. The camera was positioned above the subject, which makes the subject to appear small and insignificant. For example- When the plane crashed into the ice. It made the actor appear small. Overall I really like this movie because this movie has a good plot, actions, lighting, angles etc. The actors did very good job with their roles and contribution. I would recommend this movie to people who enjoy actions.",Captain America - The First Avenger
650,beer-backwards,The Roar of Approval from the Audience said it all!!!!,10,22 July 2011,"So I am an avid movie goer and a fan of all Marvel movies, but this one takes the cake, well for now at least.I knew from the start that if this movie wouldn't have been up-to-par the audience would strike back with vicious yells and profanity, because of the approval of The Amazing Spider-Man and The Dark Knight Rises trailers and the way no one said a thing after seeing the Sherlock Holmes trailer. This movie starts off in the present of a group of guys finding a mysterious craft of some kind and inside it lies the frozen Captain America. We all may know about him being frozen from a snip it of The Incredible Hulk extras but it seems as if they have done away from that.Cut to 1940's and we have a small wimpy but full of heart Steve Rogers trying to enlist into the Army. As you know form the trailer he gets rejected. I am not going to spoil the movie for anyone so I will let you go see it for yourself.The acting was above par and the choice for Captain America and Red Skull were top notch. Chris Evans is most definitely Steve Rogers and not Johnny Storm. Hugo Weaving, as always, gives us a great performance as a Nazi Scientist trying to rule the world with god like powers. There was not one flaw in acting on either side and the effects were amazing.Please if you are a fan of Marvel STAY AFTER THE CREDITS!!!

In the comics, he is Captain America's greatest enemy but in this film, his motives and origins are never even explored. He was just a one-off character. Peggy's relationship with Cap also felt really forced, he carries a pendant of her face around with him and it's never explained why. People that carry pendants of their partners into battle but those people have often been married for years, more often than not, several years. Meanwhile Cap carries around a pendant of a woman he met 2-3 years ago and never had feelings until Italy in 1944. They haven't even been on their first date yet so he can barely call her a girlfriend. Besides that, the rest of the movie was good. I really liked Steve's character development of how he went from a man that wanted to give his country his all to a man that gave his country his all in his final moments.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Not a ""Chick Flick"" a great ""Guy"" movie. This movie is an inspiration for those males of all ages, a story for those that had to struggle with their lack of physical ability, There is hope for us. Experience has shown me that when a movie is made about a Comic Book Hero, the hero comes across pretty ""Comic"" and unbelievable. Having read these books in my youth, I was looking forward to see what they would do with it. I was very pleased that they did not try to inject an anti USA message here. This is a Good vs. Evil story as most comic books were. Having Tommy Lee Jones, and Hugo Weaving who brought their professionalism to this production certainly made the difference. Different film editing would have made this an Oscar contender for sure is the only weak point I could find. This film coming out when the ""Super Soldier"" programs that various governments are working on makes it timely and more believable. The Special Effects are not overdone they work well with the story and are done is such a way that enhances the story without taking it over to make up for a weak script or acting, not the case here. Very well done. Chris Evans did a wonderful job, and I look forward to more from him. The director Joe Johnson did an outstanding job with the screenplay.

666,warlock817,Good inoffensive fun that could have been more exciting,7,23 July 2011,"Captain America: The First Avenger, directed by Joe Johnston, bears the mark of many of his films -- good, solid direction; clear and understandable characters and plot points that support the material -- but misses the mark, if only just slightly.Steve Rogers (Chris Rogers), an underdeveloped and over patriotic young man, wants to join the 1942 fight against Hitler. What compounds this problem is his close friend Bucky is the complete opposite of everything he is: strong, confident and athletic. After several, failed attempts to ""join up,"" an exiled foreign professor chooses him for a secret mission and the rest, as they say, is history.Johnston and Christopher Markus' script spends a good deal of time building up the character of Rogers as a dedicated solider, willing to do anything to defend his country and his fellows. But he spends a little too much time in fact. By the time Steve Rogers becomes the hero of the moment, the audience knows he is dedicated and the action that they have paid to see distills into three adventures and a montage of attacks mounted by the Captain.Where such films like this always tend to shine is the villain, aptly performed by Hugo Weaving. The scenes in which he is featured are truly the lynchpin of the film, with special emphasis on the climax between his character and Captain America.Johnston's straight forward direction is technically correct but the timing and the script hamstring him. Much credit goes to the special effects team that takes Steve from wimp to pimp.",Captain America - The First Avenger
667,kingfish9307,Wow this was bad,4,22 July 2011,"With over 70 years of material you would think the writers would not have to stoop to ripping off Star Wars, Indy, and James Bond. The weapons that Hydra were very close to the storm trooper blasters, but even more lethal. Yet somehow they fail again and again to stop soldiers with shot guns and pistols. The inventions that Iron man's dad comes up with are way advanced for 1942, rendering him little more than a primitive Q. The scene with the Cube and Red Skull was straight out of the Raiders ending. All in all it was very slow moving, lacked any kind of imagination, threw in the very cliché love angle, and sported a very unconvincing Evans as Cap. He should stick to playing the Human Torch in those dreadful FF movies, and you should skip this and watch Thor.",Captain America - The First Avenger
668,rjw930,"recycled, contrived, over-the-top studio schlock",3,1 February 2012,"Captain America is the latest lackluster installment in the increasingly stale genre that is comic-books. I should have known better than to go into the theater with any sort of expectation, but alas, there I was, popcorn in hand, cautiously excited at the prospect of a WWII superhero movie. At about the 15 minute mark, I sank wearily back into my seat and braced myself for the another 110 minutes of recycled, contrived, over-the-top studio schlock.The audience is introduced to pre-Captain America Steve Rogers and from the outset it is clear that all plausibility is being thrown out the door. Captain America wastes no time setting up a believable character in Rogers, instead mindlessly diving into emotional manipulation to the nth degree. These poorly conceived and overtly contrived early scenes attempt to cast him as a Rudy-type i.e. has all the heart, but none of the physicality. The establishment of this caricature is insultingly obvious and ridiculously over-the-top. In addition, actor Chris Evans was digitally altered in post-production to be smaller in these scenes and the result is a distracting, mousy look that looks creepily unnatural. The human eye is very good at spotting things that are not real and for the first twenty or so minutes it is difficult to overlook. The movie finally stumbles into the heart of its story by having Rogers participate in a military experiment that vastly increases his size and strength. Now, one of the central reasons that I allowed myself some optimism concerning this movie was the time period and corresponding bad guys. This is World War II. Nazis. Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indiana Jones. Awesomeness. This leads me to the most frustrating aspect of Captain America. The writers inexplicably choose to do away with the Nazis by making the baddies some weird offshoot blandly named Hydra. Why in God's name would you change the antagonists from the most universally recognizable and despised group in modern history to some lame, generic faction named Hydra? The work is basically done for you. Everyone already hates the Nazis. You get a free pass on explaining who they are and why they are evil. Everybody already knows. I have a gut feeling that politics came into this decision. American society, especially Hollywood, is terrified of offending anyone. This movie is a paradigm to in-offensiveness. The ridiculous multi-cultural team backing up Captain America is further proof of the anachronistic politically correct mindset of these writers.The central conflict is so generic and bland that it hardly deserves any explanation. I'll give you a sentence. Hydra wants some sort of mystical power cube that it can use to take over the world. Meh. Its really just a vehicle to get Captain America into the monotonous action scenes that are completely devoid of importance, meaning, and suspense. Captain America himself is so flawless that there is really no question of how it is all going to turn out. Yes, I know this is a superhero movie. Yes, I realize that Captain America is supposed to be a little hokey. But a little relatable human imperfections would go a long way into making him a more engaging character. Nolan's Batman is interesting because we see how tortured and unsure he is. He makes mistakes and is full of doubt. Captain America is an Abercromie and Fitch model with the personality of Mitt Romney.There are too many problems in Captain America to point at one thing. Its the lack of depth in the 'written by committee' script. Its the cookie cutter character of Captain America himself. Its the unwillingness to break new ground or push the boundaries even a little bit. The success of Spider Man and Batman has set off a production company feeding frenzy into comic-books. At this point, it looks like Hollywood is merely cashing in rather than trying to create something new and fresh.",Captain America - The First Avenger

670,substance24,A Stereotype Nightmare,2,29 July 2011,"I went to see this film at a midnight premier screening. I had seen previews for the movie, and honestly, I thought it looked pretty solid. Of course, I was expecting a standard summer action flick, but nothing like this.From the get-go, I could tell this movie was not what I had thought it would be. It's filmed using a digital camera, which gives it a TV-like quality that I find distracting. With every shot, I was reminded that I was sitting in a movie theater. Johann Schmidt's introductory scene was overly theatrical and cliché-ridden.I'll say this about Captain America: apart from the camera-work and Johann Schmidt's intro scene, it started off well. The characters were well established, and Steve Rogers was very well written.However, the moment Stanley Tucci's character appeared on screen, it started to feel wrong. His accent was so stereotypically ""old German scientist"" that I found myself smiling whenever he spoke.This is around the time that we're introduced to the other characters: Colonel Phillips and Peggy Carter. Both are just more stereotypes added to the mix. Phillips is the grumpy and pessimistic army man, and Peggy is the cliché ""strong government woman"". Neither of them ever move more than an inch from their carefully enforced character cubbyholes.The action scenes, while sometimes entertaining, are, once again, cliché-ridden. Steve Rogers' first fight as a superhuman has him jumping on top of a car and being shot at through the roof. Sound familiar? It's been in loads of action movies, and it's just one of the action clichés in this film.Later in the movie, one of the characters dies. Within one scene, I had forgotten who had died and why everyone was so somber. That is not a good thing.Finally, during the final battle between the Cap and Red Skull, I found myself looking away from the screen, hands on my face, realizing I didn't care at all about who won. I didn't care if Red Skull defeated the Cap and took over the world, because, quite frankly, the villain is too evil and too unrealistic to be believable.For all the film's flaws, though, it's well-acted. Chris Evans does a great job, as does Hayley Atwell. I just wish the characters had been written better to allow these actors to really explore their roles. They feel caged.All in all, this film felt like it was made simply to get the Avengers moving along. They rushed it. The characters are too simple. Steve Rogers/Captain America has no character flaws, which makes it difficult to connect with him. He's too perfect. And the action isn't worth seeing.Skip this movie. Go out and watch an Army recruiting commercial. You'll find it's more entertaining than this garbage.",Captain America - The First Avenger
671,user-828-592263,"Well done, but...",5,28 November 2011,"First of all I would like to say, that this is a very well done movie.All actors play their roles very well, and more than that, now I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Steve or Colonel.Effects are good and very clean. It's hard to notice any kind of unnaturalness.But something was missing there. I couldn't find a word for that feeling, until I understood that it was ""boring"".There is action there and love story and good guy and bad guy and good guy finally wins.. But there was nothing special. I think two hours is too much. Everything is too slow. So, that's why I give it 5 of 10. Well done, quality movie but something is missing in the story, something to attract and keep attention.",Captain America - The First Avenger
672,acolu7,Hands down the best Marvel movie since Iron Man.,10,20 July 2011,"Yes I said it. I personally even enjoyed it more than Iron Man actually, because Captain America The First Avenger has much more to it than just great action sequences and a solid story. It has heart. The quiet confidence of star Chris Evans speaks the loudest without him even saying anything and ultimately, that's what makes this movie succeed more than anything else. I enjoyed Chris Evans performance so much in this film I kind of wish he had never played Johnny Storm from the Fantastic Four movies. He was just that good, and to me was born to play this role. Without a doubt he IS Captain America. The film is extremely well casted and Marvel may have just nailed their most frightening/menacing villain yet. Hugo Weaving plays the Red Skull who squares off against Captain America and who's motives tie into a previous Marvel Studio film. *hint hint.. Thor* This is also the very first Marvel Studio film without a rushed romance. The chemistry between Chris Evans and co-star Hayley Atwell oozes off screen and makes for Marvel Studios first believable romance. (I liked Thor's romance as well but compared to Captain America the romance in that felt too rushed) The movie really does a terrific job of making you feel for Steve Rogers before his transformation. I felt the skinny Steve scenes were the most meaningful and helped you to really connect with Steve after the transformation as well. The pacing of the movie is really well done. It never dragged once, and kept me interested and entertained the entire time. The action is also very fast-paced and slick, director Joe Johnston definitely knows how to work the camera around an action scene. The fights are very easy to distinguish and their are really no quick cuts or ""slow mo"" scenes (which is director Zack Synder's forte.) and I really appreciated that. Overall I would give Captain America the First Avenger a 5/5 I just absolutely loved this film and cannot wait to see it again. It captures the spirit of old adventure classics and you can definitely see a bit of an influence from ""The Rocketeer"" in this film. Go see it! Captain America is without a doubt the best comic book movie out this summer! I enjoyed it better than Thor and X-Men First Class (both which I loved as well) so that should definitely tell you something!

Graphics were on par, some moves were cheesy but fun to watch none the less since it's what he does in the comics. This is a back story, so everything is not blowing up for no reason and it has major focus on WWII because that's Capt's beginning. A few parts may drag for people who don't read comics. Otherwise I think Chris Evans did a fantastic job as Steve Rogers and Tommy Lee Jones along with the rest of the cast added laughs in appropriate parts. The Red Skull played by Hugo Weaving was perfectly matched for the part. Sexual tones are kept to kisses and side long glances while language is mild at most so this is a film the whole family can enjoy.",Captain America - The First Avenger
674,jiangjonas,"This movie is the worst film I have ever seen,",1,21 October 2011,"This movie is completely stupid and every minute watching it makes me feel a little bit dumber. Everyone is constantly doing the opposite of what every sane person on the planet would do, and the story line is none existing. Every new scene is just some random cliché and you can pretty much guess what is going to happen all the time. This is the worst piece of Hollywood bullshit I have seen since ""The Fantastic Four"". How the producers could get some otherwise great actors is totally beyond me.If you want to see Tommy Lee and Samuel L in a great movie go watch ""The Sunset Limited"". You might actually learn something and be moved by it.Captain America will most likely just make you ill.How anyone can like this movie is mind blowing. Humans are really a stupid race sometimes.I seriously can not stress how much this movie is a waste of time, and if you like it you are properly slightly or moderately retard.",Captain America - The First Avenger
675,p-valderhaug,"Incredible Movie, should be watched by everyone!",8,26 December 2011,"I never had any relationship to the Captain America comics, i always found the all-American hero to be a bit too much for me. Based on this, i did not have high expectations for this movie. I was proved wrong. From the first scene to the last i was glued to the screen. Chris Evans portrays the All-American kid from Brooklyn Steve Rogers perfectly. Through this movie my joy for Captain America was highly raised. Over the last years there has been many movies based off of Marvels comic book superheroes, this is by far my favorite, it gave life to probably the most heroic of all the superheroes. The antagonist is also portrayed rather well. The only thing i did not like about the movie is the ending. I feel like it was a bit pushed so that it would fit with The Avengers in 2012, but that was it.To give this movie an eight is based on the fact that this movie did justice to the comic book character and showed him as a freedom fighter, someone who will do anything to keep people safe, instead on showing him off with his red, white and blue colors. If you like superheroes, you really should watch this one.",Captain America - The First Avenger

In fact, im really looking forward to it. Having waited for the Blu Ray to see Captain America i was looking forward to it, but its a massive let down. Although Hulk is awful as well. The 3d version also is an after thought at best, a gimmick if you will to try and make this more entertaining than it is.Im all for character building and for the 1st hour CA does this OK. Even if it does look awful fake before he gets taller stronger etc. The action scenes are OK as well but the story stops once he becomes CA. The worse part though is the Rocky/South Park the ww2 scenes. All i could here was the song from Team America and South Park ""Everybody needs a montage"" Even Tommy Lee Jones couldn't save this. (That says a lot) In short, good start, very poor middle, poor end. (An actor should only be allowed to play one superhero as well.",Captain America - The First Avenger
677,GabriellaBN,"Rushed, corny, and entirely predictable",5,21 March 2012,"I have to admit, I was very excited to view this film. As a superhero fan, I couldn't wait to see it. The whole ordinary-guy-turned-super was appealing, it didn't hurt that Fantastic Four buff Chris Evans would star as the leading role. Next, the corniness. The effects were great, to some extent. I can only watch a slow-motion exit by Chris Evans while the background burst into flames once. (I'm not even sure that happened but then again, the entire movie was one big blur.) I was disappointed. The so called ""relationship"" was cliché. Who would have thought that after the transformation ladies wouldn't fall at his feet? Who would have thought that the one girl that liked him for who he was before would win his heart after? After seeing one chick flick, you can safely predict the outcome of their relationship. The ending was good, but it made the whole movie seem like a simple back story for the big Avengers film to hit theaters in May. I'm not even certain I'm going to give that a try after this flop. The entire movie was rushed, scenes were predictable and the acting was overdone. Props to Chris Evans for working with what he had, but this is one movie no American should have to sit through.",Captain America - The First Avenger
678,TheFlyingMustache,A Great Popcorn Movie For The Summer,10,24 July 2011,"I didn't think Captain America could be done properly on film (next to Thor, anyway) but director Joe Johnston has surprised me and delivered a film that exceeded all expectations. It's definitely one of those films that allows one to easily leave their brain outside the theater.First of all, the casting was perfect. At first I was concerned with Chris Evans being cast as Cap but while watching it, images of the Human Torch from the Fantastic Four films never came to mind. I saw Steve Rogers and Captain America. Hugo Weaving plays Johann Schmidt, alias the Red Skull, who really does justice to this sinister comic book villain and despite various people complaining that the Red Skull is poorly written (being that his motivation and back story are hardly touched upon) I found him to be quite an enjoyable antagonist to see on screen save for those few character developing flaws. Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Stanley Tucci, and Sebastian Stan also did justice to their characters (especially Sebastian Stan who really made the character of Bucky into more of a person who could handle tough situations on his own rather than a wimpy sidekick like he was in the comics at times).As for the plot, it was pretty straight forward but there are quite a few cool action scenes and, as stated, it's pretty much one of those films you can just leave your brain outside the theater and just go with the flow. Also, unlike ""Thor"", the romance between Cap and Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) is more developed and handled better in this instance.So if you're looking for a good film to go see just for the fun of it, go see ""Captain America: The First Avenger"". Well done, Marvel! Let's hope that Joss Whedon can deliver ""The Avengers"" just as well as Joe Johnston delivered this.Final Verdict: 10/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
679,james_c9110,Does this latest take on the shielded hero do one of Marvel's most popular characters justice?,6,30 July 2011,"So after two Iron Man films, The Incredible Hulk and Thor, we have now reached the last of the Avengers set up films; Captain America: The First Avenger. Because of its title there was a lot of pressure for this film to be good, otherwise audiences were unlikely to be enthusiastic about next year's 'The Avengers', which may well be Marvel's most ambitious project to date. People unfamiliar with one of Marvel's most popular comic book characters may be put off the film simply by the superhero's name. The USA is known to be one of the world's more proud countries, and many people from outside the US might not find the patriotic theme too inviting, however the superhero's title is justified quite nicely and fits in historically with the needs of the country at the time. This really is not a ridiculous propaganda fest as some might expect. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is introduced as a small skinny and generally unhealthy looking guy with good intentions. He's desperate to join the army and help fight the war against the axis overseas, however he is repeatedly turned down from serving his country due to his physical appearance. He remains persistent and is eventually noticed by a military scientist who gets him trained up and enters him into a contest where the chosen candidate becomes America's first super soldier. During this process we meet a Colonel played by Tommy Lee Jones and the film's love interest Peggy Carter, played by Hayley Atwell. These two characters are the strongest of the film's supporting cast and there's convincing chemistry between Atwell's Peggy Carter and Steve Rogers. Dominic Cooper's Howard Stark is also worthy of a nod. However, perhaps he could have done with a bit more screen time. Regardless, it was nice to see glints of Tony Stark's personality in the scenes he was in.Hugo Weaving plays Captain America's nemesis; Red Skull. He's the typical comic book villain; seemingly deluded with dreams of world domination. He's not boring and Hugo Weaving plays the part nicely, but he's just nowhere near as interesting as Thor's Loki. Red Skull is the head of a Nazi division named Hydra, a group of specialist scientists and soldiers who invent/are equip with high tech weaponry. One of Hydra's recent discoveries makes them a serious threat to the allies and so Captain America is deployed to take them down.A lot of the cool fights that we got glimpses of in the trailer are still only glimpses in the film. This is due to them being part of a montage sequence rather than a full action scene, this felt unnecessary and was disappointing, especially seeming as it came straight after Captain America getting a new suit and shield. You can't help but think that those being tested out for the first time in a longer fight would've been much more entertaining. There are still several lengthy action sequences though, with great moments – trains, planes, motorbike chases it's all here. It's just a shame the film is so cleanly cut between character development and action. In Captain America you only seem to get large chunks of one or the other, never both merged together.Captain America does have its flaws but it's still an entertaining summer blockbuster. It also ties in well with the other Avenger set up titles which should leave audiences pumped for next summer's Marvel outing.",Captain America - The First Avenger
680,Thingz-change14,I owe the captain an apology...,8,4 September 2011,"After watching The Green Lantern, I wasn't expecting the next superhero-summer-movie I watch to be anything but crap. Oh how wrong I was...I've never read any of the comics, I was never very interested in the superhero either. Until now... The film tells the story of a short skinny dude who wants nothing more than to join the army to help serve his country. Of course he finally does and becomes Captain America and yada yada yada, watch the movie. I really love (Yes that's right, LOVE not LOVED) this movie because I relate to it in so many ways, I'm not really skinny and short but I've had been pushed around and beaten up so I know what it's like. All I ever wanted to do was teach jackasses a lesson. Now if only I could inject some super-juice into my body to gain superpowers... I also love the message it sends out there, ""Do what's right"" or ""Stand up for yourself"" that sort of thing. Dumb cliché's aside... the action was also pretty decent. It wasn't exactly what I expected (I was expecting a bunch of slow-mo fighting and some karate flips) but its pretty good. At least it's no Green Lantern.Pretty explosions aside... The acting was great. When I found out Chris Evans was playing Captain America I was like ""Hell yes!"". He's an awesome actor, I didn't hate his Johnny Storm role either. So I was looking forward to seeing him kick ass with a shield. Tommy-Lee Jones does a wonderful job as usual. Hugo Weaving does a decent job. Not exactly his ""Agent Smith"" from The Matrix but he still did a decent job. Hayley Atwell was good too. And then of course there's the rest of the cast...The script was great. I loved all the lines, although I was expecting an awesome one-liner at the end but... oh well. I expect too much. So to wrap things up... If you still haven't seen the movie, stop reading this review, get off your ass, and go watch it! Oh and I owe the captain an apology. I thought the movie and everything about the movie was gonna suck. But I was wrong, it is officially one of the best superhero films I have ever seen. I'm sorry Cap.",Captain America - The First Avenger
681,rooksbailey8,Captain America? More like Captain Boring.,6,28 December 2011,"After reading a bunch of glowing reviews when the movie came out, I finally rented it and I have to say I was disappointed. I found the movie to be little more than a by-the-numbers comic book action movie.*SPOILERS BELOW* Now, I am not familiar with the original Captain America, so I don't know how it compares to that. However, the premise of the movie - a patriotic super hero who must defeat a Cobra-like evil Nazi organization based on super science - is one that should appeal to me. I mean, think of the possibilities! Unfortunately, it seems apparent to me that the movie never considered the possibilities and instead chose to make CA into an amalgamation of every super hero trope set against a paper thin WWII backdrop.Captain America himself is little more than a copy of Spiderman's Peter Parker - a wimpy kid who is gifted with super hero powers...and proceeds to brood over his new found abilities for most of the film. Then, of course, you have his (doomed) mentor and his (doomed) friend, both there to provide motivation-by-death at key moments. Hugo Weaving plays the part of your ridiculous and paper thin villain whose motivation is never developed beyond the ""he is crazy"" approach. And Tommy Lee Jones reprises his increasingly tiresome role of the folksy sheriff/soldier/authority figure.Even more disappointing than the lack of deep and original characterizations were the incredibly boring action sequences. Based on this movie, CA was nothing more than a brute who would win battles by banging people on the head with his shield. Really? Not exactly what I had in mind. I mean, how many times can you watch CA charge into a mess of Cobr...er, Hydra thugs and start beating them up with as much finesse as Hulk Hogan? I actually found myself looking at my watch every time a fight sequence would break out because they were all thoroughly uninteresting and on par with those found in the awful Batman TV series.However, I think the greatest tragedy of CA is how WWII is never portrayed with any depth; really, it is little more than a convenient backdrop. When I saw some of the (unimaginative but) interesting Hydra weaponry, such as the mammoth Leman Russ tank at the beginning of the movie, I immediately started imagining all sorts of alternative WWII battles along the lines of DUST. I mean, how would the Battle of the Bulge changed if the Wehrmacht fielded a bunch of laser-armed Leman Russ tanks?!? Unfortunately, the movie never bothers to explore any of this as while we get to see huge stockpiles of advanced weaponry, the movie is content to use a dozen guys with silly looking laser rifles and flamethrower units, and the occasional laser-armed APC, none of which impacts the events of WWII in the least. Even when Red Skull ""goes rogue"" and uses his weaponry in open revolt against Hitler, there are no historical implications. It's as if the events of this film take place in a bubble that the rest of the world found thoroughly irrelevant and uninteresting. Wait a minute...they may be right.I really wanted to like this movie, but its approach is so amateurishly banal that I found myself hating it with each passing moment. And don't even get me started on its unsatisfying conclusion that seemed to be written before the rest of the movie for franchise reasons. In the end, nothing is really explained or resolved, which is the final lazy insult for me.All in all, CA is little more than yet another missed opportunity by Hollywood. Captain America? More like Captain Boring.",Captain America - The First Avenger
682,ambientalchaos,You ain't desirable if you ain't a hero,7,29 July 2014,"I shall be short on this one.Negative sides of the film:The film is a complete unorganized mess. Let's just put all the ingredients in the soup at once and the meal is done. The scenes are so short you can't even realize what was happening in the previous one. There's no particular order of happenings. Everything just happens at the same time.Cameras and all that weaponry in WWII? I don't think so.Steve spends three minutes in the laboratory and he jumps out as a superhero without any side effects and without showing any emotions towards his new looks, skills. Is he a robot without feelings or what? Bad sound editing. I could barely hear the actors talk and when it comes to the fighting, the sound will blow up your ears.Mindlessly jumping into a fight, without the previous plans and re-thinking. Let's just go out there and get killed. Hurray!Beautiful woman in the war, wearing lipstick 24/7 and having her hair perfectly done all the time, going to the battle without her helmet although everybody else has one, just not to ruin her perfect hairstyle. Tell us your secret please. Captain America magically mastered piloting and handling with the yet unfamiliar technologies to the USA army.The beginning of the film teaching everybody that if you're not tall enough, if you're not ready to go to army, you're an undesirable man, and everybody will pick on you and hate you.But let's not be too harsh on this one. It still has a great acting crew to satisfy your eyes if nothing. All in all, I give it 6-7 stars since it is a puzzle piece of Marvel that explains the other films to the crowd unfamiliar with the comics. And it does have some exciting yet illogical action scenes for the crowd that seeks adrenaline rush. Conclusion: A film for the fans of Marvel only.",Captain America - The First Avenger

Captain America is not a easy character to find believable on the screen. his ideals and concept is something action and adventure movie goers have a hard time relating too. Understanding that Joe Johnston took Captain America: The First Avenger and created first the back story of who Steve Rodgers was before he became Captain America and connected to the heart strings of viewer. This could have completely fallen flat if not for the use of amazing special effects crafting a Chris Evans as a 70 lb. weakling.Johnston took so much time telling the story of Rodgers becoming Captain America that the rest of the film felt rushed at points. The action scenes looked and felt amazing to watch but sped through. Once Captain America goes to war in the film it feels like only a matter of minutes before you are watching the ending fight scene between him and the Red Skull.The acting in the was really well done. Chris Evans really shined within the film and you where able to completely forget that he at any point was Johnny Storm. He also connected with the supporting cast of Hayley Atwell, who sadly will only be seen in this film because of time period it was set in, and Hugo Weaving who became the Red Skull in my eyes.",Captain America - The First Avenger

But, seriously, I regret wasting my one and a half hour on such a film. I mean, such a film would have been justified if made in 70s or early 80s. Acting-disappointment, story-disappointment, execution- disappointment. For god'sake if you don't know how to make a period superhero film then don't, do not destroy the character completely. Start was a little good, but as soon as he is convinced to become a national hero, the film loses itself completely. Didn't like Captain America's transformation from an elite army men to a sort of superhero.. His sacrifice for country was although meant serious but was completely humiliating, the end 1 minute however, was really good I would say but that again was connected to a very unrealistic event.

687,jdrumdog1,A Revisit,8,17 April 2019,"I'd like to revisit this, as I've never left a review for Captain America previously, but I'm going to do it now.Given the extra context of origin stories we have now in the MCU, I don't know how this movie would get scored as under a 7. Yes, it has some Marvel cheesiness in it. Yes, there are still some shortcomings, as with all movies. However, overall, there's no way this movie is worse than Captain Marvel, as an example.Good things:1. Chris Evans plays the part well. Remember, this is a principled individual who will stay by those principles no matter what. The character was an embodiment of what 1940s America was aiming to be, and he does that well.2. Hayley Atwell also plays her supporting role extremely well. She also serves as proof that strong women have always been in the MCU. She was good enough to have her own series, which says a lot. Hayley has self admittedly said this was just a job and wasn't super passionate about it, but she does well. It's...well her job.3. Tommy Lee Jones getting to play basically himself is a riot. Small part though.
Bad things:1. There's corn. It's popped and buttery, but it's still corn. Some of the lines between Evans and Atwell are examples, specifically around the last Hydra base. However, given the source material, this is expected. The penultimate fight also is a bit meh.2. I don't really like Howard Stark's portrayal in this film. A little too fake NYC for me (the accent, meh).3. The Red Skull. Threatening but you don't get him fleshed our enough. For someone who was always one of Marvel's top villains, he feels second rate here. Hugo Weaving does his best but it's not quite enough.
That being said, overall, it ultimately hits home. The last scenes with Cap and Peggy, as an example, are fairly good and that scene ends quite well. The transitions are decent.The big question here is, in hindsight, how is this a lower scoring movie than Captain Marvel? There's at least a story here, a much better use of a best friend, and there isn't a blatant agenda thrown in my face. The script is better, just everything is better.This movie should at least be a 7, and I've marked it as an 8 (a B), and that's what it is: in the MCU, a B movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger
688,aasta123,Don't live up to its expectations,4,26 May 2014,"First of all, I was deeply disappointed by the movie. I was looking forward to some spectacular and meaningful marvel superhero movie, but Captain America didn't quite live up to marvel's name. First of all I have to say I enjoyed the training camp at the army, but that's about it. In those scene Rogers is a very honorable man, and I guess he continued being so, but after his transformation I really felt as the character lost his uniqueness. Like with the flag pole you could see his ability to think outside the box, but with him as captain America I didn't feel like there was anything outside the box - I felt as if I had seen it all before.Secondly, I think that the villain in this movie was pretty pathetic. ""Red scull"", really?! You never got to know why he was THAT against the world, he was just put in the movie as an obstacle for the hero.Thirdly, the technology was way to far developed of its time and made it all seem pretty unrealistic.And last but not least, the ending sucked... I didn't feel as if it fitted with the plot, and instead of giving me any answers it left me with even more questions. Who found him? How could he been sleeping for 70 years?

The change from puny wimp to super hero was well done, as was the intro sequence with red skull. The whole nazi-mysticism mystique was done very well.

One good thing about this movie is that it's action packed and full of cool characters like Captain America, Bucky Barnes and the Red Skull as the evil villain.
What is one not so good thing about this movie?
One not so good thing is that Steve Rogers takes a long time to turn into Captain America because he's at army camp for a bit.
Who would you recommend this movie to and why? (not specific people, but types of people)?
I would recommend this movie to all families who like action movies and kids 7 and over.",Captain America - The First Avenger

702,hpacheco-2,Too Much of an American Captain America,3,8 September 2011,"The first part of the film is well-constructed, with the usual super-hero in-development plot. However, the storyline involving Hydra has too many inconsistencies. I get the feeling that they only desperately want the superhero to look cool rather than having a reasonable script. They managed to create a film with over-clichéd lines, lack of action, misplaced explosions, meaningless technology and conflicting war scenarios. It falls short for a star wars type, for an action type or for an epic type. I was expecting a typical ""america rocks"" film with lots of action and unreasonable American patriotism, but this extremely inconsistent plot was a huge disappointment even for that.",Captain America - The First Avenger

704,kingjoeg,Captain Average,5,2 August 2011,"Captain America is a typical blockbuster movie and an average one at that. Some of the action sequences left me shaking my head in disbelief due to their incomprehensible nature. It is alright for a film to be a little unrealistic but it is not acceptable to break the laws of physics. The film was too slow paced and corny for my tastes, but as soon as Captain America became the hero the quality jumped, but sadly it was a bit late in the day. Stanley Tucci's character was my favourite performance in the film. The final scenes are beautifully shot and emotional which was the highlight. Captain America failed at being a decent standalone film but succeeded at being a set up to The Avengers. It's only purpose it seems is to make the audience aware of who Captain America is.",Captain America - The First Avenger
705,escoces21,What a waste of time and money,2,10 August 2011,"Having gone to see another film (The Devil's Double) only to find it sold out. We took the only other option available which was Captain America. Not something I'd normally have even considered, but there wasn't much choice and I have to admit I do still enjoy the visual novelty of 3D generally. Anyway against my best judgement and hoping for the best, in we went. - What a load of rubbish. Pathetic plot (if there was one), thoroughly 2D characters, lacklustre action scenes and less than impressive use of 3D effects. Even as a pathetic piece of American propaganda it was poorer than the usual fare. Having said all that, my friend (who is easy pleased)seemed to quite enjoy it, which is the only thing that saved it from getting one star from me. As we were going in the usher was telling all and sundry to ''hang on till after the closing credits had finished'' - hoping that maybe there would be some great freebies handout or at least an excuse for the drivel we had just watched, we hung on as everyone involved in the making and their dogs were listed of, just to be informed that shortly, even more of the same would be available to watch. Er - thanks for the warning. Me thinks next time I'll just stay at home and watch paint dry or play with my navel!",Captain America - The First Avenger
706,fatdog222,"Captin America, good to see you could make it on time.",10,30 July 2011,"I will jump straight into this review with a great big smile. Not only was the performance of Chris Evans a current career high light, Hugo Weaving does not on the other hand disappoint portraying the a most evil antagonist. I do not see fit to name any other names, however in light of Hayley Atwells performance I think we will be seeing a lot more of her in Hollywood.As for the film its self, Excellent, Critics of this genre need to realize the genre that is being depicted through this movie has conventions and thats why we watch them.From batman to spider man these are the what make super hero movies great.We are seeing the re-invention of the medium through which super hero's are being portrayed and rightly so. The Graphic novel and comic book mediums, although still going somewhat strong lack the socioeconomic structure (aka they're not trendy enough thus don't make enough money) to be advertised to a younger audience.In turn the moral values these movies teach will not be forgotten, thats the point of marvel, its not about the powers, or the hero. It is about the individual and the relatability.-thats from Stan Lees mouth as well Which brings me back to Captin America, the never give up attitude that Americanism was so caught up on during the set era is ripe and depicted well through Steve Rogers character. Teaching us to rise up to a challenge, and to never back down from what we believe in no matter the cost.The action that is lusted for the moment you can smell the popcorn will loosen your grip on your drink and have you reeling in anticipation of what Captin America will do next.A great movie which i will be recommending to all my friends This film leaves me excited for the avengers and the other films the paramount/marvel franchises are about to unleash on the world =P",Captain America - The First Avenger
707,meyoukangaroo,Thumbs up my brotherend!,10,10 March 2012,"I'd admit it, I had watched it a bit late, but this is by the far, next to Tower Heist in recent movies, as the better ones of cinema now. This is a pinnacle of the right medium thrown across the face of the expected general bland that is Hollywood entertainment at this point; where the biggest movie stars perform in mediocre films, and everything seems to be contemporary, stupid or depressing. But once in a while, someone a director or and actor or a writer comes a long, to reinstate at least some hope back in all that bland unoriginal theme, and in the right way. Captain America was a homage to the comic series, it was great, it had plenty of actions and even though it kept that relevantly typical marvel comic build like that of Spiderman where something extraordinary happens, it was made in the most rationalized means, and fitted into a nice framework of creativity and originality. That's the word - originality and ingenuity, - you don't get that often in Hollywood now- a-days, and this really slapped it on like well ridden material. A true homage, and even though my ""fellow"" viewers found it a bit ""unrealistic"" and the humor ""obvious/offbeat comic-relief"" they don't know what the movie competitors are, to truly know how much other movies now a days are off beat in humor and ""weird"", my fellow viewers are insane, and don't know what they're talking about. There were no boring bits, and it was funny and quirky all the way. And most of all it was GENUINE, - weirdness and offbeat humor are made splendid when like in the movie where the main character learns from the scientist that value of strength is what's important, - this movie shows how the value of the genuine is important, and that can triumph over occasional unrealistic marvel aspects and offbeat humour (if any) any time of any day in this current movie industry.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I am waiting on the Avengers now. Also, don't miss out the credits they will show the Avengers trailer in the very end. This movie starts from the making of the ""Captain America"" and beautifully ends up in the New York City current day where Steve Rogers and head of STARK foundation meet. Movie has a lot of details about Captain America. Only thing which I might question was gun used by Steve. I don't recall from comics that captain America has gun but maybe I am wrong.

709,leeezly,Boring and badly laid out plot.,1,13 November 2011,"This movie is actually not more than an awful commercial for the stuff to come in 2012. This is also why it was produced cheaply. Apparently it was never intended to be good.The main actors role of being a skinny and not large guy was done badly. People know the actor, so it was hard for them to imagine him to be skinny. Rather they should have used an unknown guy. And Tommy Lee Jones giving his good name for this sh** ... worse. He cannot even be in the sequel since he died in the movie. Also this movie leaves a lot of things unexplained. This is probably due to the amount of other information and short movie. Why do they always have to be 2 hours? I can watch Apocalypse Now Redux without problems. Arggg!Marvel, what a shame. You wasted 2 hours of my life.",Captain America - The First Avenger
710,kryptostang,"Finally, a hero with character and not money, brains, or women.",8,22 July 2011,"There was an atmosphere around Captain America that other superhero movies seem to be lacking in different amounts and that is the likability and humility of the way this particular hero is portrayed. Odd enough, as America is often branded as being the epitome of arrogance and pride. But instead of being somewhat disgusted with the protagonist's bravado and sleazy ""charm"" as other movies may want you to completely buy into, I found myself cheering for Captain America, not because I didn't want evil to win, but because I didn't want good to lose. It seems to me like some of the more recent super hero movies force the audience to cheer for the lesser evil. Sure, the hero's a jerk, but hey, if he doesn't do anything about it then the world will explode. Yay, hero. Captain America has you cheering for him the whole way through because he keeps his integrity and stays true to what he stands for. The movie is quite clean, funny, and keeps its head on track. The villains are evil enough, but not obsessively dark as if trying to be villainy. The only small gripe I had was that I wanted to see more of Captain America in action! I know this was an origin story so we had to keep it simple and build the base of this hero but to see a couple more built up action scenes of Captain hitting people with his shield would have been great! Don't get me wrong, the ones they had were fine, but I just would have liked to see more is all. The effects were great, I wasn't concerned with plot holes or awkward gaps, and it kept my interest(most important factor in my book). Just got back from the 12:00 screening and ran out before I had to listen to all the goofy comic book nerds rave about what they just saw. From a total newbie to this comic-screen adaption, this was a pleasant experience that I would recommend. 8/10",Captain America - The First Avenger
711,scuba_de_cuba,Started out good and then plateaued.,6,23 July 2011,"(Spoilers in my review will all be marked ahead of time.) I don't know much about Captain America unlike other comics, so I was interested and excited to see it. I went into the movie with an open mind... The movie starts out good, with a good story and good character development, but shortly after Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) becomes Captain America (i wont say anymore about that so as not to spoil any of the story), the story kind of goes into a slump until all that is left is pretty much just action. It was like taking a balloon, filling it half way up with air and then letting it deflate. Disappointing.Plus Captain America was more like Captain Invincible. Nothing was challenging for him at all, not even the villain. I will go more into detail in the next paragraph. It was equivalent to playing a video game with God Mode cheats enabled. Also when we do get to the main villain (Hugo Weaving), we get a tiny smidgen of story about him, and thats pretty much it. I was very disappointed in the lack of effort by the writers, who got off to a good start, and then kind of seemed to stop trying. Captain America was my least favorite of the Avengers movies (Iron Man 1 & 2, The Incredible Hulk, & Thor.) I give Captain America an R for Retarded. lol. Just kidding. 6.0/10.0PS!!!! - Stay after the credits for a first look at the upcoming Avenger Movie!! Sweet!!The rest of my review (except for the last paragraph) ***contains spoilers!!*** -- OK so after the first 20mins/half hour about tiny Steve Rogers and him being chosen, everyone (scientists and the military)is very excited and highly anticipating the transformation of Steve into the first super soldier (Captain America) and when they finally do it, they're reaction is basically like 'huh, thats neat', and then kind of don't care anymore. Like watching the fireworks of the fourth of July, its amusing but when its over you go home and nothing changes. They put him in some ridiculous costume and make him preform on a stage with dressed up chicks dancing, with a cheesy rhyming script and choreography, as a literal mascot of the army. And they make him do it like hundreds of times, and he doesn't seem to care, even though he wanted to fight in the army like his whole life. Like some ape they experimented on, had a break through, and then threw him in the circus. It was a major (and very strange) side track. Then he finds out someone he knows is behind enemy lines, and decides to go fight.***Spoilers continue*** Then he becomes unstoppable. He fights his way through the rest of the movie without any challenge at all. Even the final battle between him and the villain (The Red Skull) isn't challenging. Its basically a fist fight, and then -Major Spoiler- ***the villain accidentally vaporizes himself. Like woops. I guess I shouldn't have grabbed that glowing all-powerful energy cube with my bare hands huh?*** Speaking of which, the energy cube that the Red Skull uses to power all his weapons is an ancient energy cube. They never explain what it is, where it came from, or what it was meant for. He just finds it and gets his scientist to manipulate its energy. And the Red Skull is basically relying on his one single scientist to solve all his problems, and he covers the costs. He has one plan to conquer the world, and no back up plan at all. So when Captain America starts to destroy his like 5 or 6 headquarters, he doesn't really know what to do other than watch and run.***Spoilers continue*** And as far as his abilities... He basically has a red face and can punch hard. Those are literally his only two special ""abilities"". Plus we don't find anything out about who he is, where he came from, why he wants to conquer the world, etc... All we find out is that he injected himself with an earlier version of what Steve is eventually dosed with, which made him a little stronger... and then burned his face off. Thats pretty much it. (Eyes roll). In the end, the Red Skull is more an inconvenience than a foe.All in all, while the graphics and action were good, the story was underdeveloped and disappointing - Captain America was an entertaining no-brainer flick worth watching once... on DVD. 6/10. (OK) :/",Captain America - The First Avenger
712,kshires09,Captain America? Severely Disappointing.,3,11 November 2011,"I really like Captain America as a Marvel character. He is very interesting to me. He is intelligent, charismatic, and opinionated. What he is not, is a singing and dancing monkey. I rented this movie a few days ago because I saw Hugo Weaving was in it so I decided I would give it a go. But all the movie turned out to be was a set up, explaining how the f*** he ended up in the modern world with the rest of the Avengers. If it wasn't the overly modernized technology and the villain who was a poor rip-off of the G.I.Joe: Rise of Cobra movie villain (who wasn't particularly intelligent EITHER), I would have to say the downfall of the movie was the musical number. Beyond that fact, it is STILL stuck in my head (""The star spangled man with a plan""). That and (*and this is the spoiler*) he falls and love with this woman, Peggy, and then lands a plane in the arctic and is cryogenically frozen, apparently. He's discovered by us, modern Americans, and then he breaks out, ends up in the middle of Times Square, freaking out, and Nick Fury appears out of nowhere as if traffic didn't exist and tells him he's in the future, to which his response was ""...I had a date."" And that's the last line of the movie. I assumed that at the very least, he would find 90-year-old Peggy in a nursing home and dance with her. But no, we're left hanging about poor old Peggy and he just chills in the middle of Times Square looking sad and confused. Conclusion: If you never liked Captain America and you just want to watch and obvious set-up for The Avengers movie coming out, then go see this. Otherwise, don't bother.",Captain America - The First Avenger

714,academywinner,"A fun hero movie, albeit sorely missing an accent.",9,22 July 2011,"Up front you should know that I went into this movie knowing nothing of the characters and their backgrounds, so my review is from an entirely comic-book clueless perspective. That being said IMO, As far as comic book hero movies go, captain America fills the bill. It's got everyone and everything it need that makes it an entertaining and memorable. Leading man Chris Evans does well, pre and post captain America transformation. His believable vulnerability and noble ideas make him (of course) a hero worth looking up to. The only bone I have to pick with the studly Evans is in his voice. Various times in the movie he mentions his brooklyn background, and each time it (to me) awkwardly pointed out his obvious lack of the subsequent accent he should have had. Otherwise, he wore the outfit well, was impressively sized, and did a great job staying true to the small guy persona in a tough guy body. Hayley Atwell portrays Peggy, the female of the film. I don't have any criticism for her acting, but I wasn't thrilled with her character as a whole...it almost came across as one dimensional. I suppose it's not a big deal, as this is a comic book film and the women there are primarily there to be the love interest for the hero, but I was left thinking the character deserved more then the role of the sharp shooting beauty. Hugo Weaving's red skull has a (fitting) scary sort of German Voldemort-y feel to him, so no complaints there. The same goes for the rest of the well- wordrobed supporting cast; a very well chosen out group of actors. I did not see this film in 3D, but the special effects were cool without having them thrown in my face. Also the effect that put Evans's head on a scrawny body for the beginning of the film was *seamless* and impressive. In summation, the film did what it set out to do and did it well. It is what it is, and what it is is a lot of fun. It's the journey of a lovable hero, set in a world war two backdrop. In the world of comic book hero movies, Captain America is definitely high on the list.",Captain America - The First Avenger

The end of the movie made me cry. I watched this movie with one of my friends, and we were both so sad and mad at the ending. But overall, captain America was a sweet action filled movie, with an amazing cast line up. Chris Evans wooed us, as did his persona.

717,TonyaTemplar,A favourite in our house,10,11 January 2016,"We love this film. My 3 year old (almost 4) daughter is in love with Captain America. She begged me to buy Captain America bedding and on a recent trip to Universal Studios in Florida we stood in line for 30 minutes so she could meet her hero. We all love this movie and just as well as we watch it almost every day. Funnily enough I don't mind. It's rare to find a film you can watch again and again and still love. Captain America: The First Avenger is a just a great film. Chris Evans is fabulous as Captain America. Some of the action scenes are awesome, we love when he goes to rescue the soldiers in his stage costume. The CGI effects are brilliant and the older retro scenes are well done. The movie ends with true patriotic heroism and full of heart. Just perfect movie time.The joys and the thrills mostly go to the actors performances. Chris Evans is perfect as the thoughtful compassionate little guy with a big heart about to become a big hero. Epic movie moment when he takes the flag off the pole that ranks up there with Indiana Jones shooting the guy with all the swords. Hugo Weaving is great fun to watch as the Red Skull. Tommy Lee Jones has the great comic one liners that every good movie needs. We love the Howling Commando's. Hayley Atwell is stunning as Agent Carter and it's not a surprise that a Marvel spin off series all her own was born. We love the scene in the car when they talk about dancing, that moment when she almost touches his chest when he first comes out of the machine always makes me chuckle and their final scene is really emotional.As superhero's go Captain America has to be amongst the best and this film has a big place in my families heart.

718,brokentoejoe,Nazi's with Lasers,1,27 November 2011,"I'll start by saying I am a huge comic book fan. I've been reading comics for years. I'm not some snob that thinks comic book movies are atrocities, I personally loved movies like Nolan's Batmans, Raimi's Spidermans, and other various Comicbook movies. That being established this movie was far from a good movie. Its hard to decide where to begin I have so many problems with it. I suppose I'll begin with the painfully simple plot. A power crazed Nazi has a doomsday weapon that draws its power from a magic cube, naturally his plan is to blow up Washington DC and take over the world. We have an incredible underdog hero who is given the Super Soldier serum which turns him into Captain America. He then punches his way through an army of Nazi's and saves the day. Yup, its that cheesy. There is a clear mistreatment of the time period as there is a dreadful attempt at using the style and whatnot of the period mixed in with a bunch of advanced technology like laser guns and super tanks. Evans gives a simplistic, two dimensional performance of a scrawny kid who also happens to be the most black and white moral idealist in the history of time. And once he is given more muscle than Lou Ferigno and Hulk Hogan combined, he turns into Americas perfect soldier. I don't even know how to explain just how little complexity there was to his character. To sum it up it was a painfully stupid movie.

In fact, there was just enough of everything: romance, drama, history, action, humor, mystery. I don't know about you, but nothing quite encourages me like a good underdog story. Oh, and for once, I found myself GLAD it was Captain America, and Captain Some-other-country. They were VERY considerate of other nationalities by having a number of different nationalities fighting on the good side alongside the Americans. I loved the World War II setting and the romance.

Sure, itwas obvious that he had gained some powers, but only in the First Avenger I actually realised his super potential.Strong sides.The brilliant transformation. Yeah, that is what all we like. No point to deny. Skinny weak guy becomes handsome. And hot. At some moments I was afraid Agent Carter will eat him with her eyes.Captain America can be funny. When everything is just serious it does not go well with superhero movies. And humor is their best seller. That is why the Guardians are so popular. The flag moment is just hilarious.The atmosphere. I think film creators made a good job here. Past looks like past. I did not go too much into details looking for mistakes so the picture for me was nice.The villain. To create somebody craizier than Hytler...very brave. And i liked the character created by Hugo Weaving. And the removing of the skin - what a moment!But.
...oh God! That is what I do not like in all those superhero stories and action blockbasters! Not realistic at all. Of course Hydra whould defeat. How come they lost with that dredful weapons? So many soldiers, all the defence, and Captain America took the military spot easily. Captain is ok. But what about others who were released without weapons and superpowers? Maybe if you are 11 you're just getting excited with all that action. But if you're a bit older...well. Just enjoy all special effects, Captain's muscles and think that the story just begins.Anyway, despite of all minuses (which are the problems of most superhero movies), if you are Marvel fan, you have to watch.

The villain is fairly weak and the plot can be a bit slow at times, but it's action scenes are entertaining, most of the characters are likeable and it is overall a good setup for the Avengers movie.

(BEFORE YOU READ IT! MOST OF THE MCU IS UNCLEAR FOR ME ALTHOUGH I GREW UP NEXT TO IT THROUGH THE YEARS. IF YOU'LL READ FACTS YOU KNOW SINCE AGES, I'M SORRY!)
Not sure if I ever gonna finish it, anyway, let's start!
I liked this movie a lot, was a kind of emotional, action-filled journey through Steve Rogers' origin story. Emotions weren't missing, that grenade catching scene proved me that Steve was the perfect choice for Captain America's role. Even though the movie's main concept seemed sort of banal (felt that Wolfenstein vibe :D) but thankfully a twist was given to it. The ending felt reallly fast-paced for me, at least it became understandable at the very end.
I'd give a light 8 as a start.

From Cap jumbling to people falling it was great, but when you get to a big building and plane sadly I can not say the same.

I think they totally dropped the ball with this Captain America movie. This movie reminded me of the Captain America TV movie from the late 70's it was that slow.I am hopeful that Avengers as a team delivers more in the future.4 stars because the ending of the movie started to redeem itself.

746,arussell817,Some problems but Entertaining none the less,7,29 August 2011,"Going into yet another Super Hero movie leaves you wondering what type of crazy story will I be delving myself into this time. The problem being is that their are a few movies that have set such a standard that if no other super hero movie is the same then they somehow get crappy ratings.Captain America is the first of possibly more then one film, but as it stands the team behind the captain did a good job. The story flowed very fluently in creating a character who had nothing into someone who still had heart and soul while being the beast of a man he has always been inside. I think a lot of the complaints of this movie have to do with ""over animation"" or that it was too cheesy.Here's the thing about animation. Its difficult, long, and very tedious work to do. If you can give me an easier way they could have portrayed captain America as a tiny little weak nobody then all of the sudden a 7 ft. Super Warrior.... without animations? please feel free to explain how you would do that because you would be making millions.The thing is that yes I believe the film is over animated in a lot of ways however, the animation was quality enough to where it wasn't dominant and it was entertaining. As for the cheesy writing in some areas yes, I agree that they went a bit overboard with some stuff but ... I mean the guys name is Captain America..... really...?Overall my outlook on the film is a positive one, I think they set up Captain America nicely for the upcoming Avengers film and I believe that film will deliver the Amazing writing and showing we hoped for in this film.",Captain America - The First Avenger
747,alexhef,Worse than terrible,2,15 October 2011,"I didn't come to this movie with any high expectation but I was still surprised by how god damn AWFUL this was. Worst movie this year? Easily and by a distance. Worst movie of the decade? Certainly a strong candidate.I don't even know where to begin writing about the inanities that kept pouring out of this film, suffocating any shred of enjoyment.Actor performances? Wooden, bored with stupid accents. The only passable performance was by TLJ who tried to be a good soldier but was hampered by the moronic plot and idiotic lines he was forced to recite. Speaking of which...Plot? A shy little patriotic guy is magically transformed into a big guy in red-white-blue tights and goes to fight mad nazi scientist. The love story was a clichéd jumble: shy guy wins the girl? Really? (that is actually an accurate description of the character: The Girl). The allied sodiers (you know the ones who actually won the war) exist solely to cheer the frisbee wielding guy in tights, The nazi soldiers who for some reason all wear stupid looking masks and constantly make the most ridiculous salute ever invented by humans, apparently went to stormtrooper school of shooting. Or maybe they just can't stop laughing at the sight of the guy in tights with his frisbee in the middle of the war. And when they do hit it turns out they have lasers that can bring down a building with one shot but can't even scratch the magic frisbee. And how does it come back to the thrower? Wait.. if I start thinking about this movie rationally my head might explode.The villain? I might call him a cartoon, but any cartoon villain is a 1000 times more sophisticaed than this. What does he want? To kill everybody! Why? Because he's evil!!! Muahahahaha. Though here I must give some credit to Captain America for holding back the laughter at the bad guy's stupid mask long enough to actually fight the villain, lose then watch the bad guy melt himself with the all-spark... oops wrong cube... the magic blue cube.I don't even know how I finished it. For the first 40 minutes I entertained myself by laughing at all the stupid stuff going on, (There was a lot of laughter) but then that became boring and eventually too stupid to even laugh at. I spent the other hour and 20 minutes cringing, crying and begging for the pain to stop. Should've left earlier but I felt bad about wasting the money. That'll teach me.I think I'm just rambling now, but words cannot describe how awful this movie is. It makes Batman & Robin seem like Oscar material. In short if you want to torture yourself for 2 hours (did i mention this movie has enough actual plot for about 10 minutes?), I suggest nail pulling or water boarding. Has to be more enjoyable than this.Do NOT watch this movie!!! Save your self the mental damage.",Captain America - The First Avenger
748,pwiezer,disappointing,2,8 November 2011,"If you want to watch a movie and haven't seen a superhero movie before then this is a great way to start.but if you are a regular movie go'er be warn't. the special effects are good enough but the plot as thick as 1 page. the acting over the top.And some of the action, correction most of the action to stupid to ignore. Feels like a 40ties advert for the US.Even superman has got more balls then this 'blegh' nice over the top good boy...This movie really isn't worth 7 stars unbelievable rating. feels like a hack or money was transferred to IMDb (which is ridiculous of course) but still...unbelievable rating",Captain America - The First Avenger
749,vctr-dumitru,crap,1,27 June 2012,"It's garbage. I had a feeling about it being awful when i saw the trailer and cast. Nonetheless, I wanted to see it because I WAS planning on watching ""The Avengers"" and wanted to know all the background stories. So, where to start (being that the entire movie was a piece of shi.t)... The love story: The chick didn't even care about him before he got buffed and emerged from that stupid contraption without his shirt. OK, after his out she keeps checking him out, hardly restraining not to touch him, after witch, in the rest of the movie, she keeps on meeting with him for no apparent reason and at some point they actually kiss. Why did she like him ??? Just because he pumped himself full of steroids ? I can't recall any other reason... And, what was her role in the movie ? I can only guess that she was the army slut, having no other particular use for anyone actually. Always dressed up and wearing makeup regardless the scene, not doing anything at any point... I don't know, i just couldn't stand her. Next: That stupid Captain America. Only the name gets on my nerves. WHY WAS HE A CAPTAIN and everyone in the movie started calling him that way ? HE WAS NOT A CAPTAIN. Disregarding this, i hate seeing metr0sexuals portrayed as an icon and the absolute good guy that everyone should look up to. that's not making a film for intelligent people. it's for idiots who don't know any better. The movie: Oh man... i'm sad i can't give it a big 0. Every scene in the entire movie was unrealistic, you can clearly see the punches being thrown never actually landing (but the bad guys are dropping like flies). The special effects look like they were borrowed from the '80's made me think that i was watching a leached, unfinished movie. but no, i was watching the ""good"" stuff. nothing was convincing about them. i could have overlooked this stuff if the actual plot of the movie and the acting were any good but, sadly, they were crap also. the sequences ran so fast one after the other that i couldn't actually enjoy and understand anything. it's something like this. skinny guy gets in a machine and returns as mister universe, girl likes him, he goes out and punches some guys, returns and becomes a clown, punches some guys again, blows up a train, fights an army, kisses a girl, flies a plane, wakes up in 2011. it's like there was no pause between these events, no thinking, no brainstorming, no emotions. i don't know if the movie wanted to be an action movie, thriller, romance, all of the above, I HAVE NO Idea. i think somewhere in there was a villain with a red head who was completely useless. good thing he didn't get to America to blow it up cause he would've gotten his ass kicked even harder. the idiot invents a super gun that can destroy cities in hours.... god damn it, that stupid gun didn't do anything to anyone (i think it vaporized a couple of soldiers though, something like 2 hits from 1000 shots). how the hell would've he destroyed a city with that useless b.b gun ? oh, writing this i remember there was this glowing cube that i don't know what it was for (just thought i should mention). the dart.h vad3rs were like dumb ragd0lls with the sole purpose of dying by the ""captains"" mighty hand and idiotic shield. basically, no continuation, no story to mention of, no drama, no nothing in this movie. The last thing i want to mention... what year was the movie in ? i mean... they had absolutely everything they wanted. laser guns, super planes, super cars, what happened to evolution since then ? anyways, dumb movie for dumb people and a waste of time for me. it got a 7 average rating so maybe it was aimed at the right audience (if you know what i mean)",Captain America - The First Avenger

I would never say that such a topic, I mean American comic can be so interesting, but this is most probably related to good director.Lets say bad things: 1) music:... sorry but didn't catch me at all, additionally it was repeating all over from beginning. (1 point down) 2) could be funnier, I can imagine 3 scenes where better joke was needed. 3) Dr. Zola shows frustrationswhy 8/10: - human are support: there is not ""just"" captain America. - no exaggeration, man it's ""just"" human with muscles... no superman, no further action needed at all. - strength of will...nice, not pushing so much. - of course , OK, effect of muscles :) nice play, with women response. - Some details like Dr. Zola showing frustration to sign something (i know its in negative point also but this time I believed it) - Return to the caste Wolfenstein game: guys with suits nice - Hugo: oh Hugo, finally not just Mr. Smith. perfect. - The end: Finally movie I'm looking forward to see Avengers :)If you accept comics with small changes...definitely worth it",Captain America - The First Avenger

So I watched this movie with very high expectations.The special effects are quite good and believable. Acting and storyline is quite the opposite. This is the first A-Class movie I couldn't watch to the end in years, not even until halftime. It's so boring and long, everything seems kind of pointless. I have no idea how the last half is, but to equalize the first, it had to be something I read about in the newspapers, what I didn't.I really like Captain America and Chris Evans actually. F. ex. in Avengers (one of the best Marvel movies of the last years) everything worked, it was an awesome character. Somehow I hated him quite a while after this movie.I hope so much the sequel fixes this mess.",Captain America - The First Avenger
753,dissaorh,Boringly Correct,5,1 August 2011,"Remember when movies were fun. What happened to the epic final battle? The big show, the awesome history? Wanted to make a funny movie or a politically correct?I still remember the mood of Tony Stark in 1,2 Iromman. I remember the big final fight in Hulk 2, but each film is worse than the last. This time we have to swallow another ""stupid American movie with big budget."" RedSkull does not know fight, The Capi only do it with little soldiers, the politically correct Capi's squad not of great importance in the film, his only reason for existing is to be correct.Jose Cruz Captain America: The First Avenger- 3 ShieldsThe question has never been- ""will they make a new Captain America movie?""But rather, ""when?""The Captain is after all one of the greatest Icons of the Marvel comic book Universe and if Hollywood can make a Green Lantern movie, getting the ""Cap"" on the silver screen is a financial no-brainer. If you haven't heard, this has all been part of a master plan leading up to the 2012 release of The Avengers, that will include Iron Man, Thor, Hulk and good old Cap. Since Iron Man there have been subtle and blunt teaser moments giving winks and nods to fans all setting the stage for something bigger to come. Why is any of this important? Because this ""back drop"" to Captain America: The First Avenger is what makes it a great movie and not an awesome movie.The film begins present day with a group of explorers in the Arctic Circle coming across what appears to be a ship of some sort where they discover frozen in ice the famous star studded shield. ""We've found him"" they say and then the film quickly cuts to 1940's World War 2. Here begins the story of Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) a young scrawny man who after being seen as unfit for military service, volunteers for a top secret science experiment that turns him into the super-soldier Captain America. As a self-professed comic geek, the film does an excellent job of telling the story. When Evans emerges from the transformation process you get that wow moment as the CGI effect of making him a skinny wimp for the first half hour of the film is excellent, and now we have our hero reborn. The story wastes no time in throwing him into action against ""Hydra,"" a group of bad guys who are the Nazi super-soldiers, and now the Cap is ready to pound some swastika wearing thugs.While I can't say the movie slows down from here because it doesn't, the story doesn't seem to build the way it should for what you expect from this type of film. As a fan and sucker for all the hype I came in expecting greatness. The action scenes are good and by the time Cap gets his famous shield from Howard Stark (Dominic Cooper), you're ready for some good old American Nazi stomping and the film delivers. Coincidently Howard Stark is Tony Stark (Iron Man) dad.All the casting is dead-on. The Red Skull, Cap's nemeses is perfectly embodied by Hugo Weaving (The Matrix) but I wanted them to allow his intensity to match his costume and it's as if they didn't let him off the leash. Tommy Lee Jones does an excellent job as the tough talking Colonel Phillips and provides some great funny one-liners adding laughs throughout the film as Cap's superior officer.Critics can be too critical, especially when they have a personal connection to the subject matter (IE: Star Wars 2nd Trilogy, get over it guys), so let's be clear. I would recommend Captain America: The First Avenger to any comic book or action movie fan as you will enjoy this film. It does what it needs to do by pulling in a broader and new audience and you will feel your money was well spent. But for those of us who grew up in the Marvel world we want that final show-down to deliver. Unfortunately it is there where the Captain doesn't completely, but slightly miss the mark. For those ""die-hard"" fans, don't wait for a special scene after the credits. About half the theater did only to realize the film ended with that ""set-up"" moment and to be fair, in reflection, it was great. The Captain is the First Avenger, a worthy watch and great visualization of the hero we know and love. But ""Good Old Cap"" will leave you wanting more and we'll all have to wait till next summer when The Avengers assemble.Directed by Joe Johnston, 125 minutes, Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action.",Captain America - The First Avenger
754,Who95,Marvel's most peculiar,7,5 January 2014,"When you make a movie based on something, you have to make it independent from its source, yet not unrecognizable. That's what Johnston did with elegance and ability. Indeed Captain America is not just a nice movie amongst other superhero movies. What's mostly peculiar of this movie is its 'retro' style. It really seems an adventure movie from the 80s, due to its simple plot, soft tone and pleasant pace. It looks and sounds like an older movie with modern special effects. And those special effects are generally nice; CGI is 'less intrusive' than it is in other superhero movies. The only noticeably digital thing in the movie is the bad guy... and here's the main flaw, in my opinion. He just looks fake and inappropriate, he doesn't work... He doesn't seem as evil as he should and his character isn't well defined. Instead, the main character is greatly developed, I really liked his story and the theme of 'doing what you can with what you have'.In the end, despite its flaws, I found Captain Amercia nice and peculiar, which is a good achievement for an action movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I thought them putting Dr.Arnim Zola in it was wonderful. And Sebastian Stan did very well as Bucky.(Though I was worried)I also liked the end when Steve wakes up almost 70 years later in New York City when Nick Fury finds him. This movie is tied with Thor and Iron Man for the best Marvel movie ever! There wasn't a thing i didn't enjoy about the film.(coming from a fan)Stan Lee's cameo was pretty funny if you understand why he's saying it.

Not even Captain America has any power like super hero, a normal hero in any normal film can perform better action than that. In the whole movie he looks like not other than an ordinary man. In one scene when he coming back from rescue mission he is walking in front of people and he can't separate himself than any other man. So not a single good action scene, not even a story. But I don't know why still this movie can get 7.6 stars.

I like how it started with cap in the ice and ended with a surprise. The enemy was opposing. I like how tony starks dad was in it.

758,me-9-192451,"A setup for a sequel, not much more",2,31 July 2011,"Captain America is reasonably well acted. Set in the 1940s, there is not much firepower around, so the fight between CA and his nemesis feel very much like a bar brawl. The story is not entirely plausible at times, for instance when a bunch of super-weapons captured from the enemy with the help of CA are not used against that enemy in later battles, or in the final scene when a radio becomes the plot device to prepare for the inevitable sequel.In many ways, this movie feels like it was designed to build the expectations for a sequel that presumably will feature a stronger plot and a modern day nemesis with more heat at his disposal. I'd suggest waiting until that sequel comes out and grabbing a cheap copy of this movie then. This movie just doesn't have enough plot on its own.",Captain America - The First Avenger
759,rory-byers,A poor stepping stone towards The Avengers,3,4 August 2011,"As you can tell from the title of this review, I wasn't pleased at all. I'll try and keep it short & to the point: - How do you make a super hero look 'super'? You make the bad guy look unbeatable. This was not the case in Captain America. I have no idea what his 'evil plan' was. He had a weird obsession with a glowing box, and nothing really got explained. The bad guy needs to be a threat.And to continue the common theme that the bad guy wasn't that bad, I think I could've taken out his army. They were pathetic.The love story. This goes from a slight crush to full on love in a matter of minutes. He has a picture of her in his compass, nobody else find that creepy? - It's the 1940's. Where are they getting this technology from? They have some form of ray guns but they lock their prisoners in old rusty lock & key, metal bar cells. There's no continuity. Plus the bad guy has a super car. Please, someone explain.Why didn't the bombs in the plane go off? The only thing that kept me interested was Hayley Atwell. Chris Evans was OK. I'm sure he'll be good come the Avengers. Tommy Lee Jones was just poor one liners. Hugo Weaving was poor. Red Skull proved little threat. Sammy L. Jackson has one line at the end. Pointless.All in all, I felt they rushed it. Isn't Captain America supposed to be the leader of the Avengers? Well, for him to be the main guy, his film felt like a minor stepping stone towards The Avengers.",Captain America - The First Avenger
760,Thought_ful,Limited Potential,7,23 July 2011,"I thought this movie wasn't great but not bad either. I would categorize it somewhere in between average and good. This film moves at a steady pace and the plot points are pretty dull so there aren't any real surprises. The action is OK but at points it's borderline dumb. Your lead character is Steve Rodgers who goes from scrawny to brawny via a super serum and seemingly everything about him gets enhanced except for his personality. Big and buff doesn't translate into entertaining unless you like to frequent establishments such as ""Swinging Richards"". Chris Evans makes a pretty good Captain America but that in itself is part of the problem. Not Chris Evans but the character of Captain America. We live in a time where people want dark, edgy action topped off with a great story so Captain America and Superman really stand to suffer in my opinion. They don't have the charisma or ego as other superheroes and if a movie like Captain America isn't superbly written and/or directed, then you end up bored 80% of the time like i was. As i said, it's not bad and worth checking out if you're a comic book fan but it's not as entertaining or good as ""Thor"" or even ""Iron Man"".",Captain America - The First Avenger

From there the movie goes strait down hill. I was looking forward to a good Nazi ass kicking but all the fight scenes were corny and dull. The Darth Vader looking Nazis stumbled around and fired their laser guns a few times and ended up fighting him bare handed one at a time. The acting left much to be desired and most of Captain America's dialog consisted of dumb quotes. The main villain looked like something from a GI Joe movie and after the first hour I couldn't wait for the movie to be over. Save your $8.50 for a better movie and if you must see it wait a few months until it's in the $5 bin at the store.",Captain America - The First Avenger
762,comicguy3469,Great Movie!,10,20 July 2011,"I just got back from a special pre-screening (no they didn't show Avengers trailer but..) CA is awesome! I give it an 85 because there were some things they could improve on, but man was it awesome. I'd say Iron man is still #1, but CA is pretty dang close. It is par with Hulk and then comes Thor and IM 2. Yes I liked the Hulk, I couldn't figure out what fans didn't like about it, anyways another time. Great movie, I will for sure go see it again. I don't get why the critics are giving it bad reviews, I feel like they are now bias to comic book movies, or just don't understand what's going on in it. The only thing wrong with CA was that it wasn't 5 hours long, which makes sense, it was a little rushed, but whatever all the important pieces were there. It was great story telling, and man Chris Evans is Steve Rogers!!! The Red Skull was great too, an actual scary bad guy. And those of you who were worried, don't be there are Nazis and swastikas in it. It followed the comic almost perfectly, almost, you'll see what I mean, but I think for the movie universe it might just work out. The director did a perfect story telling job her, couldn't ask for anything better. I'd like to see some multiple emotional stories in a sequel as well as more bad guys. Anyways I'm pumped for Avengers (now we can see why CA is one of the greatest heroes in the Marvel Universe), and I will go see CA again tomorrow at midnight and again on Fri so hopefully I'll catch my Avengers trailer. This is one movie I don't mind paying for 2d or 3d, it's all about the story here.",Captain America - The First Avenger
763,raglandboy13,CAPTAIN America,10,24 July 2011,"This movie was great, the acting was very good and the story was written perfectly, the humor the action the seriousness of this film was all put together very well. This is one of the first superhero movies that is well made and actually feels like a comic book on screen. This is one of my favorite comic movies and i love that they keep making more superhero movies, when all of the marvel characters come together its going to be great, The Avengers is going to be excellent and the way in this movie how they had captain America come to the future was awesome, its all coming togehter smoothly for marvel and i don't think it could be done any better. all the movies that have been made and are part of the avengers have all been top notch, you have iron man 1 and 2 they were great, thor was very good, the last hulk was much better even though in the avengers its a different actor then from the movie, and captain America to rap it up for the avengers",Captain America - The First Avenger
764,mfaizanak,Truly remarkable,8,22 July 2011,"To be very honest, when I saw the trailers of this movie, I felt it wouldn't do the job right. I love seeing comic books being made into movies, and I will add that I haven't read many Captain America comics. But Captain America is one of Marvel's biggest characters, if not the biggest. Every comic book fan knows his amazing shield and that virtually nothing can stop the hero when he has it with him. And this is why I was afraid. Once someone would take the idea and make it into a movie, that was it. There would be no ""revised versions"" or anything of the sort. There could be new versions but that would have to be years from now. You wouldn't want a movie like this to go wrong. I saw the trailers and I felt that that was exactly what was going to happen. The great name of Captain America would be ruined by a bad movie. I researched a little bit more to find who the director was and my fears grew stronger. Joe Johnston, the man who directed films like Jumanji, The Wolfman, and Jurassic Park 3? October Sky was good but that's a drama film. How could someone like that ever make Captain America into a successful movie? I went into the theater with low expectations. Forgive me if I bored you with this intro, but I felt if I wrote a review for this it had to be necessary.You already know I liked this movie, presuming of course that you read the title of this review. It starts out with something I didn't expect at all (I'm not going to say what, and I promise I will not give any vital plot points away, just things you probably already know). After that begins the tale of Steve Rogers, a young man (boy if you wish to call him that) who wishes to enlist in the army during World War II, but finds it hard to do so because of physical problems (among others). But Steve has a good heart, and that makes all the difference. After that, well, you'll see what happens, but I'm sure you already know our little protagonist becomes a lot stronger (and yes ladies, a lot more handsome too). After having watched Chris Evans in Fantastic Four as the Human Torch, I had doubts about him too. I've barely seen any of his other movies but I obviously thought he was just a young pretty boy with not much real acting skills. But once again, I was wrong. Chris Evans is not Johnny (The Human) Torch. Chris Evans is Captain America. If you've seen Fantastic Four and its sequel, forget they ever even happened. Don't make the same mistake I did and think Evans is going to be the same as he was in his role in the two movies I just mentioned. He may not be the best actor out there, but I think he fit the Captain perfectly. Mature and serious for the matter, determined, courageous, good-hearted. Chris Evans pulled off a magnificent job. Evans became his truer self (I've seen some of his interviews and he's a pretty serious dude, but before that, I thought he was kind of a jerk based on his previous film roles). That's probably why he did this role better than he's ever done before. This is definitely his performance which will lead to him being called ""Captain America"" by little kids who see him on the streets.The movie itself was a bit serious, a bit darker than I imagined, and not very cheesy at all (thank God, that was one of my other fears). It has its funny moments, and its depressing moments. But you will enjoy it, at least I hope you will, just as I did. Most of the film's cast performed very good. Hayley Atwell was great as Peggy Carter, the rather badass British, and I enjoyed Dominic Cooper's performance as the smooth and intelligent Howard Stark (yes, Tony's dad). Tommy Lee Jones, as was expected, was great in his role as Colonel Chester Phillips, and Hugo Weaving was sinister as the nefarious Red Skull. Another excellent performer was Stanley Tucci as the almost fatherly Dr. Abraham Erskine. But I think Chris Evans did the best, maybe because I didn't expect that from him.The film has great effects, none extremely extraordinary, but they do their job perfectly. Based during the time of World War II, the movie adopted a sort of old-fashioned, 20th century style. And it works greatly. And the plot goes along just well with all of this. Somewhere in the middle, I did seem to think the movie was rushing a little too fast, but that's understandable due to length; it's longer than I thought it would be, 2 hours and 5 minutes. The film has its fair share of badass moments, moments where everything happens exactly the way you could possibly hope for them to happen. And moments where the film grabs you and makes you feel emotional, attached to the characters, especially Steve Rogers, who you stick out with from the start till the end. The hero marks the spirit of America, and has the power to inspire everyone throughout the world to be a hero, because as this movie teaches, anyone physically weak or strong can be one as long as they have a good heart.And if you've read this entire review, I sincerely thank you greatly. But don't just take my word for it. Go watch it for yourself. Gather your opinions. And don't expect this to be the absolute best of the best because it isn't. But I'm sure if you give it a chance, you'll enjoy the experience as I did.",Captain America - The First Avenger
765,tjdpa87,Another Generic Superhero Movie,5,23 July 2011,"If you thought this movie was ""awesome"" or like a "" tour de force"" or something, you are probably either 8 years old or a total idiot. I went into this movie with high hopes. I saw some trailers and i thought it looked pretty cool. Growing up I was a pretty big marvel fan. For some reason I felt that Captain America was going to be good. I was wrong, it was just as pointless and boring as all the other movies marvel has put out as of late. The movie had a good beginning. The back story was enough to make you wonder what would happen next, but then my curiosity ended as soon as Steve Rogers was dropped into battle. I'll just get to the point.My issues:1- Captain America is invincible. I can't understand why every dumb villain in this movie was just dying to fist fight Captain America. Every time CA entered a room everyone just immediately threw away their future rifles the moment they saw him. I laughed at one point when one of the hydra guys pulled out a switch blade(Use your gun idiot!). So anyways Captain America was pretty much never in danger the entire movie, he was an unstoppable ass-kicking machine. At no point did you feel he was challenged or that he might not succeed. There was little to no adversity with the exception of a guy with a switch blade and a couple incompetent cumbersome flame troopers.2- Women all over the army? And hot ones too! Maybe I didn't live through the 40's, but i'm pretty sure that these dames weren't running around with the troops firing thompson machine guns.3- Red skulls face looked like a cheap rubber halloween mask. There was nothing menacing about him or his cheap red face. Were we suppose to be horrified when he took off his mask.4- There was little to no development of Red Skull, all we know is he wants to attack everywhere. Lame.5- Those hydra troops really need to lose their salute. That whole both hands in the air thing was too much. They might as well have just all shouted ""derp"" in unison.So anyways it seemed as though the writing staff came up with some good ideas the first day, got excited, went to lunch, and never came back.",Captain America - The First Avenger

I was proved wrong, this movie was excellent. I mean the storyline was perfect and its has stuffs from Marvel. I also liked the war propaganda that you see during the Second World War. Also hope that their would be a sequel to this film instead of leaving a cliffhanger in this film like in the ending. Overall, it was an great movie to watch and I have no regret and it was money well spent. I don't know what left to say about this film except that was excellent, exciting, and action packed.

768,tnudel1,Where Are Marvel's Marvels?,6,10 August 2011,"***POTENTIAL SPOILERS INCLUDED***When I saw the second trailer for 'Captain America', I was quite excited. I thought to myself, that the casting of Tommy Lee Jones as a colonel is right on the money. Hugo Weaving as usually, a villain is a 'safe investment'.But, was it the Captain America that we wanted it to be? The answer, sadly is no. Sure, it's an OK summer movie, but nothing more. This movie does not exploit enough the potential of Captain America, and his unique background, that occurs during WWII. This movie feels like it's devoid of any true effort to make it a good one, and speaking generally, it is also the same case regarding any recent Marvel movie, except Iron Man, which was a good summer movie.The performance of the actors is solid. Chris Evans fits well to the protagonist.The usage of some futuristic armaments in this film kinda ruins it. OK, so it's a film about a super hero, but still.Anyway, it was nice to see how everything connects to the other Marvel films, like Howard Stark and so forth.So, in conclusion, i think that Marvel should make some effort next time the make a movie, because this films really underestimate the audience.But I'm sure that 'The Avengers' will be a whole lot better.",Captain America - The First Avenger

772,russo-joseph35,who the heck is Mr.India,10,15 September 2011,">>>Author: Farid_Hijab_Nadweed from LapjatI am amazed at the reception this movie gets. All you need to do is watch the Hindi movie ""Mr. India"" (1987) to understand why I have given this a rating of 2. It simply is a frame-for-frame copy. I haven't seen plagiarism so blatant in a Hollywood movie.Even simple scenes like showing the doctor the bathroom, the dogs in the car, the experiments for a US army Super Soldier program, the cheesy background green screen in most scenes, are straight lifts. All Joe Johnson (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids) and his team has done is to hire translators instead of screenplay writers.Welcome Joe Johnston to the ever-burgeoning group of 'inspired' directors, whose poster-boy is Mr Sanjay Gupta(Oldb..and reservoir...ahem..Zinda and Kaante fame) Mr America is a direct frame-by-frame copy of 'Mr India', a sweet and fun movie that could only come from India. Sentimental, silly and melodramatic, it also handles the superheroics amzaingly well-- way better than something like Mr America. When will filmmakers start giving credit to the original movie makers? Its one thing to use a story as a framework and foundation, but here even the screenplay is copied. The sad part is people who haven't seen 'Mr. India' hail this movie. Shame on the director and producer of 'Mr America' for not acknowledging the source of this movie.Mr America beats everything what people like Joe Johnston and Chris Evans have done before. I truly hate them because of this monstrously bad piece of s***. However, watch the Hindi movie. Highly recommended. <<<<No offense but, Captain America is a classic...and this movie was a descent portrayal of the comic, just in more detail, which was the 1940s.Can Mr.India predate that? If not..it sounds like they copied him, the characters are descent, and you could totally see Arnim Zola horribly disfigured in sequels and using the same actor. lolI'm loving the build up to avengers..I cant wait to see it..I'm so stoked, people are acting like it's filler/fodder or a cheap imitation of something, that's ridiculous. see the moviecap rocks bring on the avengers finally some justice",Captain America - The First Avenger
773,TeamSjonnie,"The action is not good, it is really boring with dumb enemies.",5,20 October 2011,"It was kinda a true letdown, a 7.1 usually means a pretty decent movie, well this one isn't.I won't go into any specifics, but would point out all that makes this movie a disappointment.1. The enemies feel like those in the ""A-team"" TV show. They don't form any challenge, they are just in the way, all you need to do is shove them away, it is that easy. Basic rules like, take cover, don't run around in the open they have never heard off. It was like watching one of those childhood action movies, only those had better action.2. The jokes... Dear God, even in life and death situation, when every second counts, the directors couldn't resist having the actors spit out some lame punchline while the action pauses for a few moments. More annoying than humouristic. 3. Plot and relationships are too simplistic, too predictable.4. Would like to point out again, the action is bad, because the enemies are too dumb for their own good. It's like watching the best football players in the world playing a game against your grandparents.This is one of the worst Marvel Movies I have seen, and I hope this isn't an indication of what the next Avenger movie is going to be. I still can't understand why this movie got a 7 on IMDb. Blows my mind, I think it has something to do with the name of the hero and his costume, I mean I would love this movie if his name was Captain Holland, that would be hilarious. :)",Captain America - The First Avenger

776,Klas3176,Something Deeper?,9,6 December 2011,"It is obvious that Captain America is an enormously popular flick, and although there will always be people who find some fault in one aspect or another, just looking at the numbers makes it clear that this movie strikes a chord in the hearts of a good majority of Americans. Many people have already given their opinions on the movie itself – whether or not it follows the original storyline well enough, or whether or not the characters were believable enough – and I have nothing novel to say on that point. However, I do want to point out some of the themes that struck me within the movie because I firmly believe that Captain America's popularity springs from something deeper within it. We've seen Hollywood spit out one action flick after another, but not all of them have the same appreciation, so what's the deal with this one? Captain America's action scenes are cool but they're really not any more stunning than the next movie, it has comedic elements without being overly funny, and there is very little in the way of sexual material to grab the audience's attention. No, I think the reason for Captain America's popularity lies in its themes of character and sacrifice.In Steve Rogers we find a scrawny little guy with one goal in life: to serve his country with honor. We see in the opening scenes how Rogers possesses an irrepressible inner drive to be a part of the war, but it is not for himself, his desire is completely selfless. ""Men are laying down their lives,"" he tells his friend, Buckey, ""how can I do any less?"" The plot makes it crystal clear that Rogers is chosen for the super- soldier program for what is inside him – his character – and the success he experiences throughout the movie are accomplished because of his selfless determination to do the right thing no matter what. Could it be that audiences find it so easy to root for this guy because they recognize the value of character, or the value of doing the right thing? Although many people want to assert that nobody can tell you what is right or wrong, the response from audiences to a guy who selflessly and consistently does the right thing tells us otherwise.Similarly, the theme of sacrifice seems to connect quite a bit with us as an audience. All throughout the movie, Rogers is sacrificing himself for others. When the only opportunity open to him is to be a performer in a ridiculous suit, he swallows his pride and takes it, sacrificing his dream to be a part of the army so that he can support the troops in any way possible. Of course the biggest example of Rogers' sacrifice is the ultimate one he makes at the very end, by laying down his life to save the city. Could it be that people love Captain America so much because they recognize the beauty of the sacrifices, especially the ultimate sacrifice he made? Could it be true that, ""Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends"" (John 15:13)?I know some people may not want to believe in ""antiquated"" or ""overly religious"" ideas such as selflessness, moral character, and sacrificing ones self for others, but when we watch movies like Captain America, I think we start to understand that these things really are imprinted in our hearts. Captain America gets high marks from me; it is first-rate in its quality and quite deep in its themes.",Captain America - The First Avenger
777,carv6482,Captain America,10,7 December 2011,"First of all it was about time for Marvel to make Captain America's part in the Avengers. I have been waiting for a long time now. One thing I loved about this movie was that it followed the comic books almost exactly. When I see movies like this I am always a bit weary of how close they will follow the comic. Captain America presents a man who is beat up and stepped on mercilessly through his life. Also, after he gets his power the viewer is expecting him to step on other people mercilessly. However, this is not the case. Captain America proves to be the same person on the inside no matter what happens to him on the outside. This story reminds me of David and Goliath. Before David went up against Goliath something extra ordinary happened. The old king of Israel was going out and there was a new king that needed to be anointed. When the priest came to find the new king God directed him to David (who was the youngest of his brothers and watched sheep). The priest was not going to even consider David, but God said in 1 Samuel 16:7, ""The LORD does not look at the things man looks at. Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."" This truth is still the same today. God does not care about what is on the outside (Ex: cars, money, and a house). God cares about if you are choosing to follow his son Jesus Christ.",Captain America - The First Avenger

You're too occupied with the bravado brass and string orchestral music to notice that realistically no one would smirk with an explosion in the backdrop. You'd be on your knees trying to take up as little area as possible. Many questionable logical flaws. Oh boy. So much to overlook, just to enjoy this movie. The best part of this whole freakin' movie was the sexy actress. She's so hot. Little to no realism in the context of battle or physics though. You have to totally give yourself up to imagination, letting many considerations slide. Also, not a shed of blood in the entire movie except for a couple of scenes.

I thought the movie would be close to the comics without too much of a plot and very jingoistic. However, the movie actually covered this aspect of the comic in a very original light and 21st century style that I was more than pleased with. It really tried to emotionally connect you to Captain America and his plight as a character rather than depict him as a ""Superman"" hero.

When Steve Rogers finally gets accepted he becomes an experiment so that Steve can achieve maximum human potential. What is so great about the movie is that Steve Rogers never gave up on his dream to serve his country, even after being on stage and earning his name ""Captain America."" For me there is not enough words to explain how amazing this movie is!I know people might think that I am totally crazy when I say that I am an absolutely massive fan of Captain America, in my eyes I am his biggest fan. He is so honorable and brave. Captain America's costume is SOOOOOOO COOL, not to mention the shield which i am in love with. People are gonna say to me, it's only because you love Captain America that this movie is your favorite,but i don't care because i know that's not true.In the movie, the acting was to an absolutely amazing standard. The actors and the characters were so perfect and meant to be. Chris Evans was PERFECT for the roll of Steve Rogers, Chris Evans is an amazing actor and I would give anything to meet him and hand out for a while.At the moment Captain America: the First Avenger is my favorite movie because of too many reasons I can't explain all of them.

I have seen Iron man 1 and 2, bits and pieces of both the Hulks, Thor, The Avengers and of course this movie and they were all great bot there's no doubt that Captain America: the First Avenger is the best out of all of them!This review probably wasn't that great because it was my first, but thanks for reading!!!",Captain America - The First Avenger
785,ilovevbgirls,Horrible Cast,1,8 August 2012,"Why would they cast the guy who already played a super hero in the movie ""The Fantastic Four"" as another super hero. GAY! Out of all the super hero's Captain America is by far the worst. He has virtually no powers and a stupid shield. Maybe they'll do us all a favor and kill him off in the next Avenger's early. NTM he is dumb as a bag of rocks. They need a replacement super hero. One of the best parts of the Avenger's movie is when Iron Man verbally clowns Captain America. I refuse to see the actual Captain America movie. Horrible casting! I overheard that they were supposed to cast ""Curt Angle"" from the WWE as the initial Captain America. That would have been a little better. IDK I think they are flopping with the Spiderman cast's and Captain America's cast. It was almost as bad as when they cast ""Halle Berry"" as Catwoman or Storm. PFF! The woman they should have cast for Storm is the actress Iman. She is even from the continent Africa and looks way more like Storm. Who is the casting directors on these projects? Do your homework!",Captain America - The First Avenger
786,Kcanario,The first Avenger,10,9 November 2012,"Marvel entrainment has made yet again another great movie Captain America: ""The First Avenger"". The setting isn't just during the time of WWII but it is also during the 2012 era. This movie is yet both enjoyable and filled with action making it a very interesting and fun movie to watch.The starts in a WWII setting with a unfit or a ""weak link"" soldier played by (Chris Evens) that volunteers for an experiment with scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine played by (Stanley Tucci). The serum plus the experiment transforms him into a super soldier. And he decides to put his ""powers"" to good use for the military as Captain America. He embarks On many secret missions to try to stop Germany from Taking over the world.For this movie it is around 125 minutes and I personally think Joe Johnson did a very good job on directing this movie and the actors and actresses did an outstanding job. The story board very interesting and long but intriguing. Over all I think that the movie and the cast, director, producers and editors did a very good job overall. Furthermore, Captain America is a great movie but in some scenes it will get boring at times. And some of those boring scenes they will sometimes be very long.Adults may think that comic book movies can only be for kids, but there is many action scenes within this movie. This movie can be for every one like kids that like comic book movies,adults that like the time line and seniors that like World War II. In conclusion, Captain America was a very good movie but there was some boring scenes but overall it was a outstanding movie. What will happen next? Maybe Captain America will be in another movie with someone like Iron Man or the Hulk.",Captain America - The First Avenger
787,jjjdevbackup,not the dark knight but a fantastic action-comic-book movie,8,19 December 2012,"like all marvel movies i made the case of seeing this film in the cinema and not waiting for it to be released on DVD/blu-ray, and like all other marvel movies i went to see it with my close group of friends and among ourselves the movie has been decused many times. captain America is the retelling of the ""comic classic"" origins story of the loved hero captain America and in a somewhat common marvel movie style with a few twists and changes that alter the story but with the up-most loyalty to the original work. the movies style is not that of Christopher Nolan's dark knight trilogy and although the three movies are enjoyable this doesn't make captain America bad. captain America excels as what it is an action movie with essence and story (i am willing to admit the development of characters in the story is not as strong as in other movies, this is disappointing as much of ""caps"" development was cut from avengers). Nolan's movies or story driven to the core but doing movies like this is not alway good movies would not be as big if they were all citizen Kane a ""three hour"" duration that completely engulfs you and your concentration making it a bad film to go see with your friends when your looking to see some explosions and action. i also disagree with the other site of the coin with movies like Micheal bay travesty transformers which was explosions, some teasing of flesh and the selling out of a loved children's cartoon for nothing but finical gain. the movie picks up rather slow but convincing we meet Steve rogers/captain America in a movie theatre watching a war propaganda film of the day were a local jock type man taunts and laughs at the film the small rogers then engages the boy in a fight out side the movie theatre refusing to give up the losing fight until he is saved by his best friend Bucky who has just signed up to join the war effort. the sign is probably the most important of rogers early development showing his over commitment to defending what he believes in most (there is also a little cheesy foreshadowing of the use of a shield. as the movie progresses it is revealed that rogers has attempted unsuccessfully many times to enlist. following the story Steve eventually meets a scientist who gives him power etc. read the synopsis if you want to now. the movie introduces the villains hydra and red skull. and a montage of the war years follows.then following the death of a good friend ""cap"" jumps on a bike provokes a high paced action sequence, gets the girl and saves the day not before making his own sacrifice, re-awaking in the modern day a few weeks/month before avengers. the movies villain red skull was wonderfully portrayed and i would once again love to see him in the role if he didn't express his complete dislike of the idea. thourgh-out the movie he always wells menacing comparable to a dilled-back Hannibal lector completely in control, overly intelligent and with some super powers and Nazi stuff threw in just for fun his plan holds solid as he wants to take over the world but believes everyone even Hitler is unfit to lead. the characters back story is never explored in-depth only hinted at making it promising for a return of the villain.RATING: 8/10 the lose of marks is as followed 1 point was lost by the movies commitment to the avengers project the usage of the cosmic cube allow justified and necessary for the film to fit into the franchise, cap is also the most under developed character in avengers even more than hawk-eye and black widow, these two character don't reserve a lot of explanation put are very shallow and not as complicated as cap and thourgh- out avengers he feels like "" that guy you met twice at a get together and you know where hes from and a bit about his interests"" and were meant to follow the character with up-most confidence.Another mark because of the movies genre allow i respect the genre and its working i cant a movie full marks on the grounds that it looks pretty.",Captain America - The First Avenger
788,coltonmock,Fun to come back to watch,9,26 March 2021,People got very angry when this came out as many decisions happened to lead to continuity in the MCU. Obviously well thought out and the plot lines were necessary and still shine through the newer movies and tv shows.,Captain America - The First Avenger
789,zander-nico,Captain America is a New Kind of Superhero,8,19 February 2013,"""The serum amplifies everything inside, so good becomes great; bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because the strong man who has known power all his life, may lose respect for that power, but a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.""Captain America: The First Avenger is the superhero origin of Steve Rodgers' transformation into Captain America. The movie is set in the 1940's during World War II and Steve Rodgers has the desire to fight overseas just like the rest of the men in the United States. There is one problem though, he is a 90-pound weakling who doesn't look like a soldier, yet he has the heart of one. Director Joe Johnston's Captain America: The First Avenger is a stripped-down superhero movie that focuses on character development rather than superpowers. The script for the movie lets the lead characters take center screen. The plot not only focuses on Rodgers' transformation, but also revolves around the conflict between Captain America and the villain Red Skull. A common quality that Red Skull and Captain possess is the serum that they were both injected with, yet they decided to use the strength they were given in different ways. Captain America could be symbolized as a young, developing America, while Red Skull portrays a similar character to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler. Chris Evans gives a believable and realistic portrayal of a persistent and gutsy Steve Rodgers. He walks, talks, and fights like a soldier. The emotional depth of the character is seen when Rodgers decides to risk himself in order to save others. His depiction of the underdog that evolves into a superhero is worth rooting for. On the other hand, Hugo Weaving gives a strong performance as Red Skull. The character viciously manipulates his followers' thoughts in his conquest to take over the world by speaking down to them as if he is a god. By emphasizing the last word in a phrase and then taking a dramatic pause, Weaving is able to get into the heads of the audience through his diction and annunciation. This creates a confrontational relationship between the hero and the villain. For fans of traditional superhero movies, this movie may not fit the standards because it doesn't contain common elements associated with this genre. The character of Rodgers is developed in order to focus on him rather than relying on a suit like Iron Man, the money that Batman has or the mutations that X-Men possess. Rodgers doesn't need all of the flash and gadgets that other superheroes of our era have because he is innately a hero. He doesn't have much of an advantage over others, but is able to pursue his dream in an unconventional way, which isn't anything like the superhero movies the audience is used to today. He puts himself out there even though he has many weaknesses. It makes the viewer think about what the ordinary person can do with the abilities that they possess to help out others.",Captain America - The First Avenger

In this mind i would say that the story behind captain America is quite fascinating and makes a bit sense.The connection with world war 2 makes it more like realistic.Though this whole hot female has a crush with captain America was really unnecessary.I would say the film could make you want it progress and the two hours go by really fast Overall there are better superhero movies with a deeper meaning or with better screenplay etc but you must it in order to see the rest of the series and to understand better the whole superhero universe,Captain America - The First Avenger
791,TheBlueSaint,A Superhero Film That Isn't Ashamed of the Hero.,10,31 December 2013,"Most of the critical reviews of this film fault it for the very thing that makes it special. They criticize it for acting and plot when it's obvious what they really can't tolerate is the message. It's entertaining rather than dark; exciting rather than dismal and engrossing rather than self important. Unlike the common trend it portrays a hero that is self-sacrificing rather than self pitying. Who is more concerned with others than himself. This doesn't fit with the current fad for heroes who are borderline psychopaths as likely to snap and end the world as to save it. The people who hate this film are the ones who think a brooding, self hating Batman is ""realistic"" and avidly follow a meth-dealer's descent into violence and madness. Brave, honest and self-sacrificing don't carry the cool-cachet of brutal, psychotic and self-absorbed. This is a film with an actual hero rather than an anti-hero. Someone you wouldn't be afraid to find yourself alone with in an elevator.For some reason actual heroes offend certain people. They claim they're not ""real"" enough; they don't reflect the frailty, deceit and brutality of actual people. They seem to be insulted by a portrayal of a person who is more noble than they are. Who challenges their vision that somehow we're all corrupt if you look deeply enough. They claim that the movie is clichéd; as if the lonely hero sitting sullenly gazing over the city is somehow fresh and insightful. They criticize the acting as if Chris Evans' squeaky clean Captain America is somehow more contrived than Christian Bale's neurotic Batman and Hugo Weaving's Red Skull is more over-the-top than Heath Ledger's manic Joker. They're criticizing the medium but what unnerves them is the message. I wish I understood why.There is one other vein that runs through the critical reviews. It's too overtly American. As if that is by its very nature a flaw. They feel that Americans should forever dwell only on the mistakes of recent years and forget any achievements of the past. To begin and end all things with a spoken or unspoken apology for the very act of being American. This is as myopic as blind patriotism. There is no shame in highlighting the ideals towards which a great country should strive.But back to the film. If you want to feel exhilarated; to feel good about being alive when you're done viewing a film; if you want a film that has humor and soul as well as violence and mayhem watch Captain America. If you want to leave a film wondering whether simply being human is somehow a burden; as if it's all just a long solemn slog unto the grave watch another, more ""realistic"" hero film.",Captain America - The First Avenger
792,marievasseur-mx,Excellent film despite a defect relief,9,7 March 2014,"While U.S. soldiers enlist to fight Nazi Germany, Steve Rogers is seen constantly repressed into military offices. Considered too weak and full of flaws, the army refuses to incorporate the young man has only one desire, to do his duty. Spotted by a scientist, his pugnacity will be rewarded and he will find himself involved in an experiment whose goal is to create super soldiers. The film retains the origins of the hero without changing the time. So, it CAPTAIN America wins a special character, keeping apart from other adaptations set in a contemporary registry. Because the character of Captain America was born during the Second World War and it will therefore participate in the fight against the Nazis. If the action should prevail, it remains that the story takes its time, especially in its first part, to give us a hero stuck in a puny body before turning his transformation. In this respect, one can acknowledge the work on the special effects that helped to give Chris Evans musculature and small body. If the effect is deliberately exaggerated, the result is stunning. And that makes all the more credible physical metamorphosis hero. However, even if the hero gets great power, it will become a patriotic mascot before taking things in hand to actually turn into heroes. All this part of the story turns out to be the most successful of the film. For the rest, we must be realistic, there are very redundant in the world of superheroes and a relatively predictable path themes. Everything else, no matter what happens, very friendly. If it can possibly be frustrated to see the debut of the hero, after a successful first mission sent in a few images, CAPTAIN America manages to bring moments of pure comic. In the genre, the attack on the train or the last game are real success stories. Similarly, a lot of shots of the film reflected the beauty and strength of comics illustrations as when the Red Skull, with his true face, catching the cube in his hand at the end of the film. Finally, the real disappointment CAPTAIN America is the relief. Because, once again, wearing glasses is more an annoyance than an asset. Fortunately, the end credits really anime embossed retro images. Apart from this drawback, CAPTAIN America : THE FIRST AVENGER proves a very great success in recent adaptations.",Captain America - The First Avenger

794,tomsharp96,Captain America The first avenger Review,8,2 May 2014,Captain America The first Avenger is a great marvel film packed with a huge story line from start to finish. This film creates and disembarks captain America from being a small skinny man to a heroic looking strong man with super human strength and and stamina enabling him to be one of a kind. This film revolves around world war 2 between America and the Germans (Nazis)also known in the marvel film as hydra a well adapted deep science division of the Nazi army.There is thrill at every corner of this film with a true American hero background this is also used in the film as captain America in his suit is used as a advertising purpose at the same time as being a American war hero.Red Skull is the main mortal enemy in this film who was a Nazi leader in the organisation and falls to the hand of captain America in the ending scenes as he sacrifices himself to save the world freezing himself in the Atlantic and then later to be found in new York 60 years later.Overall an amazing film with a captivating story.,Captain America - The First Avenger
795,e_93gsx,Captain America – Same old song and Dance,6,10 March 2012,"Captain America is a comic book movie the presents itself like a comic book movie. That is not necessarily a bad thing but it can grow old. The director Joe Johnson directed another comic book movie that was so much better. The Rocketeer, also directed by Joe Johnson, is movie that draws inspiration from comic books without making the mistake of becoming a comic book movie.Here it is simple the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad. Though the bad guys start out as a special division they are still just Nazis but you would never know that looking at them. Absent are all the swastikas and normal Nazi uniforms. Sure everything looks Nazi-ish and you know it is WWII so there is no doubt they are Nazis ,they even succeed in mentioning something about Hitler, but it never manages to feel real or scary unlike Joe Johnsons other movie the Rocketeer which used Nazi symbols, uniforms and weapons prominently. Anchored with that reality the Rocketeer feel so much more ""real"" even though both are movies that derived from comic books. From there it only gets more unreal. The weapons the bad guys carry are science fiction laser weapons. Very hard to pull off in a WWII war movie and here it just feels like a Saturday morning cartoon. Yes they bad guys had advanced technology but why go that route? With such an unreal movie why not try and keep it as real as possible.On a side note I have to mention something I thought was really dumb. One of the soldiers fighting with Captain America wears a ""bowler hat'. Nothing is wrong with that. But when he puts his sergeant chevron on it and uses it as part of his official uniform that is the kind of stuff that keeps it a comic book movie. Sure that is a little thing and maybe it is nitpicking but it doesn't help any with trying to give this movie any reality cred. If it is going to be a comic book movie why not embrace it and have The Captain throw out some cheesy over the top pro-American one-liners? He is Captain America. It brings to mind the scene from the 80's G.I Joe cartoon movie when Sgt. Slaughter is punching a bad guy and with the last punch says ""And this is for the U.S of A!!"" Bam! The guy gets punched. Cheesy yes but that is the point. They are both super American patriots.I can't end this without talking about his uniform. Although I am a comic book fan and do read many of them I must confess I know very little about The Captain. In my opinion his uniform was close enough to what is in the comics that I like it. I guess they could have done worse with this movie and in all actuality I didn't hate it but it is hard for me think of it as anything other they just another comic book movie.",Captain America - The First Avenger
796,dj_jeff2000,This is the Cap movie I've been waiting for!,9,25 July 2011,"Spoiler: We open in modern day, where the powers that be find good ol Cap frozen in ice.End of Spoiler: Jump to the 1940s. Sickly Steve Rogers, played perfectly by Chris Evans, is once again submitting his application to the US Army. Turned down again. His close friend Bucky Barnes tells him that he true calling is here away fro the war. This doesn't dishearten Steve and when he sets out to give it another go he is recognize and given a chance by Dr Abraham Erskine(Stanley Tucci) and as they say the rest is history.Director Joe Johnston does an amazing job bringing Captain America to life on the big screen. I felt that he brought over a lot of the feeling he gave The Rocketeer and applied it to this movie. Johnston has some hits and misses but the one movie that stood out in my head was The Rocketeer, so I knew that I could trust Joe Johnston to do Cap justice.There have been many incarnations of Cap between the big screen and the small screen, all I have felt fell very flat. Once this movie starts it never lets go and you will never feel bored during this picture. What the writers and the director have done was able to pull Captain America right from the comic book pages and bring him to us on the big screen. They stay pretty true to the comics, making some adjustments here and there to make it adaptable as a movie. The relationship between Bucky and Steve is altered slightly and handled a little different than in the comics, but the way they handle it works well in the confines of the movie.Hugo Weaving is absolutely amazing as the Red Skull. Once he reveals himself as the Red Skull my jaw dropped. He looked exactly like I expected. He plays the part well and makes the Skull one feared villain.The look of the era is very authentic right down to the hair styles. Johnston really took his time and paid attention to the minute details of the time period. Costumers look great too and I loved how they even got the original Kirby shield in the movie. The effects were well done, with only a couple parts that looked a little spotty in a couple of areas, but fans will be pleased when Cap dons his costumer and starts slinging his shield.Fans of Cap will not be disappointed with this film. This is one of the best super hero experiences I have had in the theatre. Oh and in case if any are wondering. Stay until after the credits for a surprise. You won't be disappointed. Is it May already? Bring on The Avengers!",Captain America - The First Avenger
797,solidsnake790-1,A good summer flick even if you know the Captain's Origins and Story,8,22 July 2011,"(NOTE: CA = Captain America) Growing up I didn't read many Captain America comic books, but through cartoons of various incarnations in regards to Captain America, I knew many of the things already. Knowing all of this I still enjoyed the movie. Though I will mention my two friends that went with me and knew very little about CA enjoyed it a little bit more because there were a few more surprises for them. Of course this is no Dark Knight, very few if any superhero movies are but I can tell you that this to me was better than the recent X-men first class, which I also enjoyed. This was also better than the two Iron man movies because the character is more relate-able in contrast to Iron man's rich playboy with everything becomes a superhero.Chris Evans fits in perfectly as CA and as one other reviewer also mentioned, He is a much better CA than he was as the Human torch. You take to heart the evolution of his character from a scrawny kid from Brooklyn to one of America's greatest heroes. The supporting cast is also an awesome supplement, especially Tommy lee Jones' and Stanley Tucci characters. The movie takes liberties with the history of WWII, but just pretend this is taking place in an alternative universe (which most of these movies are anyway) and you will be fine. Overall this a good movie to go to if your are into superhero movies with a lot of action, which with respect to few CGI, seem realistic(in terms of movie action).I watched it in 2D because let's be realistic, the only movies I would like to see in 3D is Avatar because it was hyped as an awesome 3D movie.

800,hdg-53311,Good movie,9,28 November 2015,"Although there are two more Captain America movies, Captain America : The First Avenger is the first big budget movie about Captain America. It was released in 2012, directed by Joe Johnston and starring Chris Evans. It is a well-reproduced movie in that it has a great plot.The movie is set in the 1940s during World War II. Steve Rogers(Chris Evans) is a man who wants to be a soldier. However, because of his physical weakness, he is rejected every time he applies. One day, he is recruited as a candidate of the Super Soldier project because of his diligence and willpower. As a result of a secret experiment, Steve gains overwhelming strength. He uses his strength and his trademark vibranium shield to fight against an evil German organization named Hydra, led by Red Skull(Hugo Weaving).The best thing about Captain America : The First Avenger is its well-knit plot. The story sets out from Steve Rogers' weakness, which makes his transformation outstanding. After the birth of Captain America, there are his heroic fights, and finally comes the final battle. All the parts of the story make a perfect storm that keeps audiences immersed in the movie. However, the supporting characters' importance is quite low. In my opinion, It would have been better if sub characters had taken a more active role. For example, Howard Stark(Dominic Cooper) should have appeared more as the maker of the vibranium shield.Despite this minor defect, the story is still appealing in that it perfectly vitalizes Captain America's heroic aspect. It might be said that it is very hard to make such an old character appealing to modern people, but the story of this movie admirably achieves that.

I have no clue what they were attempting to do here. Iron Man was not at all what you would expect the witty, humorous rebel Tony Stark to be and the additions to the group was a bit much, could have left the red suit out. As for tying it in with the rest of the films this had a very small piece of the overall game plan to bring them all together. The action and humor that you have come to expect from the Marvel films was minimal at best, it was as if they were working with a serious budget.

805,bfox-60657,"Even though this is ""By the book"" Plot, IT's CAPTAIN AMERICA",8,20 April 2020,"Yeah I understand the plot wasn't super deep. There were a lot of cheesy dialogue. But it was one of the few cases it worked really well. One could argue that the ""addition series"" to the MCU helped me enjoy the movie greatly. On its own it would be weak. And maybe that's true. Still that doesn't make it a bad movie by any meansCaptain America has always been the ""goodest"" of good guys. But Chris Evans pulls it off, the short man who gets turned into a super soldier and goes on to help troops in WW2. The bad guy is a Nazi. What did you expect? Any other plot device would be weird and unnecessary. This movie also has rewatch factor. How many Oscar movies are re-watchable. Maybe a few here and there. This movie sticks to the script and there is NOTHING wrong with it.In fact if you look closely this really isn't a paint by numbers plot. Captain America doesn't get a super happy ending with the girl. It takes him literally winning the battle to prove his worthiness.Where the movie shines is C.A. where still the main character is relatable. Agent Carter is always professional, and Hayley Atwell lights up the screen. She's a perfect choice for Agent Carter and I think is an underrated actress, and even a bombshell to be honest (personally i had to say it, but she is gorgeous and her body type fits the time period).There's good struggle plot, an awesome Hugo Weaving performance just playing the bad guy, not being too evil, but not too dull either. But oddly I thought the choice to go basic works. He has an evil sidekick...etc. It works for this movie.In summary I give this a range from 6 to 8 out of ten. I give it an 8 because of its re-watch factor, its a family movie we can all enjoy. And yes some of the dialogue hits the funny bone. And Sebastian Stan is very underrated as James Barnes who rightfully becomes one of the best villains of the MCU as the ""Winter Soldier"".In summary, this movie is good, It's not oscar worthy, but it does its goal of portraying Captain America as a super clean guy who does his duty for his country. It sticks to the point. Plain and simple. And I liked it, and I don't think it's as dull as people make it out to be, but I understand that point of view",Captain America - The First Avenger

807,kennedymckay,Captain America: The First Avenger,10,20 March 2017,"Under the direction of Joe Johnston, Captain America is a film that changed Marvel and action films forever. This film begins with Steve Rodgers being declined from his request to enter the military, due to various health issues and size. As Rodgers attempts to enlist again, he is granted the opportunity to be put through a series of tests to see if he is the most eligible to become Captain America. While he does not exude high levels of athletic ability, he demonstrates a superior level of knowledge during the tests and is given the ""super soldier"" treatment, which consists of a serum and extremely powerful vita- rays. Rodgers then transforms into a near- perfect human and given a shield, his signature relic. Captain America's main motive in this film is to find the Tesseract, an ancient artifact that contains inconceivable power. As this harmful relic was brought into the earth on accident, it is Rodger's job to eliminate it. Once he discovered that Johan Schmidt, a World War II Nazi officer, held it captive, Captain America made it his mission to recover it, as Schmidt planned to use it as a weapon to wipe out massive cities and groups of people. On Captain's mission to destroy Schmidt and the Tesseract, he discovers that Schmidt is a villain who is given the name, ""The Red Skull"". Rodgers, Bucky Barnes, one of Rodger's friends who was in the military, and a few others that he recruited to be on his team attacked the infamous Hydra Base, Schmidt's Nazi division, in an attempt to eliminate his project and ensure that he does not follow through with his plans. After Captain and his team attack and succeed, Rodgers seeks out Schmidt's final Hydra operation to finally secure the Tesseract. This film is one that is constantly keeping the audience on their toes and has a defined plot and motive, which are key elements of any good film. Since this film is indeed an action film, the viewer expects that it is filled to the rim with action scenes, and this film definitely does not disappoint. Because of its story line and ability to attract various audiences, this film is one that almost anyone can enjoy. In this film, there are many different character roles that ultimately impact the plot and outcome of the events that take place. Steve Rodgers, or Captain America, is undeniably the most important and prevalent character in this film. Rodgers starts off as a weak and scrawny young man who wants to enlist in the military. Because of his appearance, he does not seem to exude much confidence in himself, until he is given qualities and physical characteristics that make him at the peak of human perfection, which completely change him as a person. Although he does not have any actual ""superhero"" qualities, he becomes one of the most perfect human beings, exuding agility, speed, endurance, and power. Steve is undeniably a stubborn person who has often prefers to take on tasks himself, but also has a soft and caring side, which are key elements of any good hero. Although Captain has many huge decisions to make in this film, his morality continues to shine through, as he is a person who values integrity and ethics. Rodgers is seen in this film looking after his friends, such as childhood best friend, James ""Bucky"" Barnes. Barnes is known for being honest and an overall good person. He looks out for others and is loyal to those that he cares for. Johan Schmidt, or The Red Skull, is Rodger's primary enemy in this film. With injustices, such as stealing the Tesseract or holding hundreds of people hostage at his military base called Hydra, he is known for being immoral, unjust, and egotistical. The protagonist, Captain America, and the antagonist, The Red Skull, are clearly stated from the beginning of the film. The characters in this film not only add special elements to this film, but to various other Marvel films, such as the Avengers film. While this film contains many messages for the audience to understand and take home, Steve Rodger's perseverance and character is the most prevalent and important in this film. In the beginning of the film, the men who are trying out to be Captain America are put through multiple tests to see who is the most honorable, eligible, and intelligent for this position. The first test that the men are put through is to get a flag from the top of a flagpole. While all of the other men are struggling to grasp the flag and climb the post, Steve quietly observed. Once the Sergeant tells them to move on, Steve casually steps up to the post, pulls out the pin that holds the post to the ground, and as the pole falls to the floor, he picks up the flag and hands it to the officer. This event shows how much intelligence that Steve had, and that the smarter ones always out rule the athletic ones. The message from this little event in the film is that it is okay to not have the most athletic ability, as long as you know a way around it. Many young boys or girls can find hope in this because it is made known that anything is possible. Steve Rodgers is an inspiration to many people because he started from the absolute bottom, and eventually climbed his way to the top. This film is especially important for young people to watch, as Steve's story is inspiring and can motivate others to always find another way.",Captain America - The First Avenger
808,obervlt,My Intro Into MCU - Not As Bad As I Thought!,7,4 July 2019,"The start of my marathon to watch all of the MCU movies in special chronological order to get to the Avengers: Endgame, ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" is the lowest rated MCU movie in my watch list. I will be honest, I watched it in two sessions, half and half. Still, looking at the 6.9 Rating at the moment of this review, I expected something bland and boring.I am pleased to say that this movie is up to my standard of recommendation, although it's not something I would re-watch. Without spoiling it, I would just say that watching it requires a lot of suspension of disbelief (even for a superhero movie), and I didn't quite like some design choices and very-modern looking tech which looks completely out of place even in the context of the story. The pacing was probably a bit off, because even though it has a lot of action, some parts seemed a bit boring. On the other hand, we have a solid, even if fantastical, plot, a decent hero and memorable villain. I must add that I am intrigued by the epic tale which just begins to unfold and I can't wait to see what's coming next.",Captain America - The First Avenger
809,shadyabdallah-72563,The change of era,8,8 September 2018,"I actually liked the movie so much, but the story was so expected.
About the change of era, I didn't like as it was so sad for someone to quit his love..his friends..his whole life to live in another era.",Captain America - The First Avenger
810,alexak-26311,Great acting!,10,28 August 2018,"May not have been the most action packed movie, but it had far more real acting and story line than 90% of the other super hero action movies. Chris Evens, Sebastian Stan, Hayley Atwell were great. The entire cast was well rounded and fit the movie in every way. Movies like this are usually more special effects than story which is really sad because the characters are what the movie is about not the giant explosions. As far as super hero movies go this one is one of my top favorites. Well worth watching.",Captain America - The First Avenger
811,erikskog-69115,Great introduction to Cap!,7,15 September 2018,"This was a really good way to introduce Captain America to the MCU. 
They really captured the emotions and Steve's love for the country in this movie. 
I also like the introduction of the suit. With bringing back both the old classic suit from the comics and also making the suit more ""military like"" for when he gets into action. Overall a great rendition of the Cap. Great job Marvel!",Captain America - The First Avenger
