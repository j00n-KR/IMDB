0,MartinHafer,"Frustrating, as the film is enjoyable BUT could have been better.",7,10 April 2019,"""Shazam!"" is a frustrating film to watch. On one hand, the film tries to be more a kids' superhero movie...and excellent idea since this would help the film to stand apart from the bazillion other superhero films. But, on the other, the film has some rather adult content...making it not especially appropriate to younger viewers! So, it seems like the case of a film where the filmmakers weren't exactly sure what direction to take with the project.Billy Batson is a troubled orphan who has run away from foster home after foster home after foster home. Inexplicably, he's bestowed the superpowers that enable him to become Shazam*.....a seemingly odd choice. At first, Billy uses the power to make money and is a bit of a jerk....my favorite parts of the movie actually. Later, however, when a supervillain attacks, it's time for Billy to grow up and accept responsibility for his actions.As I mentioned above, although the film is about a kid superhero and his young companions, it also features a lot of cursing, inapproriate contenxt AND a cursing/vile Santa Claus! I honestly think the film project must have changed the focus of the film and it really seems that it's like two movies in one...and should have been one. Still, it is entertaining and, at times, quite magical...though at others it is less stellar and needed a bit of an editing.",Shazam!
1,bkoganbing,A show for kids of all ages,7,29 July 2019,"My only previous reference to Shazam! is the 70s morning TV series that Michael
Gray and Les Tremayne starred in with two different actor playing the adult Captain Marvel. It was shot on a shoestring budget with Gray and Tremayne wearing the same clothing every episode.No budgetary expense here was spared in Shazam! the movie. We get some background on the teen Billy Batson who is in a group home in Philadelphia and
wants to find his parents. He's not a bad kid, but a mischievous one who is the
troublemaker for the adults at the home.One fine day he's contacted from an alternate world and given the power of a
superhero. Which he's fine with, but not sure how to use. Asher Angel is Billy
and the adult superhero he can transform himself to is Zachary Levi. Watching
Levi as the adult is like watching Adam Sandler. Maybe the producers tried for
Sandler originally.Things go great until he runs into a super villain Mark Strong. It seems back
in the day when Strong was a kid he entered the same realm, but was rejected.
Now he's back having aligned himself with demon forces.Shazam! for all its technical wizardry is a show for kids of all ages. By the way
no name for the superhero is decided so you will not hear Captain Marvel.That comes in a sequel I'm sure.",Shazam!
2,Leofwine_draca,A little different from the norm,6,3 January 2020,"SHAZAM! is the latest superhero outing in the DC Universe franchise; this one takes a noticeably lighter, more kid-friendly tone than the previous instalments. It's generally a light and likeable affair, a superhero spin on the whole VICE VERSA body swamp storyline. The CGI effects are fairly good and more than adequate for the genre, and the storyline makes some fun nods at the 21st century obsession with social media. I wasn't too keen on the sound of the kid humour in this, but it retains the wittiness of other modern superhero outings, so it's not too bad at all. Mark Strong can be relied upon to deliver a good baddie as well.",Shazam!
3,SnoopyStyle,fun with some clashing tones,7,5 July 2019,"In 1974, young Thaddeus Sivana is rejected by the wizard Shazam and indirectly causes the accident which cripples his father (John Glover). Thaddeus (Mark Strong) grows up obsessed with returning to the Rock of Eternity to confront the wizard. He's tempted by the Seven Deadly Sins and they escape. In Philadelphia, foster child Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is obsessed with finding his mother. He is taken in with other foster kids and befriended by disabled superhero-obsessed foster brother Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer). With his last act, Shazam calls in Billy and declares him the new champion. Billy learns to be the superhero Shazam (Zachary Levi) with Freddy's help as Dr. Sivana tries to take Billy's magical powers.This has its fun. Zachary Levi delivers a performance from the little boy inside him. It has all the elements of a children's comic book superhero movie. It's good. As an adult, I have an issue with Billy Batson. He seems to be inhabiting two different characters. On one hand, he's a smirking carefree prankster. On the other hand, he's a troubled closed-off child with mommy issues. Those two personalities are sometimes on the screen one after the other and sometimes even at the same time. I do like Shazam as a scared child or as Josh in Big. I also love the surprise of the other Shazams. While Freddy does get on my nerves sometimes, I do love the eventual relationships of the foster kids. Overall, this is a fun superhero movie despite the clashing tones.",Shazam!
4,Prismark10,Not a marvel,5,19 July 2019,"Warner Brothers decided to brighten up their DC range of superhero movies after accusations of dreariness.Shazam! who started life as Captain Marvel once upon a time tries to have some irrelevance of a Deadpool movie but remaining kid friendly although its tone is uneven. Those school bullies should had been toned down and made more comic.As a toddler in Philadelphia, Billy Batson got separated from his mum and has been looking for her since. Although it never crosses his mind that she has not been looking too hard for himA teenage Billy Batson (Asher Angel) goes through one foster home after another. He runs away from them all to search for his real mother. In his latest foster home he has joined a diverse range of foster kids including disabled foster brother Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer) who is into Batman and Superman. Freddy gets bullied a lot and Billy helps him out. His selfless actions brings him to the attention of a wizard losing his powers.Billy gets new magical powers from the wizard but is not told the extent of his powers. Together Freddy and Billy learn what this could amount to but Billy uses Shazam to make a quick buck first until Thaddeus (Mark Strong) shows up. He is powered by the seven deadly sins and wants Shazam's magical powers.For a film released during Easter, the Christmas setting signifies some kind of last minute reshoots or re-editing. It certainly takes too long to get going and some of the Thaddeus as a kid scenes looks oddly inserted. Like many other superhero films that origins part affects the pace of the movie.The film improves when it gains momentum, that is when Shazam tries to realise the extent of his powers and confronts Thaddeus. It might have helped if the wizard told Billy what his powers were.",Shazam!
5,claudio_carvalho,Silly Even for Grown-up Children or Teenagers,5,7 July 2019,"The overrated ""Shazam!"" is a disappointing adventure where the humor never works since the storyline and the screenplay are silly even for grown-up children or teenagers. Maybe the target audiences are little children that are capable to give a ten to such a turkey but for adults it is almost unbearable. The special effects are maybe the best this forgettable movie can offer. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Shazam!""",Shazam!

The film is light and funny most of the time. Very entertaining even if it is hokey.",Shazam!
7,kosmasp,Captain Marvel,8,21 June 2019,"I'm pretty certain I'm not the only one using that summary line. And it is not because any of us are Marvel (Cinematic Universe) fanboys - well I guess it is sort of true in my case, can't talk about the others. But just to the effect that I really enjoy the movies they put out. It is not that I prefer the comics from one publisher more than others.And back to the summary line: Shazam was once called Captain Marvel! A long long time ago. He wasn't really that popular and Marvel Comics did not exist at that time. Now I won't bore you with more details (you can look them up online), I merely gave you a nudge to pursuit and look for an interesting story.Talking about interesting story: this is quite an achievement and we finally get the right amount of scary action (though one particular scene might cross the line at a meeting to the dark side) and the humor. As in trying to find a name for our super hero, but also on how he reacts to his powers and his interactions and so much more.So the right amount of everything make this a very entertaining movie - I think it didn't quite translate at the box office, but whatever the case was (I didn't check the numbers), the movie is good and the rating at least displays that at the moment (close to what I am giving it)",Shazam!
8,classicsoncall,"""If a super-hero can't save his family, he's not much of a super-hero!""",7,6 September 2019,"Finally, the DC Comics franchise managed to inject some humor into one of their super-hero projects. A lot of it works, though the story line is merely so-so, as the target audience appears to be well below the age of the average DC based film which is darker in tone. With that in mind, it probably would have been a good idea to temper some of the language to make it an all around, better family friendly picture. I didn't care much for the character of young Billy Batson (Asher Angel), his personality didn't seem right to be selected as the 'chosen one'. I actually liked his foster brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer) better; he seemed to have some of the qualities, and even the looks of the young Fred Savage in ""The Wonder Years"" television program. It probably comes as no surprise that the release of this picture around the same time as ""Captain Marvel"" would confuse comic book fans who thought both Captain Marvel and Shazam were one and the same character. It even had be puzzled for a while when the titles were announced, but changing story lines, ethnicity and genders is nothing new for comic book writers looking to push the envelope on transforming existing characters. The picture is pretty well balanced between the comedic aspects of the players and the threat posed by the evil Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong) and his Seven Deadly Sin allies. The foster home setting at the center of the story was a good one to demonstrate how kids in that kind of environment can learn to overcome their circumstances and achieve personal goals and fulfillment; in that regard, teenage Mary (Grace Fulton) was a perfectly good role model. I don't know that this film would lead to an even more effective sequel, though one of the credits scenes hinted as much. I did like the final scene after all the credits rolled in which an in joke was leveled at Aquaman's expense, and the final clip in the movie proper ended things on a high note with the appearance of a faceless Superman. When the film makers follow up on this one, it would be a good idea to maintain the same sense of fun this one had.",Shazam!
9,lee_eisenberg,"corny, as it was intended to be",5,6 December 2019,"""Shazam!"" is one corny movie. I have no doubt that they intended it as such. While it has most of the stuff that commonly appears in superhero movies, a noticeable difference here is the positive depiction of the foster home. I figure that someone wanted this portrayal in contrast to the negative depictions of foster homes that we often see.Overall, about what you'd expect.",Shazam!
10,BA_Harrison,Shazaverage!,6,12 April 2019,"Teenage foster child Billy Batson (Asher Angel) dreams of being reunited with his mother; being a superhero couldn't be further from his mind. But that's what he becomes when an ancient wizard (Djimon Hounsou) chooses him to be his successor, endowing him with super strength, lightning fingers, invulnerability, and the power of flight. Unfortunately, Billy's new ability to turn into a muscle-bound hero (played by Zachary Levi) whenever he says 'Shazam!' coincides with the appearance of a supervillain, Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong), who was rejected by the wizard as a child, and who has spent the rest of his life looking for a way to seize the powers he was deemed unworthy of.Shazam! is DC's attempt at a lighter, more humorous approach to the whole superhero schtick, something I wholeheartedly approve of, not being a big fan of the grim and gritty Batman/Superman films of recent years - but it isn't wholly successful. Billy discovering precisely what he is capable of in his hero state is reasonably fun, his amazing antics documented by his disabled foster brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer), but when Dr. Sivana enters the picture, the film becomes little more than a mundane superhero flick, full of CGI-driven smackdowns, but little in the way of originality. At well over two hours long, it soon starts to feel more like a chore than a pleasure, especially with much of the intended comedy falling very flat.As with the majority of superhero films, Shazam! is cleaning up at the box office despite its faults; I just hope they try a little harder with the script and the action for the inevitable sequel (which looks set to feature a talking caterpillar called Mega Mind).5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",Shazam!
11,paul_haakonsen,Shazam!,6,13 May 2019,"Granted, I can't claim to hold much of any particular interest in the superhero genre, yet I have seen almost every single one put out there so far. Why? Well, because I enjoy watching movies and given the chance, then I will definitely watch a movie or at least give it a chance.Turns out that ""Shazam!"" was actually entertaining, well at least for what it turned out to be. It wasn't a superhero movie that took itself all that seriously. But then again, I am not familiar with ""Shazam!"" or the tone used in the comic books. But for me, as being unfamiliar with it, then it was adequate entertainment to watch a boy turn into a grown up and gain super powers at the blink of an eye.It was nice to see a superhero movie that didn't turn dark and brooding, like the Marvel movies have a tendency of doing. ""Shazam!"" was what it was, a superhero movie mixed with some comedy.The acting in the movie was good, and I think that Zachary Levi, playing Shazam, actually carried the movie well with his charming appearance and his demeanor. He definitely made the movie more enjoyable for me. I've always thought that Mark Strong was a good actor, and he was quite nicely cast for the villainous role in the movie.As for the special effects, yeah, it is a superhero movie after all, so of course it is going to need special effects. And yes, the CGI and special effects people definitely delivered something that was quite pleasing for the eyes. I liked what I saw here.The combination of comedy and action superhero genre was actually working well in favor for ""Shazam!"" and if most definitely made it more bearable and enjoyable for me to sit through a superhero movie.So after the movie ended, is ""Shazam"" a superhero that I want to watch in more movies? Well, not particularly no. He was fun for what it was, and that was about it. But I can't really imagine a whole series of movies with this character.Definitely a watchable superhero movie, but not a particularly outstanding one.",Shazam!
12,preppy-3,Very OK,7,29 April 2019,"Foster kid Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is given super powers by an ancient wizard. When he says :""Shazam"" he transforms from a 15 year old kid to a 30 something muscular super hero (Zachary Levi). However he's still a kid emotionally. Then he has to battle the evil Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong)...but he's still a kid inside.I wanted to like this movie more than I did. It has great special effects, the acting is good (even though Levi overacts more than once) and the story is OK. However it moves VERY slowly (Shazam doesn't even show up until almost an hour in), its morals are questionable (we're supposed to find it cute that Shazam is drinking beer and stealing from an ATM machine) and the final battle goes on forever with too many superheroes and villains. Also the bullying some kids go through in this is way too brutal. One crippled kid is knocked to the ground and kicked around! So I honestly did not like it too much. It's just too long.",Shazam!
13,CinemaSerf,An easy watch for the easily pleased....,7,26 November 2019,"It depends on what you want from the film as to whether or not you will enjoy this. I knew nothing at all about the Shazam character, I just wanted a couple of hours of distraction at the cinema on a wet Tuesday night. I got it! It is a well put together, light-hearted superhero film. It doesn't purport to be anything more sophisticated and that's just as well. It has no depth to it at all, but Zachary Levi delivers in an enjoyable, slightly comedic, throw-away little movie and Mark Strong is just about evil enough as the baddie. Sometimes simplicity is all that is required.",Shazam!
14,zardoz-13,"Fast, Funny, and Furious!!!",8,30 April 2019,"The road that most comic book superheroes take to reach the silver screen is usually straightforward. The latest character to enter the ranks of the DC Extended Universe, ""Shazam!,"" emerges as a major exception to the rule. Indeed, the Shazam character began life as none other than Captain Marvel! Now, this revelation may surprise everybody who loves superhero movies. After all, didn't ""Captain Marvel"" appear recently as the newest addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Sure, she did, but the history of the character goes back further than you might imagine. Initially, the original Captain Marvel had nothing to do with either Marvel or DC Comics. Instead, Fawcett Comics created this character and ushered it into print in February 1940. Captain Marvel's popularity proved so prodigious that before long Fawcett's superhero surpassed the sales of the then invincible champion of costume-clad crimefighters: DC Comics' Superman. Not long afterward, however, DC sued Fawcett for copyright infringement, and Fawcett had to cease publishing ""Captain Marvel.""What a complicated trajectory for a superhero's reawakening! In the late 1970s, Marvel Comics acquired its own Captain Marvel, but he shared little in common with the original Captain Marvel. Actually, Marvel's first Captain Marvel was a man, before he became a woman. Meanwhile, DC Comics appropriated the old Captain Marvel from Fawcett. To avoid the prospect of yet another breach of copyright, DC changed Captain Marvel's name, opting for the magic word ""Shazam!"" that fourteen-year old foster child Billy Batson--uttered before he could transform himself into this formidable adult superhero. For the record, DC Comics bought the character from Fawcett in 1972 and then rebooted him in a 2011 graphic novel. Moreover, DC Comics kept Captain Marvel's pristine scarlet red outfit with a jagged lightning bolt across his chest. Interestingly, the first theatrical superhero chapter serial was Captain Marvel! Indeed, ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" (1941) beat both ""Batman"" (1943) and ""Superman"" (1948) to the silver screen.As an origin epic, ""Shazam!"" charts a new direction for DC superheroes. Just as ""Deadpool"" stood the Marvel Cinematic Universe on its head, ""Shazam"" has done something similar for the DC Universe. The extraordinary thing about this new entry is that he literally qualifies as a superhero without a clue. Runaway juvenile Billy Batson (newcomer Asher Angel) ends up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a new foster family, but this doesn't dissuade him from pursuing his dream. He wants desperately to find his long, lost mother (newcomer Caroline Palmer), and he does. Alas, she wants absolutely nothing to do with him! Whereas Superman and Batman lost their parents respectively to a doomed planet and a homicidal maniac, Billy loses his mom because she no longer wants the responsibility of raising him. Of course, it is traumatic to see your folks shot dead in front of you or learn afterward that your folks perished when your home planet blew up. Imagine how devastating it must be to have your own mom disown you! Billy turns out to be an ideal candidate to replace an ailing, ancient-looking Wizard (Djimon Hounsou of ""Amistad"") who stipulates that his successor must be someone pure of heart. No sooner has Billy uttered the magic word ""Shazam"" than he finds himself empowered beyond belief. By the way, Shazam is an acronym for the six immortal elders: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. After he winds up in his new foster home, Billy hangs out with an obnoxious, crippled, foster kid, Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer of ""It""), whose vast knowledge of superheroes enables Shazam to catalog his powers.""Lights Out"" director David F. Sandberg and ""Earth to Echo"" scenarist Henry Gayden take an exhilarating, tongue-in-cheek approach to the material. Shazam (Zachary Levi of ""Thor: Ragnarok"") and Freddie are in a convenience store when two hooligans hold the cashier at gunpoint. Freddy dares them to shoot the shenanigans out of Shazam with their firearms. Struggling to appear casual, Shazam accommodates this suicidal challenge. Happily, the bullets all bounce harmlessly off his spandex costume. Afterward, Freddie urges them to blast away at Shazam's face. Similarly, the slugs rebound off his mug! Ultimately, the short-sighted Shazam doesn't exploit his vast potential to serve the best interests of society until the super-villainous Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong of ""Green Lantern""), arrives to confront him. Silvana covets Shazam's powers, and he is prepared to do whatever is necessary to wrest those powers from him. Shazam doesn't know how to defend himself against somebody so consummately evil because at heart he is just a teenager! Sivana quickly opens our hero's naïve eyes. As an adversary without scruples, Dr. Sivana is the epitome of wickedness, and Mark Strong delivers a bravura performance bristling with menace. Earlier, Sivana had a crack at those same super powers when he himself was a juvenile. Unfortunately for him, the Wizard found Sivana lacking any semblance of innocence. Nevertheless, Sivana embarks on several examples of supreme savagery before he suffers his comeuppance.Predictably, our immature hero comes to grips with his qualms and demolishes his antagonist when Sivana threatens the demographically diverse members of his foster family. ""Shazam,"" however, qualifies as more than just another standard superhero saga. Zachary Levi's sidesplitting performance as Billy Batson's alter-ego Shazam works splendidly because Levi doesn't try to be funny. Shazam behaves like a deer paralyzed by car headlights. At first, he fears Sivana and flees in fright. Eventually, Shazam realizes he cannot tolerate Sivana's anarchy. Ultimately, Billy--who had sworn the other kids in his foster home to secrecy about his identity--shares his power with them. These suddenly mature kids with costumes and super powers not only thwart Sivana's evil aims, but they also chastise two insufferable bullies at school. More than anything else, ""Shazam!"" succeeds chiefly because of Levi's endearing portrayal of a charming but clueless superhero. Sandberg and Gayden duplicate all the traditional superhero tropes, but they provide such spontaneity that what might have seemed stale is now fresh and funny.",Shazam!

16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Magic, indeed",8,7 April 2019,"Billy Batson(Angel, charming, snarky, ultimately sweet) has gone from one foster home to another. Now he's put in a group home. And if the characters and pathos therein don't stir up any emotions in you, you are made of stone. At first he resists becoming part of their family. In his mind only blood relatives count. And his mother is still out there. And when he finds her everything will be perfect again. Over the course of this he grows to be more responsible, more caring, and opens up. A wizard(Hounsou, determined if aging) finds him pure of heart, even though he disagrees with that assessment. As such he is made the champion. Given the abilities of ancient gods. Put in the body of a grown man. Faced with this fantastical set of circumstances, he does want any of us would do. Any that are teens or in contact with the inner child, that is. He shows off, charges people for selfies, and buys beer and does other things only adults are allowed to. Meanwhile, Dr Thaddeus Sivana(Strong, sinister) has spent almost half a century trying to find the man who deemed him unworthy. Something his brother and father were already calling him regularly. When he does, he unleashes the Seven Deadly Sins, creatures made up of nothing but evil and mostly convincing CGI. Honestly it's only really when they are touching a live action element that it looks dodgy. These two superpowered people are the only ones who can injure each other. Who will win?Given the tone I would only show this to someone 13 or older. It simply gets too graphic, scary, intense and disturbing at times. Also, there are jokes that push it to that level, though none going as far as those of Deadpool. They have slightly different audiences, intentionally so. This does subvert expectations and have a lot of fun with its concept. Hilarious from start to finish. It is also an incredibly big-hearted film. Among its beautiful messages are ""while nobody's perfect, if you find someone who loves you, you should give them a chance"". Good and Evil is not a matter of what you can do, rather, it's about what you choose to do with what you have. The climax is grander and more effects-driven than what came before. I completely disagree with those that say that it then becomes exactly like lesser movies like it. It went in a direction I didn't see coming, and I felt was hugely satisfying, building on elements that had been given a lot of attention.I recommend this to anyone that finds the core idea even remotely appealing. 8/10",Shazam!

Getting set to go Manchester again to get Easter presents, the comedic ads caught my eye,and led to my second IMAX viewing being a call of Shazam!View on the film:Following James Wan in going from the world of The Conjuring to the world of the DCEU, director David F. Sandberg's horror sensibility shines through,from Sandberg and Alexandre Aja's regular cinematographer Maxime Alexandre giving the opening a dark and stormy night appearance, snarling, demonic gargoyles and baddie Sivana dressed in black with an eye on unleashing Seven Deadly Sins. Conjuring the villains from Horror, Sandberg wonderfully contrasts the look of the baddies with the bright, animated sparks of Shazam igniting a bubbly mood.Whilst blue bolts and floating things do appear, Sandberg zaps them aside by giving the slick action scenes off-beating settings, such as the thunderous final battle in a Christmas market. The first Shazam flick since 1941, the screenplay by Henry Gayden & Darren Lemke flies over the DCEU mythology and lands on zig-zag gags snapping pics at the fun of having superpowers. Matching the more serious Horror edge from Sandberg, the writers make the gags land by smartly making Shazam's search to be part of a family be the sincere spine of the tale. Backed by deadly sins, Mark Strong gives a delicious turn as Sivana,with Strong cutting thick slices of ham as Sivana pounds Shazam into the ground. Two sides of the same hero, Asher Angel brings a warmth to Batson being a loner, whilst Zachary Levi captures the excitement that grips Batson when he says Shazam.",Shazam!
20,FlashCallahan,A very deceptive trailer......Not for children...,6,17 April 2019,"Billy Batson is a foster child who is proving a nuisance to Child Services with his search for his mother.In his latest foster home, Billy makes friends with Freddy, and finds himself selected by a Wizard to be his new protege.Now with the ability to instantly become a superhero by saying the films title, Billy begins to explore his new powers with Freddy.But Billy soon learns that he has an equal enemy, Dr. Thaddeus Sivana, who has accepted the power of the Seven Deadly Sins instead.Now pursued by Sivana for his own power as well, Billy must face up to the responsibilities, and realising that family can be important....Going by the trailer, you'd be forgiven for thinking that Shazam! would be a homage of Big and the current slew of comic book movies we have has since Stark first graced our screen.DC more or less promised that this was the brighter side of their Universe, and the trailers promised that also, but my goodness, this has some very dark scenes, and connotations to the nuclear family that give the film a dark tone throughout.The first 50 minutes of the film is way too long, and could have done with trimming at least the opening Gambit of Sivana as a child. This set the mood for the entire film, and stayed with you until the end. Potentially, it does make Strong appear as a more formidable foe, but a little flashback would have sufficed, so we could have spent more time on the 'fun' stuff.And when we do get to Levi, the film does go up a gear, but again, it spends too long with the Queen song and the bumbling around with the super powers, which made it feel like a more comic 'Chronicle'.Strong is good in his role, but as I've said before, some scenes with him in are very disturbing, and feel out of place for a film that should have a much more lighter tone.For a universe that is universally panned because it's not Marvel, DC have taken a massive gamble with Shazam, and it sort of pays off, with some fun references to other films from the DCEU, and it does pick up after an hour, but that opening sequence is really too dark for this film.Good, but it takes far too long to get to the meat of the story.",Shazam!

I was also excited to see that Dwayne Johnson was going to be Black Atom. Well, I got saddened to learn that he would not be in this film and even more depressed when I learned that they were going to recast Henry Cavill as Superman as this just highlights the problems DC has had trying to bring a shared universe to the big screen. They recast, they plan to make a new Batman series not in the shared universe and a Joker movie and they have so many television shows of their characters. They are watering down their own universe and this is why Marvel will continue to chug along while DC will crash when they flip in new cast among Gal Gadot and Jason Momoa confusing viewers as to whether it is a continuation or something new. This film, thankfully, stands on its own quite well. Sure it exists within the DC universe, but you needn't see any of the other films to enjoy this one.The story has a young Billy Batson having trouble fitting into foster homes as he desperately tries to find his mother. Well, after he takes up for one of the kids at his new home he is brought into the realm of the wizard Shazam whom grants Billy his powers as a last ditch effort because the seven deadly sins have entered a man obsessed with finding the wizard after he was deemed unworthy of being the keeper of Shazam's powers as a child. Billy uses the powers a bit for his own gain, unsure how to control them, but is forced into action when Dr. Sivana and the deadly sins inside him wish to eliminate Shazam so that none can stand before him!The casting is rather good, I found it a bit strange that they got Mark Strong to play the villain in this one as he also played Sinestro in the Green Lantern film where he never got to be the main villain in the non existent sequel to that film. Zachary Levi plays Shazam here and he does a pretty good job, although it is obvious that the costume is the reason he has the muscles in this one. the child actors all do a good job in this one as well.So, it was a good film, would have enjoyed it more had they included the Rock as Black Atom in this one. They introduced another Shazam enemy though that is a bit more obscure so I am guessing he may be in the sequel making me wonder if Black Atom is going to be in any Shazam movie, which considering DC's track record I can see them totally screwing up and not adding him. These Shazam movies are going to have a short shelf life though as the kids are going to get older, so it may be a one and done due to DC's like of vision. Which is a shame as it looked like they were beginning to get on a role with Aquaman before they started the lets recast Superman stuff.",Shazam!
23,Mr-Fusion,From Hard-Knock to Hero,8,29 April 2019,"Cannot begin to tell you how hyped I was for this movie; primarily for Zachary Levi in the lead role. He is absolutely fantastic in this, and embodies the story's light-hearted side while the character struggles to reconcile all-powerful hero with (at-heart) unprepared kid.That's what I loved about this movie: it's a touching portrayal of a teenager who's been dealt a crappy hand and now has the means to live it up -- or accept his role as someone who's supposed to help. The cast is uniformly great, it's got a decent villain, and the effects are first-rate for the film's feel. There's heart and soul to this movie, and it plays like an antidote to the DCEU's unnecessary darkness.It's a great time.",Shazam!
24,siderite,The most Marvel DC movie yet,6,27 June 2019,"They tried with dark and brooding and it didn't work. Not because it wasn't cool, but because it wasn't smart, but that's besides the point. DC had made a lighthearted movie about a kid that discovers superpowers and has to use them kindheartedly against a petty all evil villain who only wants death and pain. And if it sounds cliche, it's because oh it so painfully is. OK, it's lighthearted, but it's very very dumb. At no point did I make any connection with any of the characters. Because of the cretinous script and the silly performances the only person I really cared about was Mark Strong's character, who sometimes slipped the evil mask and was clearly having fun, but still did a better job than all the other actors combined. The direction, I think, was OK. Who would have thought that the creator of the short videos torturing poor Lotta on YouTube was going to direct a DC movie? Watch those for more plot than this film had.",Shazam!
25,lasttimeisaw,"a scathing sideswipe to humanity is borne out of the story that it virtually takes centuries to search for one individual who is truly ""pure at heart"", are we really doomed?",7,1 July 2019,"This latest DCEU enterprise proves to be a box-office lightweight compared to its predecessors, but ""lightweight"" is exactly the operative word here. SHAZAM!, the superhero origin story directed by horror genre practitioner David F. Sandberg (LIGHTS OUT, 2016 and ANNABELLE: CREATION,2017), constructs it distinctive lightweight tonality that goes diametrically different from DCEU's tried-and-tested idiom pervaded by relentless darkness and solemnity.Given that the protagonists are a bunch of school-age foster children (inclusivity is attentively put into action), SHAZAM!'s tonal shift seems rather apt, no globe-trotting saving-the-world agenda, astral or deep-ocean monarchally familial rivalry or off-putting, swaggering anti-hero riffraff, the story can be boiled down to a teenager's rite-of-passage of looking for a real home, which does not derive from bloodline, but non-related kindred spirits, meanwhile everyone is having a whale of a time!A superhero's mask is superseded by his/her adult alter ego, adolescent Billy Baston (Angel) is chosen by an ancient wizard (Hounsou) from another dimension, as his successor, and bestowed with his almighty power, by enunciating the magic word Shazam! (the wizard's own name), he can alternate physical forms between his usual self and a towering superhero (Levy), whose multiplex arrays of superpower have been continuously tested by his best friend and foster brother Freddy Freeman (Grazer, sometimes too attention-seeking in front of a more reserved Angel), disabled and geeky in superhero stuff (of course, DC comics only).Actually Billy's ascension to a super-being is a last-ditch move from the desperate ancient wizard, after a bad apple, Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Strong), who in the prologue, is deemed unworthy as the wizard's chosen successor when he was a child because he is not ""pure at heart"", then years later, vindictively steals the Eye of Sin and becomes a human vessel of 7 sins after defeating the wizard. Now, Sivana is bent on acquiring Billy's bequeathed superpower, and eventually he will wreak havoc on, not the entire city of Philadelphia, but moderately, a winter carnival.Playing tongue-in-cheek jokes at the drop of a hat and amusingly teasing its genre platitude, SHAZAM! is a small-scale (the bus rescuing scene cannot hold a candle to Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 2's sensational metro escapade, which is made 15 years ago), family-friendly (6 foster kids with different characteristic traits and an almost-perfect pair of foster parents), and innocuous funhouse ride that everything diligently plays to the gallery, from adult actors play-acting their inner kids (including Strong's one-trick-minded villain panache), to a laidback atmosphere only marred by several horror tropes (the visualization of the grisly 7 sins and the boardroom massacre). Visually adequate for its ilk, for a casual viewer (not a diehard comic book fan), SHAZAM! is too endearing to hold any grudge against. En passant, a scathing sideswipe to humanity is borne out of the story that it virtually takes centuries to search for one individual who is truly ""pure at heart"", are we really doomed?",Shazam!

29,Robert_duder,Benefits from low expectations,7,28 April 2019,"I think it's no secret that Marvel has a stranglehold on the Superhero genre and DC tries very hard to keep up but for the most part has failed. It seems to me that DC is usually successful because people aren't expecting much and then it delivers in a decent way. That seems harsh but it's also true. Who expected Aquaman (arguably one of the worst superheroes) to be a watchable film? Shazam looked and sounded silly period. The fact is that it's a fun, magical, zany, cute action comedy that ends up being mildly entertaining which makes it seem better than it probably actually is. It definitely has a different vibe than some of the others in the genre and that's a breath of fresh air for certain. 2019 is jam packed with superhero movies and Shazam might be one that stands out because it's different. Zachery Levi (huge fan since Chuck) really does a great job in the lead role of playing the fish out of water but also the kid in the superhero's body. The cast of kids all have great roles although they aren't exactly fleshed out throughout the film. Jack Dylan Grazer is especially good as Freddy and has great chemistry with Levi. Mark Strong plays an okay villain but I feel like he could have done better with a stronger script. Shazam is a lot of fun and it's light and fluffy and deserves a watch. 7/10",Shazam!
30,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Say his name: Sandberg!,7,6 April 2019,"David F. Sandberg is shaping up to to be quite the director. After proving himself in the horror genre with both 'Lights Out (2016)', his debut, and 'Annabelle: Creation (2017)' (another franchise course-correction), he has burst onto the big-budget blockbuster scene in style with what's easily DC's best live-action post-'The Dark Knight (2008)' picture to date. In fact, 'Shazam! (2019)' at its worst is far better than even the very best of the prior entries in the 'DCEU' (or 'Worlds Of DC', was it?). Its success, I feel, almost all boils down to two simple things: character and joy. Of course, neither of those things really are simple, which is why so many movies miss the mark on them. In terms of character, the picture makes a point of painting its central children as precisely that: kids. They're immature, innocent and error-prone, which makes them prime candidates for character arcs. This, obviously, most keenly pertains to our protagonist, who gains the body of a hero far before he gains the heart of one. His arc is an expected but satisfying one that's actually somewhat unique. Even if the film is never as emotionally resonant as you'd perhaps like, it always makes the right decisions - and, even, takes some risks - when it comes to its characters and their relationships. You care about them all and really want to see them succeed, to see them learn from their mistakes and bond as a family - a dynamic which helps the piece immensely overall. When it comes to joy, the flick has you covered. It's often properly funny and nearly always manages to make you smile, both thanks to its heart and its smarts. It actually deconstructs some superhero tropes in subtle, world-appropriate ways and this makes it feel quite 'realistic', or grounded, in proportion to a lot of similar fare. There are moments of pure delight (mainly during the 'power testing' scenes) and, on the whole, the affair is always fun. This is true even when it takes some of its darker turns, of which there are a few. It's surprisingly 'edgy', in a way, and isn't lacking in its 'horror' aspects (thanks solely to Sandberg, no doubt). These sequences are successful, although the creature special effects aren't as convincing as the superhero ones, but often clash slightly with the overall tone; still, they're peppered throughout the piece so that they aren't too jarring and that their culmination doesn't feel like a typical 'superhero finale' but instead like the proper conclusion to the narrative. The finale, too, is surprisingly well-handled, given the track-record the genre (and DC, in particular) has. It's always legible, has a number of decent twists, includes the film's best joke and finishes the narrative off nicely, to boot. It's a great end to a great piece, even if it can't quite replicate the brilliance of the earlier aforementioned 'power testing' scenes. In the end, the movie is pleasantly surprising and genuinely good. It seems to me that all DC had to do was say his name: Sandberg! 7/10",Shazam!
31,bowmanblue,It brings out the kid in you,7,16 October 2019,"Superhero this, superhero that. Someone gets super powers and ends up fighting an evil version of themselves with similar abilities. If you've seen one (recent) superhero movie then you've probably seen them all and it gets to the stage where you start to wonder if there's anything new a film company can bring to the genre. I'm pleased to say that, despite following most superhero cliches, 'Shazam!' has enough going for it to make it definitely worth a watch.Ignoring the fact that it was originally meant to be part of the (possibly now deceased?) 'DC Shared Universe' (remember 'Batman vs Superman, Suicide Squad' and all that?) you don't really need to know much about any other film to 'get' what's going on here. A young boy attains magical powers from a wizard (as you do) and, every time he says the magic word ('Shazam!' just in case you hadn't guessed), he's changed from a weedy fifteen year old high school lad to a spandex-clad muscular hunk.Now, if you've been following what was supposed to be DC's attempt at a 'shared universe' you'll know that they tried to make themselves different from Marvel by being 'darker' and 'grittier.' Well, 'Shazam!' isn't like that at all. It actually feels a bit like one of those 'family' movies from the eighties, as if it's part of a 'Goonies' shared universe than the 'Man of Steel.'Having a child as the star can always be a bit hit and miss, however Asher Angel actually pulls it off and is quite believable in the role, even before he transfers leading man duties to Zachary Levi for the 'superhero moments.' We have veteran actor Mark Strong as the baddie who has the previously-mentioned 'similar powers' as Shazam. He's naturally a good actor, therefore he plays the part well. However, just like the light-hearted tone of the film emulates Marvel's output, so does the lack of real development and motivation for the villain.There's plenty of laughs and a great use of Queen's 'Don't Stop Me Now' (possibly even better than 'Shaun of the Dead' used it), however, for those of us who noticed, the computer-effects are a bit ropy and probably could have been a little more polished. But that's just a minor gripe. Ultimately, I reckon youngsters should enjoy this film and not notice the - slightly in-your-face - message about 'family,' choosing instead to simply go along for the ride. For the adults, there's plenty of mocking of superhero movies and it's quite fun to picture this film in the same world where Batman and Superman have become marketable brands.It may not be the greatest superhero movie of our time (and certainly not the most original), but it nicely crossed the divide between a film for adults and kids and if you're in the mood for something light and fluffy after the darker 'Infinity War/Endgame' pairing, then you can happily lose yourself in a world of magic and wizards for a couple of hours.",Shazam!
32,ThomasDrufke,Huge Win for DC,8,5 May 2019,"My initial concern about Shazam! is that it wouldn't take itself seriously enough. Whether it be Guardians 2, the Ant-Man Films, or dare I say the Fantastic Four films, I've never been a huge fan of the comic book films that lack earnestness and try to make a joke out of everything. The trailers for Shazam! were lackluster to say the least, and I never found myself excited for its release, which is perhaps a product of being merely a few weeks before Avengers Endgame. Alas, Shazam! is an utter blast. It's every bit as earnest and fun as something like Aquaman while displaying more heart than I originally thought. Zachary Levi was great as the titular hero, and I even liked Mark Strong as the villain, Dr. Sivana. Heck, it was even funnier than most Marvel movies, and for DC that's saying A LOT. Interested to see how The Rock's Black Adam factors into the sequel, that is, if that (6 year old casting) is still in play.8.2/10",Shazam!
33,Edvis-1997,7,7,16 June 2019,Well I'm a little bit puzzled and lost. This movie was like Okay but nothing more. It didn't entertained me a lot. It was like real life animation film. Hmm I don't like to compare DC with Marvel but at this point Marvel creating much more interesting movies in 2019 than this one...,Shazam!
34,Cineanalyst,"""Big"" Remade as Captain Marvel",6,15 April 2019,"The best gag in ""Shazam!,"" about a teenage boy who can alter his body to that of a muscular adult with superpowers by saying the magic word, is when the man-child runs across a giant floor keyboard in a toy store--paying homage to the iconic scene between Tom Hanks and Robert Loggia in ""Big"" (1988), another film about a kid coming upon some magic that transforms him into an adult body. There's a lot more to laugh at here, too, especially over the youngster exploiting his newfound adulthood to partake in such activities as buying beer in between his exploration of his multiple superpowers. In this family-friendly fare, they even manage to make light of the sexually-perverse metaphor of an old wizard making a boy hold his staff and say his name so that his powers will flow through him. Personally, I didn't care much for all of the references to other characters in the DCEU, including the needless after-credits scenes, but others in the audience I was in seemed to be into it.Otherwise, ""Shazam!"" is burdened by the usual formulaic fluff of superhero movies, as well as by some corny hokum concerning home and family. Billy Batson is another in a long line of super-orphans: Superman, Supergirl, Batman, Robin, Spiderman, Iron Man, The Wolverine, et al. Plus, there's the home of adopted superhero children we've already seen in the X-Men movies and ""The Umbrella Academy"" Netflix series. Perhaps, the worst offense here, however, are the generic villains. I mean, really, gargoyles-come-to-life personifications of the Seven Deadly Sins. Baddies don't get more humdrum than that. This one even opens with the origin story of the supervillain, but fails to develop him beyond his being envious of power.The bloated script spends time showing us a panhandling man-child superhero rising to fame on social media versus a supervillain who first uses his powers to lay waste to a corporate boardroom, and there's the issue of one of them having their powers handed to them while the other has to go out and earn or take his despite everyone from his father to a wizard telling him he isn't good enough (wait, which one are we supposed to be rooting for, again?), but for all the potential socio-economic issues it could raise and chances it offers to weight in on the nature-versus-nurture debate, let alone the obvious puberty parable, ""Shazam!"" remains oblivious to all of it. How many generic superhero origin stories are enough? I don't think the DCEU adopting the MCU self-deprecating light treatment of, say, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), ""Ant-Man"" (2015), ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017), and, most recently, ""Captain Marvel"" (2019), is especially novel. Not that I'm calling for a return to Zack Snyder's grim vision (""Man of Steel""(2013), ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016)), nor dare to dream of continuing the days of the un-ironic, noir-infused approach of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, but my true wish fulfillment for superhero movies such as this one would be that they--even if it's just a little bit--grow up.",Shazam!
35,ericstevenson,I am Captain Marvel!,10,16 April 2019,"Yep, this was the best movie I've seen all year. I admit to not having read much of the Shazam comics (well any really), but I understood the character's origins. The film starts off by showing a boy being summoned to Shazam (the wizard). Obviously, this is the main character right? Nope, it's actually the future villain! I was thinking about how they'd obviously kill off the father and there's a car crash.No, there isn't. But then there is! But he isn't dead! But that wasn't the main character! Dang, I have to give this movie tons of credit because the guy playing the adult superhero acts EXACTLY like a kid in an adult's body.Look for a great ""Big"" shout out. Doctor Sivanna has got to be one of the best villains ever, because they make him so complex. It's so great that they have all these lighthearted scenes with an adult acting like a kid, and then go to these disturbing scenes where he brutally kills people. I'm glad to have not read the comics, because than I would have known how it ended. Let's just say I hugged my whole family after watching this. The creators say this only came out at the same time as Marvel's Captain Marvel as a coincidence (yeah, right). ****",Shazam!

That said, the premise of this movie was very familiar, its like many superhero movie mashed into one. What i also did like is the more or less fleshed out villain - we do get so him at the beginning, and we see why he does what he does.Overall, ""Shazam!"" could have been great with that ""wacky"" premise, but it was just OK at the end. Not bad movie to see it once definitely, but nothing that great.",Shazam!
39,ironhorse_iv,Shazam was marvelous. I kinda like this comic book movie.,8,6 December 2019,"Once known in its source material as Captain Marvel in Fawcett Publications before being bought out from DC Comics and losing its name to Marvel Comics. This 2019 Warner Bros motion picture written by Henry Garden and directed by David F. Sandberg was a really fun watch. It doesn't encumbered itself with too much heavy melodrama like previous DC Extended Universe films. There were some really funny moments such as the cultural references to flicks like 1988 'Big' & the power testing sequences. Yet, the story of Billy Batson (Asher Angel), a 14 year old foster kid gaining magically superpowers to transform into an adult superhero of himself known as Shazam (Zachary Levi) does have some flaws. Besides the common coincidence of events happening at the right time & apparently all the characters go to the same location like campus despite being different ages; I really don't get Billy was chosen over someone with a more pure heart like the innocent, all loving Darla Dudley (Faithe Herman) or den sister Mary Bromfield (Grace Fulton) whom college subplot of leaving her family is abandoned in this universe? After all, I found the whole rescuing his foster brother Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer) from clichés one dimensional bullies kinda weak. It's the bare minimum of human decency. Plus, joining fist fights in school ground isn't really a good message. The whole bully subplot could had been cut. A better approach would be saving Freddy from getting run over in the first place. Regardless, the filmmakers could had made him a lot more worthy to gain the powers than what they presented Billy with; while keeping true to the tone of uneasiness about his championing. Personally, I didn't really like the amount of serious crimes that the supposedly hero does after gaining his powers. Don't get me wrong, I understand that he is a kid so trying to buy alcohol and go to a strip club while underage is somewhat common for a boy, his age. However, grand theft is not. I really didn't like how they made ATM theft seem so innocent in this film without showing any punishment. The same with the whole bus incident. I'm deeply surprised that the people and the media didn't turn on him like they did with other DC metahumans. That subplot of him not fitting with society norms with his powers could had really been interesting especially sharing a common ground with the villain Doctor Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong). The theme of people spending years desperately searching for something to the point of obsession and the tragic consequences of denied is a strong theme. The film could had connect them better. After all, Strong's performance could had add a certain gravitas, and his extremely sympathetic backstory makes him surprisingly easy to root for, even when he's slaughtering innocent people. You can have a temptation of man type story with the sins wanting him to join the doctor rather than forcing Billy to transfer his power to them. It also make the plot make more sense in why the antagonists left the aging wizard (Djimon Hounsou) alive; because they knew that they couldn't corrupt him. It would help the story with its strong nature versus nurture type theme. Another thing the film could had done better is bond adult Billy better with his child self. One was a little too happy go lucky and willing to talk with random people, while the other is more gloomy and distanced with attachment issues such as difficulty becoming emotionally attached to and trusting other people especially adults. Despite that, I did dig the whole memory perception flashbacks changed throughout the film. The way the light brighten to higher quality to make his mother look more beautiful than what really took place shown in the third act is brilliant. It shows the different in emotions. While the movie gets really dark and depressing at times, it's nothing really pessimism ugly like the previous DCEU films were. The movie's visuals are easy on the eyes and doesn't spent too much in the darker cinematography tone even in the high octane nightmare fuel boardroom scene that certainly will traumatized younger children. As for the combat scenes, it does have that CGI heavy hard to keep track action at times, especially involving the demons who can alternate between smoke & physical forms early in a battle but not later. Nevertheless, it was mostly fine even if it beg the question, where does Batson's clothes go when he changes to Shazam. As for costumes. Yeah, Levi's fake muscle suit does looks kinda cheesy and cheap; regardless how much the actor go to the gym. However it somewhat works with the tone of the movie as the focus of this was mostly on gaining laughs while looking a little bit corny; which Levi is a master of. His chemistry with Grazer was magically. Both did a good job. I also didn't mind the silly hand drawn animation toward the end and outrageous post credit scene involving a certain caterpillar. Yet, I wish Superman's appearance was a little more believable. As for the character of Black Adams; hopefully they can fit Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson or Shazam original choice John Cena in the sequel in that role. Overall: From all the 7th entries in this film franchises, I have to say this is probably my favorite. It's also a lot better than Marvel Studios 2019 film 'Captain Marvel', as it really capture the soul of the source material from heart. It's lightning in a bottle. Electric. One worth seeing.",Shazam!
40,Platypuschow,"Shazam!: If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the rest of the film in your head",7,14 May 2019,"The DC Universe has been a mess since day one.What with one facial expression Cavill and him slapping the fans in the face bailing.
Affleck's solo movie being on hold and then him slapping the fans in the face bailing.
Them rushing into Justice League without establishing the characters.
All the drama around Suicide Squad with Leto after the editor got a bit over zealous.
And of course the inconsistent tone and just underwhelming quality.Shazam looked promising, but was it really a good idea for them to go further away from the dark tone people are used to? And is ""Shazam"" really a character that can carry the franchise on his back now Batman and Superman have gone walkies?Truth be told I liked the trailer, but only in the sense that I didn't view it as a DCU movie. It looked like a fun family film and I was fairly looking forward to it, I did however think it would be predictable Hollywood stuff and the trailer is basically the entire film compressed.Well, I was right. It's exactly that, but it's also an enjoyable enough little take your brain out movie.Levi is great as our lead, Strong hams it up suitably as our villain and the supporting cast (Mostly kids) do a passable enough job. The movie is big, flashy and exactly what you'd expect if you saw the trailer.So it's fun, it is but it's not without its flaws. It's tacky, badly so in places whereas in others the CGI makes me think that somebody overpaid the SFX team by a tremendous amount. Then you have the plot and the general delivery which is basically exactly what you'd expect with absolutely no surprises. It's a Hollywood film, and as usual they play it very safe and by the numbers.In my opinion this has done the DC Universe absolutely no favors, this isn't a character that will save the franchise and I still believe they need a miracle to turn things around.Regardless it's fun dumb stuff and a perfectly passable little film.The Good:Great laughsAt least John Cena never got the lead role *Shudders*A fair bit of funThe Bad:Some sfx are unforgivably ropeyGeneric, tacky, Hollywood stuffAsher Angel looks like Maisie Williams, seriously it oddly confused me throughout the film",Shazam!

The cgi fighting at the end, less so, I was a bit bored and was just wanting it to end. But the Superman meets Big parts I loved.A lot of the success of this movie rests on Zachary Levi, as if you don't believe him as a 14 year old who suddenly gets superpowers, it doesn't work. But he is great Mark Strong is fine giving off Lex Luther with powers vibes. I loved seeing Cooper Andrews (Jerry from The Walking Dead) here Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer are both fine too.Some of the CGI didn't work especially during the flying scenes.I'm a sucker for movies about family(not the F&F tripe), and this one got me quite emotional at times, which I wasn't expecting!!

A lot of fast paced scenes, incredible effects, heartfelt moments, some sad moments too, even had a lot very funny moments, & best of all those things it even had a formidable foe that was very tough unlike in some movies.I don't like spoiling things so I'll leave that up to suspense for the viewers. I just highly recommend this mega fun much better than Aquaman among other DC flicks except nothing is better than The Batman movies plus I'm a rare needle in hay stacks that really enjoyed Suicide Squad that's all irrelevant though; I'd lastly like to mention David F. Sandburg is a phenomenal director even for his other films.",Shazam!

He stopped being funny fast.Everything about this movie was superb. They didn't use forced jokes like another superhero company I kniwI recommend this movie to DC fans. Mcu fanboys won't like it cuz they are close minded this movie lacks forced jokes and are full of themselves.,Shazam!
45,Thanos_Alfie,Entertaining...,6,20 March 2021,"""Shazam!"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a young boy gaining some unexpected powers that has to learn how to control them. As he gains experience and learns even better his powers, soon he has to deal with a new powerful enemy.I liked this movie and I found it very interesting and different from other superhero movies that I have watched. The plot of the movie is simple but very interesting and the direction which was made by David F. Sandberg was very good and I believe that he did an excellent job. The interpretations of both Zachary Levi who played as Shazam and Asher Angel who played as Billy Batson were very good and the combination of them created this beautiful result. Finally, I have to say that ""Shazam!"" is a nice, entertaining movie that I highly recommend everyone to watch it.",Shazam!
46,cruise01,Light hearted with plenty of humor and action.,10,6 April 2019,"Shazam! (5 out of 5 stars).Shazam is all heart and awesome bringing in a lot of fun, humor, and action. I love most of the DC movies. Shazam is kind of like that Guardians of the Galaxy in Marvel movies. While this film is like to the rest of DC movies. The humor is cheesy, funny, and has all heart. This is also one of DC's low scale superhero movies with more of a heart-charming story of Billy Batson trying to search for his mother and being stuck in a foster home.The plot follows Billy (Asher Angel) a teen who has been bouncing around foster home to another. On a search for his birth mother. When he is stuck in a foster home with Freddie (Jack Dylan Grazer) and a group of other kids. He defends one of his own against bullies. Being chased down to a subway train station. Where he gets transported into a different dimension with a wizard named Shazam (Djimon Hounsou) who gives the power to Billy. Which makes him transform into his alter ego Shazam (Zachary Levi). While he is learning of his powers. There is another mad man Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong) who is in control of seven deadly sins beasts and wanting to steal Shazam's power.The film does have a strong heartfelt story about a foster kid Billy. He is rebellious and a troublemaker. He is on a search for his lost mother. Seeing Billy and the other foster kids were a lot of fun. Freddie and Billy on screen brought a lot of fun humor. Freddie is obsessed with superheroes. Freddie was acting more of an instructor to Shazam. When they decide to make tutorial videos of Shazam's training. Which was a fun collage of scenes.The film moves at a fast pace. You have a lot of fun with the characters. Shazam taking selfies for money or having a lightning show. He is a grown man with a kid at heart. Zachary Levi is perfect for the role. Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer were great with their characters. Mark Strong was good as the villain. Djimon Hounsou was good as the older Shazam.The film does have some great action sequences. May not be as stylized compared to other DC movies. It does have a whole lot of fun with the action and Shazam trying to fight. The visual effects were good too. It may look cheesy with Shazam flying around like it is one of the older Superman movies. But it still works.Overall, Shazam is a great superhero film. It has a heartfelt story, the characters are fun, and it has plenty of humor. The film does have a mid and post credit scene that is worth checking out. One is for a hint of a sequel while the other is played for laughs.",Shazam!
47,Floated2,Lighthearted good message superhero film,7,10 February 2020,"After initially seeing several trailers, had very little interest as the film made out to look somewhat forced with its comedy and sort of cringe. Shazam! is a likeable character (as the child Billy) and is seemingly easy to root for.The positive message dealing with him being a foster child was well done and the story is interesting at times. Though the film becomes more stale and predictable once the villain is brought into action.Expectations were somewhat low as did not expect to enjoy the film but as a whole it is above average and has done moments of entertainment. The film definitely does have a feel that targets younger children and teens, and one could assume they found this film to be funny.",Shazam!
48,eddie_baggins,A try-hard comedic superhero outing,4,21 July 2019,"I'm sorry DC, it's just not working for you.After the doom and gloom and relatively po-faced outings of old didn't work, DC have tried the Marvel approach of fun and frivolity in amongst their narrative re-telling's of their favourite properties and while Wonder Woman was an easy watch and Aquaman a fun yet extremely silly splash, the bemusingly well-received Shazam! is a try-hard effort that's insistence on constant chuckles masks the fact is has an extremely dull main character, generic villains, poor CGI and a story we've seen countless times before and seen delivered in a much better fashion.Despite lead actor Zachary Levi's commitment to his role as the wise cracking teenager in an adults body Shazam, David F. Sandberg's film mostly feels forced and lethargic as we head on a two hour plus journey that sees charisma free Asher Angel's orphan Billy Batson be transformed into the all-powerful Shazam, when a wizard chooses him to be the saviour of the world for some unknown reason.It feels like it takes ions for Shazam to appear as we get stuck following around the depressive Batson as he looks for his real mum and gets introduced to his new foster family and potential new BFF Freddy Freeman (played in a scene stealing fashion by Jack Dylan Grazer) yet sadly when Shazam finally does make his appearance you quickly begin to realise this film isn't taking any risks as it takes us on a journey of Batson learning about his new powers, running away from fights and recreating Rocky Balboa iconic moments.It's a real shame the film didn't decide to take more risks with its generic coming of age/origin story, nothing fresh or original happens here even if it's nice to see the film do away with a love interest subplot for Batson and the appearance of yet another Mark Strong big bad in the form of the lamely recreated Dr. Sivana is a major weakness of the film, that culminates in one of the most long-winded and un-exciting finales I can remember seeing in a comic book film, right up there with the end of the original Guardians of the Galaxy film or Man of Steel's crash and bash extravaganza.With all the doom and gloom of the film (perhaps I'm just a grumpy old man?) there are moments throughout Sandberg's outing that suggest a great film lay somewhere within all the forgettable components.In a career littered with horror outings such as Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation, Sandberg does bring some nice ominous moments to Shazam! around the hit and miss humour, highlights of which include a board room attack and some neat otherworldly side quests but all these little set pieces and moments make up very little for the overall feeling that Shazam! just isn't as fun, smart or hip as it thinks it is.Final Say -With an air of manufactured swag seeping out of every pour of Shazam's! being, this latest DC outing feels like an unfairly praised adventure that will likely be forgotten about quick-smart as the next batch of far more memorable superhero outings come our way. Funny in brief moments, this is superhero film seriously devoid of magic or wonder.2 vending machines out of 5",Shazam!
49,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,8,12 September 2019,"Shazam! was light, funny and simple. It was actually pretty much what you expect from a super hero movie : the tragic past, the super villain, the transformation, the built up and the final great battle. However, what this movie had extra was the comedy factor, the teenager's theme and a more heartly story, all of which can't be easily found in the nowdays superhero movies that focus on the action and visuals rather than the actual story.",Shazam!
50,leonblackwood,Total Let Down! 3/10,3,19 January 2020,"Review:
I was so disappointed with this movie, which is a shame because it would have been half decent if Shazam! wasn't a blithering idiot. I didn't understand how Billy Batson, who is the human version of Shazam, acted more like an adult compared to the grown superhero. On top of that, the humour was awful and the storyline went from bad to worse. The evil side of the plot would have worked if the evil Dr. Thaddeus wasn't fighting against a pathetic imbecile, who just would've shut up. I also wasn't that impressed with the CGI, which didn't seem to suit the tone of the film, and none of the cast seemed that shocked with the all of the mysterious happenings that were going on in Philadelphia. Basically, it was a waste of time and money in my eyes, and I couldn't wait for it to end. The film kicks off in 1974 in Upstate New York, was a young Thaddeus Sivana is arguing with his father and older brother, Sid, during a car trip. Thaddeus is transported to the Rock of Eternity, a magical temple hidden in another dimension. He meets the Ancient Wizard, Shazam, last of the Council of Wizards, who has spent centuries searching for a new champion who is ""pure of heart"" after the previous champion, driven by revenge, released the Seven Deadly Sins upon the world, which killed the other Wizards. He then decides to test Thaddeus by telling him to touch the Eye of Sin. Thaddeus is easily tempted by the Sins entrapped in their statues to free them by taking the Eye. After being prevented from doing so by Shazam, he deemed unworthy by the Ancient Wizard. Upon returning to Earth, the confused Thaddeus makes a scene, causing the car to crash and cripple his father, with Sid blaming him. Back at the Rock Of Eternity, Shazam tries again to find another worthy person by casting a Seeking Spell. In present-day Philadelphia, foster child Billy Batson runs afoul of the law, while searching for his birth mother and is placed in a group home run by Victor and Rosa Vasquez with five other foster children, Mary, Pedro, Eugene, Darla and superhero enthusiast Freddy Freeman. Meanwhile, an embittered adult Sivana discovers a way to return to the Rock of Eternity and steals the eye of Sin, becoming the Sins vessel and besting the Wizard. He returns to Earth accompanied by the Sins, confronting and killing his father and Sid along with Sivana industries board of directors. At School, billy saves Freddy from bullies and is chased into a subway, where he is transported to the Rock of Eternity as Shazam summoned Billy to be the champion. By calling Shazam's name, Billy is transformed into an adult superhero, and the wizard turns to dust, leaving his staff behind. At home, Freddy is taken into Billy's confidence and helps Billy explore his newfound powers: electricity manipulation, near-invulnerability, super strength, speed and flight. Freddy's YouTube videos of Shazam testing his powers become viral, and Billy begins skipping school to use his powers as Shazam for money and fame. Seeing Shazam save a bus on the news, Sivana challenges and easily defeats him, demanding he surrender his powers, but Shazam transforms back into Billy and escapes into a crowd. From the news, Sivana deduces Billy's identity and abducts Freddy to find Billy. At the Vasquez home, the other children also infer Billy's secret and tell him they have also found his mother, who lives nearby. Billy reunites with his mother but is disheartened to discover she had abandoned him on purpose, feeling unqualified as a single teenage mother. Billy returns the compass she gave him as a toddler and leaves, telling her he needs to return to his ""real family"". Sivana calls Billy, having taken his foster siblings hostage, so Billy as Shazam agrees to give Sivana his powers in exchange for his family's safety. In agreement, Sivana and Shazam travel to the Rock of Eternity where Sivana takes the wizard's staff, but the siblings follow and attack Sivana. From their attack, Shazam realises that Sivana loses his powers when all seven Sins leave his body. Sivana pursues Shazam and his siblings to a winter carnival, unleashing the Sins upon the crowd. As Wrath battles Shazam, the other Sins capture his siblings, demanding his powers. Will Shazam save the day against the evil Sivana? You have to watch the film to find out! Personally, I think the director made a simple film over-complicated, which is why it's over 2 hours long. One of the most annoying things about the movie is that it takes a long time for Shazam to come to terms with his newfound powers, and by the end of the movie, he's still not taking anything seriously, so it's obvious that they plan to make a sequel. God forbid! I will give the movie a couple of stars, mainly because of Mark Strong's performance and some of the epic action films, but apart from that, I thought that it was badly written, and it seemed to go round in circles. I think you can tell that I wasn't entertained at all, so I can't recommend it to anyone, but I'm sure there are people who enjoyed it because it did make a slight profit at the box office. Disappointed!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by David F. Sandberg, who also brought you Lights Out in 2016 and Annabelle: Creation in 2017. He's known for his horror shorts, and with only 2 major releases behind him, I'm not sure that he was the perfect director for this project. After watching the bonus material on the Blu-ray, you can tell that David was overwhelmed with the budget, and the whole scale of the film, so it seems like he concentrated on the vision more than the script. With that aside, the movie did make a profit, so he must be pleased with his first high budget film, but I personally could tell that it was made by an unestablished director. There are so many question marks over some of the scenes, which were so far-fetched, and he really let Zachery Levi run wild. It's rumoured that there will be a sequel in 2022 with the same director and Zachery in the lead again, so I hope that David has learnt from this experience, and listened to the critics, to produce something special for the DC franchise.Budget: $100million

51,TheMovieDiorama,Shazam! shockingly refreshes the superhero sub-genre through childish behaviour.,7,6 April 2019,"After the pleasant surprise that was 'Aquaman', it seemed that DC found its feet and could pretty much tackle anything. So when I heard that a film was being produced about this titular character, doubt shrouded my mind. Could they turn a relatively unknown intellectual property with mainstream audiences into a memorable film? Well, despite the weak promotional material and genre saturation, DC may have just crafted their best yet. Witty and hilarious dialogue mixed with hearty themes of family and that fundamental splash of blockbuster action. It was a shocking electric spark that energised my eyes, diminishing my superhero exhaustion with its thunderous shenanigans. Billy, a foster child searching for his biological mother, encounters a wizard who grants him magical abilities so that he can stop the seven deadly sins from taking over the world.Imitating a narrative premise reminiscent of 'Big' (even to the point of referencing that infamous piano sequence) whilst integrating typical superhero plot points. However before I tackle the many positive aspects, I'm going to change it up and outline the negatives first. The story starts off somewhat bumpy, relying on heavy exposition to convey the magical lore of its source material and materialise the antagonist's motivations. Whom of which was severely underdeveloped, as if he was an afterthought to make way for the central bonding between Billy and his foster family. Strong deserved better, considering he is a talented typecast for villainous roles. The third act, consisting of that inevitable final showdown, provided a massive tonal shift from its preceding act and unimaginatively settled for mind-numbing spectacle (with the occasional shoddy visual effects) rather than maintaining its innovative hilarity. With that being said...oh, hang on wait just one moment......
SHAZAM!
...This film one hundred percent worked for me. Once it found its tempo, it became a relentless journey filled with adolescent joy and nostalgic charm. Sandberg, primarily a horror director, utilises his typical visual storytelling techniques and modifies them to focus on visual gags. Considering I harness a soul that has not seen the light of day ever, the amount of well-executed humour came as a shock and made me laugh on multiple occasions. Whether it be Billy testing his newly acquired powers (which reminded me of 'Chronicle') with his new foster brother or the villainous Sivana demolishing an entire board meeting, the range of visual and narrative jokes were varied and mostly smashed the mark.However what Gayden's screenplay excels at is balancing the childish antics with hearty themes. Family is a prevalent message beneath its frenetic action, and frequently conveys this through successful conversations between Billy and Freddy. Their many heart-to-hearts and jealous conflicts allows Billy to grow and fit the shoes of the adult that he can switch to just by saying the ""chosen one's"" name. Sandberg executes this balance perfectly, and enables the characters to become emotionally investable. The natural progression of Billy and Freddy's bond is some of the best character development I've seen in a superhero film period, and that's mostly down to Levi and Grazer's fantastic performances.When Levi is on screen, he just lights up any and every scene. His hyperactive performance had the right level of innocent naivety and boisterous humour to not become exhausting. Grazer on the other hand did the exact same but without the handy usage of superpowers. His character sparked an immediate connection with me without detailing a tragic or melodramatic sob story. The film prevails on detailing tragedy whilst remaining grounded, and Grazer's performance is a culmination of that. In fact, all of the child actors were top-notch. A foster family that I myself want to be an integral part of. Perfect comedic execution from everyone. The action, visual effects and soundtrack aren't especially electrifying, but they remain functional. The technical elements do not necessarily stand out, but that's only because the intent focus on the characters and comedy make up for this.Overall the change of tone for the DC Extended Universe is a welcomed addition, differentiating itself from the bloated darkness that previous chapters relish in. But it also manages to make the entire sub-genre feel fresh again, acting as a standalone feel-good adventure that everyone can enjoy. A shocking switch-up, I must say.",Shazam!
52,Ed-Shullivan,Simply a very fun filled family adventure film,9,22 July 2019,"What a wonderful fun filled adventure film for ALL ages with a twist on the super hero genre. Since this superhero is a 16 year old boy named Billie Batson (Asher Angel) who unexpectedly transforms into an adult sized super hero (Zacahry Levi) by merely calling out the single word SHAZAM!The young 16 year old Billy is a lost and troubled teenager being moved by the city of Philadelphia's social services division from one foster home to the next from as early an age as three (3) as he keeps getting into trouble. Billy yearns to be re-united with his birth mother but to no avail. His most recent foster home placement is a kaleidoscope of four (4) other foster children, who are being raised by a married couple who were also raised as foster children themselves.As much as Billy believes he can only rely on himself and no one else, his new foster family quickly grows on him as they reach out with love and genuine concern for his well being. Billy's moment of strength first comes to light when his yappy handicapped foster brother Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer) is being bullied and although Billy's common sense is telling him to walk away he quickly realizes he needs to lend a helping fist in this fight with the much larger two (2) bullies. As a result of his sacrificing his own body for that of his new foster brother he finds himself being transformed into a vapor world where a strange wizard indulges Billy with his magic staff and the word SHAZAM which transforms Billy into a super hero.As can be expected from any super hero there has to be a number of enemies and/or villains to fight and that is where the most evil Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong) comes into the picture to wreak evil on the world but especially on young Billy's new foster family. Okay so the battles between superhero Shazam and Dr. Sivana are predictable, the ending is not so predictable but what it is, is very entertaining and leaves the door wide open for a sequel which Mrs. Shullivan and I will be most eagerly looking forward to.On a personal note, we wish to thank set dresser Toni Wong for including our little Christmas gift to her (Santa Clause plush toy riding a motorcycle) in the pawn shop scene. This little touch made the adventure film Shazam a truly memorable family experience for the Morvay family.",Shazam!

54,digitalbeachbum,"So boring that my kids and wife left the room, and I skipped around looking for good scenes but didn't find them",1,21 July 2019,"When I was growing up I collected comic books. Shazam wasn't one of them, but I knew of the story and I did read many of them through other sources.I know this is supposed to be a modern origin story and many people who don't know Shazam need this sort of thing to get them started on the future DC story arcs they will be putting out, however, the director totally missed the mark and attempted to make this a stupid comedy with really cheap and immature writing, that was not funny.I thought the casting was fine and the actors did all they could to make it work, but it ended up being the fault of the director and the writers. It is a shame that they missed an opportunity to really do something special. Instead they made a Saturday morning cartoon of Bug Bunny/Elmer Fudd/Roadrunner/Wile E. Coyote slapstick.Don't get me wrong, I really like all the Looney Tunes stuff and I still watch them today. However, for this movie, no, don't go that route. You need to stop being stupid and be a bit more serious. Pick something between Justice League and The Tick. Don't try to be a dumbed down version of The Tick and do it for 10-14 year olds. Make it for every one. Not every scene needs to be comedic.This movie didn't suck completely, there were some good scenes, but it sucked enough that my kids and wife just got bored and walked out of the room and started to do something different. As I continued watching, trying to give it a chance, it I couldn't help but skip ahead. The dialog was getting in the way of the fight scenes. The ending was horrible and lacking in maturity. The ending was too predictable. The ending was corney.I'm very, very, very happy I didn't pay to see this in the theatre.",Shazam!

57,southdavid,Wizard of Floss,7,8 April 2019,"DC decision to move away from universe building and just concentrate on making one good film at a time continues to pay dividends with ""Shazam!"" a capable family oriented action adventure.Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is a teenager whose bouncing around in the care system looking for his mother when, at a time of desperation, the Wizard Shazam (Djimon Hounsou) passes his power to him. When he says ""Shazam"" out loud, Billy becomes an adult superhero with amazing cosmic powers. However the villainous Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong) seeks the power of Shazam, to combine with the power of seven deadly sins.I'm admittedly a lot older than the target audience for ""Shazam"" though I did still enjoy it. It reminded me a lot of ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" both tonally and, of course in some of the specifics - high school interactions, animated Ramones Credit sequence. The film is a lot of fun, often funny (and managing to keep a lot of the best bits out of the trailer) takes the odd in joke at the larger DC character, the effects and action sequences are great.It is, admittedly, pretty familiar stuff though. It's an origin story at heart and superhero origin stories is not something we've been lacking in the last few years. A couple of little things too, like certain characters not seeming to age relative to their children sticks in craw a little. I also wasn't sure I ever really bought that Billy and Shazam were actually the same person, Zack Levi plays him much more carefree and happy than his scenes as a teenage actually suggest he is.As an adult it's a lot of fun, it's definitely worth seeing and I'm left wanting more but I can't begin to imagine how much I'd have loved it at 12 years old.",Shazam!
58,Vartiainen,I mean... it's good for what it is trying to be - I just don't like what that is,4,28 February 2020,"Billy Batson (Asher Angel) - yay for alliteration! - is a troubled foster kid, who's been bouncing from home to home due to his inability to let go of the past and fit in.

And then a One-Eyed Willy full of sin chases after him to get him to touch his staff in order to suck the power out of him. Again, basically what happens.Jokes aside, Shazam! was one of the first big steps from DC to move their cinematic universe away from the grimdark approach of Nolan and Snyder, and into a more lighthearted, adventure-oriented realm, akin to Marvel. But because DC seemingly can't do anything without going overboard, it's a pure comedy. A childish comedy full of toilet humour and inappropriate jokes akin to American Pie. Well, not quite as bad as that, but heading in the right direction.Still, the film does feature underage drinking, a strip club, pre-teens discovering their hormones, schoolyard bullies straight from the 80s (seriously, these dudes are at least a decade older than the kids they are bullying; how many times can you repeat a class) and other quality content like that.And apparently it was a big hit. Likewise, my hope for mankind has once again taken a big hit.Shazam! is an okay movie, especially because it's clearly intending to be a childish comedy. And for what it is trying to be, it's fine. Easily above average. But forgive me for having a different taste in humour. I dare even say, a more refined taste.",Shazam!

The concept does have Big meets Superman, right down to Superman's themeThe CGI was great too and Mark Strong was good.If your looking for a feel good superhero movie with great humour then check it out.

It's a family friendly movie, which is different from DC's other movies, but this is how Captain Marvel ( that's right) should be done. They got all there other heroes bitting off their biggest money maker, Batman, somewhat altering what the charater is all about so that it can be dark cause that's suppose to be hip( it's not)
This movie was fun like it should be and you really get the full idea of what Shazam is like as a charater. Zachary Levi was perfect as the man child.
Also loved Mark Strong who just makes the perfect villian (possibly the nicest guy on Earth). Also liked the performance of the actress who played Dara, and I don't want to spoil anything, but that little girl becomes a dream Come true in the thrid act.
Very similar to Spider-Man homecoming as it's really a story about a foster kid trying to find a place to call home. A heart warming story wrapped in a superhero cape.

62,Turfseer,Comic book action film features most unappealing screen villain in recent memory,2,30 May 2019,"Another comic book action film has come down the pike, this one based on the DC comic book of the same name. It's set in modern day Philadelphia and focuses on a troubled teen, Billy Batson (played by 16 year old Asher Angel), who's been searching for his birth mother ever since he was lost at an amusement park as a child. He ends up at a group home run by the kindly Victor and Rosa Vasquez, who are in charge of a group of lovable kids straight out of the Steven Spielberg playbook.
Heading the motley group is Freddy Freeman (played by Jack Dylan Grazer who steals the show as a disabled kid who walks with a limp and also happens to be the resident superhero expert at the group home). Freddy befriends Billy who is transformed into the superhero Shazam played by an adult Zachary Levi. With all the previously alluded to ""lovable"" characters, where does Shazam go wrong?
It all has to do with a simply atrocious antagonist, Dr. Thaddeus Sivana, played by Mark Strong. We first meet Thaddeus when he's a kid, on a car trip with his father and brother in the early 70s. Somehow Thaddeus is transported to the ""Rock of Eternity,"" a magical temple where he's rejected by an old bearded wizard who makes it clear that Thaddeus will not be chosen to fight the Seven Deadly Sins who have been unleashed to wreak havoc upon the world by a previous corrupt ""champion.""
Right after Thaddeus's supernatural encounter, the three are involved in a terrible car accident, leaving the father paralyzed for life and blaming poor Thaddeus for causing the accident. All well in good until in the present day, Thaddeus becomes imbued with power from the Seven Deadly Sins and decides to kill both his father and brother; after dispatching the brother (who also blamed him for the decades old car accident), the father meets a particularly gruesome end when the now grown up Thaddeus throws him unmercifully out the window of a skyscraper, after interrupting a board meeting of his father's mega rich corporation.
The massacre of the father, brother and their co-workers is ludicrously unrealistic as we never see the follow-up police investigation nor an emotional reaction from anyone who's become aware of what apparently would have been tremendous tragedy in real life. It's a scene that's completely inappropriate for children (of any age) and sets a very bad tone for the rest of the movie. In fact, from this atrocious scene onward, Thaddeus never wavers in his lack of charm or humor and proves to be one of the most unappealing screen villains in recent memory.
There is very little more to say about Shazam as the plot features Thaddeus trying to do in Shazam at every turn with the assistance of his Seven Deadly Sins (made to resemble gargoyles through a series of calculated CGI effects). Shazam, by the way, after uttering his very name, is transformed from the teen aged Billy into a goofy muscleman, unable at first to control his adolescent urges for fame and fortune. Of course in the end, Shazam (or should we say Billy?) learns an important life lesson about the pitfalls of materialism.
Along the way, Thaddeus kidnaps Freddy and the foster kids and parents and Shazam has to save them. There's also a subplot where Billy makes the disappointing discovery that his birth mother lost him on purpose when he was a child, as she was too immature to care for him at the time (given the downer of a story line involving Thaddeus and his creepy ""sins,"" did we really need an additional downbeat turn in the plot, with Billy being rejected a second time by his mother?).
Thaddeus and the Seven Deadly Sins are of course defeated in the big amusement park finale where the forces of ""good and evil"" do battle. In the end, one can only throw up one's hands and blurt out: ""who cares!"" Someone is laughing all the way to the bank, but it sure isn't the parents of the kids who shell out their hard-earned money for high-priced tickets so their kids can indulge themselves in their self-defeating comic book reveries.",Shazam!
63,hellraiser7,Little Big Hero,9,15 May 2019,"It really looks like the DCCU verse (DC Comic's Cinematic Universe) is finally gaining the momentum they need but most importantly going the right direction. Part of that direction is in making movies from characters from the DC Comics roster that don't get nearly enough attention or recognition and they made a right choice with ""Shazam"".I honestly wasn't this would ever happen but I'm glad someone finally at the guts to take this on, so it was a dream come true for me. ""Shazam/Captain Marvel"" is an underrated franchise in the DC verse, it wasn't overlooked as it has had popularity in the past but as time went on it's became somewhat forgotten, but thankful like a bolt of lightening has struck down once more.
I really like the franchise, I mainly got into it from Geff Johns run on the character which is great. What I like about Captain Marvel and what really makes him unique is that he's a fantasy superhero, I always like those kinds of heroes because it means they inhabit a bigger world full of possibility and wonder yet to be explored. But also, are an homage to the mythological heroes of the past hence Captain Marvel's call sign ""Shazam"" where each letter is the initial of all the characters from Greek Mythology. But most importantly that this series has a family element which makes it slightly easy to emphasize and relate with the heroes.I really love the concept that you can transform yourself into a superhero as fast as you can turn on and off a light switch, by just simply saying the one phrase ""Shazam"". As we see it's actually very useful once depowered Billy becomes a kid again which makes it somewhat easy not worrying about your secret identity being leaked out, who would suspect an ordinary kid. Though that would be something I'd love to have, if I'm ever in a bad jam, I could just say that phrase and level the playing field. But this makes the series is sort of a wishforfilment fantasy on just the simple concept of becoming much more than your ordinary self but for a kid's perspective the mere notion of becoming an adult; much like the 80's film ""Big"" but with superpowers.One of the things I like about this film and is part of the original comic is that it's not concerned so much with plot, yeah there is a plotline and some development but it's the typical take over the world or power takeover type, we've seen or read dozens of times. It's a film really concerned about the characters and what they do.The characters are great, Asher Angel is solid as Billy Baton whom is a person with a heart of gold whether he knows it or not. His character is sympathetic as he's a person that is trying to find his family which has unfortunately put him in a severe state of disconnect not just with people but also life in general. Little does he know he's about to get one hell of a jumpstart.Zakary Levi is just excellent as Captain Marvel (that is the superhero's actual name for the record) he is Captain Marvel just as Christopher Reeve is Superman and so forth. I really bought into his performance as an adolescent in a grown-up body. There are lots of funny moments from one scene after Captain Marvel stops a robbery, he gets him and his stepbrother Freddie beer but of course both hate the taste of it and then just switch over to pop and junk food, yeah good idea. Or even when he parades in public in several scenes like using his lighting power to charge peoples phones, yeah minor good deed but it's better than none, I thought it was funny because it breaks the cliché of superheroes wanting to hide; but Billy doesn't want to hide he wants to be seen his way of saying this is me and why the heck not, you are in costume after all not like anyone will recognize you which is part of the point of them and really who wants to hide.And we even see him have fun with the powers may 'be being a tad irresponsible with them, really like his reactions as he's doing it along with exercising heroics, which makes sense that's probably how any person would react or feel if they ever had them for the very first time. My favorite from him is welding lighting much like ""Thor"", I just always thought lightening is cool. But the unique thing about Captain Marvel is that he's a rookie superhero still learning the ropes. He learns the hard way that being a hero/superhero isn't a game, that it really does carry a measure of responsibility.But I also like the Shazam family his interaction with them is the real heart of the film. Each of them had some good scenes and persona, but I also like how they consist of a diverse cast. There not some PC bullcrap but actual characters; Billy really has something in common with each of them they've all been orphaned and have needed family and all of them together they are as we see they all do support Billy and Billy does come to their aid in return which is what a real family does.. Of course there is a payoff with them near the end, I won't say what it is, though if you've read the comic series then you probably already know, but all the same that payoff really put a smile on my face and I actually heard some audience members cheer.Really like the back and forth he has with Freddy Freeman played well by Jack Dylan Grazer whom is both Billy's best friend/brother but also manager/trainer much like whom Mickey is to Rocky. He's got a lot of spunk and charisma and despite his disability he doesn't let it stop him. I really like how the bond between both really grows, both really look out for each other like brothers.Dr. Silvana he's a decent villain not a standout in my book but a pretty good opponent for Captain Marvel. Mark Strong I thought put on a solid performance, I like there was some emotion to his character where he's not just some two dimensional villain, he's menacing but you also sensed he was a person that was deeply hurt. Sort of like how there is a bit of a contrasting parallel between both Billy and him. Despite Silvana having a family and probably the best kind of circumstances ever, he never really had a family because they didn't love him back and was always view as just as inferior to it. When he gains power, he pursues more of it power is to fill in the inferiority complex he's been afflicted with all his life and still feels.Where Billy practically had nothing and no family but was able to find and gain love throughout the new foster family he's been assigned with, as he interacts with them more the emptiness inside most to all his life he felt fills up. It also helps him find the real reason he wants to use his powers which are to protect his family and many other families out there.The action is solid, there are some good scuffles, my favorite one which to me is an honorable mention in favorite battles is the battle at the carnival. I just think it's cool because I don't see battles take place in carnivals much, though it also serves as irony for the film and are usual places for families to have fun. But in this battle your just seeing Captain Marvel just going toe to toe against the seven deadly sin demons whom I thought were solidly designed they look like they could be creatures from the ""God of War"" video games. But just also the physical scuffles with Silvana were solid, there was some real struggle there despite how powerful Captain Marvel is he is still a rookie so he's not perfect, which just more makes you want Billy/Captain Marvel to win.The film does have heart other than the typical great power comes great responsibility motif, which is there, the real themes are about growth of oneself and what family truly is and can be. Family isn't really about who your related to but about people that truly care and even love you. And though that love it gives the spirit the nourishment it needs to grow, we see real character development in Billy throughout the film you even notice it in the Captain Marvel persona he starts to act a bit more mature.In the film we already know Billy has found what he's looking for but he don't know it yet, it's not until he starts to grow a little close to his foster siblings and opens up a little with them he really does become part of that family but also his best self.""Shazam"" is a big superhero film with a big heart.Rating: 3 and a half stars",Shazam!
64,jamesrupert2014,Amusing at times but overly long and strictly for the kids,5,15 March 2020,"Young Billy Batson (Asher Angel ) is given a magic word ""Shazam"" that turns him into a super-human adult (Zachary Levi ), but while he's learning to master his new found super-abilities, the seven deadly sins incarnate (Mark Strong ) is hunting for him. The film starts interestingly enough, focussing on the villain's back story but then takes it's time getting to the 'Shazam' moment. Initially, there are a few fun moments as the now supercharged teenager and his foster-brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer) figure the caped-marvel's powers but then the story goes nowhere until the obligatory super-villain shows up. After a few generic CGI-fights, the scene is set for the climatic 'twist' (broadly hinted at earlier in the film). Even by superhero standards, the original Captain Marvel (see for example the 1941 serial 'Adventures of Captain Marvel') pubescent-adult transition was a strange premise, but the current film doesn't really do much with the concept beyond play it for laughs. There is a noticeable disconnect between Billy's personality as young, brooding Billy and as goofily-heroic Captain Marvel (in all but name) that really undercuts the premise (the Captain seems much more of an all-powerful version of Freddy). There is a go-nowhere backstory about Billy's mother (perhaps setting up something in the inevitable sequel) and the foster family (made up of a group of 2-D stereotypes) is pretty cloying. Despite some moderately grim imagery at the start and the relatively brutal massacre in the boardroom, the film is light-weight, colourful kid's wish-fulfilment fantasy (resembling a live-action anime film (I was reminded of the pre-to-post pubescent 'Sailor Moon' characters) more than a D.C. Universe super-opus). Although decades past the target audience, I generally like these kinds of films but this one had little to offer beyond silly (and repetitive) yuks for younger viewers.",Shazam!

But will Billy discover what it truly means to be a hero?A pretty good DC film, Zachery Levi really plays the part of a kid in a superhero adult body perfectly, though there are some scenes he overdoes it a bit.

67,dee.reid,"""Shazam!"" is the much-differetn kind of superhero movie we've been waiting for...",8,14 May 2021,"""Shazam!"" the 2019 film adaptation of the long running superhero series that first began in 1940 in ""Whiz Comics #2"" (cover-dated February 1940) and was created by C. C. Beck and Bill Parker, is the fun, goofy superhero movie we've been waiting for. Of course, the character has had a long and confusing history in the seven decades since his debut - for instance, his original name was Captain Marvel, but that name was later dropped in part due to trademark issues with Marvel Comics over their superheroine character of the same name. And the character, which was originally published under Fawcett Comics, eventually let the rights get purchased by DC Comics, who has owned the character ever since.This brings us to the relatively low-budget (for a superhero movie these days) film adaptation directed by David F. Sandberg from Henry Gayden's script. The story follows along typical superhero movie origin stories, but has a more organic pace and a radically different tone from many of DC's previous film superhero adaptations, which have typically been way too dark, overly serious, angry, and cynical; 2017's ""Wonder Woman"" shows that DC had it in them to think outside the box, at least a little bit. In comparison, ""Shazam!"" is comparatively more light-hearted and fun, with a kind of coming-of-age goofiness that better matches the source material and feels more natural to the title character (and with a bit of ""Rocky""-inspired motivational cues to boot).(In short, it's a welcome alternative to what we've become so used to seeing from superhero movies.)Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is a streetwise 14-year-old runaway who is in search of the mother who abandoned him several years earlier in Philadelphia, is then taken in by an affectionately loving and culturally diverse foster family, and is later abducted by the wizard Shazam (Djimon Hounsou) who desperately needs a new champion to continue his centuries-long fight against evil. So he bestows his powers upon Billy, and when he says the wizard's name, he is magically transformed into the red-costumed adult superhero Shazam (a perfectly cast Zachary Levi); the word ""Shazam"" is actually an acronym - the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury. And every hero needs a villain, and in this case it's Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong), a power-hungry scientist who gains the ability to control seven demons that are representations of the Seven Deadly Sins.""Shazam!"" is definitely the fun, goofy superhero movie we've been waiting for.

There is a little confusion about this character and his name. Actually, he was the original Captain Marvel, created back in 1939 for the Fawcett comics company. There were some legal troubles with DC comics over similarities with their character Superman and Fawcett eventually went out of business. Years later, Marvel comics came up with their own Captain Marvel. DC bought the rights to the original Captain Marvel-which they had run out of business years earlier-but could not use the name, since Marvel comics had now copyrighted it for their guy. Yes, he was a guy before Carol Danvers took over the name. DC decided to use the name Shazam-the power word that changed 14 year old Billy Batson into the adult superhero-for their character. Shazam's powers come from a magic wizard that granted him the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles and the speed of Mercury. If you have read the comics, you know that Shazam's world is a little more on the humorous side. For instance, there was a friendly talking tiger and an alien villainous talking worm-both of whom make some sort of an appearance here. Zachery plays Shazam, Djimon is the wizard that bestows the powers on Zachery, Mark is the villainous Dr Sivana and Jack plays Freddy, a fellow foster kid. FYI: the man that runs the foster home plays on The Walking Dead tv show. Besides the obligatory super fights and humor, there are lessons to be learned about family and who makes up a family. Shazam is in the DC movie universe-there is a surprise super hero cameo near the end-and there are 2 scenes during the end credits; one right after they start and one after they are finally finished.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for intense sequences of action and some language and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.

71,injury-65447,Burnt Out!,5,7 June 2020,"I was expecting big things from this movie. I'm familiar with the director from his shorts on YouTube, which I find to be of generally high quality. I have to say I'm underwhelmed and disappointed.I feel I'm extra critical of this film as it tricked me into thinking it was offering more than your usual superhero movie. It's not at all. It fizzles out quickly.The story itself is needlessly convoluted and feels like somebody just pulled a bunch of random superhero / fantasy ideas out of a hat and stuck them together. Maybe it's true to the comic books. I don't know, I can only judge what I see in the film. An old wizard, a chosen one, a bad guy, teamwork, powers, flying around, costumes. This offers nothing I haven't seen before. And it doesn't even offer the best of what it has chosen to present.The Villain is so flat. Mark Strong might be a fine actor but in this role he offers nothing except a try hard one dimensional villain. He never comes off as menacing or threatening. Just a caricature.The Monsters are ridiculously generic and the CGI at times looks very dated. There is absolutely Nothing memorable about these creatures. They are not intimidating or scary or interesting in any way. Just standard cannon fodder baddies. Never Is a distinct personality developed for any of the ""sins"". Might as well have ditched the seven sins idea completely.The acting in general is passable but not great. I never felt emotionally connected to the characters or the journey of discovery in regards to a ""true home"". The family relationship seems superficial and empty. I didn't care at all about his foster siblings discovering their powers. They look like a cast that's been hastily assembled to fulfil diversity quotas.The length of the film is not justified. There was no reason for this to be over 2 hours long. I can't actually believe there is so little character or mythology development in a film this long. So much of the time must be spent on scenes that add nothing to the story.The humour rarely works. Definitely not enough for this film to qualify as a subversion of typical superhero movies. It feels disappointingly on a comedic level with most generic films of this type. I may have gotten a few smiles but overall it hardly even feels like a comedy. It feels like a typical superhero film with maybe a couple more jokes thrown in.Generic. Generic. Generic. This film does nothing except compound the superhero movie fatigue I know lots of people are suffering.",Shazam!
72,drqshadow-reviews,Slick and Silly but Very Cartoony; My Kids Liked it More Than I Did,6,11 July 2019,"Escapist fantasy that also, almost coincidentally, happens to involve a big, powerful, lightning-themed superhero. For better and, sometimes, for worse, Shazam! is more like a cartoon than almost any other offering from the recent flood of caped/costumed movies. It's playful and carefree, even when a serious threat looms near. The surrounding world is vibrant and simple, most supporting characters dedicated to their one specific personality trait.There's a welcome sense of relaxation throughout, an exhale when we realize there won't be much dramatic tension. On occasion, it toys with that juxtaposition - a confrontation with would-be robbers from the first trailer being the loudest example - but for the most part it's happy to occupy its own place and do its own thing. The humor is mostly on-target (razor-sharp, actually, during its most inspired moments), and Zachary Levi is wonderful as the innocent, naive cape-bearer, but it's awfully narrow and the constant efforts to tie it in with the super-serious DCEU are off-putting. I enjoyed the experience, but I didn't love it. My kids did.",Shazam!
73,GiraffeDoor,"Funny, thrilling and saccharine.",7,21 July 2021,"This movie seems to made of three discrete elements:1) Billy and the other one discovering this new superpower and having major fun with it. Superhero movies do seem to have gotten all serious lately and being able to indulge this fantasy of a kid gaining superpowers in the modern age and watching exactly what two kids would actually do with it is the most delightful aspect of the movie and seques nicely onto the theme of whether any of us would really be the heroes we think we want to be if the chance came up.All three of the actors with these 3 roles between them are just a treat to watch.2) Of course we need a formidable bad guy and they really picked a duzy to come up against such a childish hero. The juxtapostion plays beautifully and our antagonist hear just conveys so much cool terror and doesn't even wear a costume (major props to the costume department for for though, he is looking fly!).I was pretty nonplussed by how dark this thing got. I'm used to the approach that sins = good and anti-sin = good but it still worked. I wish I had had more time to appreciate the design of the 7 sins.3) This arbitrary and rather mawkish theme of family. There is an irritating hero worship of foster parents. Naturally I'll agree one should adopt if they are one of the people arbitrarily allowed that right. But you're only really treating yourself by doing that.Those foster parents were pretty annoying but the kids are neatly characterized. The Asian kid is such a racist stereotype, I'm actually impressed by that in this era. I found the whole story arc of this rather trite and tacked on but it didn't ruin the movie though it did cost it a point out of 10.And of course the set pieces are superb and the management of humor and blockbuster grandiosity is brilliant.Too bad the sentimentality and the patriarchal undertones made it short of Marvelous.",Shazam!
74,XweAponX,"""Captain Marvel""",10,4 July 2019,"That's the actual name of this character, if anyone has read the excellent ""Kingdom Come"" graphic novel by Alex Ross, and many DC tiles going back to the late 30's. I'm not sure if this character predates Superman, but it is one of the first DC characters ever made.This story here, an ""Origin Story"", is aimed at Kids, and Zack Levi does a great job of playing this person, who suddenly gets a Grown up Body and Magic Powers. Therefore, watching the first part of this film is equivalent to scraping fingernails on a blackboard. At first, Batson doesn't get it and he causes as many problems as he fixes. He has to learn a hard lesson, and after that is when this film picks up speed and quality. Of course, this origin story which was first told in the 1930's or maybe earlier, has been modernized to include Cell Phones and Youtube and Selfies.In Kingdom Come, Superman is depicted as the Earth's Mightiest Immortal while Billy Batson is the Earth's Mightiest Mortal, they have a gargantuan Face-Off and Supie loses big time. But later, Batson proves his Humanity and becomes a true Hero. This is one aspect of the character that was missing from this film. In fact, the confrontation with Superman was a huge part of the events that take place in the Comics. There is one scene in this film that is appropriate and Homages this historic meeting, which depicts Shazam side by side with his immortal counterpart. Now, hold on, I may be talking about Wonder Woman! So just watch the film, to see who I am talking about.Of course, Mark Strong has to play another version of Sinestro only not as cool. Strong plays the boy ""Sivana"" rejected by Shazam, cos he was greedy. When such kids grow up, they become what would be labeled ""A-Holes"" in Guardians of the Galaxy terminology. Rule number one: When visiting a powerful wizard who tells you not to listen to any Daemons, you really should do it.For Shazam, Batson was not really a better choice, Shazam had been testing children for years and never found a champion. So Shazam, the Wizard Shazam, has to take a chance that Batson is that guy.We have to remember, it's ""The Power of Shazam"" - Which was the name of the old Serials from the 40's, ""Shazam"" was not the name of the character that Batson will eventually become, it is always the name of the Wizard whose powers Billy uses. In the old DC comic books, he was called ""Captain Marvel""- Not to be confused with Miss Marvel or any other Marvel Comics ""Captain Marvel"".There were parts of this film that were outrageously bad, but the parts that were good far outweigh that- and makes the film worth sticking with.When Strong's ""Sivana"" in Child Form visits the Wizard ""Shazam"" (Djimon Hounsou -Ironically Sivana's father was played by John Glover, who played the devil in the show ""Brimstone"" some time ago), we see 6 empty thrones in the Wizard's ""Lair"". Keep those in the back of your mind, ""File for Future reference"", any good movie never wastes 6 good empty thrones. That's all you will get out of me.Both Sivana and Batson get their childhood wishes, it's what each of them do with that heart's desire that's important. Some people should never gain any kind of power at all, look at our present Federal Administration. The difference between Sivana and Batson, was that Batson really was not looking for what he was handed. Rather, Batson was looking for something else, something that has haunted and eluded him since he was a small child. It was the reason he moves from one set of Foster parents to the next. In this film, he hits the jackpot, but he doesn't realize this right away, it takes a little bit of bruised buttocks syndrome for him to start getting it.But once he gets tapped by ""Shazam"", he's got to figure it out quick, and his only ""Superhero for Dummies"" Tutorial is his friend and roommate Freddy. Which wasn't really the best source of information. Between the two of them, they muck it up fairly well.I would have preferred a darker story and darker character overall for ""Captain Marvel""/""The Power of Shazam"", but this is what we got.Someone whined about the special effects, well, it was WETA, so you may as well complain about Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, Justice League, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman, as well as most of the Marvel CU films, I guess the version of Shazam they watched was the workprint that they got from a torrent site.

75,alindsay-al,A fantastic fresh feeling comic book film,8,6 April 2019,"I am really excited to review the newest DC Film Shazam! The premise of the film sees a 14 year old boy granted the powers from a wizard, during the film he must realise what it takes to be a hero. Zachary Levi is relatively new to me, I have only seen him in his small roles in a couple of the Thor films, so when he was cast in this role I wasn't sure, but he was fantastic in this role. He really nailed the role of this kid in an adults body, he is very likeable and fun to watch especially when he newly recieves his powers. He is of a good physical build to sell all the action scenes and look the part of the role. Also new to me is child actor Asher Angel who plays Billy Batson and he does a great job with a suprisingly emotional performance, he also does the humour well but he does very well in this film. Mark Strong plays the villain Dr Sivanna in this film and he did a really good job, his character is pretty fleshed out and comicly evil as well. He is a good foil for Levi and I enjoyed watching them clash in the action scenes. Djimon Hounsou plays The Wizard and he doesn't have a large role in the film but he does a good job with the material that he is given. A real highlight is the performance of Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy Freedman, Shazam's sidekick. He starts off the film as quite annoying but becomes a loveable character and I really thought he and Levi did a great job in building their relationship and chemistry. The plot is fun and interesting seeing this child granted an adult body with superpowers leads to some funny moments and an interesting take on how superheroes should act. Suprisingly to me this films emotional arc really resonated well and aided with the character development very well. The script of this film was important and I thought it really worked. The humour made me laugh throughout and helped make this character feel more likeable. Also as mentioned the drama was suprisingly good and aided in making this film feel more then just a throwaway comedy. The style of the film mostly works, the costume is great and feels like it was ripped straight from the comcic books. However, the pacing of this film was a bit of an issue for me, especially the final confrontation which feels like it goes about 10 minutes too long and would have been more effective if it had been shorter. Also the action scenes are okay but nothing really stands out and some of them even feel like a rehash of the final battle in Man Of Steel.

76,CubsandCulture,With this ringing double the DCEU finally gets over the Mendoza line,8,19 July 2019,"It is no secret that the MCU has been more engaging and better thought out than the DCEU. What I find interesting is that the DCEU three most successful films-this, Wonder Woman and Aquaman-more or less ditched the former grimdark tone of the DCEU for a lighter, more comedic offerings. This is largely successful here as Shazam! is the most entertaining film of the bunch and has something of subversive edge to it. Late in the film a villain's cliche monologue is utterly undermined and it is the signature moment of the film. It is funny and has the wow gee wiz tween energy that is so the character. Overall, this is an engaging origin story that blends yuks, superhero mythos and a nice coming of age/family story largely with care.The only real downside is the final fight sequence takes up way too much screen time. It not only drags past the point of being fun but the time could have been spent better on different things. As a story of finding a new family I feel like 2-3 of the sibling relationships were *really* underdeveloped. The becoming brothers story with Freddy and Billy works. Mary and Billy get enough of a bond but the other 3 feel shortchanged to the point of being forced. It is enough of a problem that it really hamstrings the 3rd act.This was a good film. See DCEU just needed to copy Marvel more. Grimdark doesn't work.",Shazam!

80,kirbylee70-599-526179,HOLY MOLEY!,7,4 August 2019,"Warner Brothers has been behind the release of superhero movies based on DC Comics character. Since they also own DC this only makes sense. But while the DC Universe was hitting the big screen before the Marvel superhero films with Batman, those were the only films to rival what DC has released. For some reason the folks at Warner felt that every single superhero outing needed to be as dark and gritty as the Batman films were. The problem was and remains that not all characters in comics are dark and gritty. They make an attempt to steer away from that with SHAZAM with mixed results.If unfamiliar with the character he was originally named Captain Marvel and ran in comics published by Fawcett. A lawsuit filed by DC claiming he was a rip-off of Superman resulted in his series ending until DC acquired the character in 1972. The character was more simplistic than most and geared more towards younger readers. Aiming for a larger audience and a PG-13 rating that changes a bit with the movie.The film opens on a dark and stormy night in the 70s with young Thaddeus Sivana riding along to a Christmas outing with his father and older brother. Ridiculed by both he ends up being called to a hidden hall where the supreme Wizard (Djimon Hounsou) tests him to take on the mantel of new warrior, but he must be true of spirit and heart. When he almost takes the container that holds the seven deadly sins instead, the Wizard returns him to his car. His reaction causes a wreck that leaves his father damaged and his brother blaming him.Young Billy Batson loses his mother at a fair and becomes an orphan when no one comes to claim him. Fast forward to today and we find Billy (Asher Angel) attempting to find the mother that abandoned him years ago. Having moved from foster home to foster home the agent in charge of his case decides on another tact. She places him in a home owned by a couple who were once foster children themselves and now run a home for orphans. Billy isn't quick to make friends and that includes his roommate Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer), a superhero geek. Still trying to find information on his mother he isn't quite adapting to the family setting here.Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong) has grown up trying to rediscover the location of the hall he was removed from. His goal is to take the eye, the container that held the seven deadly sins, and to gain power with it. He eventually accomplishes this but to gain the ultimate power he must take it from the Wizard who is still seeking a warrior to possess his power.The warrior chosen is none other than Billy. When he's given the power and says the magic word ""shazam"" he turns into a muscle bound, tight and cape wearing superhero played by Zachary Levi. The thing is he's still 14 in his head. He lets Freddy in on his secret and asks for advice as to what to do. They pair test out which powers he has and uses them for less than reputable reasons, like getting beer or visiting a strip joint.Eventually Dr. Sivana comes looking for Billy as the hero we will eventually call Shazam. More skilled and older than his opponent Sivana has the upper hand. It isn't long before Billy has to retreat, regroup and try and figure out what to do next. He's been adjusting to the family that is now part of his life and a momentous incident happens that solidifies that. But with Sivana hot on his heels Billy must decide what the right thing is to do and summon all his strength and pureness of heart if he is to win the day.Some of the basics from the comics are there but not all. The film doesn't play off on the innocence that those who remember the comics will be looking for. The beer and strip joints are a big clue of that. But the heart of who and what Captain Marvel/Shazam is remains at the center of the film. His standing up for what's right, what's moral and for family serve the character well here.At the same time the dark world of DC comes barreling in again though as the seven deadly sins are seen as dark and monstrous looking creatures. The addition of several characters being killed by Sivana also add a darker dimension to the film. It would be nice if Warner realized that the success of Marvel has been based on their acceptance and embracing of the source material rather than trying to change it.The film looks good, the acting is good enough and the direction is fine. But the film still has a feeling of not quite being as good as it could be. A part of that lies also in the length of the film at over 2 hours. Twenty minutes of this film could easily have been trimmed and not missed. In the end it's not a bad movie but it could have been so much better. Still, it's worth a rent and a watch but perhaps not being added to your collection.",Shazam!
81,MissSimonetta,"Too long, but still a delight that never takes itself too seriously",8,1 August 2019,"My expectations weren't high for SHAZAM! but it turned out to be a cute, heartfelt, and funny movie. I've enjoyed it enough to see it three times and each time, I appreciate the performances more, as well as little touches (like the villain basically being an overgrown, over-educated bully, illustrated by that one scene where he slams Freddy against lockers; the difference between Billy's memories of the day he was separated by his mom and the mom's version of events; etc.).My only problem is that the movie is WAY too long. They could have shaved off at least twenty minutes and the film would be all the tighter for it. Still, this was very enjoyable, enough to give me hope for future DC movies.",Shazam!

84,masonfisk,"UP, UP & AWAY, WAIT A SEC, THAT'S THE OTHER GUY...!",9,15 April 2019,"The other caped flying wonder from DC has finally gotten his own vehicle & what a ride it is. Taking a page from the Galaxy of the Guardians adaptation, Shazam! presents its hero as a lovable, ne'er do well (he is a preteen stuck in an adult's body) trying to navigate the politics of a foster family while having to deal w/his newfound powers. The closest approximation to this film is Superman meets Big (right down to a scene where our man fights the bad guy in a toy store & a floor level piano becomes a nice visual/aural joke). Zachary Levi (late of the Thor series, he was one of the warriors 3) is a game avatar for this zippy tale which doesn't take itself too seriously or maybe the approach is seriously comic because how can anyone not crack a smile at the way this particular's hero backstory has shaped up. DC is on a bit of a roll right now as Marvel's current phase is about to end w/the horizon a bit blurred as to what's next, DC may finally get the limelight it richly deserves.",Shazam!
85,aidanratesmovies,"It's not just a great movie for DC, its a great movie in general",10,28 March 2019,"Fun, refreshingly original, and super entertaining, Shazam is a breakthrough for the DCEU and comic book films like it in general. It can get caught up in familar tropes from other leading superhero films, but it manages to break out of them by pushing the boundaries and simply giving the audience what they want- a great time at the movies. Its story is good, and its acting is even better. Zachary Levi plays the part of Shazam brilliantly, and like Tom Hanks in Big, shows a great amount of honesty and humor of being Billy- a kid stuck in a adult body. Jack Dylan Grazer gives another great performance as Billy's 'manager' and new foster brother Freddie. Mark Strong proves to be a strong enough villain for the film, or at least the most thought out villian of the DCEU at this time, and proves to be a worthy foe in this type of film. Shazam is also heartfelt and provides kids watching with a good message by the end. By far, the film is something DC should be proud of, and hopefully something we will see more of in the future
My Rating: 9.25/10",Shazam!
86,truemythmedia,One of DC's Best,6,8 August 2019,"Superhero films have come a long way in the last twenty years. Look at one of the first superhero movies that really kicked off the superhero craze: Sam Raimi's ""Spider-man"" (I know ""X-Men"" came before, but ""X-men"" doesn't really have a good origin story aspect). Raimi's ""Spider-man"" pretty much has every quality that this film has: a goofy outcast in high school that gets picked on by bullies, an inciting incident that gives them powers, a training montage, some mid-level baddie fights, and then we finish it off with a fight with a guy who might actually do some damage... It's been decades since that film, how many freaking times do we need to see this exact story? I'm tired of it; give me something new. At least Marvel, when approaching their latest films, have started to branch out into different subgenres. Unfortunately, DC is still really struggling to get their cinematic universe off the ground.I know I ragged on this movie a lot, but it is probably the second-best DC movie out there (second to ""Wonder Woman"", though I still haven't seen ""Aquaman""). It's still nothing all that special, but at least it's a step in the right direction, away from the dreary world of Zack Snyder. If you're a huge fan of superheroes, then I can almost guarantee you'll like this movie. If you're a casual fan of superhero films, then just wait to see this on Netflix.",Shazam!
87,masonsaul,One of DC's best,10,6 April 2019,"Shazam! is pure joy and definitely one of DC's best. It's extremely funny, heartwarming and emotional. Zachary Levi, Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer are all great. It's got strong direction from David F. Sandberg and the cg is impressive. Mark Strong gives a really good performance and his character has a surprising amount of depth making him one of the better villains from DC. The smaller scale works really well and is a nice contrast to the usual grand comic book movie scale.",Shazam!
88,davidmvining,"Amusing and cleanly told, but with a lot of missed opportunity",6,4 November 2020,"I actually watched the DCEU movies a bit out of order. Immediately preceding my viewing of David F. Sandberg's Shazam! I watched Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey. Starting up this I was relieved to see the simply building blocks of story presented in an order that made narrative sense, and I almost cheered. Sandberg's adventure into newfound superhero abilities has some issues along the way that drag it down a bit, but it's nice to see that Warner Brothers can still hire a director who understands storytelling at the most basic of levels.So, magic. The DCEU embraces straight up magic for the first time. I can dig it. So, Billy Batson is a foster kid moving from home to home as he puts on a one-man search for his mother whom he lost when he was about four. At fourteen, he's run through dozens of names and still can't find her. At the same time, an ancient wizard loses control of the Seven Deadly Sins to Doctor Sivana. Desperate, the wizard magically delivers Billy to his temple and gifts Billy his powers in order to fight in his stead, turning Billy into Shazam, a superhero who looks like an adult, and this is the source of a lot of the movie's light humor.Shazam is a kid at heart, so seeing him act like a kid, all buffed up and with superpowers, is amusing. It's also a complete retread, so it's nice to see the movie give a direct reference to Penny Marshall's Big. And I think it ends up being how the movie flags in its second act. There's no real direction to Billy after he gets his powers. He's happy to show them off, discover what they are, and take out some petty revenge here and there, but he doesn't seem to have any drive. It's weird because he has a central goal, which is to find his mother, but once he has these powers he not only doesn't use them to help him accomplish his central goal, he completely forgets about the goal. There's a certain understanding since he's a fourteen year old who gained superpowers, but he has them for days and doesn't even think about his mother until someone else hands him an address.There's a thematic connection between Billy's search and the rest of the movie, that of family and finding it where you can. Billy finds his mother who, it turns out, just abandoned him. Instead, he has the group home of foster kids to fall back on. Contrasted to that is Doctor Sivana who rejected his own family and any sense of community with anyone else including the ancient wizard, spending his years searching out for that hidden temple and the seven deadly sins, which he eventually finds and takes for his own. He won't be at full power until he beats the wizard's champion, Billy. Hence, the conflict. I wish there was something connecting Sivana to Billy's mom directly. Something like Sivana kidnapping Billy's mom thinking that there's a special connection, but Billy is reticent about doing anything because he found out she rejected him. However, he uses the power of family from his group home siblings to help her or something. Instead Sivana does kidnap his adopted family, which is in the same wheelhouse but too easy in the other direction.That aimless act drags the film down, but once it's over, the movie gains some focus again. While it doesn't take advantage enough of the family angle, it does focus in on it, giving Billy an avenue to accepting his new group home as the new family he needs without clinging to the past and a woman who doesn't want him.The other major problem I have with the film is Doctor Sivana and his Seven Deadly Sins. Sivana is thin and uninteresting. As played by Mark Strong you might expect more, but he's just a generic bad guy with daddy issues. And the Seven Deadly Sins all run together. If you really focus on them, you can tell the differences in design, though they're all colored the same which seems like a missed opportunity. However, it takes a surprising amount of attention to delineate one from another, and they all just kind of run together, ending up feeling rather generic as well. Another miss.In the end, though, the movie's an unchallenging little superhero movie that aims primarily towards children. It's amusing and cleanly told. For some that will be a more than welcome change to the franchise that they've considered to be off the rails from the beginning. For me, it's nice, but I look back at the cinematic ambition of the first two DCEU films and sigh, happy to have something better than okay but much less than the aims of where the franchise started.",Shazam!

92,rannynm,"Entertaining, funny, action-packed and engaging",10,4 April 2019,"Shazam! is absolutely amazing. It's entertaining, funny, action packed and engaging. This is maybe the best DC Extended Universe movie so far.Fourteen-year-old Billy Batson discovers, with the help of an ancient wizard, that he can turn into a Superhero, just by saying the word Shazam! But Billy is not just dressed in a superhero outfit. He looks older and bigger.Converted into Shazam, Billy, who lives with adopted parents, goes home and tells his friend Freddy that he is Shazam. Freddy loves and knows everything about superheroes. Together they test Shazam's capabilities and, surprise! He is indeed a real superhero. Billy uses his powers for good, but also for fun.I think Shazam! makes the cinematic world a better place. This is not just a hilarious comedy. It is about finding a family, making true friends and combating bullying.The acting in this film is amazing. Zachary Levi is the perfect Shazam. He has the charisma and humor to make this hero adorable and he is a big kid. Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer also make this movie very engaging. They are not just funny but also kind hearted. These actors totally carry the film. I think all the actors make it more relatable for younger audiences and new generations. I definitely think this movie is unique, because superhero films are usually more serious and only have a couple jokes, but this one kept my laughing. There's action and emotional moments as well. The amount of comedy is perfect and what makes it so special.
The director David F. Sandberg surprised audiences. He's most know for his horror films, but this one turns out to be incredible and enthusiastic.The message of the film is that we can all be heroes. It only takes a pure heart to have the power and strength to do good deeds, help people and beat the bad guys. The story works perfectly for the whole family, so I recommend it for ages 5 to18.

It's a movie that everyone can enjoy despite its family friendly pg-13 rating. Seeing it in 3d is pretty good and the conversion effects are well done and the colors and sound mix shine. I missed out on the two bonus scenes since i had to leave the theater with my friend for a bite to eat, but one leaves open a sequel, which will be greenlit, and the one at the end makes fun at Aquaman.

95,eric262003,A Superhero Film That Has A Lighter Approach to The Genre,8,3 January 2021,"There is no questions that ""Shazam!"" has a plethora of good things going for it. What stands out about this unlike the other films from the DC Extended Universe is that ""Shazam!"" succeeds in staying original and not only that it plays off a lighter theme as opposed to the dark and gritty material you see in superhero movies where everything is political, philosophical or educational making it more labouring to watch than fun. It seems like ""Shazam!"" is following the footsteps of Marvel superhero films leaning towards humour like ""Deadpool"" and ""Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse"" albeit a little less satirical in its delivery.The simplified theme of the leads you to the question of what would happen if a 14-year-old kid was suddenly given super powers, not knowing what to do with them? The closest movie of that theme goes to 2010's ""Kick-Ass"", albeit no powers to go with the costume, but a strong fan-following on social media. With the exception of our superhero walk into a strip bar and facing off against demonic looking gargoyles who represent the Seven Deadly Sins, ""Shazam!"" is for the most part light and more aimed towards the younger aged demographics even with the simple message relating to the importance of loving one's family and showing love to the people around you.Although it might be following the footsteps of comedy superhero like films like ""Deadpool"", the movie seem more inspired on the surface of the light-comedy children's film ""Big"" from 1988 starring a very young Tom Hanks. In this movie and in ""Big"" we see a kid making the transformation of an adolescent boy into a fully grown adult. It's a great combination to take the idea of a kid growing up fast comedy by adding superhero powers to it is original and works on all sorts of levels.For the action to really start picking up you need a great deal of patience as you'll have to sit there and watch the tedious origin story of the troubled childhood of young Billy Batson (Asher Angel) and the origin story of Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong) and how he turned evil; not to mention he also had the cliched daddy issues. Once that is all out of the way, it's where the excitement takes over from there. Billy is now living an orphan and still has a fixation of finding his mother who abandoned him, though when he finds her the revelation is quite anti-climactic. When Billy was called upon a powerful Wizard (Djimon Hounsou) he was granted six mystical powers that represented the strengths of six mythological characters though all he has to say is ""Shazam"" and he can transform into his superhero form and back into a teenager again. His transition to the more buff Zachary Levi reminiscent to when David Banner transforms into The Incredible Hulk.Under the direction of David F. Sandberg, under the metaphoric Superhero Origin Manual in which our novice superhero must adjust to his new powers by making each awkward scene all the more entertaining because when you first obtain new things it's natural that people feel uncertain when something seems alien to them. When Billy was trying out his new powers, he experimented on what he could do with them, along with his fellow foster sibling Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer). What's funny is he's not using his powers to take down evil people and saving the world from corruption, he's more interested in using it to his advantage for his own selfish and mischief making ways.But once Billy adjusts to his newly obtained adult-formed alter-ego, ""Shazam!"" falls into formulaic territory as he must take down the evil Dr. Sivana which they battle all across Philadelphia (though it was actually filmed in Toronto), feels like a poor person's version of Superman vs. Zod in ""Superman II"", though just very watered down. In the end, the climax doesn't end with something to look back on.The big weakness is that the film goes on way too long and kids might get restless knowing that this movie does go on for more than two hours. Not only that some subplots just don't seem to work out at times. Sandberg successfully can balance out the superhero action, the comedy and the dramatic scenes very nicely and well-timed without one genre usurping the other. The comic-book scenes are one we've seen many times before which is formulaic, but always exciting. The comedy genre is the strongest of the aforementioned ones as I had laughed quite a lot in this movie due to the perfect timing of Zachary Levi. Sure ""Shazam!"" won't be in the same leagues as ""Captain Marvel"" or ""Avengers: Endgame"", it still provides two hours plus of solid lightweight entertainment for all.",Shazam!

The rest of the cast also did well.This is definitely my favourite DC Movie from this year. Even though it is not heavily action packed like Aquaman, Wonder Woman or Man of steel but it was still fun to watch by it's own merit. And something that kids and adults may love even as a film. Although, there is still some terrifying imagery but nothing major.Also, I am very glad this movie beat that SJW, feminist, man hating, garbage known as Captain Marvel.

This one is full of light (except for the brilliant Mark Strong as Sivana, who's the evil guy). The humor in the film is appropriate as it gets the point across that yes, while Shazam! in his adult form is the peak of human perfection, inside he is a 14 year old boy!

Starring Asher Angel, Jack Dylan Grazer, Zachary Levi, Mark Strong, Grace Fulton, Cooper Andrews, Marta Milans, Djimon Hounsou, John Glover, Faithe Herman, Ian Chen. (PG-13)Foster teen Angel is chosen by an ancient wizard (Hounsou) to be imbued with superpowers (and the form of adult Levi); he mostly uses those powers to show off and garner attention, until crossing paths with powerful supervillain Strong. Slightly above-average DCEU outing is still little more than a series of professional-but-unspectacular special effects surrounding the familiar story beats of an origin story character arc. A sense of humor helps, though the jokes are only sporadically amusing, and the irreverence is poorly matched with a dismal long-lost mother sub-plot and a humorless, weakly-developed villain. A running joke is that Angel/Levi doesn't know what all he can do in ""Shazam form"" and keeps figuring out new powers...but does he have any ""weaknesses"" at all (besides threats against loved ones)? At least this seemingly invincible champion has a playful side sorely missing in the DCEU version of the Man of Steel. In between the inexcusably drawn-out introductory passages and an overextended series of (anti-)climaxes, there are isolated moments of joy and pizzazz, but not enough to heroically save the day.49/100",Shazam!

In 14-year-old Billy Batson's case, all he needs to do is shout out one word to transform into the adult superhero Shazam.

106,arungeorge13,Calling it DC's best by far is still not enough! [+64%],6,12 May 2019,"Shazam! does get a lot of things right - for starters, it features a fourteen-year-old protagonist who's a foster kid; secondly, it has a lighter tone that is sure to get young comic-book fans aboard the DCEU. The film certainly benefits from the presence of a vibrant Zachary Levi (who plays the titular character), although his body language is visibly different from that of Asher Angel's. The disappointing bit is that a lot of the humour (some not exactly kid-friendly) was already disclosed in the trailers.It's a welcome move on the part of the DCEU to embrace a lighter tone as it moves forward so that it can get the attention of young movie-goers and comic-book fanatics. The film starts rather preposterously - a young Billy Batson makes a fool of the local police in an attempt to retrieve details about his mom who he was separated from, at a local fair many years ago. While this story may sound grim and dull, Shazam! gives it a funny twist. Jack Dylan Grazer, Faith Herman, and Grace Fulton lend ample support as the other foster kids.What makes the film several notches above the regular DCEU flick is its entertaining villain Dr. Sivana played by Mark Strong (it's a nice touch that the film starts off by detailing his character). Strong is a great actor and a great addition to the DCEU. The film also puts forth a simple yet message that sometimes getting to choose the family around you is not necessarily a bad thing. It even portrays foster families in good light, which was refreshing to see.Maybe, it's the randomness of the events that lead to Billy getting his superpowers that add to the overall charm of the movie. Levi's portrayal of a superhero who's a teenager deep down and his brotherly bond with Freddy is what keeps the film afloat for the most part. There's quite a lot of self-deprecating humor (especially when Batson needs to deal with supervillains) and that works in Shazam!'s favor. The sluggish CGI 'Seven Sins' are a bit of a bore though. But since they're relegated to playing Mark Strong's baddie aides, that's okay.There's a whole lot of Superman and Batman in Shazam! too, but in ways that you'd least expect. This almost leads you to believe that their universes will collide in the near future. Director David Sandberg also chooses to leave the name of the superhero ambiguous right till the end (in truly comical fashion), just so that 'Captain Marvel', the name now in use by Marvel doesn't pervade into this flick by any chance. The director also makes it a point to depict the protagonist as someone who makes mistakes, looks at the world from the perspective of an adolescent, and totally rids him of the usual superhero machismo that we've come to expect from these films.Even when you consider all of that, the DCEU still have their work cut out for themselves, especially in terms of tonal balancing and getting the lead characters across right. This could be a decent first step for a franchise that is to yet fire on all cylinders.",Shazam!
107,Abdulxoxo,"Enjoyable, light-hearted superhero flick",7,23 January 2021,"This film loaded with silly humour, but it actually got some clever laughs and its heart is in the right place. When I say that this film has its heart in the right place I mean that it manages to get the balance of comedy and sentimentality without crossing too far over the line into cheesiness. Billy's story involves him not being happy in his foster home and trying to search for his mum. I felt sad for Billy. However, the way we get to know his new foster family, with all their individual quirks, shows us that he's in a safe and loving environment with genuinely good people. It's nice.
When it comes to the superhero stuff I think this film manages to do well at demonstrating action scenes via the use of amazing visual effects. Perhaps near the end the film turned into something we've seen many times before, but it looked good while it was happening. The performances really carry this movie; Zachary Levi suited the role. Because he is actually playing a 14 year old boy he has to portray that convincingly - which he does with ease. He's really funny, and also looked suited to the action stuff as well. But one issue is that, the personalities between the adult and young Billy doesn't match, Zachary Levi is more convincing that's he's a 14 year old boy than younger Billy is. He come as across as very childish as an adult than he is a 14 year old. I hope they correct that in the sequel. Jack Dylan Grazer is pure comedy throughout this movie. His mannerisms are just as impressive as the words coming out of his mouth. He, which was a true supporting performance. Few minor issues i had with the movie is that the villain was too weak and the film did felt slightly too long. In the latter stages when the comedy was lessened and the serious stuff took over I did feel the film begin to lose its identity. The quirky comic superhero film was starting to look like all the others. I know they have to have the big battle between the hero and villain; but it almost lost me when all that stared.
All in all, Shazam is an enjoyable film with some positive morals going on. It has a lots of charms and a fine balance between humor and seriousness.",Shazam!
108,martimusross,"A Really Great Children's Movie, But Adult Superhero Fans Will Be Bored",7,10 April 2019,"I really enjoyed this movie, I was expecting a more adult movie but I quickly realized this was made for very young teenagers, shall we say 12 to no more than 15 years of age. Appreciating it on that level it was great, it had a very strong story, much on the lines of Big(played by Tom Hanks), with a very similar side-kick who was nerdy and geeky and brilliantly played by Jack Grazer..I loved the action sequences, the acting was good, this was an all-round family movie, in much the same way Disney used to make them. As an aside, I wish Disney would return to this sort of linear wholesome story rather that the recent disasters, of Dumbo, Mary Poppins and The Last Jedi, we need movies like Escape From Witch Mountain and Herbie Rides Again, more of this type of children's movie please.I would draw attention to a few things that didn't work very well, but certainly didn't ruin the movie for me;1, We were introduced to a 14 year old boy, Billy Batson, he was rather a cool, calm and sorted teenager on the hunt for his real mother. When later on he became Shazam, being given powers, he became a rather nerdy juvenile idiot who bared little or no resemblance to the character of the personality that had previously been developed. He went from 14 to about 8 years of age I would guess.2, The evil villain, Dr Sivana (played by Mark Strong) was unremittingly evil throughout without any character development in the movie, apart from wanting power we didn't really know anything about this character despite the promise of the earlier scenes.3, Lastly when the final sequence of action began, it just went on too long, there was just to much pursuit, to many special effects and I started to fidget.Overall everyone around me loved this movie and I can see why, Zachary Levi may have overplayed it all (ham Like) but it all fitted with the charming, foolish identifiable character every child would love to know.",Shazam!
109,Troy_Campbell,Doesn't quite scratch the blockbuster itch.,6,6 April 2019,"More a comedy than an action flick, the latest superhero outing for the DC Extended Universe emphasises the direction Warner Bros clearly started taking with last year's ridiculously entertaining Aquaman. Gone is the energy-sapping gloom and doom that permeated throughout the Justice League centric franchise, now replaced by colourful, cartoonish wish fulfilment that goes all in on the goofier side of superheroes. When 14 y.o. foster kid Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is plucked from obscurity by a bizarre underground wizard (Djimon Hounsou), he's given the power to transform at will into the near-invincible hero Shazam, played by man-child Zachary Levi. Although a lot of the funnier moments were in the trailer, when focusing on the titular rookie hero and his amusing sidekick/best friend Freddy Freeman (a scene-stealing Jack Dylan Grazer), the movie kicks goals. Their methods of testing exactly what powers he possesses is often hilariously realistic. The change in tone for this series is welcome, but it's unfortunate that the blockbuster spectacle has seemingly fallen by the wayside. The set pieces on offer here are unfathomably unoriginal and, by the time the final showdown arrives, it has repeated similar action beats ad nauseum. It also makes two terrible decisions in the villainy stakes: employing a seemingly-bored Mark Strong as a one-dimensional megalomaniac and then giving him indistinguishable CGI monster henchmen who grow wearisome quickly. Parents of youngsters beware: although primarily a light-hearted romp there are a few scenes that are emotionally and physically brutal - a board room sequence in particular holding back no punches with its savagery. Amusing enough to serve as a decent slice of escapism, but Shazam! lacks the action awesomeness required to really scratch the blockbuster itch.",Shazam!

Seriously, The Dark Knight trilogy, and Man of Steel are so dark and dreary and overly long, but Shazam was just the right amount. It has action, comedy, and a good storyline. Shazam serves as the 7th film in the DC Extended Universe.Billy Batson is a teen-aged foster kid who has been searching for his mom for years. He is soon placed in a new foster home and reluctantly makes friends with Freddy Freeman, who is a superhero enthusiast. Billy gets called upon by a wizard and gives him his powers because he's pure of heart. Whenever Billy says 'Shazam!' he'll turn into an adult superhero. He and Freddy make videos and show off his powers on the internet.Dr. Thaddeus Sivana finds the wizard and unleashes the seven deadly sins and controls them.

His entire journey with many messy situations is starting from here. A watchable version of comics. Not a single moment will feel you boredom. Villain is also having superpower alias of magical seven black demons capturing his body. As me it is very good attempt by DC and watchable to every kid and family especially in summer vacation.

117,jeremycrimsonfox,Funny Superhero Movie For The Whole Family,8,8 August 2019,"Ever since Man of Steel came out, the movies in the DCEU had taken on a darker, more serious tone, but Shazam breaks that mold by being a superhero comedy in the vein of Deadpool (only not R-rated). Telling the story of Billy Bastion, a young orphan who is chosen by a wizard to inherit his power, he has to figure out how it works with the help of foster brother Freddy, especially when the Seven Deadly Sins are freed by Dr. Sivana, who use him as a vessel.Since this is a movie about a kid who can transform into an superhero who is at the age and size of an adult, there are going to be some comedic situations, and thankfully, this movie not only knows it, but also uses it. Billy's testing of his powers causes some comedy (like jumping into a building, and the charging of telephones), but the movie also has some dark and even emotional moments (like the scene where Billy meets his birthmother). This is a good movie that is worth checking out.",Shazam!

120,one9eighty,DC's version of an average Marvel film,7,12 February 2020,"From the same DC universe that has brought you Batman, Superman, Green Arrow, Suicide Squad, The Flash, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman, comes another comic book superhero - Shazam. Shazam (Zachary Levi) is an interesting character in the comics because he's similar to a lot of other superheroes before and after him, I think of him as being produced from a cauldron of other superheroes traits and abilities - from not just DC, but also from other comic universes like Marvel and Dark Horse too. The story goes that a orphaned 14 year old boy in search of his mother, Billy Batson (Asher Angel), is bestowed magical powers which are unleashed when he says a magic word (in this case, the name ""Shazam""). He is transformed from a child into an adult with all sorts of super abilities (all of which you may have seen on other supers). His biggest weakness is his naivety and youth, which can also be a strength too as it happens. With his new powers it's up to Batson/Shazam to figure out his place in the world, and also defend the world from evil entities - in this case demons that embody the seven deadly sins - which are controlled by, and are empowering Dr Sivana (Mark Strong).This film is a lot less serious than the dark brooding DC films that have come before it, like Superman, Batman, or even The Justice League. It's colourful and light hearted, and this serves it well - and makes it stand apart from the other films. It feels that the film is aimed at a younger audience but isn't too young to exclude older comic/ superhero fans. There is plenty of fun with comedy and laughs aplenty; it's all family friendly. There were times where the story didn't flow as quickly as other parts of the films, but it didn't feel rushed, it just felt a little like somebody wanted to shoehorn some drama into a comedic film. With this being an origin story I guess there is a certain formula to follow, which the film did quite well. Having knowledge of Shazam already the test in my household was how well my partner received the film and truth be told she understood it and didn't ask ""why"", ""who"", and ""what for"" - which is a good sign.It's a decent 'bubblegum' superhero movie that kept me entertained and didn't hurt my brain to watch it. 7 out 10.",Shazam!
121,educallejero,Jack Dylan Grazer (Freddy) is the best,5,7 April 2019,"Asher Angel as Kid Billy was good, not great. Together, they created a super strong (an extremely funny) first act. I was thinking ""8 or 9"" after it. A great start for Freddy and Shazam gave me confidence for the rest of the movie.But then Zachari Levi got more and more screentime. He was vomitive. I didn't laugh ONCE with his jokes. I absolutely despised his interpretation.Also, why the hell a kid would completely change his personality by suddenly being an adult? That's absurd and actually the contrary of funny.Did the writers know that the joke is that a kid is still the same kid, but with the body of an adult? Why a shy, introvert and antisocial Billy would turn into an open, extrovert moron? Whatever. I didn't enjoy it.The story about ""what really is family"" is fine. Done a gazillion times. The 3rd act bored me to almost a comatose state. The action and CGI was between bad and atrocious. The ending, mediocre at best. The emotional conflict forced and its resolution over simplistic.

123,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"""Big"" meets ""Spider-Man: Homecoming""",8,6 June 2019,"As far as self-aware movies go, I think Shazam! (2019) is the best example from the genre of comic book heroes. Deadpool (2016) might have been more ""meta,"" but Shazam! hits all the bits that make comic books popular to kids, especially young boys. As a fan of self-aware films, I would have seen this movie anyway. However, with Zachary Levi in the lead role, I absolutely had to see it. I've generally been a fan of his work from Chuck and Tangled (2010), so seeing that he still has his comedic timing in shows like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel and movies like Shazam! is encouraging.In terms of plot, the premise is somewhat weak, but the pitch is something akin to ""Big (1988), but as a superhero film like Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)."" In fact, there's at least one scene in a mall that winks so hard at this reference, I was afraid it would strain its face. Additionally, I did find the incorporation of a foster family into the narrative was something I have rarely seen in movies, let alone superhero films. I mean, considering how many orphans end up becoming superheroes, it only makes sense that some of them would end up in the foster care system.Even with being a stunningly warm advocate for foster families, Shazam! is basically unadulterated fun (har har). I did appreciate the references to other parts of the DC Cinematic Universe, and it's a little funny to think that this comedy is one of its better entries. Sure, it employs plenty of tropes along the way, most of which have to do with a teen finding himself in the body of a man. If you don't take it too seriously, you'll probably end up being entertained at the very least.Big meets Spider-Man: Homecoming, I give Shazam! 4.0 stars out of 5.",Shazam!
124,RforFilm,"Leap in the air and shout SHAZAM! Shazam! is a fun, hilarious story from D.C.",10,8 April 2019,"As children, we all dream of being superheroes, but how often do we see stories of that happening? Whenever we see an Avenger, Batman or Superman grace the screen for another adventure, they are always adults that have evolved into the role of the cape and the one to save everyone. They'll make fans out of anyone, but let's face it; children are going to be their biggest fans. They're the ones that are innocent enough to not understand that there isn't really a Batman or Superman, but the image alone is still an inspiration that they'll want to try and make a similar impact.We've made it clear that almost all the heroes tend to be adults and the youngest I see it go is Spider-Man, but it's fair to say he's not like other kids or teenagers. Today's movie may be the first that I've seen a more ordinary child become a superhero...sort of. It's kind of a cross of that and the Tom Hanks comedy Big. That was another fantasy that kids got into; the ability to grow up into a grownup without the responsibilities or true concerns of adulthood. Let's see how it ties together in the next D.C. hero, Shazam!.Fourteen year-old Billy Batson (played by Asher Angel) is a homeless foster kid who has spent him life trying to locate his mother who he was separated from at three, but no one has been able to locate her. He eventually gets picked up by the police and is sent to another foster home where he shares a room with a superhero-obsessed kid Freddy Freeman. Billy fights off bullies going after Freddy, but then they chase him in retaliation. Billy escapes onto a subway where it magically takes him to a cavern where a wizard (played by Djimon Hounsou) reveals he's been chosen for special powers.When Billy utters the wizard's name ""Shazam"", he now can turn into an adult superhero (now played by Zachary Levi). Though he appears as a man, he's still a child on the inside. He goes to Freddy who he's able to convince of who he is. The two spend the next couple of days figuring out what his powers are and even have some fun (buying beer, getting money, etc...). The pressure starts to hit Billy when some of his antics almost get people hurt, but a scientist Sivana (played by Mark Strong) also arrives not only has similar powers, but has control of monsters called, ""the seven deadly sins""I'll say now that I really had fun with Shazam!. Compared to the earlier D.C. movies and even Aquaman, Shazam! is the lightest of the movies, feeling more like an 80's family film in the vein of Big and Goonies. Because of this, this feels a tad edgier then modern family movies as these boys aren't afraid to do inappropriate things. What makes this work is that none of them are doing this to be bad, but they feel like kids who learn their lesson and try to be better.Speaking of which, both Asher Angel and Zachary Levi balance out perfectly in their roles as boy and man. Young Billy is a rebellious kid, but it's all in favor of finding his real family. Any kid can relate to this, whether their a foster kid or not. Once we do find out about his mother, I don't want to give it away, but it's not afraid to go to dark places. You know the screenplay is good when it's able to go from goofy & fun tone to dark and serious without it seeming jarring.This is a good direction for Warner Brothers and D.C. who've needed a change from the gloomy Zack Snyder voice in favor of something that's not afraid to embrace its comic book nature. I know nothing about Shazam! and it's comic, but this movies makes me want to explore this character more. This is also proof that not all comic book movies need to follow the Disney and Marvel formula where everything is painstakingly connected. I'll be curious about how this follows the rest of the D.C. story is something is planned. If not, then there's a lot to build from here.I'll give this ten Shazam! comics out of ten. This is a great family movie. This is a great comic book movie. This is a great comedy. This is a great kids movie. This is just great. I highly recommend this at all costs and present this as proof that Marvel may have some competition now.",Shazam!
125,Holt344,"Light-hearted superhero comedy for the whole family, Zachary Levi is Shazam",10,10 April 2019,"With a talented film crew, a great and funny ensemble cast, we got the funniest DC movie yet and with the help of the tone and heavy use of comedy we got everything we wanted but much more. David F. Sandberg directed this masterpiece of superhero movie and he did an excellent job at capturing the characters and atmosphere of our culture and world. I found the movie very entertaining, enjoying it from start to finish, staying funny with jokes and interesting Easter Eggs that fans can see throughout. One of my favorite Easter eggs was the nod to the movie Big as its really a similar story and it was perfect. Well executed movie with superb cinematography and a great soundtrack.The ensemble cast was perfect with big names like Zachary Levi leading the movie as Shazam, he has wanted to do a superhero role and he is perfect as Shazam. Asher Angel portrays the child behind Shazam, Billy Batson and he just shines in the movie as it feels so natural. The whole cast is funny and great in their own way but the other one they stood out was Mark Strong as Dr. Sivana. He played the part with perfection, nailing the villain persona and just acting terrifying.Shazam! Was both a hit at the box office and critical acclaimed, for a good reason. The passion behind this project, both the director and the actors, the whole crew. It shows that they enjoyed working on the film and it's one of the reasons why we the viewers are entertained and feel good watching the film. I also think they did a fantastic job at adapting Billy Batson/Shazam or Captain Marvel to the big screen/live action. I have also read the comic book by Geoff Johns and it's comic accurate.",Shazam!
126,bankofmarquis,Entertaining enough,7,1 September 2019,"In the battle of DC vs Marvel in the Cinematic world, the prevailing theory is that DC is ""righting the ship"" with back-to-back decent films - AQUAMAN and SHAZAM. And...after viewing both of these films, I will agree that they are moving the ship in the correct direction, but they have a long, long way to go before they can say they have ""righted"" this ship.SHAZAM is a fun. light, comedic-ish film that will appeal to kids and tweens and will be considered ""not bad"" by older teens and adults - and that is an improvement for a DC comic book film.Asher Angel stars as Billy Batson, a troubled teenager with family/parental issues (is there any other kind in these types of films?) who is given the power of SHAZAM by a mysterious wizard (the always dependable Djimon Hounsou), when he says the magical word SHAZAM he is instantly changed into the SuperHero SHAZAM. The Superhero part of this character is played by Zachary Levi (TV's CHUCK) and that is the first problem for me with this film, I didn't feel that these 2 actors connected much to form the illusion of 1 person. Asher is all ""broody and moody"" - you know, the way an adult would direct a teenage actor to perform as a troubled teen - while Levi, who is having some fun, looks like he is trying just a bit too hard to showcase his ""inner teenager"" while wrapped inside a body hugging, muscle enhancing costume.Billy Batson is sent to a foster home full of a ""It's A Small World"" group of troubled youth that have - despite their differences - formed into a family. Want to bet that Billy figures out that ""family"" does not mean his mother and father who abandoned him but rather those around you that love and care for you?All of the kids in this ""family"" are well played, as are the ""father and mother"" figures. Standouts are Faithe Herman as smart-as-a-whip/cute-as-a-button Darla and, especially, Jack Dylan Grazer (hypochondriac Eddie in IT: CHAPTER 1) as the lad who becomes Billy's best friend. He is just as fun and charismatic as he was in IT. To be honest, I think I wanted more of a movie about this group of people than the typical ""Super Hero/Super Villain"" film.However, I can forgive this film for focusing on the Hero/Villain dynamic for Mark Strong (SHERLOCK) is wonderfully villainous as the bad guy with daddy issues of his own and ""that guy"" actor John Glover is in it all too briefly as his dad.Director David F. Sandberg (ANNABELLE: CREATION) does a nice job of keeping the action going at a fast enough pace to keep things entertaining - albeit in a way that was rather pedestrian and ""nothing new"". But he aims this film squarely at the older kid/younger tween audience and they will enjoy this very much, whilst the rest of us will not be bored as we accompany them.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Shazam!

128,fernandoschiavi,"Billy Batson can be any of us. Seeming to come straight out of the 80s and 90s, Shazam is a film of another era",7,9 May 2020,"Since the beginning of a shared DC universe and the presentation of the Holy Trinity, the presentation of heroes not so well known by the publisher has been initiated and it is precisely in these heroes that Warner / DC is having the chance to dare a little more, to change one little the tone adopted so far, causing the biggest surprises for critics and the public. In 'Aquaman' we already had a lighter and more fun proposal, a fearless embarkation in fantasy and with 'Shazam' we further deepened this premise.
Being the seventh film in the Extended Universe DC. Shazam is directed by Swede David F. Sandberg - previously known for directing two good horror films Lights Out (2016) and Annabelle- Creation (2017) - this new adventure is very competent when mixing a comedy teenager with touches of family dramas and great action scenes, which differ from everything we've seen in superhero movies.
Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is a lonely 14-year-old who runs away from all the foster homes he goes through, hoping to find his mother, from whom he was separated at a young age. After being sent to a new and welcoming family, the boy ends up being elected by a magician (Djimon Hounsou) to be his champion and then transformed into a super powered being (Zachary Levi) by shouting the word SHAZAM. With the help of his adopted brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer), Billy starts to take advantage of his new condition, until he is confronted by Dr. Silvana (Mark Strong), who also has magical abilities.
One of the great qualities of Henry Gayden's script of 'Earth to Echo (2014)', is to leave behind the pomp and circumstance of Zack Snyder's epic style, based on darkness and tragedy, to invest almost all of his files in humor and in purest youthful grace. Based on the revamped version of the superhero, introduced in 2012, after DC reformulated its entire line of comics with the New 52, the beginning of the plot focuses on more dramatic aspects focusing on facts that would justify the future attitudes of Dr. Sivana and also in the search for young Billy for his mother, having thus fled several adoptive families in the name of this tireless search. It is curious to see how the plot puts hero and villain appearing in a very similar way, obviously with completely opposite motivations. Both the hero and the villain are defined by maternal and parental abandonment, respectively. While the young and ""orphaned"" Billy Batson (Asher Angel) loses his mother as a child, Sivana is rejected by his father during his childhood - and it is the consequences of both disappearances that end up defining their character.
When Billy is forced to move in with a new adoptive family, the film wins with this family interaction and that is precisely one of the highlights of the film. The interaction between this nucleus alone would result in great drama. Until he was received by the family cared for by the couple Rosa and Victor Vasquez (Marta Milans and Cooper Andrews). It is from that moment that Billy starts to feel in a real family with Darla (the great Faithe Herman), Mary (Grace Fulton), Eugene (Ian Chen), Pedro (Jovan Armand) and his new roommate Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer). The family completes the construction of a diverse and welcoming family nucleus. Billy, who always felt out of place, was now facing a real home, with people who like and care about each other, which also makes him feel part of that family.
Billy develops a friendship especially with Freddy. The chemistry between the young actors and also Jack Dylan Grazer with Zachary Levi is the main reason that makes the film work. Levi is excellent at playing a teenager and his talent for comedy is undeniable. Being an adult, but reacting like a teenager, Levi makes the audience laugh out loud in various situations shown. In contrast, it is the teenage version of the hero who is responsible for much of the emotional conflict - and Asher Angel demonstrates that he has the necessary reach. The biggest highlight of the young cast, however, is Grazer, who, in addition to having great chemistry with the central character and exhibiting comic talent, still gives life to a good dramatic passage from the film.
Bringing many of the characteristics of the classic '80s,'Big (1988) ', the plot explores well the question of what it is to be a superhero and the responsibilities that this entails in a boy's life. How would a teenager behave when he learns that he receives superpowers just by saying a single word? Billy, at first, still discovering and learning to deal with new powers, seeks to earn money on the streets by showing off his powers and doing things that a teenager could not do such as buying drinks, posting and gaining status on social media, attending a strip club, dream that every youngster dreams of: reaching adulthood as quickly as possible, but it is only when he reaches such a level that he realizes that his duties, much heavier than any youthful mind can assume, can only be properly performed with the benefit of maturity. Here, too, the script celebrates youthful fascination with superheroes and comics, exploring many of the genre's clichés and mocking the most absurd situations. The countless references to Batman and Superman always appear in a way to cheer comic book fans and to set that story in the extended DC universe (the last scene of the film is the greatest example of this).
Sandberg's direction is appropriate. His experiences with terror are used in order to create tension both in dramatic scenes and in the darkest with the villain and his creatures showing the Seven Deadly Sins in action. Batson's own journey of discovery as Shazam is pure comedy of great quality, but at the same time, laughter and fun moments are alternated with tense scenes that never let the audience forget that evil is coming.
Shazam is a movie made to measure. It offers a lot of fun, a funny villain, but that imposes presence and poses a threat to the hero, good action scenes and interesting visual effects, taking into account a not so high budget, which brings important lessons to be learned by the protagonist, which is very well photographed in the very popular Philadelphia and still brings a snowy atmosphere that brings us to the films of the 80s with extreme competence.
Shazam's message reaches adults, but it is mainly aimed at children leaving the movie theater and following life energized with childhood feelings and the real notion that any one of us could be a hero if the world was in danger and a weird wizard decided to give us his powers. We are facing, once again, a history of greatness and mythical powers, coming from a distant past and coming directly from the Gods of Olympus. However, contrary to what happens with Superman or Wonder Woman, with his special origins, Billy Batson can be any of us. Seeming to come straight out of the 80s and 90s, Shazam is a film from another era.",Shazam!

130,agmoldham,Great for the younger audience.,5,24 April 2019,The one overriding thought I had whilst watching Shazam is that it was a film I would have loved when I was 8-14 years old.The film follows Billy (Asher Angel) who is a teenager searching for his long lost mother. He is placed with a family who look after several other children in a foster home. One of his new brothers Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer) has an interest in superheroes and Billy soon unlocks his own superhero Shazam (Zachery Levi). The story lines are pretty easy to follow and the humour is very adolescent. Fairly certain we will not be seeing this movie appearing in any oscar lists next year. Having said that it's a pretty easy watch and entertaining enough. Sure it's a film which I would have adored if I were 10 years old though.,Shazam!
131,Danusha_Goska,Not as Funny or Light as Reviewers Promised,6,7 April 2019,"Reviewers say that ""Shazam"" is light and funny, that it gets to the heart of being a bullied child and yearning for power, and that it did not display the boring pomposity of so many recent comic book movies. The main character, Billy Batson, is an adolescent boy in the body of a superhero. ""Shazam,"" reviewers promised, is the superhero version of ""Big,"" the 1988 Penny Marshall hit about a boy who magically enters an adult body. The reviewers were only partially telling the truth. ""Shazam"" contains too many scenes that are pompous, hateful, violent, and just plain weird in a movie that suddenly switches into cute, crippled child mode. Zachary Levi, a 38 year old actor who plays Billy Batson, is very good, sweet, funny, and believable as a child in an adult's body, and he deserved a better movie. But he and the producers are raking the bucks.""Shazam"" opens with an assault on those most evil of villains, white, Christian, wealthy, heterosexual, American men. Three males are traveling in a car at Christmas time. Bing Crosby is singing ""Do You Hear What I Hear,"" over the car radio. The father is a vicious creep who mocks his youngest son, sitting in the backseat. His prized first-born is up front with him.Long story short: the youngest son, who is being picked on, is offered power by a wizard, but he blows it because the eye of Sauron offers him the ring of power - no, wait, sorry, wrong fantasy. Basically Satanic beings offer the kid power. This motif is ultimately ripped off from the New Testament's ""Temptation of Christ"" narrative. It's ironic that schlocky Hollywood movies rip off the Bible even as they bash Christianity. Get used to the bashing and the cultural appropriation. There are Christmas trees throughout this movie. The superheroes are all pseudo Messiahs. Nothing new here.The youngest son grows up to be Dr Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong). He's obsessed with gaining the power he couldn't receive when he was a greedy little brat. Eventually Sivana will get that power and use it to murder his abusive brother and father. He walks into a boardroom full of rich, white, Americans. Using demons, he violently murders them all. A couple of observations. Hollywood would never produce a big budget movie that included such a violent, hateful scene where a church or restaurant full of black people were violently murdered. And what the heck is this scene doing in a movie that is supposed to be for little kids? Mark Strong's performance as a man focused on the coldblooded destruction of human life belongs in a serious treatment of some historic atrocity.Anyway. Billy Batson, a foster child, gains superpowers and fights Sivana. You've seen it all before. There are funny, light, ""Big""-like scenes. Their placement in the movie served to make this viewer conscious that this movie could have been different, it could have been thoroughly light, funny, and innovative, and instead it is a mishmash of styles, tone, and agendas.",Shazam!
132,MihaiSorinToma,Another failed idea from the DC universe,4,13 April 2019,"It's one of those movies which tries too hard to be something but simply fails to do so. It tries to be funny and it puts a lot of effort into this aspect but all I got was one or two laughs in over two hours, which is simply unacceptable. It tries to have a story which might keep the viewer interested but it also fails, being mostly boring, linear and way to predictable. You can also add into the equation a couple of boring characters which are quite hard to like and you get a recipe for a failed movie like this one is. It seems aimed towards children, especially judging by the amount of them who are features in this movie, but it wouldn't be the case either, as a child would consider it too stupid, as I mostly did myself.To be honest, it's very hard to find something good about this movie, regardless of the approach. It isn't funny, it doesn't have good characters, it doesn't have a good story (far from it actually), the action is meh while the CGI is the only aspect which keeps it alive. I don't understand what is there to like about this movie, but the way I see it, it is bad. Even though I wasn't expecting much from it, judging by the previous DC inspired flicks and its trailer but it still managed to disappoint me.",Shazam!
133,markthomassintek,will appeal to all ages,9,7 April 2019,"REVIEW - SHAZAMRecently Marvel released Captain Marvel, but originally Captain Marvel wasn't the female superhero we all now know.Captain Marvel started as a male and in the 1940s was actually more popular than Superman and was later renamed Shazam.Shazam is actually an acronym made from the names of the gods who gave the Wizard Shazam his powers and this was passed down (originally Captain Marvel).Solomon - Wisdom.
Hercules - Strength.
Atlas - Stamina.
Zeus - Power.
Achilles - Courage.
Mercury - Speed.We have recently seen a huge amount of superhero films so essentially is this any different?DC has always made dark superhero films where as Marvel has injected humour into theirs, also interestingly what started as a Marvel character has been released under the DC label and actually this benefits the film enormously because in places it is dark (DC) and in others it is laugh out loud (Marvel) and it works a treat!A number of stories culminating into a surprisingly good film which will appeal to all ages. I love the little homage to BIG for example.Rating 9 out of 10",Shazam!

135,afonsobritofalves,One of the best D.C. movies.,8,18 April 2019,"One of DC's best films I once thought that DC was going to come crashing down, because of all the box office disasters they were shooting, they did not make a really good movie since 2012, but then came ""Wonder Woman"" ""Aquaman"" and now ""Shazam!"" to save D.C. Studios.
I found the movie to be really good, with a fabulous story line, incredible characters, a very good soundtrack and a sound mix worthy of oscar. The actors are very good, I do not know which is really the best, besides, they represent fabulous characters.
I just find something that I have found in all the movies in the shared universe of D.C. Universe, I think they are going too fast, they are presepitar a lot, and they are presenting us some things that would be more interesting to introduce us later.
Highly recommend!",Shazam!
136,silvermistvio,Less serious superhero film.,5,13 May 2019,"Shazam is the very first film I watched that was very different from any other superhero stories. I kind of like those kinds of films that are serious. I feel like this film isn't one of them. I mean I like comedy, but I don't like the film goes in some way that is less serious. Comedy and not being serious aren't the same. So, Shazam is that kind of film. Maybe it's because the main character is a kid. But no matter what, I feel like it's a bit inferior than any other superhero films.The story is quite simple, and watchable. But not being serious really makes me annoyed. And also, I like that kind of superhero stories where there's only one superhero. In this one, there are six superheroes. It makes me uncomfortable and difficult to accept. But in the story line, they already stated that there will be more than superheroes by showing a lot of thrones at that place where young Billy first met that old man Shazam. So, I can't say anything anymore, but to accept it.I feel like Shazam character is another version of Superman. The only difference is that when he says Shazam to turn the superhero life on and off. The other abilities (such as bullet proof, etc.) are like Superman. Seems like DC created it based on the Superman.This film is a mixture of superhero story and some comedy. So, some scenes are funny. I loved those scenes. But I don't like Freddie took Dr. Sivanna to his home. I know that that scene needs to be in the film because it's the only way of getting the film forward. I feel like Freddie betrayed Billy.There's one thing I don't like of Billy character. He freaking likes to show-off. That kind of person shouldn't be a superhero. So, I'd say I don't like Shazam that much.According to a credit scene, I guess there will be sequel. Shazam fans will be happy for it.All in all, Shazam is just an ordinary film even though the other things, such as special effects, sound mixing and editing (and etc.) are good. As for one who likes being serious, this isn't a good film for you. And its bad. But for the others, it will be. No matter how bad, it's worth to watch at least once.",Shazam!
137,ofpsmith,Nice to see DC not trying to be dark for once.,8,30 September 2019,"After the monster success of Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy it semed that DC decided that the only way to success was to be dark and gritty. This, at least, is what they apparently did with Man of Steel, Batman vs. Superman, Suicide Squad, and Justice League. The difference is that Nolan knew what he was doing. Personally I thought Man of Steel was just okay (wheras everyone else either loved or hated it) and Justice League was neither good nor bad. But then Wonder Woman came out and people thought that there could be hope for the DCEU, focusing on a deemphasized shared universe. And the story continues with Shazam. Shazam is clearly made to be a fun movie which is something that's been missing from DC for a while it seems. And that's why we go see movies anyways. To be entertained. It reminded me a lot of those 80s kids movies like E.T. and The Goonies which also seem to be making a resurgence with things like Stranger Things and the new It adaptation that came out two years ago. The movie's not perfect but it doesn't need to be. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a while and it's on that testimony that I urge you to see it.",Shazam!
138,kjproulx,One of the Best of the Recent DC Films,8,5 April 2019,"The films in the world of the DC Universe haven't exactly been smooth sailing from the beginning, but I would definitely say they've found their stride in these last few years. From standalone films like Wonder Woman and Aquaman, they're proving that taking a step back is sometimes the best thing to do. Shazam! is the latest film to be added to this collection of movies and while some may view it as incredibly cheesy, I believe the majority of audiences will find it to be an absolute blast as I did. Here's why, when Shazam! hits theatres, you should definitely seek out a screening of it.Following young Billy Batson at a very pivotal point in his life, after having lost his mother and jumped between foster homes throughout the years, he may have finally found one that works for him. Making friends with one of the foster kids in Freddy Freeman, he's interrogated about what superpowers he would love to have. Little does he know that he's about to stumble upon a magical wizard who will grant him numerous abilities and be able to turn himself back and forth between boy and man. This may sound silly and that's because it is, but it's all done in good fun and the story plays out very well on-screen.When going into a film like this, you need to know what you're in for, otherwise, you may find yourself cringing at the cheesiness of it all. Shazam! embraces its cheese and pokes fun at classic films that it's clearly borrowing from and even pokes fun at the fact that this film even exists in the same world as movies like Man of Steel or Aquaman. That being said, you absolutely don't have to see any prior films, because this movie truly does stand on its own, which was a breath of fresh air. In terms of pure enjoyment, this movie fires on all cylinders and hits all the right notes, being a near-perfect film for what it's striving to be.On the other hand, where I feel this film continuously took a nose dive was within the villain subplot. While Mark Strong gives his all here and commits to creating a great character, the certain characters around him and the burden that comes with the powers he has, felt very strange and out of place in my opinion. Aside from that, I really have nothing to complain about, but these things are very much present on multiple occasions throughout the movie and I wasn't a big fan of them. The idea behind them was interesting, but the overall execution just didn't quite work for me.In the end, Shazam! is a fantastic, comedic superhero flick, with a few minor weaknesses throughout. Zachary Levi as the leading man is the reason to see this movie alone, as his charisma and chemistry with Jack Dylan Grazer is absolutely amazing. Aside from a few annoying aspects, there is so much to love about this movie. I had a blast with it and I think you will too. I definitely recommend checking this one out when it hits theatres.",Shazam!
139,kuarinofu,Actually pretty good,8,16 July 2019,"Shazam is not a perfect movie by far, but it's self-aware, and it doesn't try to be anything it's not. It's tight, it's well-paced, a little predictable though, but also quite emotional and moving. Sure said, it approaches some things lightly and childishly, but this is what it is supposed to be - a well-made comic action for kids and teens that also has some functional elements of a family film. I loved how it had some darker moments while keeping the overall lifted vibe.Yes, the story is far too simplified and had a ton of holes, the CGI was quite noticeable at times, but the movie was made with care, and it shows. I was afraid that it would get too cheesy in the end, but ended up being ok and not cringy at all. And it's funny, which you don't see often in modern Hollywood.A good and fun ride that will share its emotion with you.",Shazam!
140,Carycomic,Reviewer Flashbatmanquestion is half-right.. This movie really is just okay.,5,6 April 2019,"I know the producers were trying to make this one a little more light-hearted in mood than the other DCEU flicks that have come before it. But, instead, they over-compensated with humor that can only be described as self-parodic. And, take my word for it; that is most definitely _not_ a good thing!I was a little kid in elementary school when BATMAN '66 was just a prime-time series simply called ""Batman."" I was a pre-teen in middle school when Michael Gray played Billy Batson, opposite William Tremayne as Mentor, in the live-action Filmation series called ""Shazam."" And corny and campy as some of those shows' episodes might have been, the humor was still more bearable than half the intentional jokes in this origin flick. I know; I know! This version of Billy Batson was supposed to reflect a more realistic version of adolescent youth. He's supposed to be living proof that purity of heart is not necessarily the same as morally flawless. Because even the most well-polished diamond still has its share of flaws! And 21st-century Billy is supposed to be just like the title character in the original Disney version of ALADDIN: a diamond in the rough.The fact remains that the writers have tried too hard to make him the DC/Warner version of Peter Parker. But, that isn't a good thing either. And that goes double for the subtle jabs at the Tom Hanks classic, BIG.Mark Strong, as Dr. Thaddeus B. Sivana, provides the only semblance of truly suspenseful seriousness. While the transformation of Billy's foster siblings into Mary Shazam, Capt. Shazam Junior, and the three Lieutenants Shazam (to go partially Old School with the nomenclature) nicely balances that suspense with a sense of satisfaction that Billy is finally getting his head out of his self-pitying butt by realizing a true family doesn't always have to be biologically related to you!In short? If you have kids of your own, ranging from five to fifteen, take them to see this film because they're bound to enjoy it more than you. But, if you're single? Stick with CAPT. MARVEL from Marvel Films. It's 51% action-packed/49% campy. Which is the more preferable ratio for the over-30 crowd (like me).",Shazam!

143,Darkside-Reviewer,Almost perfect DC,7,13 May 2019,I'd like to start out by saying I am big fan of both DC and Marvel movies and have read countless comics including Shazam.I enjoyed 75% of this movie it starts out very strong and makes you want more as the story progresses and Billy starts to learn his powers I couldn't help but laugh because he does things that we would all do if we had powers such as using our electric powers to charge our phones and shoot lightning from out fingertips help people in need and perform feels of strength while drinking 40 cans of Dr Pepper he is still just 14 years old with the powers of a God and we would all do and act the same if it was us.The comedy is very good and highlights the fun parts of being a super hero the action scenes while not to many are very well shot the CGI is good even the costumes look well done for something done in CGI.There are only 2 issues I have with this movie the first being that for a light hearted and fun super hero movie it touches on some heavy issues such as child abandonment Billys mother who was just 17 and had a 3 year old lost him at a fair ground and she never found him and he is put into foster care later in the movie he tracks down his mother after 11 years and she tells him she left him on purpose while that itself is heavy she then says she still doesn't want him in her life to which he walks away and it's not mentioned again in the movie which was to serious a subject to touch upon in a movie with such a comedic tone to it.The second issue being in the final fight of the movie Billy/Shazam makes his 6 foster siblings wizards and shares his power with them to fight the bad guy and after defeating him they are now imbued with the same powers as he is and they are also children 2 younger than he is which means the 7 wizards in the Shazam universe are children making future sequels to this movie ridiculously stupid as fans don't wanna see 7 children fighting alongside superman or the rest of the Justice League Shazam should of stayed Solo.Apart from those issues this movie is great hopefully DC will continue to put out movies of this quality in the future and learn from them.I recommend watching this movie if your a Comic book fan or just like watching superhero movies and laughing.,Shazam!
144,Marwan-Bob,A bit Predictable.,7,9 April 2019,"Really fun movie i really enjoyed it, but it has its flaws...Overall, Shazam is a good entertainer and a boost for DCEU.",Shazam!
145,msbreviews,Rating: B+,8,4 April 2019,"If you enjoy reading my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)First of all, I didn't know anything about Shazam. What his powers were, what story did he have ... Basically, I didn't know who he was. This is what David F. Sandberg's movie does best: introduce the audience to a new DC superhero, by delivering an uncommonly well-structured comic-book screenplay, packed with laughter and entertaining action. Zachary Levi is undoubtedly the standout! Not only is he hilarious, but he perfectly captures the childlike personality that a kid-turned-adult would have. His expressions of absolute surprise and awe of his powers are extremely precious, and he effortlessly carries the more lighthearted tone on his shoulders.Asher Angel is brilliant as Billy Batson. His character has a notably well-written and well-explored backstory, which eventually justifies the person he has become. It's the most emotional and heartfelt subplot of the film (probably the only one, really), and Henry Gayden did a fantastic job writing its script. It doesn't feel cliche or over-the-top, it actually feels grounded and quite realistic. Jack Dylan Grazer plays his best friend, Freddy Freeman, and he's the primary source of self-aware comedy. He knows all the cliches regarding superheroes and supervillains, so his jokes constantly land and play seamlessly into the last act.Usually, villains tend to be hollow characters with paper-thin motivations, but since a few years ago, this issue has gradually been corrected. The latest comic-book movies have incredibly well-developed villains, who carry a compelling backstory that entirely supports their beliefs, but not their actions. This type of villains work because not only the audience can understand where they come from, but in some cases, they can even connect with and care about them. Dr. Thaddeus Sivana is not exactly someone the audience ends up caring about, but his backstory is emotionally powerful enough for us to understand where his motivations originate from. Mark Strong delivers a menacing performance, and his costume/make-up looks pretty badass.The first act is kind of a mixed bag. It starts in a very captivating way, and once you understand who's the character at the center, it gets even better. However, the film's tone takes long to establish itself, and the beginning of the movie struggles to find which jokes land and which don't. The humor is on-point throughout the rest of the runtime, but those first few jokes not so much, which threw me off a little bit. The action sequences are amazing, and the sound design allows the audience to feel every punch, kick, a fall on the ground or a Superman-ish take-off. The fight sequences are seamlessly edited, and you know how much I love well-choreographed or well-edited action scenes.Shazam's search for his powers provides the funniest and most entertaining moments of the film. Each test that he puts himself through is both hilarious and informative. This is another aspect of the screenplay I love so much: they had several ideas of how to approach this segment, and they nailed every single execution. From the pop-culture references to the hero-villain cliches, Sandberg did a terrific job exploring those concepts, and he executed them flawlessly. The best jokes are the ones that can be funny on different levels for different people. If people can laugh at a particular scene solely due to it, but other people can laugh even more because that moment means so much more to them, that's when you know a joke is perfect. Shazam is not only funny for comic-book fans, everyone can leave the theater entertained and jolly.It's still a straightforward superhero movie. There's still a villain to defeat, and the film goes through all of the cliches that it makes so much fun of. Everyone knows how it's going to develop, plot point by plot point, a few minutes in. Not that I consider this a flaw, it's just ... It is what it is. The final battle drags too much, and it keeps ending and restarting every five minutes. It does have a pretty cool conclusion, but it takes a bit too long to get there. Also, and I know that this is one of those logical nitpicks that CinemaSins are known for digging, but the flashbacks and time-jumps could have received better treatment concerning the age of the characters. One thing is to think that the characters would look much older/younger than what they display on-screen, but when they make them look exactly the same in the span of 30/40 years ... Not so acceptable.All in all, Shazam is a blast! It's the most entertaining movie I've seen so far this year, and it's freaking hilarious. It continues the comic-book films trend to change how villains are written, by delivering a well-developed bad guy, menacingly portrayed by Mark Strong. Every member of the cast gives a strong performance, but Zachary Levi steals the show. His whimsical attitude, reckless personality, and rich facial expressions are guaranteed to entertain you for most of the runtime. Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer are outstanding as the young kids, and the former's backstory carries emotional impact which passes on to the big guy he transforms himself into.The action is packed with beautifully-edited sequences, powerful sound design, and cool, unique moments, but the supposedly climactic final battle drags too much. The first act struggles to find its rhythm and its tone, but once it gets going, it's an exceptional journey. The best praise I can give Sandberg's movie is that I didn't know anything about Shazam before entering the theater, and now I can't wait for its sequel. Well-directed, well-written and remarkably entertaining. What more can I ask? Go see it!",Shazam!

Though not a great one I must point out. First few minutes of the film promised us of an emotional impact but sadly that angle never made a mark. As for the performances go, everyone pretty much acted well. Specifically Adult Billy (Zachary Levi) and Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer). Their on screen chemistry looked solid and gave us some hilarious moments as well. Mark Strong as the super villain looked decent and had some backstory too. But I must say that same kind of backstory should have been added for the other characters as well. I couldn't really relate to all of them in the way I intended to. Coming from directing horror genre to this light hearted superhero flick, I adore what Mr. Sandberg did here but unfortunately it's not that caliber of a film to remember for a very long period of time. It will just be a sidekick to the DC universe rather than a integral part.",Shazam!

153,MrDHWong,One of the most ridiculously fun and entertaining superhero films that does not come from Marvel,9,4 April 2019,"Shazam! is a superhero film based on the DC Comics character of the same name. Starring Zachary Levi in the title role, it is one of the most ridiculously fun and entertaining superhero films in a long time that does not come from Marvel.In Philadelphia, fourteen-year-old Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is taken in by a foster family after another run-in with police while searching for his lost mother. While there, Billy befriends his paraplegic roommate Freddie Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer) who has affinity for superheroes. One day, Billy is whisked away from a subway by a mysterious wizard who bestows Billy with incredible super powers by yelling the name ""Shazam"" out loud.With just the right amount of action and humour, Shazam! is proof that DC is indeed on the correct path and are now healthy competition with Marvel. The film flawlessly weaves its comic relief and heart into every scene with its own distinct flavour, never once feeling as though it is stealing from those before it. This is equalled by the solid action scenes, which thanks to the creative direction of David F. Sandberg, are pure joy to watch. Zachary Levi truly owns the role as Shazam! and his constant switching between him and his younger self played by Asher Angel was brilliantly handled, with clear influence taken from the 1988 Tom Hanks movie ""Big"". Be sure to stay back after the credits for two bonus scenes.I rate it a solid 9/10",Shazam!
154,Alexander_Blanchett,Nice fun,8,13 April 2019,"Nice touch for DC to go the ""smoother"" root with a superhero film that doesnt take itself too seriously. It was fun and definitely aiming towards the younger audience but that didn't hurt the quality at all.
Zachary Levi was perfectly cast in the lead role as Shazam and convinces with his innocent and self ironic charmes. I also liked the kid. Especially Asher Angel was great. Mark Strong made as always a great villain. Nice to see Djimon Hounsou in a DC-fied Gandalf. The soundtrack worked perfectly and I liked the script and generally the direction. The film was indeed very corny and generally a huge bag of fun.
I hoped for som DC cameos but I guess you can't have everything. Really entertaining, a bit overlong in general but I think thats the time you need to tell a good story.",Shazam!
155,cardsrock,DC does it again,8,14 April 2019,"WB and DC finally seem to be figuring out how to handle their comic book characters. The focus of the movie is firmly on Billy Batson and is part of the reason the film is so endearing. Seeing a child superhero is refreshing and honestly pretty comical. Shazam! is definitely the funniest film in the DC universe and one of the funniest superhero movies out there. The film devolves into the usual superhero climax in the third act, but everything up to that is very unconventional and creative. All of the kid actors are great, as is Zachary Levi. Shazam! is terrific fun and a unique entry in the superhero genre.",Shazam!
156,CANpatbuck3664,Undeniably Charming and Pretty Solid Overall,8,19 April 2019,"Shazam! is of the more family friendly variety but despite having that kind of pretty packaging, there were scenes in Shazam! that were dark and unflinching. The beginning is very sobering, it's reminiscent of Guardians 1 where you think you're stepping into this zany comedy and you get slapped with a dramatic beat right off the bat. You also know that with Billy being an orphan, there will be some time spent in pursuit of his birth parents. With this being a softer entry in the genre, you would also expect a redemptive arc for Billy's mom. Ya.... that's not the case here (his subplot with his birth mom concludes in an unfortunately realistic and sadly honest way). That was impressive but add on top of that the genuinely funny humour in this that isn't afraid to wink at the audience or play with genre tropes. It very much danced around being a child friendly Deadpool without fully committing to it. I really dug the bits where they just set aside the inherent danger of the situation and just have fun with the circumstances (the scene where the convenience store gets robbed and the learning about his powers montage amp up the comedy in a ridiculous way). They stray from the beaten path in these two ways and they're the best moments in the movie. It definitely helped Shazam stand out and helped bring me in.Shazam also embraces something that more superhero movies could stand to make a focal point. The movie is so gleeful about the superhero concept and they refuse to let the conflict bring down the fun vibe the rest of the movie is going for. Again, Guardians 1 comes to mind where there are dramatic moments at the forefront but you never stop laughing or getting bogged down by it. Shazam! is so wrapped up in the fun possibilities of a teenager having God like powers that it rubs off on you. I was never unaware when the movie would make a mistake but it was hard to be too critical of it because of how it bounced from scene to scene without getting bogged down.The benchmark of acting in this genre has been set really high and to even come close, you have to do something pretty extraordinary. Zachary Levi doesn't hit the ball into the upper deck but this is still a homerun of a performance. He fits this character like a glove, he's so earnest in his portrayal of this teenager playing with his newfound powers that I was never not impressed with what he accomplished (even if Shazam gets a little annoying as a character, its not Levi's performance which is consistent and well done). Mark Strong was able to pull something off that many actors couldn't. Dr. Sivana is not an engrossing or deep villain, he has an interesting backstory/motivation but we spend very little time with him before he gets his powers as an adult. Its literally Strong's presence and charisma that makes it work and I thought this was a feat by itself. Getting to the kids, I thought Jack Dylan Glazer ran circles around Asher Angel. Angel isn't terrible, he's just withdrawn and unemotional where Glazer is very animated and slinging jokes constantly. The rest of the child cast gets the job done, their characters are all one note so they don't get much of an opportunity to stretch. I would also like to compliment Megan Good and Adam Brody for being pretty funny in their limited amount of screen time.While I was charmed by this movie, I never was short of any missteps to point out. In an effort to appeal to families, Shazam falls into some of the genre cliches while it so adeptly avoids others. I don't think this was a mistake however, it felt like a concession to make the movie easier to digest for the younger audience. It led to Shazam being downright corny and I rolled my eyes a few times but while I would have liked a more unconventional film, I get why they went in the direction they did. Some of the more annoying parts (the repetitive threat of Billy ""almost"" running away or Billy and Freddy's incessant arguing in the middle of the film) had to be there and I had to shrug it off. The movie runs a little long at 2.25 hours, I don't know what they could have cut out but a tighter edit would have helped. I also would have liked to have spent some more time on the Wizard (Djimon Hounsou) and his conflict with the 7 deadly sins, it would have helped flesh out Dr. Sivana's character and understand the Wizard's fear of these things getting out into the world again.Shazam! isn't a movie I'm going to visit over and over again but I had a lot of fun watching it in the theatre and for most of the run time, I had a big grin on my face. It's got problems (I saw this with a friend who was complaining about it most of the ride back) but just like the critics, I got swept up in the ride. This is good entry in the expanding DC universe and its a big leap ahead of Aquaman (which despite Momoa's bravado was still mediocre at best). I'm happy to give Shazam! a 8/10 and if you haven't gone to see it with the family (there are some dark moments so don't bring the really young children), its worth checking out in the theatre. I wouldn't recommend the 3D version though, it impacts very little and you'll get the same experience from the regular print.",Shazam!
157,cliftonofun,Sometimes ridiculous works...mostly.,6,20 April 2019,"Shazam
This movie is about as comic book-y as it gets. From silly hero costumes to ridiculous plot set-ups, the story feels like it is pulled straight from a super friends episode in the early 80s. There are pros and cons there. Embracing the ridiculousness really pays off comedically; the movie is at its best when it is essentially ""Big"" with super powers, and Levi and Grazer make for a great combo during those scenes. However, that same ridiculousness is responsible for some of the characters (from our super villain to our super friends/family) feeling more like cardboard cut-outs than real people, and all those relationships develop a little too quickly. I basically wanted to watch WAY more comedy and WAY less action, because that's what this story was made for. I was entertained enough, but there were some missed opportunities there.",Shazam!
158,garabedian123,Better and more violent than Venom~,9,10 April 2019,"Yeah..read my title. Can you believe this children's movie has more action, more violence and more adult humor than Venom?

159,elicopperman,Surprisingly Very Fun DC Venture,7,13 April 2019,"Ever since its inception, the DC Extended Universe has been a rather polarized take on Hollywood's attempted cinematic commodity series. Whether it'd be controversial misfires like Suicide Squad and any of Zack Snyder's contributions, or genuine hits like Wonder Woman and Aquaman, the company has been hitting as many duds as successes, if not more. However, out of the bloom came this relatively low budget flick with a slightly more light hearted comedic tone mixed in called Shazam. Despite taking place in a universe known for attempting to emulate a darker side to the genre, the film seems to go in the vein of Spiderman: Homecoming; a smaller and simpler coming of age tale disguised as a superhero flick. But how does it work in the end?The film centers around 14-year-old foster child Billy Batson, who is given the powers of the wizard named Shazam, but has to master them soon before the evil Dr. Thaddeus Sivana can get his hands on said magical abilities. Right off the bat, what makes this film relatively heartfelt than most of DC's other ventures are the characters. Billy can be described as an emotionally troubled individual, as all the stuff he goes through can really speak to anybody dealing with the loss of love in their life. Not to mention, his foster family are very memorable and likable, from the hyperactive albeit earnest Freddy, to the curious Darla, to the intellectual gamer Eugene, to even the worrisome Mary. While they are mainly supporting characters, they still come off as either decent role models to Billy or reminders of how important family is, a theme prevalent throughout that I cherish deeply.Compared to other ventures in this cinematic universe, Shazam goes for a more humorous approach within itself. A lot of verbal humor, witty banter, goofy slapstick and even meta references play afloat, and most of the jokes land really well. There's never a dull moment whenever Billy and Freddy are testing out Shazam's powers, and Zachary Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer really sell the appropriate reactions needed for the material they worked with. In addition, the movie knows how to contrast between its fun side and the more menacing aesthetic regarding Sivana and his army of the seven deadly sins. Whenever they are around, the stakes become surprisingly high for a PG-13 film. Sometimes the tone can get a little jumbled, but the proper balance is still there to keep the feature tightly structured without going overboard.In terms of any given flaws though, the film does run a bit too long for its own good. In this day and age where most superhero movies try to go for longer lengths, this film feels unnecessarily stretched out, particularly in the climax. I think the battle scene took up more than a quarter of the run time, and while it does build some character development, it could've run for about 10 or even 15 minutes to not overstay its welcome. Also, there are times when the smaller budget aspects become obvious, like the noticeably off blue screen effects and the hit or miss results of the CGI sins. That, and in addition to some rather mundane looking cinematography, some of the fight scenes are no better than that of Spiderman: Homecoming or Batman v Superman due to how shaky and overwhelming they come off as, something that these films need to work on.Overall, despite having some noticeable flaws, Shazam is a highly entertaining superhero film that has surprisingly more feels than the average comic book flick these days. Part of what makes it memorable is how the heart of it all comes off as very genuine given the subject matter, especially from a depressed kid learning to be more aware of those who care for him. Regardless if you're a superhero fan or a movie buff in general, I'd say give this one a watch for the comedy, suspense and even drama. I think what makes DC so special to many is how they are able to mix in humor with stories of special individuals coming to terms with the extraordinary events that come into their lives, be it powers or family. If the company keeps on this type of track for some time, they might have a better looking future pretty soon.",Shazam!

Boy to buffed out dude this movie is fun. Great energy from the leads. As with most body swapped movies...or in something silly as ""Face/Off"" you look for the mannerisms to key in to whether or not it works. For the most part...it works. Though, sometimes it feels as though he's a bit more worldly than his age. This is the lighter family based movie both comic book behemoths seem to forget. That family does mean a lot and in Billy Batson's case, it's heartbreaking. Stories about finding family are winners in my book. Because in ""Shazam"" it's grounded in something less...uh...diabolically government. Or a school about misfit toys. The ""kids"" in this film (while obviously picked for diversity) don't wallow in emotional pain. They like that they ended up where they are. How refreshing to also see parents who aren't wicked. They're kind and supportive...a zest for life cored in spirituality (without heavy handed Christianity). There's so many good things that they sidestepped in most superhero films that when they lean on a trope you do groan a little. But that's fine since it has many self-referential nods that are part of the humor.
Overall..a fun movie to watch. Silly in a lot of regards but it has a great heart.",Shazam!

166,Java_Joe,It's corny but fun.,7,9 April 2019,"Let's face it, DC movies haven't done all that well at the box office. Sure they have dedicated fans and people that like them because they're not Marvel but for the most part they've been pretty heavily panned. There have been some successes but for the longest time the old adage ran true. Namely when a Marvel movie came out people asked ""will this be the one that sucks""? And when a DC movie came out people asked, ""will this be the one that works?"" And after a long time it looks like DC is getting it that dark and gritty isn't what people want. That might have worked for Batman, but not anything else.And so we're introduced here to Shazam. And let me say right off I liked this movie. It was fun. There were some great scenes. And the movie didn't take itself way too seriously as befits the story. It's corny and it's cheesy but in the right way. I've heard people refer to it as being like the Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies and I can see why. There's that feel about it that they want to tell a story but they want to have fun while doing it.Shazam is the story of young orphan Billy Batson who one day finds himself in the lair of a wizard. A lair that you get to when using the subway. Don't ask. I never really got that part either. But the wizard sees the good in Billy and offers him power in exchange for saying the wizard's name. So when young Billy Batson shouts ""Shazam!"" he's struck by a bolt of magical lightning which turns him into Captain Marvel... sorry that name is now trademarked to the Marvel Comics Company and he needs to no go by the name ""Shazam"".He's a little like Superman, but powered by magic instead of yellow solar energy. But never forget underneath it all, he's still only 10 years old. Meaning that it's that much cooler. Who didn't want super powers at that age? The character is pure wish fulfillment and I'm perfectly okay with that.It's a fun movie with some laughs and hopefully this is showing DC that they need to tweak their formula a bit if they want to start catching up to Marvel.",Shazam!

168,danielmanson,"Little predictable, but very fun",7,23 October 2021,"So I finally decided to give this a go and I have to say, I'm a little annoyed I waited this long, because it's a very fun film.So what put me off initially was that from the trailer it seemed a bit too silly and childish and I'm not too fond of that humour. But I have to say it was done very well and I didn't find it daft at all.So as my title says, I did find the film I little predictable. You could see what direction the film was heading in early doors and it never really veered from that path. I felt like it was just missing that ""wow"" factor to break this movie into 8/10 and beyond. It was very down the middle lane kind of film, which don't get me wrong there's nothing wrong with that. But I just wanted a little more.Sticking with the plot theme. It kept me entertained throughout and I remained interested for the entire 2 hours or so. So clearly it did something right! My only negative on this subject was that I thought they expanded in the wrong areas. So the first 45 mins or so was developing the characters so we didn't even see ""Shazam"" until 45 mins in. Then it sort of whizzed through the 'dealing with the idea he has powers' phase and went straight into the overly long end sequence. I feel like they could have done more with the mid section and even shortened the beginning and end to do so.Beyond that though I thought the characters were great and they were all likeable and the arcs were also fun and interesting to get stuck in. And overall it was just enjoyable and a fun watch. It does what you expect it to do! The humour isn't over the top, stupid nor overdone and it's not complicated either. Yeah I'd recommend this if you're debating it. It's enjoyable!",Shazam!

The actors are good, especially Faithe Herman (so cute), Jack Dylan Grazer (perfect sidekick with a mischievous attitude) and ... Zachary Levi of course who plays masterfully the 'super hero next door'.The atmosphere is completely different compared to the previous DC movies: dark with the Batman trilogy and then Batman versus Superman, relaxed with Aquaman, ... In Shazam, the atmosphere is wacky! So much so that I absolutely do not know what a movie with Ben Affleck / Batman and Zachary Levi / Shazam would look like. Curious cocktail undoubtedly!To be enjoyed with buddies or family (it's primarily intended for children and teens, but not exclusively).",Shazam!
171,PyroSikTh,As Fun and Wholesome as it is Dark and Terrifying,8,9 April 2019,"Shazam! follows 14-year old Billy Batson, who's been jumping from foster home to foster home, but never gave up on the mother he lost at a carnival when he was little. He's taken in by a happy and wholesome foster family unit, but still struggles to fit in. After standing up against some bullies for his foster-brother, he's transported to a wizard's lair where he reluctantly accepts the wizard's powers, transforming him into Captain Marvel*. From there we get Billy adjusting to his newfound powers as well as his very sudden adulthood. Of course him and his foster-brother use this to their advantage, earning money, sneaking into strip clubs, buying alcohol, and occasionally taking out the odd bad guy as well.It's all a light-hearted romp where our hero enjoys having fun in the innocence of childhood. The comedy is on-point with some genuinely good jokes - mostly reminiscent of Big - revolving around a child in a grown-up's body. Zachary Levi taps into his inner teenager perfectly, but managing to balance it with being a buffed-up superhero at the same time, and the awe and wonder one would have at having those powers. That coupled with the foster family dynamics makes for a thoroughly wholesome movie that you can't help but smile at. It's just so nice and warm.Parallel to this we also see the story of Thaddeus Sivana. In fact the film opens with Sivana being transported to the Wizard's lair and failing the test, only to be returned back to his abusive and uncaring father and brother. Years of resentment and anger lead him to seek out others who have been invited to the Wizard's lair, but also failed the test, in order to find his way back and get the powers he thinks he deserves. In doing so, he unleashes the Seven Deadly Sins, and uses them as the source of his power instead.Dr. Sivana's story represents a big juxtaposition to the rest of the movie, tapping into the dark and horrific. The scenes around him become as cold and violent as his character, often feeling like this otherwise light and wholesome film flips into horror territory. The Seven Deadly Sins are nightmarishly demonic in appearance, and one scene in particular (in a boardroom) is about as violent and terrifying as a 12A movie can be. One guy gets chucked out of a window, one guy gets his head bitten off, another torn to shreds (from his wheelchair no less). But the darker moments aren't just restricted to Sivana and his demonic troupe. Moments in Billy's life can take a dark and dramatic turn as well, and no scene stings quite as badly as the rejection he suffers from his own mother when the reality of the Carnival hits him. Both Billy and Sivana come from abused and unwanted households, but the difference is Billy got out (without realising), while Sivana was stuck in that toxic environment. Oddly enough these darker and more serious moments don't feel out of place or jarring, but instead enhance and balance the rest of the Shazam story/origin. They offer real stakes, and ensures that all the jokes and happier moments are grounded and oddly realistic. DC/Warners, if you want a dark/light formula for your movies, Shazam! is the one to follow.There's plenty in the movie for more hardcore comics/Shazam fans as well. While I'm no connoisseur by any means, I know enough about the Shazam mythos to anticipate and get excited about certain events and cameos. Black Adam is mentioned briefly in an offhand line from the Wizard, Mister Mind appears in a jar (and in the post-credits), there's a cameo from the Crocodile-Men, Billy shows a fondness for tigers throughout (although Tawny himself never appears). But my favourite and the one that got me most giddy was the Marvel Family. Yes! Shazam features the Marvel Family in all their splendour! Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr, and all the others appear at the end to help Billy out and it's FANTASTIC. There's also a number of references to other comics properties as well, as well as the wider DC cinematic universe. Batfleck's batarang is one of Freddie's favourite souvenirs, one of Captain Marvel's names is Zap-tain America, a post-credits scene has Billy trying to communicate with fish, and there's even a surprise cameo from Superman (sort of; there's no Henry Cavill, and you never see his face).I have to say, Shazam! was definitely a welcome surprise. Even the crying baby some terrible parents decided to bring to the screening couldn't distract me too much or damper my mood (and the kid we were sat next to had an infectious excitement and enthusiasm for the movie which enhanced my experience rather than hindered it). Zachary Levi balances the comedic with the action with the dramatic perfectly. All the kids do really well, especially Asher Angel as Billy, and share a fantastic family chemistry with one another. It made me laugh, it made me horrified, it disturbed me and excited me. This is hands-down the best DC movie since BvS (which for the record I absolutely loved, and still do to this day). I give Shazam a very solid 8/10.",Shazam!

174,sweidman-28016,Another Addition to the DCEU,6,16 April 2019,"Shazam! Review:Shazam! is the newest movie in the DCEU. It follows 14 year old foster kid Billy Batson who is given the superhero powers and turns into an indestructible man when he says the word Shazam. I thought the trailer didn't look good and I don't care too much for the DCEU so I was going to pass on this movie. When I saw the great reviews I thought I should probably see it. I guess it was fine and I liked it. It's an interesting and enjoyable origin story. The plot had a lot to it. I think Zachary Levi as Shazam did a good job. He captured both the heroic side and the teenager side to it. I did enjoy Asher Angel as Billy. He had comedic parts and I understood his conflicts. I also liked Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy, his foster home roommate. He was funny and nerdy, like his character in IT (2018). Also Faithe Herman as Darla was cute and enjoyable. The other characters I couldn't feel for. The main antagonist, Dr. Sivana, played by Mark Strong, I could care less about. He was a bad guy but I didn't understand his views that much. He was just a bad guy. So the plot felt very jumbled to me. It looked like it was going to be a funny, kid friendly superhero movie. I felt that it wasn't really funny and it was actually kind of dark. I wish the tones weren't so contrasting that I didn't know how I should feel. Also Dr. Sivana didn't become a big problem until towards the end of the movie. The first two acts were mainly just showing off the super powers and stuff like that. There was a lot of filler stuff not needed too. It's 2:12 hrs and I think they could've cut it down to about 2 hrs or less. For technical aspects I have to say it had some of the worst visual effects in a superhero movie I have seen in a long while. It was distracting and I'm surprised at that. Other than that that's all I got. It's an entertaining movie but not the best ever. I would recommend seeing it if you like these kinds of movies and actually like the DCEU.My Grade: B-",Shazam!
175,funtasticfour,Stealing some of Marvel's Thunder?,8,23 April 2019,"Shazam is a fun character, that I never thought I'd see on the big screen. You'd expect someone who is mega buff, but instead we get Zachery Levi...and he's perfect! He brings the humor that DC movies needed. The villain isn't great, but the story behind him is pretty good. I saw lots of references to other characters, some of which paid off later and probably will in future movies. I also saw a name in the credits that didn't show up and has me excited for a sequel. (Dwayne Johnson, look it up) Overall, DC is doing a better job with their properties which has me excited, but I'm afraid also with the actors being switched out on Batman and Superman.. but this movie is a step in the right direction.",Shazam!
176,JakeBrinkman,A truly fun superhero movie,8,18 April 2019,"It takes some serious writing talent to stop being a good writer, which is essentially what they are doing by entering the mind of a teenage boy. As Billy tests his powers, he does MANY childish things that show no forethought, which is normally a sign of bad screenwriting. But in Shazam!, this is absolutely perfect for the character, and it comes across as truly funny. A superhero film that is primarily a comedy is rare in the genre, and a family-friendly comedy is truly unique.Although the comedy was the highlight of the film, the superhero action and the foster family drama in between was also just as good as you should expect from the genre, even if it never quite shines as much as the comedy does.My only two complaints are minor, but they are enough to drop my rating just a bit. The first is that the drama had serious potential for some heartwrenching and heartwarming moments, but the film doesn't build those moments quite long enough for them to be as powerful as I would prefer. The second is that, aside from one appropriate use of Envy, the Seven Deadly Sins are not portrayed as anything more than standard brainless monsters. When compared to other film and literature that use personifications of the sins, Shazam! really feels like it wasted lots of potential. Even some very fast and minor scenes with them would have been much better than the mindless brutes that we got.",Shazam!
177,Offworld_Colony,It's naff Deadpool...,6,6 February 2020,"..Not particularly that funny, not particularly that dramatic or that unique. Saying it's the best DC Universe film is damning with faint praise. It's full of utter predictable nonsense and paradoxes and contrivances. But at least it has some solid photography and practical sets. And Zachary Levi who wore out his welcome on Chuck is just the right level of goofy here. Shazam is like a lesser version of a hundred better superhero films. But I didn't hate it. It wasn't a dirge and I could half watch it will I did something better.",Shazam!

179,ethanbresnett,The DCU once again fails to hit the mark,5,7 March 2020,"It's rare that a superhero origin story fails to excite me, however Shazam! unfortunately found itself proving an exception to this rule.The characters in Shazam! are so uninteresting that I found myself caring very little about their fates. Billy Batson had no redeemable qualities or characteristics, with seemingly no logic or sense to his decision making. Even acknowledging the fact that he is a 14 year old boy and therefore changeable and juvenile there was just far too much of a lack of direction for his character. Billy never felt like a hero to me, or that he was ever trying to become one. The beauty of origin stories like the Raimi Spider-Man, Batman Begins, Iron Man was that all of these men struggled with the responsibility and power they held, but worked to justify their title as a 'hero'. Everything Billy did felt wholly disingenuous.When Billy was chosen by the original Shazam!, the whole situation seemed awfully contrived. Billy really didn't seem to fit the bill of being pure of heart... he just happened to be chosen as time was running out to choose a successor. This could have still been interesting if Billy, upon realising the extent of his powers, tried to adapt to becoming a hero and take instead responsibility. Had the film spent its time developing this I could have enjoyed it. Instead we spent too long on montages and Freaky Friday style humour. Billy's eventual moral epiphany felt rushed and unearned in the final act.One of my major gripes with DC films is that their final action sequences always resemble each others. We see two CG blobs flying through a city, smashing through buildings, seemingly taking no damage until the crucial deux ex machina moment.As much as I love Mark Strong as an actor, his villain fell incredibly flat. Sivana seemed to have no agency of his own, with his only purpose being to allow Billy to come to the realisation that family was under his nose all along (surprise surprise).There were a few saving graces for Shazam!, namely the comedy and the performances of Grazer and Levy.Overall a poor attempt to revitalise the DC universe on screen, and a film I'd be happy never to see again!",Shazam!

Loved his side kick Billy, they had great funny chemistry together, especially running those tests! LOL and Darla is so Sweet too! ;D GREAT SONG from QUEEN too!Only thing that bugged me a bit was the Monster FX, they weren't terrible, but just seemed a different gradient and texture than the rest of the movie which pulled me out of the colorful world around them.

185,Magow-Intermean,Shazam! Review,10,31 March 2019,"A wizard (Djimon Hounsou) gives 15-year-old Billy Batson (Asher Angel) the ability to transform into an adult superhero (Zachary Levi) by using the magic word ""Shazam!"". Billy becomes famous before he learns to use his powers for good, and attracts the malign attention of demon-possessed villain Dr Sivana (Mark Strong).
The wrinkle that makes Shazam! different from other superheroes is that he's literally a kid's wish-fulfilment fantasy. Crusading reporters and millionaire playboys are as obviously enviable as their caped identities, but young Billy Batson (Angel) - originally a homeless orphan, to rub it in - is an underpowered kid like most of his original readers.
A cry of ""Shazam!"" invests Billy with the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus (ie: lightning), the courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury. All in the body of a broad-chested lunk in a natty, white half-cape later copied by Elvis. Therefore, this revival of a hero whose last cinema outing was Adventures Of Captain Marvel in 1941 (before lawyers took away his name) is as much an entry in the kid-in-a-grown-up-body genre (Freaky Friday, Vice Versa, Big) as it is yet another addition to the currently crowded roster of superheroic spectacle. A lot of skeletons rattle around in the plot, which involves the last wishes of a cavern-dwelling wizard (Hounsou) and the seething envy of diabolical mastermind Dr Sivana (Strong), but the spine of Shazam! is Billy taking a Spidey-like power and responsibility crash course while learning to appreciate a family that has come together by choice rather than biological accident.
Zachary Levi incarnates every brat's idea of what a grown-up is like.
In the early stretches, as Billy bombs about Philadelphia searching for his missing mom while Sivana refines his self-made evil genius, Shazam! feels a little like an M. Night Shyamalan film with more bathroom jokes. Then lightning strikes and Zachary Levi takes over the lead, incarnating every brat's idea of what a grown-up is like - though one of the wryest takes of the film is that Levi's broad-chested, super-powered Billy (who never settles on a hero name) is free to act more like a kid than Asher's driven, guarded teenage reading of the role. This being a film made by grown-ups in 2019, Billy's heroic stunts - sometimes averting disasters he's inadvertently caused - become famous thanks to social media which peaked in 2017, date-stamping the film the way Kick-Ass' MySpace page did.
Since this is still part of the DCEU, dark shadows gather, with a couple of genuinely upsetting scenes - Billy and Sivana both have unhappy family reunions - and about ten minutes' too much rote CGI thumping and destruction. However, director David F. Sandberg, of the smart little horror film Lights Out and the proficient but ordinary Annabelle: Creation, is more drawn to the whimsy, charm and comic potential of the material. Ironically, this feels more like a Disney movie - in their mild-mannered superheroics phase, represented by the Flubber and Herbie films - than any of the Marvel comic book films released by Disney, with a clutch of appealing foster siblings (Faithe Herman is a standout) set to team with Billy in pretty much inevitable future adventures.
The hardest power to depict onscreen is the wisdom of Solomon, but Shazam! makes clever decisions, mixing middle school snark with disarming sweetness. And - yes - it delivers the requisite lightning-strike punch-'em-ups with considerable force.",Shazam!
186,SnobReviews,"""Shazam!"" is the perfect superhero movie.",8,5 April 2019,"""Shazam"" is a non-stop blast and a refreshing take on the superhero genre considering all the dark elements the other films of this genre have. ""Shazam!"" is hilarious, action-packed and full of heart.In this superhero film, a teenager in foster care discovers he can turn into an adult superhero named Shazam.Overall this film is entertaining and never boring. ""Shazam!"" doesn't try hard either; it's the perfect blend of everything you'd expect in one film. It brought me back to the superhero movies I watched growing up and I really appreciated that the film didn't have dark undertones. Zachary Levi (TV's ""Chuck"") is perfect for the part and really fun. Also, is it just me or does he remind you of Jimmy Fallon? Doesn't Mark Strong's character also remind you of Fearless Leader, the villain in ""Rocky & Bullwinkle""? Random thoughts. Regardless, I loved this film and I don't doubt that it will be a huge blockbuster by word of mouth.",Shazam!

190,W011y4m5,Solid Popcorn Flick,8,17 July 2019,"Shazam is a surprisingly warm & enjoyable movie - akin to that of Christopher Reeve's original Superman than recent DC outings.Character-driven, fun, cheesy & unafraid to wear its heart on its sleeve, it's a far more intimate affair than I'd originally expected with truly believable, human people at the centre of it; struggling to fit in with everyday life, growing up & dealing with complex emotional relationships whilst finding one's place in the world.So often we're made to view stories featuring unsympathetic, resolutely perfect godlike superheroes who hover in the sky looking down on us from above like deities with their undefeatable capabilities so to have seen someone who is basically a flawed individual like ourselves (essentially looking up to those same aforementioned icons) who's simply also gifted with similar remarkable abilities - without losing their sense of humanity - was a rare alternative perspective. Moreover, it's impressive & worth acknowledgement that even in the third act & final confrontation, the main theme of family was admirably never lost amongst all the endless action.However, it's not perfect & there are a few complaints - the first being how cheap the finished product looked with its visuals; understandable considering the smaller budget (compared to Aquaman or Wonder Woman, for instance) but the cringey CGI & cinematography could've been far superior, undoubtedly - most notably during the climax which ended up resembling a showdown from an episode of Power Rangers.Secondly, with it being set in the DC Universe, it is noticeably jarring for a self-aware, satirical parody of the superhero genre to feature in the world of such a grounded franchise that intended to take itself seriously & having Superman appear briefly was an immediate reminder of that because it's hard to envisage Henry Cavill's version featuring alongside this iteration of DC's Captain Marvel... Indeed, I'm aware there's been a shift in direction behind the scenes at Warner Bros but all I intend to say is it may have made more sense for the change to be gradual instead of a total & immediate 180.Finally, to address the elephant in the room, it is somewhat obviously inspired or influenced by Deadpool & draws a lot of its comedic humour from the character but in Shazam's defense, the film does find its own feet enough for the feature to establish itself with its own unique, likeable & quirky identity.",Shazam!
191,ZinQ,Is something going to happen?,5,17 October 2019,"If so, when. I'm waiting and waiting and getting bored. But I still have not set eyes on the yummy Zachary Levi. Just how much build up is necessary?",Shazam!
192,fciocca,"A movie that finally has a charismatic hero, and a proper villain",7,22 November 2019,"""Shazam!"" is a movie that finally delivers what I always asked: characters that have personality and are funny, a villain that looks like a villain and not like a joke as Steppenwolf in ""Justice League"", an entertaining story and especially a good balance between real stunts scenes, and CGI sequences. I really liked Zachary Levi, his performance is amazing, and he was perfectly able to play a 14 years old boy, in a body of an adult. I really liked Shazam, I think is very different from the rest of the DC universe heroes, he can transform in just a moment, he does not have the usual costume that he need to put on, he just scream Shazam and he is ready for the battle. I also liked his right-hand man, Freddy, the young guy that lives in the same foster home, and helps him to discover and develop his superpowers. I liked also all the other kids that are in the movie, they are a nice addition. Dr. Silva, is finally everything that I have always asked in a villain: job done by Mark Strong with this character was simply amazing: he looks, sound and behave like a proper bad guy, I am finally happy to see something like this in the DCEU.This is one of the best DC movie and the proof that if they want to create something original and different than the average, they are perfectly able to, they just need to hire right people to write, shoot and edit their movies.",Shazam!
193,asb_deutsch,Honestly better than most Marvel solo movies!,7,17 April 2019,"First things first. Congrats to WB for removing the dark tone. Secondly for picking a wise director. Sandberg did a nice job while directing Annabelle:Creation and Light Out (Not bad if you remove the ending sequence). This flick is much better than Aquaman. And the comedy was not forced like in Thor outings!
Starting the sequence with the child was a nice move by the scriptwriters. The diversity of the supporting cast was another nice addition. You don't need 3D/4D to get really immersed. In a nutshell, a film for all ages!",Shazam!
194,Puroo,THIS Captain Marvel should have grossed $1 billion!,10,5 May 2021,"I'm gonna be honest. Before this movie was announced I didn't even know who Shazam was. I had only seen him as one of those ""random dudes I don't care about"" heroes in the character selection screen of Injustice: Gods Among Us. So you can assume that I was watching this movie as a blank slate. One of my friends was very excited about this movie. He told me that the critics had seen this movie a month earlier and give it good ratings. I was guessing it must be a children's movie, and that is what it was advertised as.But when I saw it my mind was blown. I wouldn't exactly call it a children's movie, or even a family movie for that matter. I would put it in the same category as a Pixar movie, something which children and adults will see differently. Just as you start thinking this movie is for children, it throws one such event that the thought gets blown away from your mind, just like Dr Sivana's secretary when she touched the portal door (BA DM TSS).The story, in spite of having a lot, still manages to go perfectly well with the runtime and not feel like a bloated mess. In just a little above 2 hours it showed Billy Batson's childhood, his character development, how he received his superpowers, how he learnt to use them, how he learnt to use them to help people and not to just fool around, his relation with his adopted family members, their character development, the villain's backstory, how the villain received his superpowers, how Billy and Sivana met the first time, how Billy understood the power of friendship and defeated the bad guy, how his life became afterwards and two post credit sequel announcements.The CGI was also really good. In fact it was the selling point for me. I often watched Billy jumping from the rooftop and shouting Shazam over and over again because of how fun it was to watch. The seven deady sins also look very scary, just enough to scare children. Seeing Shazam fly and fight with indestructible enemies was like the experience of watching Man of Steel once again, except this time it was much funnier. I still don't understand how is this a low budget movie. It looks far more superior than half the DCEU and MCU movies in terms of budget (for reference, it's between $80-100 million. That's less than Wonder Woman, Suicide Squad and even Birds of Prey if it's on the lower end).Shazam is the movie I would see with my whole family and enjoy every time I see it. It is so simple yet so complex, it is family friendly yet mature, it is serious yet so funny. If it had been my way this and Captain Marvel's box office collections would have been exchanged. It is perfect in every sense, with not a single scene of boredom.",Shazam!
195,DeBBss,"Finally, A Good DC Movie!",8,10 April 2019,"When I saw that Shazam had a budget of only eighty million dollars, I was even more excited. I feel like superhero movies in the 21st century focus too much on CGI and big fight scenes, and I tend to get bored of it now and then. It's pretty ironic; when you think about low-budget, you think of a cheesy B list movie, but the best superhero movies that came out recently are Logan and Shazam, which have low-budgets. When a movie has a low-budget, it tends to focus more on character development and more emotional scenes, and that's exactly what we get in Shazam.The idea of a fourteen year old being a superhero is the freshest superhero plot that has came out in years. I generally liked that twist on a superhero movie, but I feel like it goes overboard sometimes. Shazam does a very good job at making fun at the superhero genre; Shazam is pretty much a parody. Sometimes Shazam goes overboard on the whole parody aspect, which gives this movie a cheesy feel to it. We rarely see a superhero movie that focuses on real life issues, like how Billy is lonely and doesn't have a family. The main focus of Shazam is about how Billy handles all these issues with other kids like him, and it makes Billy a more realistic and sympathetic character.The casting choices were amazing; no one can play Shazam like Zachary Levi. In fact, Zachary Levi does a better job at acting like a fourteen year old than Asher Angel, who is pretty much a fourteen year old. Zachary Levi has such charisma that I don't even see a grown man behind a costume. Cooper Andrews is by far my favorite actor in Shazam; he just does such a good job at being likable. Jack Dylan Grazer plays Freddy Freeman really well, he can be nerdy and funny at the same time. One thing that I didn't like was the bullies. The bullies were incredibly cliche and stereotypical to the point where it just got annoying.The comedy is one of the issues that I have. Yes, this movie is very funny, but there's too much comedy, and it's like an overdose; there's about a joke every 2-5 minutes. Actually, Shazam made me laugh out loud for the first time in a movie theater. Surprisingly, Shazam does a good job at changing the pace from complete comedy, to pure drama. Although Shazam is a comedy, there is a lot of real life issues this movie touches on, and I liked that balance. Another issue I have is with the costume design. I don't know if it's because of the budget, but the costume looks cheap, like I can buy it for $40 at a Halloween store.The villain was done properly this time in a DC movie. He wasn't some sort of CGI purple dude or a guy with a weird helmet and an ax , it's just a normal human being. I liked how they set up the villain's origin; he has a sympathetic or even empathetic past. The concept of the seven deadly sins, and how every sin is a demon is creative. By far the best part about the villain is his weakness actually. Most superhero movies just say: ""Beat this guy up enough, and there you go, you won the fight."", but this villain's weakness is unique. It takes strategy and patience to take him down, and I liked how they focused on that.Shazam is by far the best DC superhero movie since The Dark Knight Rises. The casting choices were perfect, the villain was well thought out, and the comedy was good, although it was overboard sometimes. Shazam is definitely worth your two hours.",Shazam!

12A
director: David F Sanberg
starring: Zachary Levi,Mark strong,Asher Angel,Jack Dylan Grazer and Faith Herman etcoverall rating 79/100Shazam was pretty good! still flawed as we can unfortunately expect from DC but it was still a lot of fun and a step in the right direction for DC, lets dive in to why this is.First of all i loved the humour and the overall tone of this movie. Shazam made me consistently laugh throughout the film which is a rare thing for films but the bon between Shazam and Freddy was so infectious you could not help but laugh. The best humour had to come from when Shazam was testing his powers this was a set of hilarious sequences and was extremely well filmed and helped with the overall lighthearted tone of the film.Next i would like to add that the film was surprisingly dark in places which i did not mind at all. I loved that they went into a lot of detail with the 7 sins and there character design was pretty scary for a 12A rating. And there was some dark action sequences involving the villain throwing people out of a multi story building that was shocking but entertaining to watch as well.However my first criticism for me would be the poor villain. Mark Strong did a fine job with what he had but his character lacked narrative depth or entertainment. He was entertaining for the first act of the film but as the film developed i got bored of him. He lacked the menacing look or entertaining powers of a good villain which i think DC is doing a lot with there films which needs to be fixed. They just did not go into a lot of detail into his motives for wanting shazams powers or his relationship with the 7 sins so this was a little disappointing for me.Next i would like to add my biggest positives for the film Zachary Levi and Asher Angel. Asher really impressed me in this film he just had a natural charm that instantly made you connect with Billy as a character and he really captured the emotion and struggles of being a foster kid this should definitely get Asher some more work after this. Next Zachary Levi was fantastic. He just has such a likeable quality to him and he really got his opportunity to shine in the film. He was hilarious and he really captured the essence of a teenagers personality. This is the big break that Zachary needed and deserves it weirds me out that he voices Flynn Rider in Tangled! I also liked Faith Herman who played Darla she had a great likeability to her and was great in the unfortunately limited air time she got in the film.Next the film had great action sequences. Sterling the director was incredibly imaginative in his set locations for the action and it really payed off well as it was completely different to any other superhero movie. The action sequences evolving the ghosts of the 7 sins were the most entertaining as they all had different and interesting qualities to them.However i would like to add that the film was not very realistic with the flying. Whenever Shazam or the villain was flying around it looked to fake and it was clear they were just on wires when doing this. I think this is due to the lower budget they couldn't make the flying sequences seem realistic like a higher budget film could so this put me off slightly.Next i loved the little links to batman and superman. This just added to the comedic tone for the film with Batmans weapons and a figurine of him. I did find Supermans cameo very amusing as they clearly have not found a replacement for Henry Cavill so his head was not shown.Next I loved that the film had a lot more deep themes about fostering and the emotional impact of a foster kid. I love that more action and comedy films are doing this to even out the tone and to make you feel different emotions. I loved the narrative character development between Billy trying to find his mum and between his foster family. For His character to be so desperate to find his lost mum only to find out she deliberately gave him up added to the surprisingly emotional impact of the film. And to see his relationship grow with his foster family was heartwarming to see as he was not used to being loved or being part of a family. However i do wish that some of the foster kids had more opportunities to shine in the film as it was clear they were only focusing on Darla,Billy and Freddy so this was a shame.Finally i am just ending on a slight nitpick and a large negative for Shazam. Firstly I thought the two bullies were overused and not needed for any more then a couple of scenes but this did not effect my opinion on the film to much. And finally i found that the final act of this film was a bit messy and cheesy. Due to me getting bored of the villain i found myself losing interest just slightly by watching the final big action sequence with shazam and him in. Also i felt that all the kids turning into shazam was not needed and was to cheesy. And the acting from the adults was questionable.Overall Shazam was a lot of fun and a good movie. And proves that DC are stepping in the right direction in the quality of there films. But they still have not won me over completely with Shazam",Shazam!

202,gavinp9,"Fun, slightly different, comic book origin",7,5 April 2019,"'Shazam!' is the seventh DCEU film and is similar to 'Aquaman', in that it's a standalone origin story, but could also easily link into future 'Justice League' films. It also has a similar tone, being a bit less serious in parts, thanks to the protagonists being teenagers - Billy (Angel) and Freddy (Grazer). It's from the director of 'Annabelle: Creation' and 'Lights Out', which explains the bits of the film that are a bit darker - it is rated M, not PG, mostly due to how the ""seven deadly sins"" are portrayed. But it's definitely not 'Batman v Superman' or 'Suicide Squad' darkness/quality.It starts a little slow, as we follow a flashback of Thad (Strong) as a kid - why? He later reappears as the antagonist, and is always fun to watch him as the bad guy. The film does a solid job of introducing Billy and his backstory and why he's a foster kid. The home life gives the story heart and meaning, with all five of the other kids having enough character development. Freddy gets the most screentime, and most of the film has you wishing he was the one who becomes Shazam/Captain Marvel, rather than Billy!When it finally does happen, it's fun to see the ""learn how to use superpowers"" montage (set to Queen's 'Don't Stop Now'). There's actually quite a few laugh-out-loud moments, as it takes a fairly tongue-in-cheek approach to comic book films - and it gets to reference Batman and Superman heaps, as this comes after the other three films they're in. It's a bit long at 130min, there's some slow patches and some of the fight scenes are a little forced, but it holds together quite well and has more good moments than bad.",Shazam!
203,Donatien3,Where DC learns to have fun,8,27 July 2019,"DC Universe movies have been criticised as being too dark and morbid (the darker take on Superman didn't go down well with some fans), or backflipping, trying too hard to be funny and seeing it fall flat (like the awful ""Suicide Squad"").""Shazam"" strikes the balance between being fun and heroic, and is arguably the best DC movie since ""Wonder Woman"".Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is a troubled foster kid who inherits the power of Shazam and becomes a tall, overpowered superhero, helped by his hero-obsessed foster brother Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer). He battles Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong) who inherits the evil side of Shazam's powers.A lot of the fun in this movie is watching a clearly overwhelmed Billy learn to be a superhero (discovering his powers and using his new appearance to drink beer and go to strip clubs). While there's an underlying theme of family, it doesn't get too preachy and keeps the tone fairly light.""Shazam"" distances itself from the events of ""Batman vs Superman"" and ""Justice League"", though Batman and Superman are mentioned regularly, with Batman's batarangs proving to be a crucial weapon. While it's part of the overall DC Universe, it still feels like its own movie, without the baggage of the previous failed movies.Even if you're cynical about DC's output, give ""Shazam"" a chance, you'll enjoy it.",Shazam!

206,ayoreinf,The Family comics,8,8 April 2019,"Yes we already have The Incredibles, in fact, the Fantastic Four in their comics version and even No Ordinary Family, were both a family of super heros, and dealt with the issues of being a family while having super powers. But Shazam is diferent, at least in one aspect. In all the paperback versions of Shazam, which I've read, all of them fairly recent, I must admit, I've seen only one or two copies of the older version, which didn't include the origin story, but it also seemed to point to the same idea of family. Family, as a concept is a matter of choice, not merely a group of people one is related to by birth. And this movie is making this point loud and clear. Even changing the origin story in a way to make this point even clearer. That's why for me this is, as I stated in the title ""The Family comics"". The whole point of the story is what a family is and what it does to you. That's why John Glover, is Mr. Sivana, after being Mr. Lionel Luther so convincingly in Smallville. There's nothing like a perfectly mean father to point out a good one.Other aspects of the movie, are more or less all right. I won't elaborate on CGI, as I said more than once it's a mere technical issue by now. Acting is of the highest quality, plot has a few holes in, but it's almost coming with the teritory, of recent comics adaptations. That's why I rate it just 8 stars. Tighter plot, would earn higher rating in my book. The jokes are all right, not always so funny, but I did smile very often when watching it. And for me it's a decent bottom line. Especially since what's important here is the family issue, and that's covered all the way through.",Shazam!

I know perfectly that the modern, and not only, films about heroes are a special effects and action shows. This is an entertaining show, without much deep meaning, which they do not claim. But this film is simply disgusting at all it's trying to show any serious meaning. This is not just a child in the body of the hero, it is some kind of selfish imbecile child in the body of the hero with a brother who shows himself as a crooked dropout clown and a villain who is the only character playing normal in this film. It's a picture of modern mass media for children(go **** with your quality, children will eat everything that glitters brightly and sounds loud on the screen).

208,Apollo15AnnoPianoCatDogSnailAnt,magic,2,21 April 2020,"Firstly it finally unveils the Skrull and Skree empires which are like in lots of Marvel comics. In the movie it just happens with people moving around or talking like mannequins. It also has the switcheroo part of who you think are the good side are really bad and the bad side really good, gasp! So those are the antagonists. There's some shoehorned-in rickety peeling back the layers stuff to add this is a serious movie not a computerized cartoon, showing Cap Marvels' origin is a salt of the earth type adrenaline junky, racing go-karts, and doing crazy military rope swinging around, rad! But mostly when they reconnect with some friend in some rickety country home, and it's peeling back the layers stuff brrrrr. I like the cosmic stuff with Jude Law and his Blue Man Group for sure, and Sam Jackson actually plays the most of all of those Nick Fury moments with a more resigned air lighthearted and he's probably thinking how he really enjoys eating a sandwich during some part of the movie. Everyone in this movie talks in super casual mode, just like the good guys and the bad guys. ""Mumumumm"" ""Oh, mumumum."" Captain Marvel quips something in a semi-cynic tone. Even in the trailers for the upcoming Spiderman movie they finally unveil a smidge of super villain Mysterio played by great actor Jake Gyllenhall and he says something like people talk in a Library, something paraphrased like you don't know what you're up against or you're not going to win against me. Oooh. Anyway, I think it's just the filmmakers themselves perspective with all of this, the crazy shapeshifting Skrulls even wear cute cuddly human sweaters or jackets at some point, it could be domestic sentiments of the filmmakers or just them in a refined classy ware. If it's the latter then that's ok. Lots of things happen inexplicably but I let this pass because cinema isn't supposed to be a documentary, like Captain Marvel becomes Superman at some point soaring around and also the Air Force superior of Captain Marvel, some other lady, is a shapeshifting Skrull oh no.As I watch this movie my thoughts also dwell on how can I achieve, it's like this daily thing to work on stuff. What the heck!? Life should be enjoyed, why work loads? Because it pays off in numerous ways inexplicably. Also thinking how skills/talent for sure are how to accomplish, and it's totally not ""other"" things that get a person by, really.",Shazam!

the problem is we get tones of such superhero movies in the last 20 years cause feeble minded people when they hear a new guy with a new costume is out in a superhero movie they go watch it no matter what crap it is.
when u gross a billion dollars with each of those movies then the result is SHAZAM.
it doesn't matter if the movie sucks big time if it's a big failed parody-bad comedy of the superhero genre.
it's a superhero movie = it will make money. that's what counts.
i'm a huge superhero fan. I loved many of the superhero movies from last decades even the merdiocre ones but this movie is AN INSULT to the genre.
if I want to watch a comedy I wil go watch.....stan and ollie.....not a superhero movie.
superheroes supposed to be action/fantasy films. not beep comedies like this movie is.
if u exclude DEADPOOL which is a worth superhero movie with comedy elements there are not many such worth superhero films.
shazam may be the worst superhero film I saw in years and it's the bottom of the barrel.
if they don't stop making tons of such films then we will get more and more beep superhero movies.

The intersectional brats suck, it's positive tone was irritating to a tee, the story is just a rehashed script from like maybe thousands of other unintelligible movies, the action was gay and lacking excitement..... this movie is overhyped dreck.

Altho it has a unic tone because of all the jokes and the nature of the character alone, Shazam maybe is not my kind of superhero. Zachary Levi's acting was amazing throughout the whole movie, it was surprising how good he nailed all the childish sides that the character has and still knew how to look serious and brave at the same time. The costume was a bit to plain for my taste and could have been a bit more dense with more colours and things on it, altho I know it is how it looks in the comics. All in all, 6-7/10",Shazam!

The CGI is good and the acting OK.I wasnt taken by the villains in this film though and thought that the film took David and Goliath odds against the superhero a little too far which tipped the balance to a bit farcical and meant things didnt quite add up.However this was a good family film and well worth seeing.",Shazam!
214,patriciogl10,Intelligently balanced.,7,8 December 2019,"This is a prime example of a comic book film done right. It has the balanced amount and blend of comedy, action and drama. There's no overcompensation for the lack of any of them, it doesn't overwhelm with disproportionate doses of genres. An origin story filled with heart, precision and determination. Shazam is a sadly overlooked hero and is pleasing to see such a well-accomplished effort do justice to such a great character.Zachary Levi also knows how to balance every moment he is given, he seizes and picks his moments to shine with his humorous delivery. Another point to his favor is that all seems to flow naturally from his persona. Jack Dylan Grazer aids in complementing each other in creating fun interactions and a full-blown dynamic between the two.Considering DC's many failed attempts at producing a fairly good installment, Shazam! comes off as a pretty sizeable effort, and indeed a surprisingly effective one. Now we can hope DC and WB know how to balance and respect the tones, moods and spirits of each character they may bring to life, and flesh out their cinematic universe with a more varied artistic output, rather than fixate on a single tendency or vein in a rather evident effort to distinguish themselves from the studio across the street.Anyway, chances of you enjoying this film are pretty high, embrace it.",Shazam!

220,TheCorniestLemur,You know what this film is? Nice.,7,30 September 2021,"Yes, I know I've been doing a lot of DC stuff recently, it'll be over soon, I promise.Anyway, of all the iconic characters DC has under their belt for their cinematic universe, man do I find it really funny that it's Aquaman and Shazam they finally got right. This is easily the best film in this universe so far, mainly because it kept it simple, stupid.The narrative is simple, the character's motivations are simple, and that's something DC seemed all but incapable of doing up until now, even for characters that really demanded something simpler (looking at you, Suicide Squad). This is a film about a boy who gets superpowers, uses them irresponsibly at first, but needs to learn to appreciate his new family and is eventually confronted by someone who wants that power for himself, and that's...it.And that's all it needed to be too. Sure, this all might sound cliche, and it kind of is, but it's done in a rather similar fashion to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, and how well did the tone of those films make all the cheesiness work? Amazingly, as I recall (although they are long overdue for a rewatch...).It's one of those films where you just know that everyone on set was having a lot of fun making it, because the actors are all turning it up to 11, the writing is excellently camp, and while I don't think it's anywhere near as well directed or shot as the original Spider-Man trilogy, you can still tell that David F. Sandberg was completely on board with this being a sillier film than the early entries in this series.The only problem I have with the acting is that Zachary Levi and Asher Angel didn't really feel like the same character to me, even though they were supposed to be. I don't know, it kind of felt like Shazam should have been way shyer and not quite as peppy all the time to feel consistent with Billy Batson, and maybe they could have worked some character development into that somehow.But other than that, the acting is so good in this that even the five year old girl who would probably have been so annoying in any other film was honestly bloody adorable, and I think that really says something.In fact the whole family dynamic this film sets up is bloody adorable, and it really must have done something right to make something that undeniably cheesy so cute to me. So while the story and direction aren't going to herald a bold new leap for the cinematic arts, it is all entertaining as hell, and after the catastrophes DC have released in this cinematic universe so far, I think I'd rather have that than anything like their first few attempts again.",Shazam!

Much like Ant man was to the MCU, Shazam also provides the comedic breath of fresh air that the DC films were lacking. Shazam is a perfect film for the family, bringing a more child centric voice to the more 'serious', 'sombre' tone of the DCEU.It is exciting to see just what role Shazam could play in the future of this property that is still trying to find its footing and the perfect direction for its movies.",Shazam!
223,jamesjustice-92,A lot less than perfect,5,13 April 2019,"Just to be clear - I don't like superhero movies. The only reason I went out and watched this one was because of Zachary Levi whom I loved since his time on ""Less than perfect"" so I just wanted to check out how he was doing. Not so good I guess otherwise he wouldn't be getting into this movie.
Shazam! is one big cliche with nothing even remotely meaningful inside: the main protagonist who doesn't know what he really wants even if it's right in front of his eyes, the antagonist who got into antagonry because of his antagonistic past with the family of antagonists, all those family matters issues, what is not important, what is, who cares about whom and really who cares? The actual main antagonist of this movie is a person who wrote the script to it - one simple thought that is given away in the beginning of the movie and that's it. After that there's only special effects, a couple of jokes, super boring fight scenes and nothing more. Zachary's performance is ok at best considering he's playing a teenager. Jack Dylan Grazer is a rising star whose greater days lie ahead, not here; as a sidekick he is great though. Mark Strong is weak and his villain is below average. Special effects are fine and why shouldn't they be actually?
The reason I don't like comic book adaptations is because they're one dimensional and flat like its pages. It's a book with pictures and occasional lines so that we understand the concept but silent movies has more concept than this piece of garbage.",Shazam!

226,asifahsankhan,"A charming, lightweight superhero movie that works well for DC",9,8 April 2019,"These days, it's easy to be cynical about superhero movies. Over the last two decades, the genre has all but consumed the blockbuster business, leaving a trail of predictable, formulaic spectacles in its wake. Most are fine, and some are pretty good, but rarely are they any better than that, even (and sometimes especially) when they aspire to more.That's a big reason why Shazam! is such a low-key delight. Its aspirations are modest-it wants to amuse and entertain while delivering a feel-good moral about the value of family-but it works hard to achieve them. Although it is loosely connected to other movies in the DC Comics universe, it largely stands on its own, and it actively rejects the gritty pomposity that has plagued so many recent movies based on DC characters, choosing instead to emphasize the idea that being a superhero is fun-especially if you're a kid. It's a movie that aims to defeat superhero movie cynicism. For the most part, it succeeds.Not many superhero movies can claim to be charming, but Shazam! has personality to spare. Much of that is a result of winning performances from its trio of leads: Asher Angel as Billy Batson, a foster kid who is granted magical powers by an ancient wizard; Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy Freeman, another foster kid in Batson's group home, who ends up teaching Batson how to be a hero; and Zachary Levi as Shazam, the adult superhero that Batson becomes. Levi, in particular, plays the role of the comically oversized hero with a madcap commitment that is hard to resist: Not since Tom Hanks in Big (which gets an obliging reference) has an adult actor managed such a joyous display of childlike energy and enthusiasm.There's a villain too: Dr. Thaddeus Sivana, a scowling, bald baddie with dastardly plans to blah blah blah something about the Seven Deadly Sins and infinite power...it doesn't really matter. Sivana doesn't have much depth, but he's played with reliable gusto by Mark Strong, who is so consistent in so many movies that it sometimes seems as if he has entirely cornered the market on middle-aged supporting actor roles. He's the Tommy Lee Jones of the 2010s.Sivana exists mostly as an adult contrast to the childish glee of Batson/Shazam. Indeed, a significant part of what sets Shazam! apart from so many other superhero movies is its firm focus on children and their view of the world: Superhero movies are often designed to appeal to adolescents, but this one is actually about the often difficult experience of being one, even when you end up with superpowers Batson, who was separated from his mother early in life, finds himself surrounded by a makeshift family in a messy but emotionally warm foster home packed with cute-occasionally too cute-kids who ground the film in a geeky, gee-whiz innocence. (This is a movie in which one character says he took a ""deep dive into peer reviewed studies about superpowers"" and appears to be completely serious.) Shazam! isn't exactly a big idea movie, but it doesn't need to be: It's a big-hearted film about finding yourself by finding family, and its emotional simplicity and goofy earnestness account for much of its appeal.Of course, there's the requisite superhero business as well. The movie refers other DC heroes, mostly Superman and Batman, but instead of setting up crossovers or franchise synergy, it treats them as childhood idols, role models for Batson as he struggles to figure out how to be a better hero.If you go for the flying and punching and magical energy zapping, you won't be disappointed. But even the action scenes work a little differently from most superhero movies, where the object seems to be to show off the CGI budget. But instead of rolling out colossal spectacle for its own sake, Shazam! uses these sequences to support the movie's themes and define the characters and their personalities.It helps, of course, that Shazam isn't as well known as some of his superpowered contemporaries. The character began in the 1940s as a Superman knock-off called Captain Marvel, which was later acquired by DC Comics after a legal dispute. Eventually, the name had to be changed for legal reasons. That old moniker now belongs to DC Comics' biggest rival, Marvel, which rolled out the big-screen debut of the current Captain Marvel last month.The contrast between the two films couldn't be more stark: Captain Marvel was a charmless and underwhelming film about an personality-free character who struggled with nothing. The movie worked through predictable, forgettable superhero movie paces in pedestrian fashion, then expected viewers to show up and cheer simply because it existed. Shazam! is an energetic, charismatic movie about a relatable hero who struggles with everything. The movie works overtime to entertain, giving viewers something to appreciate and remember in nearly every scene. Captain Marvel, in other words, was the kind of superhero movie that breeds cynicism; Shazam! is the kind that defeats it. Finally, there's a Captain Marvel movie worth seeing.",Shazam!
227,itsbobr,Kids' Movie.

Problem is Shazam is still Billy at 14-yrs old.This movie starts out in the most confusing manner I have seen in a long time. Yes, it all comes around after 30-minutes to help us understand, but this takes way too long. Way too long. We see too much of when Dr Sivana was a boy, and we really didn't need to see it.We remember Captain Marvel appearing, when Billy Batson shouts, ""Shazam"" and this is a spoof on all of that. Hollywood doesn't know what to do anymore and decides to make things what we knew as good and true as Wonky now ................. (Yes, Wonky)Not sure how DC was able to use a Marvel character albeit with another name, not Captain Marvel. Here Billy Batson does not use a crutch as we knew him to do in Captain Marvel comics. The boy with the crutch is Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer), Billy's friend.But this is a movie for 8-yr olds. The banter is too childish especially the banter by Shazam. I thought adults would enjoy this but childish banter by Shazam rules this movie and in most cases, not good. The CGI is most prevalent and is very good, but yes, it too, goes on for too long, too, as most movies with CGI battles do.Shazam fights Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong) who with his Evil Eye has the powers of Shazam, too. The problem here is that Dr. Sivana needs Shazam's powers to rule the universe.Notables: Marta Milans as Rosa, foster mother to Billy; Cooper Andrews as Victor as foster father to Billy; John Glover as Mr Sivana and is the father of Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong). The foster kids in Rosa's and Victor's home become prominent players near the end.So................... kind of disappointing and Hollywood has no idea how to make an adult/kids movie all can enjoy. The real problem here was that the dialogues given to Shazam (Zachary Levi) were just too childish and more conducive to an 8-yr old, not a 14-yr old. Perhaps a natural thing, but it went too far and for me it was absolutely annoying and yes, Wonky. However, the 8-yr olds will enjoy this. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

229,TheVictoriousV,"They DO make 'em like that, still!",7,8 April 2019,"Warner Bros. and DC's Shazam! is one of those films where the cheesy and clichéd elements would have been far more problematic had the film taken itself seriously. DC finally realize what tone is best suited for men in tights going on adventures. This is true of their movies, at least. The inverse seems to be happening with their TV shows, judging from the Arrowverse compared to whatever in God's name that gritty Teen Titans reboot was.Didn't you like Captain Marvel? Well, perhaps you might enjoy another Captain Marvel - not the one from the Marvel comics (who was also called Miss Marvel, except that name wasn't used for the female-led movie adaptation), but the one from DC's Shazam! franchise, where a small boy transforms into a grown superhero when he says a magic word. Confused? Then go see Endgame or Hellboy instead because there's a LOT of comic-book cinema to choose from this month. But Shazam! isn't a bad choice at all.In this version, possibly to avoid confusion with the aforementioned MCU movie, Captain Marvel does not have that name, in spite of predating Marvel Comics' similarly named hero. Instead ""Shazam"" is his moniker AND his catchphrase. Before all that, however, he is young William Batson (Asher Angel), a disorderly orphan who receives extraordinary powers from the ""original"" Shazam, an ancient wizard played by Djimon Hounsou (I'm sure it's just a coincidence).Thus William becomes the new Shazam (Zachary Levi), who may look like your typical super-man but still exhibits the traits of the child he is within. His sidekick of sorts becomes Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer), his nerdy foster brother who is an aficionado of superheroes. Is that really considered a ""nerdy"" interest in a world where they're known to exist?The wizard has long searched for worthy candidates to inherit his magic. Among them was Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (played by Mark Strong as an adult), who now works to return to Shazam's realm and obtain that which, in his mind, was denied him. Alas, it is the heart that counts and Sivana returns to ""our world"" with powers far more sinister.This film is heaps of fun, with an understandable villain, similarly well-developed good guys, and an entertaining relationship at the center, namely that of Freddy and our hero - both versions of him. This is a movie that knows how to use most of what it's got, whether it's archetypes, old themes about family, or pieces of music, creating a comic-book film that manages to be amusingly self-aware yet more moving and heartfelt than anything with Snyder's name on it. Was that so hard?I don't mean to say that dark and serious superhero films are impossible. I am simply asserting that it's impossible when the final product is as disjointed and patently laughable as Dawn of Justice. Unlike that stinkhole, Shazam! is one where I can foresee younger viewers taking it with them into adulthood as a joyous memory.I don't know whether this film is meant to truly fit into the DC Extended Universe. As mentioned, it doesn't quite fit the tone (in spite of how goofy Aquaman was), and heck, Hounsou already played a different character in the main movies. Or, wait, could it be that the DCEU is a poorly managed dumpster fire that no-one involved remotely cares about? Naaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh.Oh right, I'm supposed to be positive (which is difficult, what with Marvel paying me off and all). Bottom line: take a break from the hardships of life and go see this movie. It's bound to take you back to your kidhood, even though you haven't seen this superhero movie in particular. And don't let the cringe factor of certain trailers fool you, please.SIDENOTE: The film is by Swedish director David F. Sandberg and the film contains references to his previous works, including the Lights Out short film and, most surprisingly, his Swedish-language animated short ""Vad tyst det blev"". That one knocked me for a loop.",Shazam!
230,danybur,Learning to be a superhero,8,11 April 2021,"SummaryThis film about the myth of origin and the learning story of a superhero who recovers the playful spirit of the youth films of the 80s, thanks to a comedy tone that always prevails over the shadows of the story, the great chemistry between its protagonists and its troops action scenes.Review:Billy Batson (Asher Angel), is a teenager who since childhood has been escaping from their transit homes and foster families to find his mother. Shortly after starting to live in Philadelphia with the last one, he fortuitously acquires super powers and an adult body (Zachary Levi), falling into the crosshairs of a fearsome villain, Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong).Shazam! It recovers a certain spirit of the youth films of the 80s thanks to its playful spirit. It is a story about the origin myth of a superhero (and also of his nemesis) and his learning path in a comedy tone that, although it does not evade the rugged or sad aspects of the family stories of Batson and Sivana, never let them take center stage by overshadowing the tone, cutting them off with effective touches of humor (a bit in the manner of Tim Burton's Batman Returns). Fortunately, by not making concessions in this regard, the film directed by David F. Sandberg departs from the gravity and solemnity of many superhero films of the last decades. And the humor that he displays is not cool or self-conscious either.In addition to the enmity and struggles with Dr. Sivana, the other (and perhaps main) axis of the film is Billy's friendship with Freddy (Jack Dylan Glazer, the protagonist of the series We Are Who We Are, de Luca Guadagnino), one of his ""brothers"" in the transit home, who accompanies him in his apprenticeship as a superhero. Precisely the most interesting and successful part of the film is the description of that bond, of a double dynamic for Freddy since it implies being a friend of the same person who can manifest himself as someone of the same age and as someone in an adult body and not so much the mismatches that Billy himself has with his new and extraordinary situation. You can even read the occasional provocative subtext in those situations.The action scenes and special effects are very well resolved and in keeping with the tone of the film, the pace does not falter and the performances are very good, particularly that of the brilliant Jack Dylan Glazer, whose character breathes and articulates the humanity of the whole story.",Shazam!
231,jackgdemoss,Superhero Fatigue? I had abdominal fatigue from laughing so hard!,9,6 April 2019,"If I had to pick one phrase to describe Shazam!, it would be 'subversion of expectations'. This phrase applies both to my overall experience with the film as well as each obstacle that is tackled in the plot. I went in with moderate expectations and left with a sore stomach from laughing so hard the whole time. Shazam! is more self-aware of the genre than any superhero film I have seen before, and it wears it proudly. The brilliance of the comedic writing and tone of the first half of the movie really sets it up to do whatever the hell it wants with the back half because they had me hooked so hard. Thankfully, the pacing remains strong and beats onward with light-hearted comedy, a difficult exploration of acceptance, and a satisfying conclusion. If you are ready to have a few laughs, Shazam! is the best superhero film to watch.",Shazam!
232,ariqakbar,somehow this gave me a goosebumps,8,3 April 2019,"Dc really step up his game, i though it will be go 'playing safe' game after aquaman. but shazam show that he has his own strength in movie game.it was totally fun, the joke was good until the end. you'll laugh from pure reaction from a child that got a super power not from some cheap joke. it was fun because thats what a kid do when he got super power. Billy not just suddenly have a great superhero mental. the way that he react, that's how this character supposed to think. he step up in a last second (when freddy got beat up), he run when he know he doesn't have to fight dr.sivana. really good character.this is how origin story need to feel, yes you can put another hero stuff but dont steals the core hero that been told. perfect portion.and i wanna mention something that for me was a really good detail. the atmosphere that show that even after all super power stuff, the set still take a place in a normal world. the way that the story make every action cross with normal people life was genius. it show the feeling that even a little action still have an impact to a people. i think that kind of value that make every transformation scene feel really epic. i still got a goosebumps from a rooftop scene even after seeing it in trailler so many time",Shazam!
233,namob-43673,Well at least another not horrible DCEU movie...,2,4 April 2019,"The DCEU has been giving us several of the worst movies of all time. Yes Wonder Woman was half-competent, but so boring and the constant jumping from scene to scene annoys me to this day. Man of Steel could have been a really good movie, but the first and last 15 min ruined it. Aquaman was so dumb I was laughing at almost every scene. Still... those three movies is the best DCEU have to offer - which is so sad...I want my favorite character of all time, The Question, to have his own movie, but with this level of incompetence I do not want them to make that movie.Zhazam is on par with those three mentioned above, so it is not a good movie, it is actually kind of terrible, but it is not badly made as certain other installment that should remain name(BvS)less.I do have a few positives. The friendship between Billy and Freddy is pretty good, child actors in a DCEU movie that actually can act? Wow. Who would have ever thought? And this is also the biggest strength of this movie, the kids relationship work and since the movie is fairly competent and have some laughs it can be a movie to take your children to, maybe, but not too young children... This is a kids movie made for kids (mostly), and as such it is almost okay.
The acting in general is solid, and in opposite to all other DCEU movies (except MoS) this do not have an ugly color palette that make you try to adjust the light and brightness of your eyes and squint to see what is going on. And finally this is also, at times, pretty funny - there are some jokes that work, and a few jokes actually make you laugh.Unfortunately this movie is not just a kids movie made for kids, I also very often get the feeling it is made by kids. What I mean is that there are too many juvenile attempts at humor that do not work, and there are too many scenes that must have been written by 7 year olds. However, weirdly enough, I am going to contradict myself since there are other scenes and events in this movie which are kind of scary and pretty adult, which feels wrong, is it a kids movie or not? I do not know, and neither does this movie.The CGi... oh my lord... If I could take over as dictator of the DCEU for a day my first order of business would be to fire the entire special effects and CGi department. How can they, over and over, in movie after movie, produce such horrible computer graphics and absolute atrocious special effects? I can easily name 10 TV shows with better CGi than the entire DCEU, and this movie is yet another abysmal failure. Well, at least Zackary did not need a mustache removed... so there is that...
The action and the superhero stuff in this movie is also pretty bad. There are a couple of cool-ish scenes (you saw those in the trailers) and one of those ""scary"" scenes was actually really good, why did they not make the entire movie that good?
The music is horrible.
And since when is there no blood anywhere in big horrific scenes?
This movie tries so hard to make the audience laugh that it almost create the opposite effect. Yes there are a few times when I genuinely laughed, but not very often and it is so obvious how and when they are setting up those ""funny"" moments that a yawn is more likely the outcome than a laugh.
Speaking of predictable; I usually refer to Black Panther to be the most predictable superhero movie of all time, but this... oh man, this is so predictable that not only will you know the entire movie, you will also know exactly what will happen scene by scene.
The Villain have very little motivation, and is evil for the sake being evil, and he is evil in a very comedic Adam West´s Batman kind of a way.I could go on for a long time about the bad in this movie, but I feel like it would be giving it more attention than it deserves. I give Zhazam a 3/10 just because I like the kids and it is not as awful as most of the other installments. If you are 10yo and your parents do not mind you seeing a few ""scary"" scenes, this might be for you, otherwise I would not recommend this to anyone.",Shazam!
234,GomezAddams666,The hero DC fans deserve,10,6 April 2019,"I will start by being honest, I am not as familiar with the comic book lore as I am with another adaptations... but by god, this was fun!This is not your typical comic book movie and it doesn't have to be, the better entries in the genre are the ones that do not conform into filling out tiny boxes to meet a quota, and this was a straight up teenage comedy, very reminiscent of 1988's BIG, so much so it even pays a little tribute to it.Newcomer Asher Angel really sells the Billy Batson character as a young boy who seeks that sense of belonging, and Zachary Levi really excels at playing a 14-year-old boy in the body of an adult man. The movie benefits a lot from its talented cast, including amazing performances by Jack Dylan Grazer and the ever terrifying Mark Strong as Dr. Thaddeus Sivana. The rest of the cast is really good and it manages to sell this movie as a family film in more ways than one.Its soundtrack was astounding, I found myself pounding my fist into the air during the super power montage because their song of choice was astounding.The only thing I can criticize is the CGI, and that is only in some instances where it seems a bit bad and unreal, but when a film is this powerful we can let that slide.My rating? 10 out of 10.Shazam is the Superhero film DC fans deserve.In fact, how about they make Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Shazamthe new DCEU Holy Trinity? They can make tons of movies and I would watch every single one of them.",Shazam!
235,MrPupkin,Shazam! is a total blast and Zachary Levi is charming and a treat to watch as he has fun being a superhero.,7,21 January 2020,"The funny thing with Shazam is it almost feels like half of it is an indie film about an orphan boy finding a family and the other half is this wacky superhero movie. The other funny this is, it kind of works! Kind of. Both parts I actually really like. I didn't think I'd like all the other orphan kids, his new family, but I really enjoyed their stories. The superhero comedy stuff all works too. Zachary Levi is absolutely fantastic as an adult superhero with a child's mind, and he's just damn funny. The villain is a bit standard, but still enjoyable enough, and the movie is just a great time. Where it doesn't quite work for me, and really my only nitpick, is the blending of the two elements. I don't quite buy Shazam and Billy Batson as the same character. Billy is this brooding sad character, and Shazam is fun and wacky.",Shazam!
236,skip-98756,Poor Attempt at the SuperHero Genre,4,15 May 2019,"I wanted to like this but man, it just fell flat ...The acting,the CGI, the lighting, and the writing itself left Alot to be desired..The proper super hero movies by marvel and DC have nothing to be worried about with this thing, its not competition and not in the same league....It tries to be funny, but doesnt quite make it..the same with the cgi which looks passable in some instances such as with the villian, but atrocious at other times with the main character...this could have gotten a better score with a shortened and cleaned up storyline which dragged and dragged on and on with silly cgi fights in a circus park...these were overplayed to the max and ruined the flow,what there was of it....I love seeing empowered characters and the incredible feats they can accomplish, it can make anyone wide eyed but This has been done before and done Much much better than what we see here...this is like a poor mans copy of a real superhero movie...it can be fun and somewhat interesting,long dragged out scenes aside, but there are so many other movies that excel over this one...thumbs down from me.",Shazam!
237,LukeCustomer2,Not as good as I hoped.,6,1 December 2019,"Fine story and they definitely tried... but there were a few problems with this movie which really bothered me. I didn't feel the adult Shazam and the teen Shazam were the same person. Levi played himself playing what he thought a teen would be like.. the actual teen was much more grounded. If they had dropped a line like in the ""Mask"" indicating that the powers had an exaggerated personality effect I could have dealt with it but no to me it was just glaring that they acted so differently. I didn't understand the motivation of the bad guy at all. He seemed to just be a bad guy for bad guy ""reasons"". Which wasn't compelling. He also didn't seem to have much of a plan. Everything involving the younger Billy being a foster kid and learning valuable lessons from it was good but everything involving Shazam was just horrible.",Shazam!
238,CabbageCustard,Absolute winner of a superhero flick!,8,7 June 2019,"This movie is absolutely delightful from beginning to end. Every child who has fantasised about having superpowers and every adult who isn't too jaded to remember doing that will love this. The story is engaging, the cast is spot on, the comedy elements actually work (not something that can be said about every superhero flick) and you really care about the characters. Watching the two boys explore the possibilities of one of them suddenly being an adult and Shazam growing into a true superhero is a joy. There are many scenes to love in this. I especially loved the very final scene as all the kids enjoy lunch together. Very clever. Kudos to Asher Angel, Jack Dylan Grazer and especially Zachary Levi (who nails the exuberance of a kid in an adult's body) for their performances in the lead roles. In fact, I can only think of one misstep in the cast of the movie and that is the casting of Djimon Hounsou as the wizard. I'm sure he is a fine actor, but he did not have the gravitas or presence of Ian McKellan as Gandalf or Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and was unsuited to the role. He looked more like a hobo than a centuries-old wizard. That's only one small flaw in an otherwise great movie though. I hope it's not too long till we see the inevitable sequel to this.I can't help but contrast this movie with 'Captain Marvel', which I watched the night before this. That particular movie failed in every way that this one succeeded. If Marvel don't watch out, they are soon going to be eclipsed by DC as the pre-eminent superhero movie universe.",Shazam!
239,Lewis_Heather787,*Sigh*.......... I'm in the minority on this one!,4,6 April 2019,"You wouldn't have believed it about 4-5 years ago that a film like this would come out when Warner Bros and DC were attempting to start a Cinematic Universe to rival Disney and Marvel's. A lot has changed since now and then, unfortunately I was dreading that this would eventually happen to DC due to the reaction of their previous entries and the ultimate failure of the DCEU..........or whatever it was called. (I'm pretty sure that either Walter Hamada or someone at the top of Warner Bros or DC has stated that there moving away from a shared universe.....I could be misinformed).Even though I really didn't like the film there are still some aspects that I enjoyed. Firstly the main story of Billy Batson is a heart warming one and definitely gets you on board with his character and what he is going through. As an audience member you instantly get behind and root for him, its good screenwriting. Its only increased once you add in the other kids in the foster home, their dynamic is fantastic and I have to admit is some of the best parts of the film. Also makes me understand why people would love this film.The other positive I have is the performances across the board are all you want them to be. Zachary Levi was born to play this part and he is very good in the role of Shazam. He pulls of the, little kid trapped in a man's body, very well without it making look like an adult pretending to be a kid. All the other kids and also the foster parents are very good in their specific roles, not much to them but very well done.Unfortunately thats it for the positives...........In a nutshell I really didn't like this film for one pretty simple reason, this is not my kind of film or more specifically what I want in a comic book film. Forced comedy is something that I have moaned about in the MCU films for years and is the reason why I don't like a lot of their films. Don't get me wrong there is absolutely nothing wrong if you love this film or love comedy in these types of films. Its just not for me. I don't know why but lighthearted comic book films just go over my head, I'm more looking for films like ""The Dark Knight"", ""Watchmen"" or even ""Man of Steel"". (Yeah even I'm not the greatest fan of BVS, so the seriousness can be over done)However not everyone shares the same opinion as me evidently and I have no problem with that, the comedy just takes away all the stakes, repercussions, realism, seriousness and tension. I'm fully aware that this film was not going to have any of those characteristics, but I was prepared to give the film the benefit of the doubt and give it chance.Overall its 45% out of 100 or 4.5 out of 10, I personally didn't like it at all. This film is just not for me but I can fully understand why people would love it. Its fun, lighthearted entertainment that is at a good quality, in a weird way I would probably recommend it to people because I'm in the minority with this opinion.P.S. Lucky DC haven't given up completely on the more dark/realistic comic book films, praying for the ""Joker"" to be good later in the year.",Shazam!

I also don't think it makes sense that the mom of Billy would let the police take care of him. Though she is 17 in the flashbacks, it doesn't make sense to give him up. I did enjoy when the other foster kids turned into superheroes toward the end, but their personalities were flat to me before that.",Shazam!
242,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Fun but corny,8,6 April 2019,"This movie is definitely a lot of fun. And can also be pretty corny at times. I genuinely had a smile on my face for most of the movie. Some jokes were a little eye-roll inducing but that doesnt detract too much.Zachary Levi is great in the role, and they do a good job of making it believable that a 14 year old is really trapped in an adult's body. Is a 14 year old with new found powers going to really stop crime? Or are they gonna try and score beer and chicks? Again, not only were those scenes fun to watch but Zachary Levi (who is an adult) makes it so innocent. And he's so energetic too. And the movie really works when Shazam is not on screen too. I loved the stuff with the foster family. I even feel that Jack Dylan Grazer (who plays Freddy) was the true MVP of the film. For me, not only does he get all the funny lines but he also gets a pretty good gut punching scene where he tells Shazam off. I felt a lot for that character. There was also a cameo towards the end that really tickled my inner teen girl's nostalgia.That being said, I thought the bad guy was pretty lame. The special effects were so so as well. Sometimes it was well done and others looked like it came out of late 90s, early 2000s movie. If you dont bother to try and age up characters or de-age them for flashbacks...it kind of takes me out. Why does Billy's mother and Dr Sivana (is that his name?) father look the same? There was also a few scenes that reminded me of other movies. One scene in particular reminded me of Spider-man Homecoming.So overall I enjoyed the movie. It's not my favourite movie of the year as some others have said. I'd probably rate it a 7.5.",Shazam!

246,dussaultjulien,"Very slow start, but once it gets going it gets fun",7,16 June 2019,"I really didn't have high expectations walking into this movie. It got mixed reviews, some very good, and others very bad.
*I will say that before you watch this movie know that it is very childish and you can tell who their target audience is within the first 20 minutes heck maybe within even the first 10, but it is a very fun movie, once it gets started, which doesn't really start close to 30 minutes into the freaking film. I'd say the first 45 minutes were kind of a waste of time for both the audience, and the character. It could definitely have been written better, or even written completely out but otherwise a great film once they stop treating the entire audience like a child.I was surprised by this movie, in fact I thought I was going to walk out, and I almost did at minute 45, but ended ups staying and having a good time.The fight scenes were pretty long and drug out, and the whole ""I'm a super powered individual who should know how to use my powers, but don't now that I need them"" trope is present and makes it boring, but is otherwise enjoyable for the most part.

247,AdrenalinDragon,"Say the word ""Awesome!""",8,12 April 2019,"Let's face it. The DC movies have been all over the place in terms of quality. One thing that was consistent with almost all their movies were taking themselves really seriously. Aquaman was close to breaking this trend being an semi-serious entertaining DC film that went off the rails in sections, but the movie had big issues with its plot and writing. Shazam is the first DC movie that is
completely self-aware and does not take itself seriously, but also is well written for the most part. It also manages to bring in a good balance of both darkness and lightness in tone with Demon monsters and having fun with a young teenager getting used to being an adult superhero and testing his Superhero powers with comedic effect. The satire and jokes played with the Superhero genre is fun to watch and what's most impressive is most of the main cast members give pretty great performances, including the child actors.There's also more depth here than just your average Superhero movie. Shazam has quite a build-up before the main plot actually kicks in, and I respect that the movie actually shows us the main character's life and his friends and families for a good chunk of it before he actually becomes Shazam. It's easy for Superhero movies to just rush into the main plot, but Shazam actually pulls it off nicely and
gives the characters some nice emotional moments with various side characters throughout the movie. It's nice to see these sections sprinkled in-between the action sequences. It kind of reminded me of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy in that way. If I had to criticize a tiny bit, some of the CGI is a bit ropey in places. However, some of the set/production design is also really impressive. The use of
music fits tonally with the movie and the score is decent for the most part, too. Most DC movies have pretty weak villains, but Shazam has one that I actually like and his performance along with the main lead gives us some of the funniest scenes in the movie because of it.Overall, Shazam was a surprise hit for me. I didn't expect it to be this great and I had alot of fun watching it. It manages to strike a great balance between lightness and seriousness without feeling forced. I genuinely think DC here have a winner. I easily preferred watching this over Marvel's Captain Marvel and I can't wait to see it again. One of my favourite movies of 2019 easily so far.8/10",Shazam!

250,PCC0921,Captain Marvel has come a long way.,8,24 September 2020,"The Shazam character has always been one of those silly, hard-to-believe, absurd type of characters, that was created and molded over time. It was pushed mostly for comic-relief by original owner Fawcett Publications and DC in the 1950s-1970s, mostly because of the post comics-code era. DC has a lot of characters like that; Plastic Man, Elongated Man, Blue Beetle, Guy Gardner. just to name a few. It was the childish aspect of the old-DC that separated it from the more serious Marvel. But, that all changed in the 1980s when DC decided to go more sophisticated, more serious and more dark. So, in order to capture the true encapsulated version of the Shazam character (also named Captain Marvel back in the old days and to put this in true perspective; Batman and Captain Marvel/Shazam both turned 80 in 2019), from all the eras in the comics, into a 2019 film, those troublesome aspects of the character might still be there. They were, but who cares?The film still contains that silly, hard-to-believe, comic-relief absurdity that made it hard for DC to sell the character to serious fans back in the day, but the film also tempered some of that by bringing you back to reality and punching you in the face with either bad guys killing people or some kind of everyday drama that we all have to face. It is that reason why I think this film is appealing to critics, to fans and making a boat-load of money. So, even though I thought the film was silly, hard-to-believe and sometimes absurd I was still able to see past all of that, because even though Shazam is a 14 year old boy inside the body of a Superman type of superhero, the film also never forgets to remind you that Superhero-ing is not for kids. Also, it's an origin story, so hopefully these films get even better from here. I heard a rumor that Shazam might appear in as many as five more films in this next phase of the DCEU. They are off to a pretty good start, but beware of the absurdity.8.1 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",Shazam!

I thought it looked like a corny joke of a movie that was marketed strictly for 10 year olds.
Then the first reviews came out and the coldness of my attitude thawed out a bit.
Then I had friends telling me they saw it numerous times over because of how good it was? This was the breaking point and I knew I had to see it, and all I can say is, wow, has DC hit a home run! It surprised me how well it did in the shadow of both Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame. Shazam! is brave in being both intense but great for kids, and also amazing at building its characters and getting us invested in them (I was in love with the foster parents!)

I found it to be a hackneyed snorefest with uninteresting characters, excessively hoaky writing and a severe lack of thrills. One could argue that it's a comedy first, from the trailers it seemed like off-the-walls fun that's not to be taken seriously. However, I didn't find the jokes all that effective and the story engaging enough. Way too corny and by-the-books for my taste. It's just kind of a tonal jumble, switching back forth between a superhero narrative and a lighthearted family flick about pre-teens. It's very distracting, as if you're watching Superman, but the next scene it's suddenly Diary of a Wimpy Kid. To be fair, the performances (particularly from the younger actors) were decent, I especially enjoyed how outright diabolical the villain is as well as the visuals that supported him, and those animated credits at the end were pretty rad, but other than that I was very let down.

257,foxtografo,"Ok, entertaining comedy",6,1 July 2019,"It's just that, a family comedy.
Not really what I look for in superhero movies, to be honest, but I don't know much about the original characters, so I can't say if it's faithful to the comic or just a different take of it.
Still, it's an entertaining movie, even though it could easily loose 20 minutes or more, definitely too long for this kind of movie.
Acting it's ok in general, but it really bettered me that Billy and Shazam didn't act and talked like the same person, the were really disjointed as a character that only changes his aspect.
Story is ok (again, for a comedy) and effects are ok too but looking quite average on the designs...
Nothing special or new, really, comedy and superheroes has been done before.
Still, it's a watchable movie, easy going, I can see it can please a lot of people for a bit of relaxed fun.",Shazam!

260,fredschaefer-406-623204,Great to see one of comics OG's getting his due.,9,8 April 2019,"This lifelong comic book fan must admit, I was never a big fan of the original Captain Marvel, or Shazam, as he has become known; until recently, I have always been a diehard Marvel Comics guy, and I long considered that other Captain Marvel to be a corny character from a long gone era, one whom DC Comics kept trying to breathe life into repeatedly ever since they bought the rights to him in the early 70's. To me, this square stiff couldn't hold a candle to Spider-Man and the members of the Fantastic Four; at best it was a comic book for little kids. But times do change, today, I find myself buying more DC titles than Marvel, and the Rebirth version of Shazam managed to draw my interest, and as someone who tries never to miss a live action comic book movie, there was no way I was going not see the live action SHAZAM!And when it comes to these live action adaptations, I always feel they succeed or fail on the question of whether the film makers understood what made the comic book work, and what drew readers to it in the first place, and kept them there. If they were able to understand this core premise, and get it up there on the screen, then the movie worked; if not, then the results were often not pretty - see Ang Lee and what he did to The Hulk. Happily, the film version of Shazam, directed by David F. Sandberg succeeds mightily in this aspect, giving us an action filled, very funny super hero take on BIG, filled with a lot of heart. And like the recent AQUAMAN, it is blessedly free of the grimness and angst that plagued Warner Brothers recent attempts to bring Batman and Superman to the screen. Sahzam was the original teen hero, the story of young Billy Batson, a 14 year old homeless kid, who because of a good deed, proves himself to be worthy in the eyes of an ancient wizard to receive great powers, and transform into an adult super hero. The hook of the story has always been that it is about a kid in an adult body, an adult body with super strength, super speed and the ability to fly among other things. As with the premise, the story all but writes itself.The movie moves easily through the three act arc, starting with introductions, origins and exposition, then moving on to confrontations and a final resolution. We meet Billy, a kid on the street looking for the mother who abandoned him, once in a new foster home; he comes to the aid a disabled foster brother being picked on by bullies, this prompting the ancient wizard to choose him as a successor. Billy really is a good kid, who might do some questionable things for good reasons, while Thaddeus Sivana, the Big Bad of the story, is selfish and bitter, failing his test when he has the chance to inherit the Wizard's power, instead being tempted by the Seven Deadly Sins, imprisoned demons who promise him much if he releases them. I give the film makers credit for introducing Sivana's back story first, giving us the set up for the hero, while giving the villain a believable motive, something too many other super hero movies fail to do. The heart of the movie are the scenes between the transformed Billy, and his foster brother, the crippled Freddy Freeman, as they try figure out his powers, and exploit them for personal gain as only two 14 year old boys can. There is plenty of comedy as Billy tries to buy beer and get into a Gentleman's Club using his adult alter ego. This goes to the appeal of the story, and for that matter, the comic book character - the empowerment of teenagers, a time in your life when you are expected to act like an adult, but have absolutely none of the freedom, or power that comes with it. And they get the right mixture of comedy with darkness; the Seven Deadly Sins are represented as nasty monsters in league with Sivana, a cruel man with no redeeming features, perfectly okay with hurting children.The other key feature they get right is the casting. Zachary Levi is physically spot on as the transformed Billy - the guy can pull off heroic and comic with ease - but Asher Angel makes it all work as the teenage Billy. Together, these two actors play one character in two different bodies and do it seamlessly. And in Jack Dylan Grazer's Freddy Freeman, they have a great partner to play off in some of the movie's best scenes, which unlike some other super hero films, depend a lot on dialogue. As with the Bond movies, if they get the villain right, half the battle is done and nobody could have played Sivana better than Mark Strong, there really is something about casting a Brit in these kinds of parts. All praise to the young actors they hired to play Billy and Freddy's extended foster family, and not making them snarky and annoying as so many films do with young characters today. There is a deep supporting cast filled with familiar faces: Djimon Hounsou, Adam Brody, Cooper Andrews, D.J. Cotrona, John Glover, and Ross Butler. Hounsou is becoming something of a go to guy for comic book movies after appearing in this, along with AQUAMAN, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, and CAPTAIN MARVEL (the other company's hero). Brody, Butler, and Cotrona are great choices to play the super powered versions of Billy's foster siblings, especially Brody as the alter ego of Grazer's Freddy. The biggest laugh out loud moment in the movie comes when Shazam asks his brothers and sisters to grasp the magical staff that confers power and say his name.At more than two hours, the film is a tad long, but the fast pacing helps, it also helps that the screenplay manages to avoid the exposition traps that sometimes sink any fantasy project - Billy grabs the Wizard's staff, says ""Shazam"" and becomes a super hero - just like that, and while this may seem on the thin side when it comes to super hero origin stories, it's simplicity is its strength. The CGI looks like CGI, for good or for bad, but I don't find it a problem when the movie is not totally dependent on CGI to sell it.Many have commented that SHAZAM bears way more than passing resemblance to Penny Marshall's BIG, and there is a great shout out to the latter movie in the film, but Shazam is one of the original archtypes of comics: the teen super hero, predating both Superboy and Spider-Man, and his influence has been significant, as the small teen transformed into muscle bound hero trope clearly influenced Hanna Barbera's Saturday morning creations, Young Samson and Sinbad Jr. And they in turn were direct forbearers of He Man. So it is nice to see the OG finally get his place in the sun in the 21st Century.Of course, this being a super hero movie, there are credit sequences, and SHAZAM is no exception, as we are introduced to another one of his classic villains, setting up a sequel that hopefully lead to a show down with Black Adam, who might be played by Duane Johnson. Then there is a certain other heavy hitter from the DC movie universe who makes a brief appearance of a sort.
So with AQUAMAN and now SHAZAM, DC and Warner Brothers is clearly on a winning streak, maybe there is hope the cinematic versions of Batman and Superman yet.",Shazam!
261,arabnikita,A 90s movie for 11 year olds,5,5 April 2019,"Marvel made Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant Man, both were were unexpectedly good and funny. DCEU made Suicide Squad and Shazam but instead of pending time to work on the movie quality and actually humor, they decided to spend their time hyping it up and while Shazam is definitely better than SS, it is not even close to the level of Marvel and it truly breaks my heart because of how much I love DC.Shazam is a cool superhero with cool looking superpowers and cool charisma about him but that doesn't make a 130 minute movie. The whole experience felt like a 90s TV movie/cartoon about a 2nd tier hero and villains. The background is there, the hero is there, the plot is there but it all feels so ""cheap"", basic and all over the place. The writers were too lazy to take an interesting story and shape it to look original and exciting. The bullies, the wizard, the villain, the 7 sins, the fight scenes are all done half-heartedely.Yes, the jokes are there and some hit the spot but they get lost in the overall mess. Shazam feels like it is made for 11 year olds and it has good messages about overcoming adversity, friendship and getting superpowers. Sadly DCEU is not in the position to make movies for specific audiences. Aquaman had a weak plot but it was confident in appealing to everyone and was a BOMB visually, Shazam also has a weak plot but feels insecure of itself and in the terms of humor it is merely a Firecracker.#moviesshmovies",Shazam!
262,hunter-friesen,"""Shazam!"" fizzles out",4,5 April 2019,"I would have called you crazy if you had told me that we get both a Captain Marvel and Shazam film in the same year. But stranger things have happened, which is something we've had to get used to over the past couple of years. So now the year is 2019 and both of these films have premiered within the span of a month. Unfortunately, as much as I am happy to see these films get their moment to shine, the experience that I got out of both of them didn't match well with my expectations.This superhero origin story centers around Billy Batson, a troubled kid that has committed his whole life to run away from foster homes and finding his real mom.On one fateful day, Billy is approached by an all-seeing wizard that wishes to transfer his power to him so that he may fight off the seven deadly sins that seek to destroy humanity. By speaking the wizard's name, Billy is suddenly transformed into the unstoppable superhero Shazam that possess the combined powers of the Greek gods.With his nearly unlimited new powers, Billy must now set out to do good in the world, while still trying to find his real home.""Shazam!"" is directed by David F. Sandberg, who has made his name with the horror films ""Annabelle: Creation"" and ""Lights Out"".One admirable thing that can be said of Sandberg is his intention and ability to make this film a moderately fun ride throughout as it pokes fun at itself from time to time.To my regret, that is probably the only good thing that can be said about his directing, which has a consistent pattern of him pacing so much smaller material into an already overstuffed main narrative.The biggest issue that plagues ""Shazam!"" is that it always acts like it's different than all the other superhero films, even though it really isn't. This problem can be glaringly seen in the egregious 132-minute runtime, which follows the generic origin path where the hero gets their powers, has some struggles along the way, and then vanquishes evil in a climatic CGI battle. The one thing that that this film does different lies within its effects, which are a lot worse when compared to the competition.Written by Henry Gayden, ""Shazam!"" tries really hard (and fails) to be the family-friendly version of ""Deadpool"".The problem that this film repeatedly runs into stems from the fact that Deadpool's style works solely on the effortless charm of Ryan Reynolds and its ability to be R-rated, two things that ""Shazam!"" sorely lacks.To be fair, a few of the jokes are actually quite funny, but the majority just fall flat and feel like a pale imitation.Another problem with ""Shazam!"" is the terrible one-dimensional villain, whose name I couldn't remember until the credits rolled by.Basically, he's a supervillain that does bad things because that's what a supervillain does. Clear motives for his actions or any other defining character traits are nonexistentRetouching on the point of needless subplots, the whole storyline about the missing mother is handled quite amateurishly and laughably underwhelms in its conclusion. Part of the blame can be placed on Sandberg for spending too much time on it, but most of it should go to Gayden for not cutting this tedious and unimportant plot out of an already bloated story.Maybe the finest quality that this film has lies within its lead actor, Zachary Levi, who brings a lot of energy to the titular role. He's no Ryan Reynolds, of which he tries really hard to be, but he does a good enough job to cover over many of the storytelling faultsAsher Angel plays Billy and does a below average job. His performance of Billy as an insufferably meddling kid wildly contrasts with Levi's and makes it really hard to believe both of them are playing the same core character.The villain role of Sivana is played by Mark Strong. Just like his character, Strong's dull performance is immediately forgotten after watching.Lastly, Djimon Hounsou underwhelmingly stars as the wizard, who can best be described as a dollar store version of Gandalf.After seven entries, the DCEU has yet to put out one above average film. And although ""Shazam!"" falls prey to many of the same problems that have besieged the other films in the universe, the one thing that it can hang its hat on is its ability to be quite entertaining for a portion of its runtime. Still, don't expect to be blown away, just moderately surprised.",Shazam!
263,opashabms-90700,Stupid Movie,4,20 March 2021,"This is a stupid movie, even for kids. I couldn't find it funny at all and the story line was garbage. Zachary Levi and Jeremy Strong's roles saved it from being totally unwatchable, but that is it.",Shazam!
264,achyutaghosh,putting the comic back in a comic book movie,8,10 April 2019,"DC is on a roll finally. It was on a roll under Nolan a decade back, and then lost it's way as the audience embraced Marvel's light hearted fare over DC deep dark ones. But this time the roll is different. Both Shazam and Aquaman are as far off from Nolan's creations as you could imagine, yet they prove that the formula for success can be different for DC.How to make comic book stories fun? Simple, just like what Harry Potter did- add a bit of magic to it. Magic is front and square in Shazam, as it starts with the origin of the supervillain Thaddeus Sivana. Belittled all his life by his father and brother, called onto the Rock of Eternity and then again rejected by a Hagrid looking ancient sorcerer (Djimon Honsou), Sivana devotes his life to getting back there to control the Seven Deadly Sins trapped by the sorcerer. What does he want to do with the deadly sins gargoyles is not quite clear but then who cares.Finding the right family is a common theme between the hero and villain in Shazam. Billy Batson (played with utmost seriousness by Asher Angel) is an orphan abandoned by his mother. That is unlucky. He finds a foster home with awesome parents and kids (including breakout star Jack Dylan Grazer as the fast talking, comic book fan Freddy). That is super lucky. Yet Billy does not feel at home, he continues to yearn for his real life mother. Whisked away by the sorcerer and being made his champion by uttering the magic word SHAZAM, he is immediately transformed into a costumed (of course) superhero with the wisdom of Solomon, strength of Hercules, stamina of Atlas, power of Zeus, courage of Achilles and the speed of Mercury. This is a buffed up, white caped, lightning fingered and utterly confused Zachary Levi.Freaky Friday revisited, and Superman, beware, there is a new kid (pun intended) in town.Freddy Freeman: What're your superpowers?
Shazam: Superpowers? Dude, I don't even know how to pee in this thing!Much of the movie's hilarious mid section is devoted to discovering Shazam's powers, and to find a right name. Captain Sparklefingers, Red Cyclone, Thundercrack, Power Boy, Zaptain America, Sir Zaps a Lot, Human Powerstorm, Mr. Philadelphia are some of the contenders proposed by Freddie. Many dumb youtube videos and cashing in on power schemes later, Shazam comes face to face with Sivana, and then things become standard superhero movie fare- biff, boom, bang with cheesy CGI. And even then the climax does not fail to spring a surprise.Avengers, beware, there is a new superhero tag team in town.Director David F Sandberg had a tight budget and a fantasy context to sell, and he does that very well, zipping through the fantastical elements and focusing more on the building lovable characters and a humour script, along with interspacing DC references throughout to keep the nerds happy. The only two things he could have done better was building up Sivana's intent (given there was no Black Adam to fight Shazam) and bringing some tonal parity in the two characters of Billy and Shazam- Billy being Nolanesque serious and Shazam being over the top delirious.Rest of it is all good and great family fare. Proof- my four year old daughter sat though the movie. This has not happened for any other movie in the recent past, so there is that. Enjoy and do stay back for the mid credit scene.",Shazam!

There's little imagination or vision and the supernatural lair in particular feels cheap and cheesy and unironically 1980s. Levi's muscle suit is unconvincing.It's nearly joyous but it doesn't quite commit itself to the full lunacy of the concept.It's nearly well cast and acted, but there are too many weak links. The teens are decent, Zachary Levi is personable enough, but Mark Strong is just there to pick up his paycheck and doesn't even bother trying with his accent. Djimon Hounsou is a fuzzy train-wreck, but fortunately isn't in it enough to wreck it.In the end, it's an unchallenging, moderately entertaining, and completely straight-forward tale that's been and gone before you know it, doing no harm but leaving no lasting impression.",Shazam!
269,mohit_sinsniwal,worth watching!,7,26 May 2019,"They must have superhero fatigue. Why? This movie is at the very least comparable to every other. Here's what this movie has:First, a lot of really genuinely good comedy. You aren't going to laugh at dirty jokes, you aren't going to laugh at corny jokes, you're going to laugh at genuinely well written and performed comedy. In fact, probably soon to be one of the most iconic comedic moments in superhero movies to date with Shazam and his foe.Second, this movie has more than one cameo. The entire team did a great job of keeping a secret cameo (and it's not the one that people might think of at the very end).Third, this has such a great portrayal of Foster families. Very often movies have these really negative, terrible portrayals of Foster kids and the families they go into. The family that Billy gets into genuinely care about each other. It's easy to see why Billy would want to accept them. Especially after you find out some information which I will not reveal here.One common criticism is that this movie forces drama between the comedic parts and that it doesn't work well. This is only somewhat true. The drama is believable, but it's a little forced, but let me play devil's advocate. We have gotten very used to incredibly great dramas, but not every movie can have this. It's a superhero movie. In all honesty, the drama in most superhero movies always comes second. It is never really THAT captivating. This shouldn't be held up to the standard of great dramas films. Really, no superhero movie should. With that being said, I find the motivation for the villain to be persuasive. Imagine that you are a child that is being bullied. Typically if you cannot rely on your family and friends to help, you're going to probably grow up with anger in your heart. In this case, he has no friends and his family ARE the bullies. Someone criticized this, but they're completely wrong. That's a strong motivation to be someone who wants to take his anger out on others (especially family).Another thing I love about this movie is that Billy is never really just motivated to start doing good. He shows that he is willing to do good. He protects Freddy from being beat up, but only when it's gone too far. He's chosen by the Wizard not because he is some perfect, good-hearted child, but because he has the potential to be exactly that. The fact that he's willing to protect Freddy from bullies and that he gets his powers, then doesn't immediately start to save everyone shows the writers knew exactly what they were doing. This isn't some shortcut to being a good person. It doesn't show that he does all of the very funny things he does just to.make the audience last. He's learning. He's still not perfect. It's only when he has to save people from a problem that he created that he even remotely starts to start trying to understand the responsibility he carries. It's not until he begins to accept his foster family as his real family does he really understand the importance of helping others. You have to remember that he's always been a loner. He's never really experienced love since.. well, you'll see, but NEVER. In fact, I don't even think he's fully understood by the end of the movie. He's still learning. And why wouldn't he be? He's only 14.This movie is absolutely great. It's much more than okay. It's honestly better than most comic book movies I've seen in awhile, but for different reasons than the other traditional superhero movies (like I said, this movie has those traditional elements, but also much more). The only way that it is ""just okay"" is if you have some serious superhero fatigue.",Shazam!
270,snowfre,"Funny, but way too many safe choices",7,23 March 2020,"""Shazam!"" is another installment in the ever struggling DC film universe, that manages one thing its companions haven't, depart from the most archetypical superhero cliches. Does it reshape the genre in any form? Not really. I would say that it ""Shazam!"" a family oriented of the successful Marvel hero Deadpool, with its title character portrayed as a light anti-hero. A Diet Deadpool if you like. So Shazam himself is really orphan Billy Batson (Angel), who after being chosen by a wizard (Hounsou) can turn into an adult superhero form (Levi). It's a fun idea, originally conceived by Bill Parker and C. C. Beck and the film has self-distance both to the whole premise and the silly name of Shazam itself. There are of course several, not so unexpectedly, scenes where Batson switches form, from an unruly teenager to a powerful superhero, and Jack Dylan Grazer, playing Batson's nerdy foster brother, has a great chemistry with Levi. While the humor is quite patterned and not very innovative, it is charming and well-balanced. Balanced to what? Well, the supervillain of course. Mark Strong plays Dr. Sivana, a villain who has a painfully cliched origin story and agenda. The whole mission he is on is easily forgotten and he is the least memorable supervillain since the new of Marvel and DC superhero craze started. ""Shazam!"" could easily have added some emotional weight by exploring more of Billy's relationship to his mother, or further developing how he approaches his new found powers, but director David F. Sandberg chose the safe path. And maybe we shouldn't blame him, DC has major issues in the battle versus Marvel. Critically and commercially. ""Shazam!"" however, stands solidly as an entertaining and fun contestant in that brawl.",Shazam!
271,EddyTheMartian007,"Shazam is a really fun movie, with a lot of heart, but it has its flaws.",7,28 March 2019,"Shazam was a lot of fun.The technical aspects were all good. The effects are surprisingly good for a lower budgeted superhero movie. The score was pretty good, but I wish Shazam had a better theme, because honestly I don't remember what his theme was at all. The movie is shot pretty well, and there's some good uses of horror elements. From the visuals, everything is just solid, definitely no complaints there. It isn't amazing by any means, but there are some really nice shots in there, and the cinematography is above average in my opinion. Also there wasn't as much action as I thought there would be, but it personally didn't bother me. All the action was pretty good too, but I don't think there was anything that really got me at the edge of my seat, but it was definitely entertaining.All of the cast is really good. Zachary Levi definitely does a great job as Shazam, he does a believable performance as a kid. Asher Angel's Billy Batson was also really good. I honestly wasn't expecting him to be that good, but he has some really good emotional scenes. All of the foster family is good too. They do have a lot of chemistry, but I felt like they were maybe a little underused. I also thought the foster parents were good too. Unfortunately the villain Dr. Sivana wasn't that good. He's okay. As a villain he actually works really well for the movie. There are some really good comedic moments between Shazam and Sivana because of their contrasting tones. Overall though, he does have a clear motive, and can be menacing, but I feel like he could've been better. I do hope to see him in the future though, Mark Strong is too good to be wasted.The comedy was actually really well done. There were multiple funny moments, and almost none were used in serious scenes. The tone is balanced very well. There were definitely some laughs, and surprisingly barely any jokes failed. Usually in more comedic movies there's a lot of jokes that fall flat, but I'd say around 90% of the jokes or funny moments work. I do have to say while the trailers did a great job of not showing too much, but there are some jokes that were ruined from them.This movie has surprisingly a lot of heart. It doesn't stray away from more mature and emotional moments for comedy. It's all done very well, and there were some surprisingly really heartfelt moments, which I'm glad they didn't gloss over, because it really does give this movie an extra layer over more superficial superhero films. It reminded me a lot about the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films. Shazam managed to be campy and funny, while not crossing the line to cheesiness. The tone is just really well balanced, and it manages to juggle the funny and emotional scenes very well. The characters go through realistic arcs. They have arguments, they fail, and they have their problems, but they all come together in the end in just a really nice and satisfying way. It's just nice to see a superhero movie with so much heart like the first Superman film.Now I don't think this movie is amazing by any means. Like I mentioned earlier the villain just isn't good. Not only that, but with so many superhero movies, this movie is bound to come across some tropes. This does feel a lot like the traditional superhero origin movie, and also some characters do go through arcs we've might've seen before, but I think it's done well enough and in a more inventive way that manages to keep it fresh for the most part. I do believe that they could've maybe tried to avoid some tropes, but it's not like they ruin the movie, it just could've been a little better.I really have to give props to the director David F. Sandberg (and the writers, Henry Gayden, and Darren Lemke) for bringing us so much heart in this movie, and balancing the tone so well. I can't forget to mention some really nice surprises, especially the third act, which was one of the best parts unlike most superhero films. One top of that there were some great Easter eggs, and comic book stuff I wasn't expecting them to do, it just really surprised me and made me glad they aren't shying away from the material, even if it may be a little goofy.If I really had any other specific complaints I would have to mention, one of them would be how they're still using bullies in this era. I feel like bullies like that are uncommon nowadays. In addition to that they might've exaggerated some of the characters a little too much. I mean one of the kids can hack? And Billy is straight up breaking the law near the beginning. They might've gone too far there. Also I feel like most scenes focused on the Sivana storyline just weren't that good. There was this one really great scene with him though, which had horror elements to it, which I really liked. I wish the Sins weren't basically faceless monsters though. I feel like they could've delved deeper into the villain, and the sins. That area of the film is just really lacking. My final problem would be that there this one scene that didn't really make sense near the beginning. It really isn't a problem, but it just bugged me.In Conclusion, Shazam is just a really fun time. It manages to balance comedy with emotional moments really well. The characters are all just so much fun to watch. All the cast has great chemistry and they give really great performances. There are some nice surprises. However the villain was a disappointment, and I feel like it could've tried to avoid some common tropes. Overall though it was really a really good time, it could've been better, but I can't wait to see more of these characters.7.3/10",Shazam!
272,gcsman,"Wildly inconsistent tone across the various plot elements, but yes, it's a lot of fun.",7,6 April 2019,"I saw Shazam! (= ""The Superhero Formerly Known as Captain Marvel"") last night on opening weekend -- theater pretty full, with lots of kids in attendance with their parents. And I think by and large they got what they came for, namely a fun ride with lots of thrills and tongue-in-cheek comedy. The best Worlds-of-DC movie is still Wonder Woman hands-down, but Shazam! is a good addition. I actually liked that the characters and story are put squarely in the DC universe, post-Justice League, and that other main characters like Superman and Batman are mentioned frequently as background elements even if they don't appear. (A contrast with last year's Aquaman, which is certainly in the same world but never made the slightest mention any of his JL pals). And before I forget to mention it, the end-credit illustrations are GREAT -- the kinds of wish-fulfillment fantasy cartoons that Billy Batson and Freddy Freeman would draw for themselves. They're a delight.So is Zach Levi, in the title role. As Shazam, a cheerfully superpowered and good-hearted lug with the mind and outlook of a 15-year-old boy, he gets to act more like a kid than his alter ego Billy can. Levi sells it in a winning performance. If there's a superhero, there must be a villain, and Mark Strong fills the role as Dr. Sivana, who's a superpowered avatar of the Seven Deadly Sins (! pretty weird, and also a pretty big departure from the comics), much older and more experienced than our hero, and also one-dimensionally evil. We get to see his backstory too, but it's rather simplistic. Young Asher Angel, as Billy, has a somewhat tougher role to play: an orphan who lost his mother at a very early age, and has been forlornly searching for her ever since, but also growing the thick skin of a street kid. His life takes a major upturn when he's taken in to a group home by the Vasquez couple (nice roles by Marta Milans and Cooper Andrews) and their five other foster children, notably Freddy (done convincingly by even younger Jack Dylan Grazer) who's a superhero-lore nerd. The trailers for Shazam didn't hint at the big collective role that the foster kids turn out to have, and it was a nice surprise to see that develop.There are times, though, where the movie doesn't seem to be able to decide just what it wants to be. There's loads of superhero fun that is deliberately simple and direct, refreshingly different from any of Superman, Batman, WW, or the others, but the former ""grimdark"" DC tonal world keeps intruding. The opening sequence with the boy Sivana and his father is one example that we're faced with right off the bat. The resolution of Billy with his mother is something that might have been hard to see coming and that a child viewer might find rather deeply disturbing. And for small children, I would guess that the monsters personifying the Deadly Sins might also be rather frightening; they're like something out of the bottom-feeding Suicide Squad (2016). The overall feel is a big inconsistency of tone. I also agree with some reviewers that the whole thing is a bit too long, mainly because there are a few too many back-and-forth encounters between Shazam and Sivana (btw, say those rapidly and repeatedly and try to avoid getting tongue-tied) that are all inconclusive till the end. Nevertheless, on the whole it works. Congrats to director David Sandberg and the good cast for pulling it off.The windup to the final action sequences also holds a big, fun surprise that I'm not going to give away, as well as a great little cameo. Shazam isn't one of the better known comics characters, but he and his supporting cast of characters actually do have a pretty extensive history in the comics, and let's just say that if I'd done my homework digging through that history I'd have seen the result coming. That even includes the post-credits teaser, which follows the usual rule that good villains never quite go away.",Shazam!
273,PotassiumMan,Superhero movie with heart and soul,8,9 April 2019,"Zachary Levi stars as a superhero incarnation in this above average superhero blockbuster about a teenage foster child in Philadelphia who discovers his calling as a bona fide superhero. Asher Angel is solid as the teenage superhero-to-be, but he is considerably upstaged by a Jack Dylan Grazer who gives a likeable performance as his aspiring sidekick. Mark Strong is menacing as the human vessel for the seven deadly sins.Rousing and funny, this film is great entertainment although I do wonder how much a medium for children it truly is. It has many tense scenes of mayhem and the portrayal of the seven deadly sins might scare some children. The aspect of foster care is sympathetically portrayed here and adds to the film's genuineness.The film does take a while to take shape, in keeping with the mindset of a teenage boy just beginning to discover his true potential, but its payoff is tremendous. It goes from decent to superior as it becomes a classic battle of good and evil. This is a welcome addition to the superhero genre. Gladly recommended.",Shazam!
274,MovieBuff11732,DCEU could pass Marvel in the future with films like this!,9,1 April 2019,"Shazam is about a young boy named Billy Batson who is searching for his mom while bending the law. He is later picked up by a married couple who wants to have more foster kids so they pick up Billy. He also gets in a subway and finds a weird wizard and gains his powers. Billy finds a villain named Dr. Sylvia and many things happen.Shazam is probably my favorite DCEU film yet. This is probably one of my favorite DC films ever too! There were many great things in this film. First, I like how the DC are bringing in some more light hearted characters. They brought in Aquaman and now Shazam. I really hope they don't change other characters personalities. Marvel did that is Thor in Thor Ragnorok. I also thought the acting was great. Asher Angel as Billy and Zachary Levi as Shazam both did great jobs. Mark Strong I thought did a great job but his role just wasn't that good. All the other actors did great jobs too. I also didn't like how the 7 deadly sins looked and acted. I read the Shazam New 52 comic and they looked and acted way different from how they did in this film.Overall, Shazam was a great film and I would defiantly recommend watching it.",Shazam!

276,bastille-852-731547,"Sadly, Another Disappointment From DC",4,6 April 2019,"""Wonder Woman"" is the only DC Comics film I view positively since Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. I was hoping for that to change with ""Shazam!,"" which looked like a light-hearted but self-aware and highly entertaining romp that offered enough freshness to make itself distinct from darker superhero films. The trailers made the film look funny while also seeming to almost parody the superhero genre, almost like a kid-friendly version of ""Deadpool."" However, the film unfortunately didn't really do anything for me. I was expecting a fun time at the movies, but what I got was (despite some fun moments) a tonal misfire that can't figure out what it really wants to do over the course of its narrative.The film follows a bullied foster kid in Philadelphia, who ends up in the lair of a wizard one day while on the subway. When he says the magic word, ""Shazam,"" he turns into an adult superhero, and must stop a power-hungry villain (Mark Strong) and his minions, who are basically evil gargoyle-like creatures modeled after the Seven Deadly Sins. The biggest problem with ""Shazam!"" is its tone, as the film bounces between breezy and light comedy and darker moments in an erratic and knee-jerk way. The film's funny scenes are light--in some moments, they can almost be too light to the point that they degrade the dramatic stakes--whereas its darker moments are (surprisingly) rather intense at times. These two tones don't really mesh well given the juxtaposition of scenes in each type of tone, which creates for an uneven viewing experience. There is also no reason why this movie needed to be 2 hours and 12 minutes, given the relatively minimal plot. DC movies have always (generally) been lengthy, but the substantial plot imperative to the film's narrative is incredibly skimpy given the runtime. In fact, one probably could have edited this movie down to 90 minutes and not really missed anything. The film's humor is surprisingly not very funny, and just feels too juvenile and kid-focused. While this movie was always supposed to be more family-targeted than most comic book movies, this type of stuff pales to the humor in the lighter MCU movies because that humor makes audiences across many age groups laugh, whereas the jokes here are laser-focused on targeting the middle-school crowd while leaving anyone older than that in the dust.I wanted to like this movie since it looked like an entertaining time at the movies, but unfortunately this was a disappointment. I will say, however, that many in the packed audience this afternoon did seem to eat it up. 4/10Note: I saw this film in RealD 3D, which added absolutely nothing to the viewing experience.",Shazam!

The characters are likeable, flawed, actually diverse (eg. an off-beat foster home), and the movie knows how to laugh at itself. There are moments of cheese (eg. jokes about holding a wizard's ""staff""), but they're few and far between.If you miss old fashioned movies like the Goonies and are tired of arrogant Avengers' movies with flawless super-heroes who might occasionally break a fingernail, you are likely to enjoy this.I would much rather my children watch this than anything by Rich Moore (Wreck It Ralph 2) or Patti Jenkin (Wonderwoman) release - there's no message of malice in this movie.

Now about this introductory movie which roughly shows the Shazam in the making. The direction is fair as I think story lacks the depth with its 2hour 11mins of runtime as it all could've been easily summed up in 1hour 30 to 45mins. The thing I like most about the movie is that it started with the villain's story and how an innocent child who had the chance of becoming a super hero digs himself into becoming a super villain with his sheer desperation .
All in all movie is fun to watch but I still think DCEU requires more famous and known actors for their characters including the supporting ones which might attract the masses more.",Shazam!

288,Fudge-3,Played for Laughs,7,28 March 2019,"Young teenager and orphan; Billy Batson is drawn into a magical cave where he is granted super powers by a wizard.A comedy based around a super hero discovering his powers. While he inhabits an adult body Billy/Shazam acts like a fourteen year old boy. There is a lot of goofing around and showing off. The jokes do work though sometimes I cringed but I did enjoy it. The arch enemy is played (mostly) straight by Mark Strong and this does help to ground the movie.The CGI is mostly well done but there are a few shots near the end where the live action does not meld well with the graphics.I did wonder if this was originally intended for a Christmas release because it is set around that holiday season.Comic fans may not like Shazam. I'm not a graphic novel reader but I'm reliably informed that this film is based on a character that originates from a 1940s DC comic. In that story Billy turned into a super hero called Captain Marvel (a name subsequently acquired by Marvel). Here SHAZAM stands for Captain Marvel's attributes derived from the gods; Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury. So for example, while transformed Captain Marvel is supposed to have the, 'wisdom of Solomon.' While this is referenced in this movie we don't get that, Shazam is goofy not wise.I liked Father Christmas.",Shazam!
289,theredsky,Shazam Review,7,21 April 2019,"This was actually a pretty good film. I liked almost every aspect of this film. As always, let's get the negatives out of the way. The visual effects were mediocre in the beginning and progressively got worse until the end. Only 1 of the child actors didn't do a good job. 50% of the jokes either had no impact or were not funny to me. The first half of the film's tone was really inconsistent. Other than that, this movie is amazing. Zachary Levi did an amazing job as Shazam and was the best part of the film. All the other actors did a great job and the villain was interesting and unique. We do get to see the villain's backstory as the first part of the film which is unique for a Superhero film. The cinematography was good and the 2nd half of the film's tone was very consistent. The plot was really solid and the other 50% of the jokes got a smile or a laugh out of me. This film does use some pop culture songs effectively, unlike Suicide Squad and they fit well into the narrative. I highly recommend seeing this film. Overall, Shazam! provides an easy going, funny superhero experience with a great cast, a great villain, and a great story.",Shazam!
290,pritol,"A Fresh, Fun and entertaining Film!",8,6 January 2020,"The story of Billy Batson, a boy who when he says the word SHAZAM, inherits the powers of an ancient wizard, and in turn has to defeat the seven deadly sins!DC comics have always been darker, and grittier than Marvel. This film maintains some of those dark elements, but is much more light hearted and humorous than the earlier Scott Synder directed DCEU films.There is much more focus on character story arcs, as supposed to big visual set pieces, which is a welcome change. There are also contemporary themes such as; the meaning of family, and why it's ok to be different, which it addresses without being overly sentimental or taking itself too seriously.All in all, this is just a really well made and enjoyable fun film!

292,joshbarton15,DC having a helluva ball!!,7,30 March 2019,"Having disbanded their cinematic universe, instead deciding to focus more on the standalone films for their array of superheroes, allowing them space to breathe and not be under pressure to have everything build to something major, the DCEU picked themselves up off the floor with Aquaman. After the disaster that was Justice League, it was clear they needed to rethink their strategy and with that comes the arrival of Shazam!When teenager Billy Batson (Asher Angel) has a mysterious power bestowed upon him by an ancient wizard (Djimon Hounsou), with just one word he is able to transform into the superhero Shazam (Zachary Levi).When they kickstarted the DCEU back in 2013 with Man of Steel, I would never have guessed that someday they would be releasing a film like Shazam!, an entry into the superhero genre that reminds you how great it can be to just let your inner-child loose. This is undeniably one of the most fun-fuelled superhero films ever made, utterly infectious with the audience so I'd recommend watching it with as big a crowd as possible.The screenplay is pretty damn sharp, causing a few laugh-out-loud moments for myself throughout, but the narrative also manages to dip into the darker side of things as it tells a story about loneliness and the importance of family, throwing in the wonder of magical powers for good measure to ensure this becomes a major hit with all the family.Zachary Levi revels in the role of Shazam, capturing the combined cockiness and innocence of a teenager who's just discovered they have superhero abilities so brilliantly. It's a joyous performance that effectively contradicts with the performance of Asher Angel as Billy Batson, the teenage form taken when he doesn't want to use his powers. Batson is a damaged child, having been abandoned at a young age, and Angel delivers an emotive performance that gives the film the grounded angle that will make it an accessible film for many.Jack Dylan Grazer steals the show though as Freddy Freeman, Billy's foster brother, his comedic timing working so well alongside Levi's goofiness as Shazam. Mark Strong makes for a serviceable villain, hamming it up to the max at times, making him to go-to-guy, alongside Ben Mendelsohn, for the villainous roles.Shazam! runs the risk of overstaying its welcome however, thanks to an abundance of fun had in front of and behind the camera filtering through to the audience, and a number of surprises along the way, it's impossible not to just sit back and enjoy it. Amongst some of the more serious superhero films to be released in recent years, this could be exactly what the doctor ordered.",Shazam!

There are funny moments (more so in the first half) and some nice lovable characters. But the second half is boring (especially the super hero part). The chemistry between the kids is good. All the characters are uniquely funny.I know it is a superhero film, but I wish they had spent more time with the kids rather diving into villain's backstory.And yes Billy and Shazam (Zachary Levi) are nothing alike.

(I can't elaborate without providing spoilers.)2) The adult authority figures against whom Billy rebels are too incompetent by half.

299,domtaylor,David F. Sandberg saves the DCEU with one word.,8,22 April 2019,"Well, they finally did it. It may have taken six years, but the DCEU have finally produced a good movie. It's not just 'good' in comparison to the rest of its roster, either; it's genuinely great and easily the best (non 'LEGO', at least) DC film since 'The Dark Knight (2008)'. The biggest positive here is that it's extremely fun throughout thanks to a sharp script, great performances and an engaging narrative that feels really fresh. It's constantly entertaining, too, with no dull moments, and this is extremely high praise for a DCEU picture. The humor also actually works, matching the tone perfectly, and doesn't feel forced at all, something rather rare in superhero flicks nowadays. It's not like the lightheartedness detracts from your engagement either, as it has its fair share of dark scenes to retain the stakes (Sandberg's previous work in horror is really evident here), well-developed characters that you actually care about, and an interesting and heartfelt look at family. While the second act is definitely the best (seeing Batson discover his powers and use them like any fourteen-year-old would is a pure delight), the final act is great, too, avoiding the typical issues that superhero flicks often suffer here. While - like always - the stakes ramp up (although, as they are so low throughout, this step-up isn't as drastic as you would expect), Sandberg manages to keep things focussed on character and theme, rather than CG spectacle. That's not to say that there's no action however, as it is there and actually done really well, but by staying focused on the aforementioned aspects, Sandberg ensures that the audience remains highly engaged and still cares about everything that's happening. The payoff is extremely satisfying as well, thematically wrapping everything up really well. The biggest problem with the film is its villain. While Strong is good, the character motivations are rather weak and everything about him is fairly bland and generic. The design of his goons is quite cartoonish, too, reminding me of the creatures from 'Scooby-Doo (2002)'. Saying that, the villain does his job in relation to the hero from a narrative perspective, and it doesn't really retract from the film's entertainment value at all. Overall, despite a couple of flaws, 'Shazam!' is a thoroughly enjoyable film with a good sense of humour, and great characters and performances. Sandberg has truly redeemed the DCEU. Well, for now at least. 8/10",Shazam!

301,rcolgan,The Most Wholesome Film in the DCEU,8,6 April 2019,"It's quite odd that with the hundreds of heroes DC and Marvel could be making films on, both companies ended up coincidentally releasing a film based on two completely unrelated characters who are both named Captain Marvel within a month of each other. To avoid confusion (and a lot of potential legal issues) this version of Captain Marvel instead goes by the heroes other name 'Shazam!' in the funniest and most wholesome film DC has released to date.It stars Asher Angel as Billy Batson, a young boy who was orphaned at a young age after losing his mother at a carnival. Shortly after arriving at a new foster home, he is summoned by an ancient wizard in to another dimension. This wizard tells Billy that he is pure of heart and passes all his power in to him so that every time he says Shazam he turns into a super-powered version of Zachary Levi. It's basically the super-powered version of Big.Just like some earlier kids adventure films like Stand By Me and Monster Squad, the writers of Shazam understand how to write children and after gaining these powers he reacts in any way you'd expect a 14 year old boy to react. He's less interested in being a superhero and more interested in having fun, showing off to crowds and becoming a YouTube celebrity. These reactions are perfected by Levi, who is the ideal man-child for the role. All his reactions seem so genuine and his joy from discovering all his new powers is very contagious.Another great stand out is Jack Grazzer as Billy's friend from his new foster home, a superhero geek who ends up more or less using Shazam as his own personal plaything. Billy's entire foster family is also extremely entertaining, ranging from his hilarious foster sister to his surprisingly sweet foster parents. Not all the family members get a lot of screen time, but they all leave a memorable impression and a strong desire to see more from them in any future sequels.Even Mark Strong as the films ridiculously over the top villain was great and at times even a little intimidating. His character has been obsessed with obtaining the power of Shazam ever since the wizard denied him the powers when he was a child, so he releases the seven deadly sins to take these powers by force. These sins are represented as horrifying monsters that often act less like super-villains and more like they were ripped from a horror movie.With a lower budget compared to most tentpole superhero movies, the fight scenes don't have the same scale that something like Aquaman has. But this is largely to the films advantage, with the fight scenes they do have being a lot more focused and avoid the CGI mess that comes from something like Transformers.But just like Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse before it, Shazam! always keeps its characters at its core with a lot of sincerity and even a lot of surprisingly emotional moments. The whole film is certainly a nice change of pace for DC, who have become increasingly diverse in their recent film set and sets the ideal whimsical tone for one of their goofiest superhero origins.",Shazam!

This film just blows me away with the incredible writing of balance with the dark and light concept allowing all the character to develop on their own which created a brilliantly made film.It perfect set up the villian played brilliantly by Mark strong, which ive always said should have been Lex Luthor and this role as a villian proves it, this is what brought the dark concept of the film allowing him to be seriously ruthless and dark which is what makes a villain shine more in a film, which sadly the justice league failed on.Djimon Hounsou more of a cameo but still a major role in this film played a brilliant wizard who gave a back of another well know DC character, Zachary Levi nailed this role as Shazam given the character an emotional development from start like any child would be like using the powers like an idiot and messing around to become a more mature adult when he realize what more important, Sorry ive got to say this, it does something captain marvel failed to do, a hero journey this the way shazam character is written is how you write a hero journey, its not about having powers it about how you use that and how you grow as a hero that matters because if you can't protect your family what type of herp are you.This is the way this film is portrayed it's brilliantly done in a way they not forced or pushed in your face it a natural progression from child to an adult taking responsibility to not only protect the one you care about but to use the powers wisely. This is how this film come across and you couldn't have made this any better without it being over the top.Asher Angel as Billy Batson top-notch acting giving a very emotional and powerful emotional journey of a kid that being bounce for place to place while trying to look for his real mother, which give him clarity in the film with his character. Same with the Rest of the cast including the childern played by Jack Dylan Grazer Faithe Herman, Ian Chen, Grace Fulton and Jovan Armand who have must bigger roles in the film that are comic book accurateThe comedy side of the film is great it not forced, though there were a few moments that the comedy didn't quite hit, but most of the comedy was absolute Hillarious, this like I said it balanced out with the Dark tone of the film as well with the 7 deadly sin and Mark Strong character, got say for a 12A they really push that dark side of the film. This is why this film work because of that balance which ive been saying for months and why the justice league failed, To create a balanced film is how can create a character to go through a dark journey into the light and become a hero, So good job with the writing here.Just a warning though the 7 deadly sins look very dark I do mean dark which could disturb anyone under the age of 1.Dislikes: there were few comedy moments that didn't hit and a tiny small amount of pacing which didn't really affect the film but was noticeable, but apart from that this film was good.",Shazam!

308,IAmTheShyGuy,An electrifying movie coupled with humour & some heart warming emotions!,8,6 April 2019,"Shazam, an old Wizard in his search for a new champion who is ""pure of heart"", magically abducts random people by teleporting them to his temple. Once failed, they are banished from the temple, back to Earth. The film shows how a teenage foster boy becomes the champion a.k.a. our superhero Shazam and how he eventually fights against the evil man who has stolen the Eye Of Sin from the Wizard. The movie is very engaging and has all the right elements to make it a great watch! There are several humourous scenes paired with some electrifying action! Also the family bond between the foster parents and their foster children is heart warming! The first half is fun-filled and shows how Shazam discovers his superpowers and flaunts it. The second half shows the battle between Shazam and the evil guy. The action sequences look somewhat silly sometimes but the final showdown won't disappoint you. All in all this movie is a great electrifying watch!",Shazam!

318,anupapu8,"Again , DCEU proseeding in a right direction",8,8 April 2019,"SHAZAM - Wow they were able to hide so much in the trailers which the actual movie had. But we are not gonna talk about the spoilers.I am gonna say this right away. the biggest problem (and pretty much the only one) with this movie was its low budget. Which makes this movie visually less arresting and the third act little sloppy and yeah the action scenes were just decent , not great. As a result this is not that kind of movie which is compulsory to watch on a big screen. Its a really good movie though , its just that there will not be any difference in your experience if you watch it at home in a small screen.Now as i said , its a really good film. Not as good as AQUAMAN and WONDER WOMAN (again lack of good action sequence is the reason), But i will certainly say that the writing in this film is pretty much better then AQUAMAN. This one also had more heart to the storyline. And better lead actor to hold the movie.There were a lot of things happening in the movie. Forster life , searching the birth mother, tackling bullying in school and then the whole superhero sh*t. But everything is so much well organized that the movie never felt too congested. Some story-lines got more screen-time and some got less, but you never feel anything being left-out or over-stretched.Anyone who thinks this one is the counterpart of ANT-MAN from DCEU is wrong. This movie has its own DNA. Very unique in its tone, very childishly (yet mature) in portraying comedy. And injects some really good serious themes withing the story-line. Add to that some minor horror sequences which can scare the hell out of a kid below 7. What i mean to say again and again that its a very uniquely made movie. And a choice of HORROR director to direct this movie was a great choice. He saved the movie from being total childish & help it to push the boundaries of PG-13 rating.Couldn't enough praise the actors. they were just game on having the time of their life.The villain got a little back-story , which was a good touch too.Like i said the first 2 third of the movie were just flawless. I don't have any major complaints apart from may be 5 more mins spent showing the life of the villain. The only problem remains that WB didn't spent 15-20m$ more to made this movie a little more refined and a bigger third act.Couldn't wait to see the star-cast again, with the same director and a bigger budget.7.8/10by ANuP APu KuMaR",Shazam!
319,BlueSkies765,Great superhero movie,7,15 May 2019,"Shazam is a great popcorn movie. It's funny, most of the movie is joking around and it worked so well. There is a dramatic backstory. It was one of the few times in recent memory that I've seen a big budget movie with a backstory that feels genuine and isn't dramatic for the sake of being dramatic. The reason why I felt it worked is that this is mostly a lighthearted movie and it was only right to take it easy on the backstory.Everything in this movie just felt right. From the foster parents and relatives, the villain to the main hero. Every character had its own charm. There were clichés but it worked well because the movie points out the clichés and makes fun of it.Honestly I thought the movie would be mediocre but it really is one of the better superhero movies in recent years.",Shazam!
320,AleksandrBelenko,Something new to DCU,8,11 September 2019,"I watched the movie and have read some reviews. People are confused whether it is for adults or for kids, saying that plot is too childish, yet monsters are scary for kids and locating a strip club in family movie is inapropriate. Really? Rating is 12+ and 12 y.o. kid would not ask why a guy would like to see naked ladies, and would not be scared of the monsters from this movie. And is it ok to watch it for younger children? Yes. If I would watch this movie as a 5 year old boy, I would understand ""adult"" humor and monsters are not that scary. Watch some japanese horors, those are scary. Monsters here are just a fairy tale villains. Also, people, watch some Tex Avery cartoons, he has a lot of works based on erotic humor. I watched it as a kid, I understood it. If your kid is confused, then you haven't explained it before, and now it is time to have that talk.
The movie itself is good. The comedy is smooth, I did not laugh, but smiled a lot. The drama is fine too, but the movie is so dence , that for some viewers character development will not be enough. I enjoyed it. The movie is easy to watch. What else do you need from superhero movie?",Shazam!
321,mitchell5954,It's Okay,5,25 April 2019,"Shazam is the latest DCEU film. It's also the highest rated DCEU movie to date. So, does the film live up to that hype? In my opinion, not really. Not that I think the film is bad. It's adequate. It's your standard superhero origin film we've come to expect in recent times, especially from Marvel. This is basically your typical MCU superhero origin film.The film is okay. The effects and music are standard, but fine. The actors do a fine job. This film does have a lot of heart, which is its biggest strength. You can tell the makers tried to do this material justice. The comedy was actually on point throughout most of it. The comedy is actually the thing this film nails the most. It's a fun movie in that regard. I know I would love this film if I were still a kid. The characters are fine. The side cast was actually not annoying like I thought they'd be for the most part.The lead character, Billy Batson/Shazam goes through your basic character arc of his type of character of learning responsibility and to appreciate the people in your life. This film, rarely enough, conveys that message better than Spiderman Homecoming did. That's a film I liked when I first saw it, but it hasn't aged well for me at all. Perhaps this film will be the same way. Billy is a kid, and acts like a kid. Although, he acts more like kid when he's in his Shazam state than in his child form. I don't know if that's intentional or not, but it's a little glaring.The thing is, I've seen so many superhero origin films now that they all feel the same at this point. This film really does nothing to differentiate itself from the pack. This movie feels identical to many recent MCU origin movies. At least the other DCEU movies, good and bad, have had their own unique feel. Aquaman is the film that's felt the closest to a Marvel film, until now, but that movie felt grand and epic, which this film does not.That's another thing. The action felt very unengaging. The strength of most, aside from Suicide Squad, has been their great fights. Aquaman, Wonder Woman, Man of Steel, and even BVS and Justice League have great and memorable action scenes. Even recent MCU origin movies like Dr. Strange and Ant Man, as standard and formulaic as those movies are, had very unique and innovative fight scenes. This film does not. I even prefer the fights in Captain Marvel to this, and those were unremarkable as well.The villain is completely lame and formulaic. Your standard MCU villain basically. I was somewhat disappointed, because I was kind of looking forward to seeing The Rock as Black Adam being the big villain, but instead we got this clown. They try to make you sympathize with him in the opening act of the movie with seeing his bad family life. But there's just nothing to his character. He's just there to give Shazam someone to fight, and the fights weren't even that good.Overall, Shazam is an average superhero movie. Not bad, not great, just adequate. On the whole it's better than Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad. However, compared to Aquaman, Wonder Woman, and Man of Steel I felt this film wasn't up to par. I even prefer Justice League to this. Yes, I actually like Justice League. That's just my opinion. The film does have heart. Kids will definitely like it. If you're just looking for an entertaining movie, then you'll enjoy it.",Shazam!

330,abalpn-99472,SHAZAM!!! ⚡⚡⚡ This is a good entertaining film for the DC Extended Universe. Almost great but not bad at all. 9/10 👍,9,7 August 2019,"Zachary Levi is cool and hilarious as Shazam. It's great to enjoy the action, entertainment and humor. There was one scene in the film that was dark and satisfying because I like dark moments. When I watched Mark Strong's part in that dark scene, I said, ""Now that's what I'm talking about."" It's still my favorite scene/part of the film to this day so I'm not going to spoil it in detail. I would watch that scene over and over again. The parents would feel that it is not suitable for the little kids. It is PG-13 but it's still watchable for the entire family. I liked the special effects of the Seven Deadly Sins. I noticed that John Glover was in this film as Dr. Sivana's father. He played the voice of the Riddler in Batman: The Animated Series. Dr. Jason Woodrue in Batman & Robin (1997). John also played Lionel Luthor in Smallville. John Glover is typically the DC veteran actor that the fans know. Mark Strong was a good choice to play the villain. He was very chilling.I wish that DC and the Warner Bros studios would have casted Mark as Lex Luthor in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice. Mark would have been scarier than Gene Hackman and Kevin Spacey but Dr. Sivana was the only role for him. So the bottom line is that Mark Strong did have a good role and better performance as Dr. Sivana. I hope to see him in other films as a villain. There was one review saying that the film had no connections to the DCEU but there are references from the other films. It felt like a standalone film but I know that it's still in the same universe. I was watching the film and I thought that it's not bad. Zachary was doing a good job playing his role of being a superhero. I hope that the Shazamily will join an alliance with the Justice League. I would imagine Dr. Sivana and Lex Luthor teaming up. I would watch the film again and again on YouTube. It's still all right for the DCEU and I enjoyed watching it. A thumbs up! 👍 I can't wait for Black Adam and Fury of the Gods.",Shazam!
331,TheGreatMarkukini,An echo from the past,6,20 August 2019,"It has been such a long time since any DC movies fulfilled the expectations of the trailers and all the fuss around them. This time I surprisingly got what I ordered or better say what I was promised.I the dark world of try-hard realism of DC we once again (courtesy of Aquaman) get something more funny and comic. However, unlike the story of a 'Talker with fish' this flick not only softens the colors but also breaks the supposed seriousness of the script. Not gonna lie, it reminded me of those TV-movies for kinds from 90th, but it is not necessarily bad.First thing that pops into my head is the movie ""Big"" with Tom Hanks, however, here the grown-up jumps on the buildings as good as on piano tiles. Sure it cool from kids to see that if you are good then you might become a superhero, but I don't quite see how such dumb hunk of muscles can fit into the already formed universe.Any how, Zachary Levi was a delight portraying a buff and naive wall-breaker. Mark Strong as always shone his beautiful bald head in the rays of villainy; i am still confused how he can look almost the same but perform differently every time.Though all neat tricks (especially awesome is the actual transformation) and sweet visual effects I might say that the movie is a younger brother to all the previous films of the universe. A solid story for children but not quite what older viewers, expecting the real action, would prefer to watch. However, once again hats-off for warning about the rating and style in the trailers.",Shazam!

This Corpollywood product fits the mold of ""not-great with a couple of newish, entertaining scenes that can stick."" Here, they are comedy parts.What went wrong:
Main one first: hero and villain with similar powers. This trope is so common and so dull, I figure all has been written, said and yodeled about it already.The teen is all serious, his adult version childish and goofy, often acting like a drag queen or a dolt or a toon or je-ne-sais-quoi. Not the same guy. Not such a big deal, but grating.Gloom. There is colour, there is daylight, but the makers couldn't resist some Iron Age darkness. Wouldn't have cost much to paint the demons bright and the climax under the Sun, for example.Annoying kid. I won't tell which one, but you might feel like shoving his crutch somewhere. Fine, for a film with so many juves, they didn't do bad here.What went well:
The powers testing scenes are the shining ones. Kid-superheroes being kids first.Simplicity. The story is straightforward, the motivations simple, the villain focused (though he would be dull if Mark Strong wasn't such a dependable young man.) In this genre, simplicity is a quality.Adorable kid.

339,ajzeg,This movie was wonderful!,9,15 September 2019,"If this is the direction that the DCEU is going in, I might just have to consider myself a fan! This movie had a great story, great characters, solid jokes, a good script, and a lot of heart! It reminded me a lot of Spider-Man Homecoming. It's a much smaller-scale superhero story, focussing on a small cast of characters and not existing solely to set up sequels. *cough*Batman v Superman*cough* I really like how authentic this movie felt. It takes place in a universe where superheroes exist, but they aren't going around flying everywhere. The connections to the other movies are loose. That's probably what a universe full of superheroes would really be like. They would be rare. You wouldn't see them every day. The Marvel Cinematic Universe doesn't really feel that way to me. It's missing that human element of what it's like to live in a universe full of heroes and gods just as a regular average citizen. Maybe that's why I don't really like the MCU that much. Maybe that's why Ioved Spider-Man Homecoming so much. I like stories about regular people living in larger-than-life universes. Anyway, back to Shazam, this is a must-see for any fan of superheroes and family comedies! Maybe don't take the little ones though. I was kinda surprised, this movie looks really kid-friendly, it has a main cast of mostly child actors who do a really good job, but it actually has some really scary parts! There were kids crying in my theatre. Just a heads-up. All that aside, I loved this movie, it's a ton of fun. Highly recommended! Now the only movie from the DCEU I haven't seen is Man of Steel.

It isn't without its problems but the good far outweigh the bad.Zachary Levi is perfectly cast in the role. I'm happy he got his first big lead and he's very good at emulating the child-like behavior Shazam is known for. The script and his acting chops capture the spirit of the original comics. A combination of syrupy heroism and nutty plotting. It maintains some of that old-fashioned feel, but with modern context. It works very well. Asher Angel's performance as Billy Batson the boy who inherits the powers of Shazam through the desperation of the wizard himself (Djimon Hounsou) go hand in hand with Levi's. You won't for a minute think they're not the same person.The supporting cast surround him is solid. Jack Dylan Grazer is never not quipping. Maybe perhaps quipping a bit much for my taste. He and Asher Angel have a nice dichotomy and play off one another quite well. The rest of the foster kids aren't too bad either. Maybe one or two moments where I did cringe a little with their acting, but it's nothing unbearable.Mark Strong is great. It's pretty straight forward. They didn't particularly do anything too spectacular with Dr. Sivana, but I appreciated the New 52 approach and the fact that we got to feel a bit sorry for him in the film. Obviously, Shazam's most popular and greatest foe would be Black Adam, but I can see why WB/DC would want to build up to that character as opposed to using him right away. Fingers crossed that will happen someday, but the the time being, Strong is good and it looks like he's in it for the long run. It would be a good idea to stay after the credits. Regardless, Strong always brings his A-game to any film, but I will never unsee him as Sinestro in the mediocre GREEN LANTERN film. Of all the things that were not good in GREEN LANTERN, Mark Strong was not one of them.The CGI is okay. There are a couple of moments where it looks distractingly fake. It's no secret at this point that the Seven Deadly Sins of mankind show up in the film and, to be honest I've seen better VFX. I'm not very picky on this department, but I think a little more time would have helped the artists really polish them.Director David F. Sandberg does a solid job. He also adds a touch of scary elements which I appreciated. A couple jokes did not land for me and I'm pretty sure this is just because of what my preferences are, but there were times where I did roll my eyes at some of the humor. It's very MCU like and it did get on my nerves here and there, but Sandberg kept the tone well balanced for the most part.Despite that I truly dug the film. There is nice little surprise for the audience, but being that I read the comics, I saw it coming from a mile away. Most of you will know what I'm referring to, but it will only make you anticipate the sequel more. I walked away satisfied, but begging for a sequel now. SHAZAM is a winner for DC, right now it's going back and forth between second and third place behind MAN OF STEEL. Maybe this will convince all parties of WB/DC, Henry Cavill, and Ben Affleck to return to this franchise? One can only dream.8.5/10",Shazam!
345,AliensReservoir,I had no idea what it would be and what a good surprise,10,11 May 2019,"Before this movie I had never heard of ""Shazam"".
I saw some trailers, which made me watch this movie as I was thinking it would be funny, and indeed it was very funny, with some good tears.Kids super heroes might let you think something like ""over acting"" and ""stupid joke"", like most of the time, but it was not the case for THIS movie, it was well done all the way.A very good moment for all the family.",Shazam!
346,Benslie,DC is finally learning how to make good movies!,10,7 April 2019,"First of all, I just want to mention how yes this is a superhero movie but that is just what's on the surface while underneath it's a movie about family and I love that. This movie shows that superhero movies can tell more than just being a funny superhero movie but also a serious film as well, as long as they do it right. This leads into the character development that happens in this film, mainly with Billy. From the beginning to the end Billy doesn't stay the same but he changes. Now, I have to talk about the acting of course and what else can I say other than its spectacular. Everybody in this film does their job at a hundred and ten percent. I want to mainly talk about Zachary Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer because they were the main ones you follow. First Zachary Levi was a perfect choice to play Shazam because he had fun with this role. He played it as if it was a real-life teenager who just got superpowers and doesn't know what to do with them. He had great chemistry with Jack Dylan Grazer and they could easily bounce stuff off of each other easily. They both were hilarious too. Jack Dylan Grazer is going to have a promising career when he gets older. Talking about being funny, the movie all around is a hilarious ride. Whether it is poking fun at a superhero cliché or just a funny line the movie knew when to be funny and when to tone it down and be serious again. My only real problem with the film is the Villain Thaddeus Sivana, played by Mark Strong. Now, don't get me wrong they do give him a decent reason for doing what he's doing and he's played well by Mark Strong it's just he seems weak compared to everybody else in this film. In the end, this film is great other than the villain and is worth checking out. I give Shazam a 9.5/10.",Shazam!
347,richarddillomes,"Say my name, say my name",6,29 July 2019,"Shazam! (which accounts for the initials of the following characters with their corresponding powers: Solomon (Wisdom), Hercules (Strength), Atlas (Stamina), Zeus (Power), Achilles (Courage), and Mercury (Speed), follows the story of Billy Batson, a foster kid elected by the wizard Shazam to carry on the mantle of Captain Marvel (yes same name, long story.) With the help of his foster brother who's very much into the superhero business, they try to figure out what powers he possess the same way a kid would if he got a new toy. The movie was inspired by Tom Hanks' movie Big (a must-see) and apparently by the tv show Stranger Things (which I did not notice but it would've been really cool if they were able to pull it off), but in my opinion focused a little too much on being a kid's movie as opposed to balancing it with a mature audience. Nonetheless I agree it's a vast improvement from the dark and serious tone set by the earlier movies in the DCEU franchise and hopefully we see continuous upgrades in the sequel like more screen time for the rest of the Marvel family. If I can't get Armie Hammer anymore for the title role, I'd happily settle for expanded storylines for Adam Brody (who at one time was in the running for The Flash, pun intended), Dj Catrano and Ross Butler.Shazam! is the DCEU's 7th movie in the franchise and as I was trying to recall the last six, I could only get five (I forgot Suicide Squad, or maybe I was trying to forget about it on purpose.) Conversely, I can name all the 22 movies in the MCU including plot points (I can barely recall what happened in the Man Of Steel) and I think this is a testament as to why DCEU is stil struggling to make any significant headway into the superhero franchise box office. They work on titles separately, instead of as a whole that's why we're unable to connect each movie on a single thread. For example, they are replacing Ben Affleck with Robert Pattinson. It may be confusing to see Robert and Gal Gadot (I don't even know what's going on with Henry Cavill at this point) in a future installment of Justice League. Same goes for Zachary Levi. Shazam's slapstick tone is sort of the same as Ezra Miller's the Flash. Even then, there were a lot of missed opportunities in terms of humor. I mean how can you not use Destiny's Child's 'Say My Name' anywhere in the movie at all?Overall, Shazam! is a decent output and hopefully it's promising potential realized in future installments. What they need now is a Kevin Feige to connect all of these movies together while we're only a few movies in and then they can start giving MCU a run for their money.",Shazam!

350,shimenpf,Good!!,7,9 April 2019,"In a time where we get at least 4 superhero movies per year, it's hard not to fall in clichés or being repetitive, but Shazam managed to do it. The start is low, too many flashbacks in a very short span can be very tedious, but they get paid off well. The characters' reactions are kind of forced and unnatural, but passed that, the film improves drastically. The hero's concept is very interesting and refreshing. His behaviors are very fun to watch and show the other side most superhero movies never explore. It subverts and avoids many clichés, like the evil villain's speech. The theme of family is shown nicely, mostly in Billy's arc. The climax is satisfying and emphasizes the theme of the story. Shazam! is an above the average superhero movie.",Shazam!
351,TheMysteriousReviewer,Shazam! A Great Movie,9,26 June 2021,"Shazam is a really fun superhero movie that shows Warner Bros can make some enjoyable superhero movies in recent years. And this shows all the potential that has been very well executed. The story is enjoyable. The heart does come to the right place when Billy was adopted. The action is exciting. The characters have a lot of likabilities, even the villain. And the visuals are well crafted from the effects to the power we would see. I'll admit, it can have this one cliche school element. But it cannot stop how surprisingly great it came out. Has there been some superhero movies from DC that disappointed you? Well I can guarantee you this will be the exact opposite. I recommend giving this a watch. I thought this would be a your typical superhero comedy. But this is more than just that and came out quite an exciting film.",Shazam!
352,thisseatofmars,Dissapointing. Go see Hellboy instead; at least that has some character.,5,17 April 2019,"The opening of Shazam! is excellent. The moody snowfall, the transportation of the young Sivana to the magic cave, and the demons communicating to him via the Magic 8-Ball was all excellent. However, the rest of Shazam! gets worse as it goes on. This is due in part mostly by Zachary Levi's hammy performance, lame jokes, and the film not doing as much as it could with the concept.The costume for Shazam! is excellent. The saturated red and frilly white cape, plus greased-back Elvis-style pompadour really compliments the 1930's origins of the character. You'd think with this kind of tribute to the source material, Shazam! would go some way in revitalizing or at least reinterpreting the superhero genre, like how Aquaman and Venom did: Aquaman was a grand fantasy epic and Venom was a buddy-cop and monster movie. Shazam! meanwhile is a potato that's been boiled for too long. Apart from the moody opening, the overall tone feels displaced. How is it that this film has so little charisma? How is it that adult Billy Batson acts less maturely than young Billy Batson? Zachary Levi's, or perhaps, rather, Hollywood's interpretation of how kids act is extremely over-excited and enthusiastic about everything, and watching Levi bumble around making lame jokes is hard to watch.Ah, yes: the ""jokes."" They act as your typical Hollywood formula for humour: say the most obvious observation as loudly as possible, minimizing wit whenever you can. A lot of the ""humour"" is meant to stem from Batson's excitement over getting his superheroes, but after a while (and this drags out) the charm of the excitement wears off. There's only so many times you can hear variations of, ""Dude, I can fly!"" or ""Dude, I can run fast!"" (""Yeahdudeyoucantotallyrunfast"") before you start massaging your temples. Adult Batson sees an attractive women leaving a convenience store and makes an obvious pass, ""Hey, I'm, like, an adult"" (or something). Yes, Batson, you sure are: an adult that acts more immature than the child actor playing the child version of your character. Your fish-eyes and moley neck aren't creepy at all.Mark Strong is a good actor but the part of Sivana is as dry and straight as can be. He's the villain, deriving his powers from seven demons that all look alike, have simple designs (green bumpy skin and frowny faces) and stand around doing/saying nothing for 99% of the movie. If they're based on the Seven Deadly Sins, why not jazz up their appearances? Give them unique personalities and voices to match? (Wouldn't it be cool to cast someone like, I don't know, John Cleese, as Avarice? And for kicks, Jordan Peele as Wrath? It'd fit him, as his films, like Get Out, are so gross and hate-filled.)With the excellent red costume, you'd think the film would go some way in establishing its own character or tone, but they really don't push the concept. Really, if it was me, I would've explored the theme of magic in the movie. Superman gets his powers from science (pseudo-science, of course; Earth's red sun), Batman from tech and willpower; Shazam's power comes from magic. There's a scene late in the movie where the players come to an enchanted cave where a series of doors lead to a number of different worlds, one containing alligator men wearing tuxes. Why couldn't have more of the movie had moments like these? Guardians of the Galaxy is fun for the variety of alien life and locations: think what fun you could have with magic. Instead, Shazam!'s locations are malls, convenience stores, a fair, streets, and a school, where they take the opportunity to humiliate a security guard. This humiliation was inappropriate and insensitive, given the gun violence in America (and in schools, unfortunately). Also, I really, really didn't like the scene where a national monument of Philadelphia was destroyed; the statue getting decapitated. Honour your country, Hollywood. Honour your history.",Shazam!

For the entire 2 hours and 12 minutes I was back and forth between laughing, crying and edge of my seat thrilled! In a day and age where its getting harder and harder to tell the same cliche super-hero story over and over without putting the audience to sleep Shazam uses a ton of original elements to stand out from the pack and launch this superhero into an anticipation frenzy, wondering what kind of impact he's going to make on the Justice League! This is a must watch!",Shazam!
355,dishlady69,Not bad for the only attempt at recreating this childhood classic.,5,16 June 2019,"Having seen pre-production previews, I was a little disappointed in the direction the producers chose. Costuming was subpar and many of the special effects have a low quality ""meme"" feel to them. I'm not sure if that's what the producers were going for or if they just fell under budget. It doesn't feel as though it was purposely done. I have another critique about the multiple carnival scenes, but don't want to add a spoiler to this review. All-in-all it could have been much more cohesive and costuming could have been much better. Good job casting, though, which is where you get your five stars.",Shazam!

358,nodlimax,"I like it, but it's not awesome",7,11 April 2019,"Shazam is different from a lot of earlier DC movies. It definitely brings a lot more fun to the table compared to Man of Steel and BvS. I really like the characters from the family as well as Billy/Shazam. The chemistry overall between the characters is good. Also the focus on ""family"" is really good and I actually bought that various aspects of personalities and how humans from time to time deal with bad situations in their life was dealt with in a pretty realistic manner. I don't want to spoil anything from the story so this is why I'm keeping this aspect a bit more vague.The action scenes and the humor worked for the most part. Unfortunately half way through the movie I got a bit fed up the the silly aspects of the story. I thought they could've put a bit more focus on other aspects.I liked the idea of Shazam going up against the 7 deadly sins (Greed, Sloth, Envy, Lust, Wrath, Gluttony, Pride). Unfortunately they don't have any character. They are literally just displayed as monsters. I've seen other forms of media that dealt with that in a better way. Here they really are just ugly CGI creatures that attack and kill people. It's a bit of a waste. Their designs also was rather boring and except for gluttony it was pretty much impossible to recognize who was what. Also the CGI for the sins looked a bit more like from a computer game. So it was quite obvious that these characters weren't real.One more thing that bothered me was the lack of intelligent decisions. I had to constantly remind myself that Shazam in terms of his thoughts was still a kid, because otherwise I couldn't excuse that he constantly put other people in danger. It's actually really funny if I think about it. Most of the people that were either put in danger, got hurt or killed did so because Shazam was around. If he wasn't around their day would've been pretty normal I think.A kid watching this movie will probably not notice it, but that last part will become quite obvious to adults looking at it with a different mindset and experience. I think the main focus group for Shazam is probably teens between 12-18 years. Younger kids may get nightmares from some of the scenes. The older you are the more likely it will be that you will end up cringing at some parts of the movie. I cringed a few times...Final comment:
Don't lead super villains into areas with lots of people that can be used as distractions or hostages!",Shazam!
359,iwatchibinge,'Okay' movie.,6,28 June 2019,"Decent watch when you just want a lighter movie which doesn't jolts (even being titled as Shazam) or makes you emotional and sappy. Kiddish on all fronts - storyline as well as filming (not a drop of blood even after humans being slaughtered by monsters...I mean c'mon!); even monsters (sins) seemed not more matured from the monsters in 'Mortal Combat' movie. DC maybe wanted to break into Marvel-esque light-hearted superhero script but ended up being a kid/teens movie. Nothing exciting, just okay watch.",Shazam!
360,jljacobi,Good. Could've been better,7,12 May 2019,"I enjoyed this movie, but I would've enjoyed it more if it didn't meander so much or linger so long on what are essentially irrelevant aspects or duplicated ideas.The good: All the children are extremely well-acted and the little girl has to be one of cutest kids in the history of cinema. The foster home stuff is really, really good. All of the buddy scenes are pretty well done, there are laughs, and lots of good moments. In short, for the most part it's fun.The bad: The development of the bad guy and Billy alike are ponderous. It's like when someone you're conversing with keeps making the same point over and over despite you're having acknowledged it. Perhaps they think were all too dumb to clue in the first time through.The ending is watered down. It wasn't so much that I minded group superpowers, but perhaps wait until the sequel? I guess the message is that we're all special, or it's trying to be inclusive, but now they've kind of painted the main character into a corner. Any of the supporting actors could be the star of the sequel.That's a lot of complaining for a movie I actually liked, but when you're wishing they'd just get on with it, or thinking ""didn't we just cover this?"" rather than just enjoying, the movie missed the mark.

361,ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,An Entertaining Coming-Of-Age Superhero That Balances Both Light And Dark,7,17 September 2020,"Under the leadership of the new Warner Brothers CEO, Walter Hamada, DC film's have now reset the tone to their movie universe and more importantly have settled into carving their own path that's separate from the Marvel formula. Shazam hits the pitch-perfect tone for comic book movies; there's fun, excitement, and heart but it does not shy away from darkness.Director David F. Sanberg unabashedly draws from Tom Hanks' Big to such an extent that when it makes a Big reference, you roll your eyes and hurriedly gesture the movie to shut up and move along. The film is self-reflexive and pokes fun at the superhero genre, like a cleaner version of Deadpool that does not fourth wall break. It cleverly subverts tropes and conventions, most notably in the third act finale, which is the trickiest hurdle for any comic book movie. There's pressure on the story to have a big fight at the end but in doing so the story can easily lose story or character development. Shazam remembers.Zachary Levi makes for a great Shazam and brings all the laughs. He avoids the trap of playing a man child, which a lesser actor could have dangerously fallen into. Levi projects his inner fifteen-year-old and acts as if he is a kid who blew out his birthday candles and realized all his wishes came true. He shows that joyful thrill of wish fulfillment with ease. The transitions between Billy Batson and Shazam are seamless and both feel like the same person.Asher Angel brings the feels as Billy Batson. Together with Jack Dylan Grazer's Freddy, the disabled friend Batson befriends at the foster home, they both develop an engaging onscreen friendship that is the heart of the film. I kept wanting the movie to go back to them more than the Shazam parts.Mark Strong is only given the basic super villain package for Dr. Sivana, who acts as a dark mirror opposite to Billy Batson. It was entertaining watching Strong elevate the material and chew up the scenery.There are some genuinely dark moments in this film and I'm not referring to things that happen with the villain or anything involving superpowers. No Marvel movie would ever warrant a moment of such sadness. But I'm glad it's there because it was a powerful endearing moment.Due to its wish-fulfilling nature, Shazam will fare much better with children, who probably won't feel the film running a bit long by the end. For a manchild such as myself, it's a great one-time watch. There's nothing else I would get from a rewatch. I do look forward to seeing The Rock do Black Adam and then have them duel it out in a Shazam sequel. Shazam's bigger achievement is that it's a fine piece of sushi ginger that cleans the palette for future DC installments.",Shazam!
362,WooderIce64,A Good Time,8,24 April 2019,"Shazam is much different from the other DCEU movies. While some of the others gave themselves a much darker tone, this one is content to be a much lighter movie, telling a coming of age story. It focuses on Billy Batson, a foster kid who's gone between various homes while searching for his real family. He forms a bond with Freddy, another kid in the home, who's obsessed with superheroes. Billy is summoned by the wizard Shazam to take his place and prevent Dr. Sivana from claiming his powers. It's not a particularly original premise, but it succeeds because of the characters, which are the movie's best strength.Billy Batson, the protagonist, is an interesting character because of how the movie works as a coming of age story. If you think back to when you were his age, you could likely see yourself acting the way he does with his new powers. However, he falls into the same mommy issue territory that other DC movies have unsuccessfully tread in, and doesn't do it much better. (at least there's no ""Martha"" scene) Mark Strong plays Dr. Sivana, who acquires powers by unleashing the seven deadly sins in the form of these smoky monsters. I'm not sure if Strong was the best choice for him, but he gives a good performance. By the way, am I the only one who's reminded of Kingdom Hearts by him? The other kids in the foster home, as well as the parents, don't have much in the way of character development, but they are all very fun to watch, and they each serve their role in the story. Which leads into another point, that this movie is very funny. Quite different for the DCEU, but they've done it well here. Most of the jokes are effective, and it knows when to be serious. The action scenes are good. You've got some large-scale action like in Man of Steel, some fist-fights, and some magic action. The visuals are good, and all of these fight scenes are enjoyable to watch. The film's climax does kind of drag on, though.Another cool thing about this movie is that with Freddy, it gives us a better look at how superheroes are perceived in this world. We see Freddy's personal collection of memorabilia, including an authentic batarang that actually plays a role in the story, as well as Batman merch in a mall. Superman is talked about in this movie like people in the real world talk about celebrities. It's also full of various pop-culture references to various movies, TV shows, video games, and music. Heck, it even pokes fun at other DCEU movies.For me personally, it's set in my hometown of Philadelphia, which is cool to see. That also makes it the first DCEU movie set in a real place. You see SEPTA buses and trains, City Hall, the Art Museum, and a final battle in Center City. It's pretty obvious which parts were filmed in Philly and which weren't. It's not as much of a ""Philly movie"" as something like a Rocky movie or a Shyamalan, but it's still neat to see familiar places on the big screen.Shazam is a worthy addition to the DCEU. It's not their best movie, but it's still a fun time, something this franchise hasn't done as well as they could have. If they ever make Justice League 2, I look forward to seeing Shazam join the League, and for what they have in store for these characters.",Shazam!
363,hotrobinproductions,SHAZAM! I couldn't keep a smile off my face even if I tried,8,6 April 2019,"This movie is amazing. By far arguably one of the greatest superhero films by far. Once I heard Warner Brothers were making huge changes ever since the last hiccup, I knew they meant it, especially when those changes involved a team of people who are more connected to the horror genre. Aquaman, from James Wan, which was overall enjoyed by many alike and was indeed a success hitting the billion dollar mark world wide. Would it have been another one hit wonder? Like Patty Jenkins, who also consists of her talent in capturing horror and terror from films like monster. Many have believed Wonder Woman would have been the one hit wonder to save the dceu. That is not the case, DC has proven to turn themselves around THUS, SHAZAM! The film doesn't feel remotely rushed, slow, it feels so real as if the world of Philadelphia and the things going on make sense. The acting is fantastic, the villain SURPRISED me. I was worried thinking the villain would be generic and just a set up type villain for black Adam. He was well executed and his story was told beautifully. Billy Batson, a boy struggling with trying to find himself and his family. The film has so much groundwork yet combines elements to a universe so much bigger than we think, without it being forced like BVS did with the justice league cameo. Shazam is full of surprises, Magic, charisma, thrills, laughs, and kick ass action fun. Beautiful well made crafted film that feels like an 80s film, but far from forced.

When I saw the actor for Shazam is Zachary, I was disappointed, but after I watched it, he surprised me, actually he did a great job.My only negative point in the movie is the character of the kid ""Billy"", I didn't see any match between him and ""Zachary"", ""Billy"" is so depressed and serious, in contrast, ""Zachary"" is so funny and talkative!!! I think ""Freddy"" character is more fit for this role instead of ""Billy"" character.Finally, ""Shazam!"" is generally fun and worth to watch, beside it's suitable for all kids.",Shazam!

368,Nomad007,Not quite a 7. Better than a 6.,6,8 April 2019,"Unfortunately you can't leave fractional ratings. The movie wasn't great. The execution could have been better. The movie has a hard time deciding if it's for adults or for kids. Based on some of the content alone, this is not something I would recommend for kids, in any way. I would even recommend this to middle school kids, Even today's more adult middle kids. Some of the films content fills more R than PG-13. Other things are really off like the the lead Shazam acting like an adult when he's a kid but acting like a much younger kid when he's an adult. Some parts, like with the wizard are very cheesy while other parts are more appropriately cartoonish. Overall the plot was fun and the movie was mostly enjoyable.",Shazam!

The child actors were funny and endearing, and the story was a fresh take on the genre especially for dc comics. I particularly liked the call outs to other dc heroes and look forward to shazam being incorporated into the justice league. Parts of the movie also reminded me of 80s and 90s fantasy/superhero/kids movies and shows with the focus on family and how the climactic battle occurs. The movie wasn't perfect however as it seemed like it was 10 or 15 minutes too long. However the fights were fun and fresh and I look forward to more from sequels.",Shazam!

I think he is basically colourblind, and the material he produces is tonally inept, and generally a complete waste of some of the greatest animated source material available.Aquaman went some way to changing the tone, and arguably Shazam has gone a little bit too far in the other direction. It would sit better alongside the Burton / Keaton Batman than the current DCEU, or as a Deadpool-esque parody accompaniment.It takes its time to get going, but once it gets moving it is well worth it.",Shazam!

If i have to look at it as a movie - it's very mixed for me. There are many problems that keeps it from being at least in some level good - from it's visual effects (although the lightning effects look good); half of the story; huge percent of the characters and the cinematography, while the music and the dialogue being the weakest aspect out of everything else. Aside from those problems, it's still a fun and enjoyable film that i don't regret seeing it at all and i'll probably watch it again in the future, unlike the other movies of DC Extended Universe.",Shazam!

374,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Shazam! the better Captain Marvel?,9,7 January 2020,"This week we have Shazam! DC Movies tries it's hand again at another standalone feature hero film. And I bet you're wondering how they will fare this time. Well luckily for you, I obliged by seeing this movie 2 weeks prior to its opening. DC definitely took a risk with David F. Sandberg, known for movies Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation, as the director for this movie. But it seems that DC is committed to him as there are rumors of a sequel. Based on the visuals of Shazam, this may be a good move. Also, for once the trailers didn't give away the whole movie. Either way, here we go.Shazam! lends itself to being DC's version of a teen-friendly version of Marvel's Deadpool, minus breaking the 4th wall. DC has worked on providing viewers with a second version of what Marvel already created in their universe by giving a separate genre within the superhero movie category, a family teen comedy superhero origin story. This film is starkly different from every other DC superhero movie that has come out recently. Will this movie be heralded like Wonder Woman?... NO. But they are targeting completely different audiences. Is this movie as good as Wonder Woman?... Yes, as the end result is as pleasing.Let's start by saying this is a typical origin film for a superhero. You will take a ride with Billy Batson and the main villain, albeit a ride that is about 15 minutes too long. Nevertheless, you will enjoy the rollercoaster as it hits its peaks and valleys. There is strong comedic dialogue in this movie that will remind you of your childhood and family. With that said, I would've enjoyed this movie a little bit more with better demonstration of powers by both the villain and Captain Marvel. This is something that DC has struggled with in many of their films. Nevertheless Shazam! is a slow burn, but if you give it a chance by the end of movie I know you'll be entertained and invested in the family.With that said, gather the troops and head to the theater for this DC superhero movie. Of course, hit the matinee, if possible, but if you're taking the kids you won't be disappointed with your nighttime price.",Shazam!
375,benprichardsdotcom,Garbage,2,12 July 2019,"FYI we only watched the first 17 minutes which was long enough to figure this is a crap film. For all it's virtue signalling I was offended that we the audience were supposed to conclude that the black woman who opened the door to the young Billy couldn't be his mother, talk about overt racism.",Shazam!
376,sujanfaster,The other side of DC,8,6 April 2019,"The DC's Universe plan may not be completely in place, but they are coming up with some good standalone movies for now. With Aquaman turning out to be a huge success, Shazam joins the party but in its own style. Shazam has most of the Marvel movie characteristics when it comes to the screenplay and humour. Oh come on, like I was not going to compare this with Marvel. DC has finally shredded its Dark Tone and has made a movie to cater the wider fanbase. But I still think Shazam does lack that punch that other funnier Marvel movies like Ant-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy or Deadpool. May be it will get better as we get used to the character in the sequels (if there are any).Shazam is a superhero-children movie rolled into one. It has the lead character fighting school bullies and evil monsters from different realms alike. Some part of the movie feels like watching '17 again' in reverse. Just like the character, the audience will take time to get hang of the superpowers. But the movie lacks a bit on the emotional quotient although it does speak a lot about family (something like Fast and Furious). Its finally refreshing to see a movie with not so much VFX as we get to be on Earth most of the times (considering how the superhero movies are just jumping from one world to another these days). There isn't really too much of action but sufficient enough for the script. The background score could have been more engaging.Zachary Levi gets a very refreshing role and he is very appealing as Shazam. Mark Strong doesn't have to do much as the negative character. And the rest of the supporting cast doesn't have much to do apart from the younger Shazam and his friend.Shazam is a good entertainer, a different and an old school superhero flick. But it lacks an ingredient that will make it a memorable one.",Shazam!
377,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: Shazam!,8,16 April 2019,"This is by far my favourite DC universe movie. Shazam! showcases the sort of quirky and exiting content that could only come out of an expanded universe in the same way Guardians of the Galaxy did. David F. Sandberg appears to have taken ques from other superhero directors, namely James Gunn and Mathew Vaughn, and made something fun, heartwarming and altogether a blast to watch.Zachary Levi is pitch perfect in the role of Shazam, in every scene he is believable as a kid in an adults body. The psychical humour and sharp dialogue work perfectly but don't take away from the real character moments. At no point did it feel as though there was a disconnect between Asher Angel and Zachary Levi's performances which is insanely impressive.My one flaw comes with the villain played by Mark Strong. Although the set up is good the conflict with his character doesn't really start until the end of the second act and so his character sort of disappears for a long time. When he does show up again it feels as though it kills the momentum of the film but this is made up for with a fantastic finale.The real joy of this film comes from the fact that DC have realised that realism doesn't have to mean dark and brooding. All of the kids at Billy's foster home feel real and fleshed out and the character's struggle is believable. This manages to have realistic characters and yet still feels fun which is a crucial element that has been missing from this franchise for a long time.Overall Shazam! is a wholesome, fun movie that is absolutely worth checking out. I can see this becoming many children's favourite film in the next few years but that doesn't mean there isn't something for everyone to enjoy.",Shazam!
378,GKoeneke,Fun! Very Fun!,7,3 December 2019,"So, most of the superhero movies have moved quite a bit toward the dark. I think it really started with 1989's ""Batman"". Deadpool, Dark Phoenix, Logan, they all are pushing the limits of being a full Psychopathic and Psychological Thriller. And don't get me wrong, I really love it! Still, this one was much more upbeat and just plain fun. Personally, I feel like the progression of a single superhero storyline always seems to lead to a team up of some sort. I like the fact that the writers made it fun with Team Shazam right off the bat. There can be a lot of Superhero fatigue when you get large teams together. There are so many important characters that you can't keep the details flowing for enough of them. At some point it feels more like a cameo and this isn't the writers or producers fault. Look at Avengers: Endgame. Half the characters were dead until the end and we still couldn't get enough background on all the main characters running around. There just isn't enough screen time to go around. Endgame was over 3 hours and that still wasn't enough. I'm hoping that Shazam can keep it confined to just the 6 Team Shazam in the future with a cameo here and there. It would be good to have a Shazam/Team Shazam only set of films and if he pops into Justice League or a team up film it doesn't mean that everyone will show up in the Shazam films like they did with Captain America: Civil War which was basically another Avengers movie.One thing you will get out of this is you feel like a teenager where life is still fun and games.

381,Mike_O_Dwyer,"Same old superhero problems, but with more genuine laughs",6,6 April 2019,"Shazam takes it's time to get going because, as usual for a new-to-screen superhero, we have to plod through the usual back story set up: a young boy working his way through the school of hard knocks. How superheroes get their power is usually the most uninteresting part of their story, and why it has to always take up the first 30 minutes or so of a film baffles me.When Billy finally does get his superpowers is when the film really hits its groove, there are some genuinely laugh out loud moments and some great comic timing from Zachery Levi who nails the role of a big child toying with magic powers. I really wish there was more of this big hearted joyous humour when, with his new foster brother, Freddy, he sets out to test his limits and online likesability.Every superhero story needs its supervillain, and in this case it's Mark Strong dialling it in with a bunch of lower end CGI monsters. Mark Strong is usually one of the most watchable character actors going, but here he seems quite reigned in which is made more pronounced by the verve of Levi's performance. The CGI demons are nothing short of awful, demons that fell out of a 1980s sketchpad and brought to life via early 2000s software. As with most superhero films things descend into third act bish bash boshery, and it all plays out pretty much as you might expect.When it works Shazam works really well, playing to its good heart with a sense of joy because it says something about us that most of us could relate to. When it loses heart and plays things by the numbers it becomes dull and uninspired.It's a proper old fashioned Saturday afternoon matinee, and better than decent family entertainment. But it should be brighter and more over the top with silliness and arch villainy to be really super.",Shazam!

I say ages 10-15 are likely the intended audience here and with that in mind, it's not a horrible movie. There are a lot of moments that as an adult I have a hard time appreciating, mainly because the writing is so dumbed down (see ""kids movie"") that there are many things in the script that force an eye roll. Besides it treading dangerously into Power Rangers territory, it can be rather entertaining at times. I didn't hate it, but I definitely wouldn't watch it again. 5/10",Shazam!
384,adamsmith-51004,Shazam!!!!,8,5 April 2019,"Earnest, joyful and inspiring. DC's latest offering, Shazam! tells a classic superhero story of Earth's Mightiest Mortal buoyed by stars Zachary Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer's charismatic performances and a story filled with heart and heroism to the core.Shazam! follows 14-year-old Billy Batson learning to become the successor of the wizard Shazam. All the while struggling to find his place in the world and most importantly, finding his family.
Director David F. Sandberg takes the viewer on a nostalgic ride that harkens back to Richard Donner Superman, The Goonies, other Amblin classics and of course, Big. Thanks to a strong script and effortlessly well-timed humour, the film breezes it's the way through a solid first act and introduces us to an array of fully realized characters with real emotion. Its second act could've used a bit more breathing room before going head on to an incredible third and final act. Thanks to real stakes and excellent direction, Shazam! survives the third act crisis that most superhero movies face. And due to proper setup, the emotions skyrockets and the moments feel legitimately earned.
The costume design great and a reminder to the golden age of comics, the storyline is brilliant and very funny. Another great DC film that stands on it's own away from the DCU
All in all, Shazam! is a breath of fresh air in a genre that is filled with generic, ready-made products. After witnessing heroes being pitted against each other, against big alien armies and against the very notion of being a hero, Zachary Levi shines brightly an earnest representation of a superhero that is both inspiring and empowering in all the right ways.

This one manages to do exactly this. The light-heartedness works perfectly with the hillarious base idea of a superhero getting his powers by a wizard in a cave.The script and the actors don't spoil the fun either, everbody and everything does a great job in the delivery. Zachary Levi never under- nor overperforms as a 14-year-old boy in a ridiculous super-suit, the comedy is spot on. And all the other actors have equally great comedic talent - It just works.The movie sure has some technical and budget weaknesses, but that's just nitpicking. I'd even argue the underwhelming settings actually support the down-to-earth feeling of the atmosphere. This is not titans versus gods, this is just a little fun story about a boy and his friends. And as such a perfect anti-thesis to the oversized run-of-the-mill movies hollywood thinks the audience wants. Yes, i'm looking at you, Aquaman.",Shazam!
387,hiraishinnojutsu,"As Usual, the Superhero Movie Everyone Loves, which I Don't Quiet Like",7,3 April 2019,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a DC fan, I love DC more than Marvel, but I think it's almost becoming a common theme among comicbook movies (and all the other genres), that most of the movies with relatively high ratings among critics, are usually the kind that I later found to be a little bit boring (I'm looking at you Wonder Woman, Black Panther, Logan, and Deadpool!). it has a slow start, which I can fully understand since it's his first solo movie, and the most important formula of the first superhero solo movies is that at act one (which sometimes boring), they tell you their original story as an introduction to the viewers (fans and non-fans alike), where and how they got their powers, what to do with it, how to deal with it, etc. And that, are exactly what you're gonna see in Shazam! (Remember Joseph Campbell's Call to Adventure of Hero's Journey? yeah, it's quiet a bit like that). And I must say, mr. (David F.) Sandberg executed it pretty well since our hero's and personality motive are not that much different than the bad guy's: they want to be important, they want to be significant, they want to be wanted; but if even their own parents doesn't want them that much, they lack the attention, they lack the love; how would you respond to that? make your own new family, or join the dark side?Alright enough with act one, what about the last act? surely it's fricking awesome since it has a lot of action with high-budgeted CGI? well, not really, sure there's a lot going on in the carnival scene when the final battle happens (against the bad guy, or guys, or things, or monsters, ups spoiler alert!), but the CGI is actually pretty crappy like the one portrayed in Deadpool and Deadpool 2 (not just in that particular sequence, but also throughout the movie sadly). That's why the final fight (or fights, ahhh spoiler again!) somehow looks pretty awkward.On the positive note, many people like it. Our Overlord, Critics Master Race, Rotten Tomatoes comments it as ""An effortlessly entertaining blend of humor and heart"", well I like it. finally DC making some improvement. Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and now Shazam!; the future for DC movies is bright, endless, and limitless. Just like Marvel in Phase 1, it had a slow start, but they kept making continuous improvement from there. Yes, sometimes they stumbled, but they kept going forward, gaining new fans as time went by among general viewers, and even, among the harshest critics (yeah, because some of them have little children, right?).",Shazam!

389,fadlanamin,You're probably not the target audience of this film,8,7 February 2020,"Obviously, Shazam! is a kid film. So if your're older than 14 years old you need to understand that you're out of this film's segmentation. Doesn't necessarily means that you can't enjoy it, you just have to set a certain mindset. The story is as simple as it can get (almost shallow even) and there are (arguably) cheesy drama that you'd usually find in kids film. But the humor are pretty good, i found myself laughing out loud at times. Jack Dylan Grazer is really shining in this film, even almost outshine Zachary Levi. Jack Dylan's character is hilarious, and he acted it really well.
My main issue about this film is that Zachary Levi is supposedly play a 15 years old (Billy) right, and he did an okay job with his jokes and childish behavior. But the thing is that the kid who played the actual Billy (Asher Angel) acted it in a very serious-ish, mature way. So there is some unbalance in the portrayal of the character.MINOR SPOILER AHEAD:

Obviously these people don't understand what the movie is about and don't know anything about Shazam. The comedy is perfect and even adults should understand it having been teens once. You can feel for the struggles of a teen and what it must be like suddenly be handed super human abilities.And of course it starts with some negative things, it's how all hero movies work. You go from arrogant, doing bad things to become a humble hero. Is it a perfect movie? Well no. It's not an oscar movie by any means. There are some plotholes you may notice further in the movies. But again, its ok given its not some super deep story. I did like the end cameo because I imagine this will tie in to a possible DC movie with Shazam as a Justice League character.Admittedly Zach is what holds it together. Being a nerd at heart he was always into wanting to be a superhero in a movie. He's the main reason the movie works. That and the Strong playing the villian.

I would never claim it's perfect, but it's the kind of movie that's just so easy to like and enjoy. It has moments of intensity and scariness as well as a lot, and I mean a whole lot, of fun, and while it may be cheesy and follow a lot of genre conventions and is certainly not the deepest thing ever, it still has a good amount of heart and a kind of transcendent charm that just leaves me with a sense of happiness.The movie is full of humor and fun that mainly comes from the characters. Though it's hard to develop all of Billy's foster family when there's so many of them and a relatively short movie, they did a pretty good job of showing their personalities and making them engaging, and of getting a lot of entertainment and humor out of them. There is also a lot of heart and sweetness that comes out of the genuine goodness and love of the foster family. And of course, the portrayal of a child in an adult's body is just an endless fountain of amusement.I thought this movie did a good job of utilizing the fact that it takes place in the DC universe rather than the real world, despite the fact that the other major heroes don't really appear. It just creates a fun layer of interest that Billy's superhero form is emerging in a world where superheroes (and specifically, major superheroes that are well known as fictional characters in our world) are already known and real.I also think this movie deserves credit for creating some eerie, scary aspects too. The opening scene was absolutely chilling - I loved it.That said, when we get to the villain, there are both negatives and positives. Despite showing his backstory in some detail, which was very cool, Dr. Sivana still came across as pretty unsatisfactorily flat for the most part, and the Deadly Sins were even worse in this regard.A part of the movie that I'm honestly not sure whether to see as a positive or a negative (maybe a bit of both) is how lacking in natural heroism Billy is. It makes it more satisfying when he finally gets it together and saves the day, and I like portraying the idea that even someone who does not have a natural propensity for being a good hero can eventually pull through. That said, perhaps they went a little too far with it. I feel like the bit where Billy beat up the bullies was the only really ""worthy"" moment until he basically had no choice but to step up to the plate. A couple more moments where you see his potential and he doesn't just seem like a goof would've been nice.Probably my least favorite thing about the movie was that the final battle felt a bit drawn out and sluggish - it had a hard time climaxing, and there was too much hero and villain just bashing each other without enough ups and downs to be interesting. Though not a minor flaw, as far as ""worst things about the movie"" goes, this is really not too bad.Though I mentioned a few complaints, I want to emphasize that overall I thought the movie was great and I enjoyed it immensely. Just writing this review and recalling what it's like makes me happy, and I'm eager to rewatch it. If you like fun, comedic movies, superheroes, and/or movies with positive themes and themes of family, you should definitely give it a try.",Shazam!
404,gluonpaul,"Pretty funny and some sweet storylines, watchable but not amazing",7,27 March 2019,"I have been looking forward to this movie since I first saw the trailer, I have to say DC does damn good trailers!The movie was quite funny, there were quite a few laughs throughout and they were well pepper in. I dont think you would have to have a really in depth knowledge of any of the superhero movies to get the little and often not so subtle nods to other DC franchises but they were nice too.Overall the story is one of a kid who has been abandoned learning what it means to trust people and what a family is. This part of the story is very sweet and there are some lovely scenes in parts.The superhero side of the movie is more about him learning how to use power which makes total sense but it gets spoilt at the end. Major spoiler here!! You have been warned!!! Towards the end he gives some of his power to his adopted family, and his little sister then does more superhero stuff in five mins of the film than he has done the whole movie to that point. Apparently she didnt need to learn any of those lessons? And neither did any of the rest of his family? It was meant to be a sweet scene about family but that part wasnt really needed as they had other more grounded scenes for that and instead it just seemed to undermine a lot of the movie.Even so this had a lot of fun moments in it, and I would say it is worth a view just dont expect to be blown away.",Shazam!
405,rorygunn,This is all they could come up with?,5,24 October 2021,We FINALLY get a proper movie about the REAL ONE TRUE Captain Marvel and this is what they come up with? And on top of that they cast the guy from Chuck as CM? I have always loved Captain Marvel and the way he was treated in the comic industry was a real shame starting with a lawsuit that eventually caused the character to lose his name to what would eventually become a stupid bitter cosmic Barbie Doll. This movie could have been another Superman 1978 but instead we get juvenile jokes. Billy Batson was an upbeat character who now has the powers of an adult and while naturally you have to explore that bit eventually Billy using the wisdom of Solomon which is missing from the movie realizes what the powers are for. Unfortunately all we got was a bunch of nonsense with CM telling all his friends about what has happened and then splitting the powers. It's a real shame this is what they came up with because the ONE TRUE REAL Captain MArvel deserved better.,Shazam!

407,rustonreviews,Another fun DC romp.,7,24 April 2019,"Based on the DC comic books, Shazam! follows foster kid Billy Batson (Angel) as he struggles to track down his biological mother, hopping from foster home to foster home inbetween each investigative search that meets a crushing dead end. With his ongoing search going nowhere, Billy is sent to live at a group home with five other foster kids, and despite his intentions on bailing as quickly as possible, he befriends superhero fanatic Freddy. After Billy rescues Freddy from bullies, he is summoned by dying wizard Shazam to his lair, the Rock of Eternity, where he reveals Billy has been chosen as his succeeding champion. Once Billy says Shazam's name, he inherits his powers and is transformed into an adult superhero, played by Levi. Confiding in Freddy with his peculiar situation, the two work together to unlock Shazam's vast variety of superpowers, with Freddy recording each test for his Youtube channel. By doing so, Shazam becomes a viral sensation, attracting the attention of supervillain Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Strong) who wants Shazam's powers for himself.It appears DC have altogether scrapped the idea of a shared cinematic universe to replicate Marvels success, and instead seem to be fixating all their creative energies on delivering fun standalone films that don't feel inherently connected to a larger universe. One of the biggest problems DC found themselves saddled with was competing with Marvel, resulting in a botched attempt at a cinematic universe that took greater joy in being dark and gritty rather than fun and enjoyable. Thankfully, Sandberg's film is a blast from start to finish. Levi plays Shazam with a cheeky, childlike wonder, resulting in an irresistibly fun performance. Levi has a great screen presence, and Shazam is no doubt one of the most likeable superheroes of DC's (mostly broody) repertoire. Mark Strong delivers a suitably menacing performance as Sivana, and the insidious monsters that manifest from within him as a result of his powers look fantastic. Gayden's script is packed with humour, and the theme of 'with great power comes great irresponsibility' works brilliantly for this film. Essentially, the film plays out like a superhero version of Big (1988), with Sandberg even including a humorous nod to the Tom Hanks classic, unabashedly wearing it's influences on his films sleeve. While the final confrontation between Shazam and Sivana does drag on just a little longer than it should, it doesn't stop Shazam! from being another enjoyable DC romp.",Shazam!

It had some interesting CGI moments but the story was not at all interesting and Levi just didn't pull off a teen in an adult body. The culmination of the film was not all that original. I was impressed by the beginning of the movie as a young boy is transported into another realm who failed to pass the test. Following the first half hour the movie became tedious to watch even though I completed it just to see the eventual outcome. Many films like this make me interested in a possible sequel but not this one. I generously gave this a 5 Star rating but I'm thinking it was mostly because of Mark Strong and some of the Special Effects.",Shazam!
413,Abranth-d,Billy batson for the win !,8,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of SHAZAM ! So Shazam stars Zachary Levi better known as one of Thor's friends who got killed by Hela in Thor Ragnarok after which he jumped ship to DC. Now this guy is amazing in this movie , he's playing a 15 year old boy in a grown man's body and it doesn't look forced anywhere(no tropic thunder reference intended). The story is a very clear adaptation of geoff Johns' comic book of the same name but without Black Adam. There is a very cool sequence in the comic book which I thought was never going to make it into the movie but it did and it was amazing ! The story is more of a sweet tale about these foster kids more than a superhero movie , I even had man tears at some point in this movie. Mark strong plays Dr sivaana , the bad guy . But he really wasn't much of a threat , but they're saving the big guns aka Black Adam for the sequel from what I noticed. The kid who plays Eddie in IT plays Shazams step brother and he was great in this movie ! The supporting cast were good as well. One of the things that bothered me is .. it's not really a flaw it's just something that's bugged me. So you know how this movie is part of the Dceu right , they do show nice nods to other DC characters but there is a fight sequence at a toys r us and there is a Batman toy in there ! Like Batman was a wanted fugitive from what I remember. But that's just me being to DC movies like always. In the end , Shazam is a nice tale with a lot of heart to it , great acting , decent cgi and lots and lots of Easter eggs to the larger universe. Oh yeah there's two post credit scenes . Check em out as well.",Shazam!

Saddened that DC had to pull in the whole Marvel family into Captain Marvel's first modern film (the Captain Marvel). Though the family dynamic is quaint for modern audiences, it was not necessary in this premier outing and I feel it lessened the Captain's value, as Captain Marvel has been treated since his inception. One day, someone is going to realize the value of this character to mature audiences. Some good entertainment to be found within.

In addition, the movie not only retains the original dark of DC, but also incorporates many family-friendly bridge sections, of course, there are also elements of horror that the director himself is good at. Under the shell of the sand sculpture's temperament is actually the story of a teenager's growth: Shazan and the villain Dr. Shivana are like two sides of a coin. One is sunny and the other is dark. Reasons to go. ""Please shout my name"" ""Billy"", hahahaha",Shazam!
417,Lost_In_Translation_,A Fun DC movie with heart,7,4 April 2019,"It's good to see DC finally breaking away from their mold and making movies that are fun to watch again. When they had The Dark Knight trilogy finding huge success, it seemed like they stuck to the formula of dark action movies. Then Marvel came along and made good entertaining movies, but for some reason DC wanted to keep being the serious one.With this and Aquaman, DC is finally seeing that you can make an action movie fun without diminishing how good it is.It's strong point is it's cast of characters. All of Billy's foster siblings are really cute and have some of the funniest bits. Zachary Levi is fantastic as the superhero part of Billy and plays really well to the comedic aspect of it. He acts exactly like a teenager who became an adult with super powers.The villain is fine overall. The movie starts with his origin which was an interesting thing to see. When it comes to the modern day stuff with the villain, he gets less interesting. He just kind of becomes baddie with demons he can summon who is obsessed with getting Shazam's powers. He's more of a catalyst to help Billy become the hero that he should become.Other than the middling villain, my only other issue really is the final battle drags on for way too long. The movie is a hefty 2 hours 20 mins, and the last 30 mins or so of that is the final battle. There is an aspect that I wont spoil that is fantastic that happens in it, but even with that great moment it just goes on for way too long.It's good to see DC finally taking risks and breaking away from only making Batman/Superman movies. They are taking a page from Marvel and taking a character the general movie public knows zilch about, and making them into a fun and loveable movie to watch. It will be interesting to see what they do with the rest of the DCEU as both the Batman and Superman actors are done. WW 1984 and Aquaman 2 should be interesting, but maybe what DC needs is to just stick to their solo movies and not worry about the big team-up movies. Maybe go the route of Thor Ragnarok and just have Shazam team up with one other hero and make a fun buddy hero kind of movie?",Shazam!
418,Ingrouille181,"Out with the dark and gritty, and finally in with the fun, goofy and campy",8,7 April 2019,"The only DCEU movies other than this that I like are Aquaman and Wonder Woman; the DCEU still had a rocky start, and it's still too distracting, and I still haven't changed my mind to have THIS be the last DCEU movie I watch. One thing I'm glad about though is that the DCEU is FINALLY embracing the light hearted, goofy side of the comics, and Shazam! is definitely the Guardians of the Galaxy of the DCEU.The plot focuses on teenager Billy Batson, a foster kid who is one day chosen by an ancient sorcerer named Shazam to become his new and final champion, receiving abilities he never dreamed of before. Meanwhile, the dark 7 deadly sins have chosen their own champion known as Sivana, and with his powers, he hopes to track Billy down and take the powers he believes are rightly is.I knew director David F. Sandberg would do a great job. From his own short horror films on Youtube, to two horror movies to, and now handling a big budget superhero movie, I always enjoy seeing what kind of spin he puts on the genre. Shazam is very well written, and very funny, something we definitely need with the DCEU now; it needs to be goofy. Shazam isn't meant to be dark and broody like Batman (or Zach Snyder's Superman was) is, and Sandberg did a great job levelling out the more serious moments with the funny moments in the film.Zachary Levi steals the show as Shazam, and Jack Dylan Grazer (Eddie in the new It movie FYI) is great as his foster brother Freddy Freeman. Grazer has great chemistry with both Billy Batson actor Asher Angel and Levi. I like that the movie is another standalone, like Wonder Woman and Aquaman's movies were; there's references to Superman and Batman which were nice. I also enjoyed the other characters, including Billy Batson's new foster parents, and his foster siblings he bonds with in the movie, especially the character Darla.I enjoyed Billy learning what his powers are and the montages of what he and Freddy get up to, and it's realistic what they get to. Buying beer, going to a strip club, goofing around town and just being kids. I kind of like that the wizard (played by Djimon Hounsou) in the end chooses Billy simply because he's the last child he could find who's in anyway decent, it's not like the basic origin where Billy's found to be the most selfless, perfect being on the planet; Billy in this movie is what a kid his age would be, a rebellious teenager, stubborn, a trouble maker, he's not the best of the best and gives him a good setting to build and develop into THE REAL Captain Marvel (sorry Marvel fans). And this gives a layer to his relationship with the villain too, one of jealousy; it kind of reminded me of Orm's conflict with Arthur in Aquaman last year.And I enjoyed the villain played by Mark Strong as well. He has motivations for his villainy which boils down to years of parental neglect as well as envy and jealousy, making him the perfect villain to be Shazam's enemy in this movie. If there's one problem it's that the villain, while interesting with his 7 deadly sin ghost puppet powers, his over the top villainy and monologues felt too overdone, and I know that the movie is parodying those super villain cliches but I just think a few weren't executed the way Sandberg intended them to be. Also, this movie takes place at Christmas time, in the winter, so we get snow and cold nights as the setting. As someone who loves the Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam film, a warm summer time setting is more suited for a Shazam movie. Maybe they'll get there with the sequel. Other then that I didn't have any other complaints. And that's probably not because it's perfect, but because everything else seemed a bit average when I watched it. I guess I'll pick up more positives and less blandness when I see it next time.In the end I didn't know what to expect, the villain looked kinda bland in the trailers, and I thought the villain would end up having some wacky twist to him (something like a Meet the Robinson's twist where he turns out to be Freddy from the future, or something like that).",Shazam!

Billy Batson is a great protagonist with great development.
He starts of as this orphan who gets superpowers and use them for his own enjoyment but then learns what a real super hero is and uses his power for good.
This movie is about growing up the become a true hero its about what it means to be a hero and Billy Batson is learning that threw this movie.
There is not much I can say about this movie either than it's good it has good humor and good characters.
This movie is a must watch.VILLAIN
The villain is meh they manage to set him up good but then later he just becomes bland.FINAL ACT
The final act dragged for a bit and was a bit nonsensical like when all of the kids got the powers of Shazam and easily learned how to use their skills during a battle.
And a 9 year old managing to easily save lives is pretty stupid.ONE MAJOR FLAW
Idk If this is an actual flaw or not but I think it is.
There is this whole Side plot about Freddy being Friends with Shazam but that whole Side plot could have easily been solved.
First you could actually see Freddys face during a recording of Shazam testing his powers and you could also hear his voice countless of times in the videos he shown.
So if Freddy just showed the videos of Shazam testing his powers then the side plot would have easily been solved.VERDICT

A disparate bunch of anti heroes group together (Suicide Squad), a female superhero who completely takes the reins (Wonder Woman) and now a kid who becomes a superhero. The ideas are really interesting, it's in the execution of the ideas that it all fails.All the recent scripts are the same really. All end up with this OTT (and yawn inducing) Big Boss fight off.Shazam is fun in parts. The first act is really over drawn but things improve significantly once Shazam enters the frame. And that middle act is fun. Full of jokes and humour but then we get to the third act and it reverts to type.That last act is cringe worthy (something my children told me). No real sense of peril or danger and the CGI doesn't help.Honestly, not sure why people are posting 10s for this. It ain't The Godfather or Toy story. It's just another run of the mill 80s type plot with mediocre to poor CGI with some decent jokes.Save your cinema ticket for something better and catch this on Tv whenever it comes out.

Shazam does have intelligence with his power. This incarnation wasn't Shazam. I love Zachery Levi, but this movie just wasn't it.

432,Ashcropolis,"A Comedy film , A family drama and sometimes Horror",7,5 April 2019,"This film BLEW AWAY my expectations, a family drama at its core, the film knows when it needs to be funny and when it needs to be serious. SHAZAM! Is what everything the MCU movies try to be but Shazam does it far better. It doesn't force humor and knows how to balance different tones. SHAZAM! surprisingly gets very dark and emotional at some points. Director David Sandberg who is known for his horror films fully showcases his horror skills here when they are needed and they work tremendously when he needs them to. But what surprised me even more was how well the emotional scenes were handled, about the story of an orphan trying to find his mother. The film is at its best when it is focusing on that. The foster family is also a joy to watch every time they are on screen.
The chemistry between Zachary Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer is a treat to watch. Asher Angel is incredible in his role as Billy Batson. Grace Fulton and the other supporting cast of the foster children are also amazing.
Now The Villain. Played by Mark Strong is nothing special which sucks but it helps the audience focus more on the family and billy batson. Considering the low budget of the film, the CGI is pretty decent for the most part only getting a little cartoony during the seven deadlift Sins sequences.All in all a great comic book movie that every other
*light-hearted* comic book movies should aspire to be.",Shazam!

434,MovieBinger,Shazzzz,5,11 May 2019,"So you mean to tell me the magic that suppose to find the one can't even do that! They had hundreds of people get ""choosen"" to be Shazam and the only reason Billy got to was because he was the last choice apparently bc the wizard was tired of searching. Geezus. And no one out of the lot was bad enough to take the orb. Then you just give the whole family powers.......... Might as well give the other hundred you rejected powers too. Everyone can be Shazam yippie. Onto the rest..A fun ride that didn't land many jokes. 1st 2 acts were good and was enjoying but the 3rd got boring and that's when you suppose to be excited. A lot of scenes were predictable and cliche. Can't movies go for a different direction then the same copy paste superhero. If you are green lit for a sequel before the movie comes out you shouldn't have the same boring ending of hero saves the day.The villain is another weak villain and the problem is the superman powers where the two antagonists beat each other up without leaving a scratch on each other. Throwing and punching with no effect or effort. Show a little struggle.
Then DC can't even get a cameo with Henry. WTH it takes 5 minutes to shoot that scene.",Shazam!
435,nlgthunder,"A little corny, a lot of funny",7,10 August 2021,"The storyline of Shazam! Is incredibly predictable and is executed in a pretty corny way. However, the humor of this film is outstanding. I laughed out loud again and again at the jokes that always landed. I have to say, Jack Gazner stole the show for me, just like he did in IT. He's got real chops, I love his style.Shazam! Was cute and funny, and the resolution was heartwarming. All around it was definitely worth the watch, even if it's not a new favorite.",Shazam!
436,lumieretrain,Shazam! by David F. Sandberg,8,17 April 2019,"The DC character Shazam or also known as Captain Marvel, is one of the most interesting and funniest superheroes. As his real name is Billy Batson, a 14 years old boy, who would turn into the grown-up superhero, just by calling the name Shazam. Even he tries to look more adult when he is the superhero, his behavior would make in some situations hilarious. But at the same time, he would learn through the walking of his road, what does mean to be a hero by having a great responsibility. After David F. Sandberg directed Annabelle: Creation, he seems interested to direct a movie based on the character Shazam as his next project. In 2019 came out Shazam! by David F. Sandberg, with Zackary Levi, Asher Angel, Mark Strong, Jack Dylan Grazer and Djimon Hounsou. The movie's plot: The 14 years old boy Billy Batson (Asher Angel), gets chosen by the ancient wizard Shazam (Djimon Hounsou), to become a grown-up superhero (Zackary Levi), whenever the main character calls the name Shazam. While Billy Batson is still learning how to use his powers, with the help of his foster brother Freddy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer), he must stop the villain Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong). The movie uses the humor, to make some of the funniest scenes, hilarious with a workable rhythm, without forcing the humor. But at the same time, the movie uses the drama, to make some of the most emotional scenes, touching to be unforgettable. Shazam! maintains some of the most important themes used in the previous DCEU movies, like the superheroes' love of their family. As the heroes would get inspired by this love, to move forward and never give-up to become stronger. Especially when these heroes face the dangers, so they know how to handle them. Asher Angel did a well done job as Billy Batson, who for a long time has been searching for his mother. Until he finds her to see the reason she vanished, which would make him understand, what kind of important decision he must take. Zackary Levi managed very well as Billy Batson in Shazam form, who would initially use his powers in the funniest way. Until he would meet Dr. Sivana where he has to learn, to be much responsible whenever he uses his powers. Mark Strong was excellent as Dr. Sivana as a villain, who has been treated by his father like he is not as important as his brother. Once Dr. Sivana would become powerful, he uses his powers to release his anger, but at the same time he would try in all the way to stop Shazam. Jack Dylan Grazer was really good as Freddy Freeman, who is Billy Batson's foster brother. Freddy would help Billy to see, how to use these powers, once he finds out what happened with Billy. Until there would be a surprising moment, where besides Freddy, his other foster brothers and sisters Darla Dudley, Mary Bromfield, Eugene Choi and Pedro Peña, would get involved in this adventure as well. Shazam! is one of the funniest DCEU movies and one of the best superhero movies.",Shazam!
437,sirquickie,Mr Pantyhose,9,6 April 2019,Very cheerful and funny. Can be put on the shelf next to the 1966 Batman. The film answers the question that if a superhero becomes a child. What difficulties he must pass. Way awareness of himself as a superhero. This film was needed for DC.,Shazam!
438,Skippy489,FUN!,9,21 September 2019,"With the previous DC films, I was scared to think of how this was going to turn out. Then I found out Zachary Levi was attached and I was happy to find that out, but then I was worried that it was going to be very Chuck like. There is no Chuck here. This is a completely different role!
I believe that this is one of the best superhero movies to come out in the 2010s and best since Spider-Man 2. It really has the fun but serious tone of early Marvel movies (Fanastic Four (2004), Spider-Man(2002)).
Shazam has some flaws, but overall is pretty entertaining. I love how it was like a ""real"" movie. It blended 80s style film with 2010s style. It is really well made and really fun/",Shazam!

While the comedy hits the mark more times than not, the film never really seems to hit its stride. In fact, minus the special effects the movie never really feels like a major motion picture. The story is rather bland. The family/together/acceptance plot is rather thin and offers little to earn your attention. It is not a bad watch, but it is easily forgettable.",Shazam!

The character of Shazam! is well developed, and this origin story is a welcome addition to the DCEU, proving solo movies should be the path this universe needs to keep following.",Shazam!

443,Thekeybaldemasterrises,The future is looking bright for DC,8,31 March 2019,"I'm sure most people can agree that Shazam is a very funny movie. A bit more so than what's come before. Aquaman was goofy as well, but I found myself laughing at the movie rather than with it. That's not the case here. Shazam knows when to have fun, but when to take itself seriously. Zachary Levi was born to play this role and he had my attention the entire time he was on screen. The kids are what's most impressive about this film, they all feel genuine and real. I'm so happy the brand is finally stepping away from the dark and cold vision Zack Snyder has, and just letting these characters embrace what they really are. The only reason this got an 8 out of 10 for me was because it didn't really blow me away visually or action wise but that's ok. As long as the core of the movie is there and you care about what's happening, I care more about that than the spectacle. And yes I'm just gonna say it, it was a thousand times better than Captain Marvel sorry! 8/10.",Shazam!

The film is almost a standard superhero film.
What I would say is that I did think some scenes felt long and at times I was ready for the next one.
It is a typical superhero film with a villain but I wish sometimes we had a film of just Shazam showing us his awesome quirky self, you know like a film based on learning about his powers and the relationship of his side kick, like a building block to support the next one.
I give Shazam 7/10",Shazam!

Movie from DC. This is amazing really revives the DC Universe so comedic as every joke is so hilarious as it takes the mick out of being a superhero. All great special effects was amazing lightning bolts everywhere and massive fight scenes, nevertheless it was well done not too overdone like in most DC Movies. Just the right amount of action to support the comedy when the situations do not always go there way so interesting and hilarious. I would definitely recommend watching it even if you are not a DC Universe Movie Fan as you will not be disappointed.

A sequel? Without question, and an Oscar, if not one or two nominations and a win? I think so. A sequel has a lot to live up too, and Levi has a lot of fun to bring more to DC's round table.A 10/10 movie, with emotional moments in a foster home, and a mother-son relationship that can deliver
tears to audiences' eyes, there is also hope in this movie that makes superhero fans get what they deserve... a ""family"" superhero team-up can hype the mood when your already done laughing and cheering before the 2hrs is up.Fantastic movie, 100% a superhero worth staying! Go and watch Shazam! otherwise, your going to miss out a superhero and a 80s throwback vibe from Tom Hanks stepping on a ginormous piano, now is that a hint worth or what??Who'd want to miss that?????Lastly, enjoy Shazam!

447,jchen-07237,In Between,7,12 April 2019,"I was very excited for Shazam when I watched the trailer, and I have to admit, when I watched it in the theatres, there were only three or four people watching it, seven including us. My spirits disappointedly sunk. It was, of course, a very humorous movie, with clean humor that everyone should be able to chuckle about. But it wasn't my kind of comedy. It was more of a comedy than an action. Shazam didn't make me think of a superhero, it honestly made me infer to a classic cartoon that parents fall asleep watching. It was very cheesy, to be honest, with all the corny catchphrases. And of course, I usually prefer these kind of things, but it honestly didn't impress me as much as I thought it would. But if you love a good old family-friendly movie, this is a great movie for everyone.",Shazam!
448,jchen-07237,Eh...Let's Just Say...It's Fine.,7,12 May 2019,"Shazam! was a great film, with millions of laughable moments and very kid-friendly. It will certainly be loved by many people. But there are certain things that this film could have worked on. The seven deadly sins were not nearly as frightening or powerful as they should've been represented as, and the storyline can get a bit boring and out of hand. Shazam (Billie) killed the villain much too quickly, and the villain is not as powerful or clever as a super villain should be. He was more of a serial killer type or just a man who was greedy for something.
SPOILERS! DO NOT READ AHEAD IF YOU DO NOT WANT SPOILERS...
Also, at the end, when Billie's Foster siblings all became superheroes...one could call it a little cheesy. That does not give Shazam that much of a special effect anymore, and if you are a fan of Marvel, do not watch this, you'll be hugely disappointed.
But if you're a DC fan or someone who seeks just a friendly family movie that can warm hearts and plant laughs, Shazam is the right film for that.",Shazam!
449,jchen-07237,Shazam: Enjoy It,7,5 September 2019,"Shazam! for me was a decent film, with comedy that anybody could laugh at. For me, in my opinion, it must be a bit cliche, but this is what all adults and teenagers must think. Shazam is not another unfolding, action-filled superhero film, it is unique in many ways. The villain and his plot was not very significant to the film, which made the film much more of a superhero comedy than an action superhero film. But this is a greatly crafted family film, which can make people chuckle from every age. The comedy is well written, which made me chuckle at many parts. I recommend this film for families, especially with children. For adults who are expecting another action DC film with a dark background, I do not recommend this film. But this film should deserve praise, for brightening DC and giving it a new genre completely. DC continues to surprise us in different ways.",Shazam!

451,NpMoviez,Nice addition in DCEU.,8,12 April 2019,"If this was the potential of DCEU, why on earth movies like Justice League, BvS and Suicide Squad even exist? The more I watch films like this, the more I think Snyder was the biggest mistake of DCEU.Good : Zachary Levi is awesome as the adult version of Billy Batson. He can perfectly play an adult who is actually a teenager. His performance is incredible. He has an amazing chemistry with all the other characters which made the experience really good. The movie is an ultimate fun ride from the top to bottom. There's not a single part which felt boring or uninteresting. The arc given to Billy was quite good and we start to like the characters. The comedic parts deliver at its finest. Director Sandberg has shown versatility in a very good way. I have always thought of him as a very good director. His horror films like Lights Out and Annabelle Creation are directed quite well, the major flaws are in the script, if any. Here, there are no such problems with the script, and he understands very well how a certain part of the story is to be directed. Some parts do have a nice horror movie vibe to it, but it is not tonally inconsistent. It knows what it tries to be, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Even at the times it does, it is for a comedic purpose. It never tries to be an epic film knowing that it's not, unlike BvS. It is sure to put a smile on your face throughout and make you laugh a lot. The final moments are crowd pleasing moments done right.Mixed : It's not a big problem, but I expected more comedy out of this. What I got was great, but I wanted a lot more of funny stuff. The kid playing teen Billy Batson isn't a bad actor. But some of the times, it felt like him and Levi were a little different with each other. It could've been a little better.Bad : The villain was a clichéd villain. He wasn't interesting as a character like Thanos, Ledger's Joker or Bane. Mark Strong does a good job, but this is a poorly written villain.Conclusion : An entertaining superhero film which knows what it is, and is quite campy in a good way. It is not wildly original concept of a film. It has some popular tropes of the genre and has a familiar template for an origin story. But it will definitely keep you entertained till the end, and you will end up liking most of the characters. The best thing is, even if you have never seen a DCEU movie, it won't make a difference. It has little to no reference to the previous DCEU films and is its own thing for the most part. Recommended even to those who are not the fan of the genre.Rating.Score : 7.8/10Grade : A-",Shazam!

Who better then Captain Marvel, a less popular campier rip off of Superman, so popular in the 40's that National Comics (DC) sued for copyright infringement and won. However, with the best of intentions, 'Shazam' falls short. The jokes are flat, the storyline is unoriginal and the characters dull and uninspired. Zach Levi, tasked with portraying a 15 year old magically transformed into an adult super hero, comes off as a little creepy. (Tom Hanks, Judge Reinhold, Barbara Harris, Dudley Moore and Jennifer Garner all did it better.) Perhaps actual cameos from the other heroes (like Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman or Affleck's grim Batman) might have helped. The kids might like it but.... I've already watched one 'Captain Marvel' this month. I liked that 'Captain Marvel'. 'Captain Marvel' was a pretty good movie. 'Shazam!'... you are no 'Captain Marvel'.

And we get the chance to watch Billy learn what his powers are which is better than just him knowing all of a sudden.There are Easter eggs in the film about it being in the same universe as Batman & Superman and it's really cool.So at first I was a little confused about the story of a little boy in the car with his family and then how it changed to the story of Billy, only because I'm not familiar with Shazam.Levi was a great choice for the character and I couldn't imagine anyone but him playing Shazam.I highly recommend watching this film, I'll be watching it again.",Shazam!
457,davidhiggins-89756,Shazam pronounced SJWhazam!.,3,7 June 2019,"Hardly a movie to expect much from in the first place, though slightly better than anticipated. Was more kiddiefied in parts than initially thought, it's targeted audience being the single digit crowd (& teens) and their extended family along for the ride.
Though the use of the 'f' word bleeped out and many instances of the 's' word, was it really suitable?. Almost trying to pervert the intended audience in an underhanded way. (Slight incidental spoiler's coming)So we can have the older schoolboys running into handicapped kids with their truck and there are NO consequences! at all, no one takes a video of the younger kids getting beaten up either and does the right thing informing the school authorities. (nowadays in real life the mobile phone prevents a lot of this!).
In this movie the bullying of younger schoolchildren is proclaimed to be all part of the curricular.
The message is 'you just have to just put up with it' UNLESS you happen to have a superhero friend to pop along to the school in an attempt to belly up placate the bullies into thinking 'hey, that kid I like to beat up is cool after all, I'll leave off knocking them around henceforth'. SUCH A BAD MESSAGE!. 3 stars for that.The Police also in this movie were shown to be totally incompetent, never showing up to the big fareground fight scene at all. Highly unlikely.
The real Police must be sick of Hollywood showing them to be such bumbling slackers in the movie World, as are other folks in their effected professions. Just used & abused by Hollywood, have been through the ages.There were some unexpected laughs it was a bit of a knock about, SJWhazam being some kind of toned down Deadpool. Not particularly to be taken seriously.
Sad thing about the whole movie, other that the 'bad' message about tolerating bullying is most of these actors are never going to be in a bigger film than this. They will go on expecting bigger and better things, but for most of them this is as good as it gets. Hardly the pinnacle in any actors career, but then again, better than what most of us will ever achieve in the acting World.",Shazam!

Consider DCEU Reborn.,10,5 April 2019,"If you know something about DC Comics and Cartoon and go in with some expectations- this one will deliver the goods. This perhaps is the best interpretation of the character Shazam! The first half leaves you in splits, the second half in awe and the last few minutes is like nothing seen in any Comic Book Cinematic Universe thus far. The DCEU Cultural references and the comic timing makes it just unforeseen and in a good way.Most origin stories do not focus a lot on the Superhero Origin and instead go on to make room for a grand build-up to launch the Super-villain. This technique works wonders for this story. Also, I liked the way this film masters the art of grounding the fantastic world of comics in reality. You don't really get such things in superhero films as much. It is like reading a comic-book. There are a few negligible flaws, but the movie entertained so very well that one doesn't feel like exploring the negatives.People have been saying this and rightly so- Zachary Levi was born to play this role. Jack Dylan Grazer is brilliant and Asher Angel impresses as Billy. The rest of the cast is decent. Special salutation to David F. Sandberg, DC has unearthed a gem in this guy.For Marvel fans- think of this as the PG13 version of- ""Deadpool + Thor- jam-packed into one 2 hours film... and if that was not sufficient, the film maker, craftily adds a ""Stranger Thing"" undertone to glue it all.

461,ZCDomingos,The cast gave it all and it showed!,10,5 August 2019,"Yes! I was really rooting for this movie!
DCEU remains a struggle, but with movies like Wonder Woman and Shazam (still haven't watched Aquaman, so no opinions on that one, yet) makes me believe they are getting their vision straight.To me what stands out is the acting, the technique between Zachary Levi, Mark Strong and Asher Angel is phenomenal and so well drafted. The classic Mark Strong gives such a compelling performance I couldn't take my eyes of the screen whenever he was present. Mark's really did great with his character, the calm and yet menacing presence was incredible and perfect, and the way it balances with the childish acting performance of Zachary Levi was so well done. Both actors really connected to the core of their characters and it shows whenever they're on a scene together.Asher Angel was an incredible young talent, and such a delight to watch, just as much as his companions, I mean Jack Grazer stole the show with his relatable and remarkable performance. The foster family was such a good dynamic to the movie, so glad they went full on character development with Asher's character and everyone involved. I really was afraid the foster family plot would only serve as an entrance to Shazam and a final crisis to end the movie, glad they fully developed that plot and managed to put a magnificent twist on it.It's not every movie that manage to present such an interesting and well chosen cast, but Shazam killed in that department. Presenting us a well diverse cast with characters that really matter and help the plot unfold in a natural way, was really the best thing that came out of this movie!",Shazam!

Kids will love it, will leave the theater excited wanting to be a superhero and yelling ""Shazam!"". The villain is really poor, the bad bad guy. The film doesn't have a very complex plot, the guy is thirsty for power and wants the ones that the protagonist has and uses the 7 deadly sins (which are mythological monsters) to try to get them. It touches very important issues about the true meaning of family and heroism. It reminds us of The Goonies, Stand By Me, The Greatest American Hero and Big. Wonder Woman is better but this one is better than Aquaman. Same light and cool tone since Justice League and this is the perfect path that DC found to compete against Marvel. The movie is very long, in the middle it becomes heavy and slow, 1 hour and 45 minutes would have been better.",Shazam!

We have a movie with a sorcerer, a bad guy and seven demons helping him and off-course a superhero.
The special effects are good, the storyline is stupid and is lacking any suspense.
The only funny thing is that this superhero is more interested in selling selfies for money although he has the ability to empty an ATM completely without any setback.

I can honestly say it was a fun movie, but I just don't see where the glowing praise is coming from.Story-wise, it does its job without much surprise or imagination. The little drama with Billy searching for his long-lost mom, while being unable to accept companionship from others, is alright. The special FX are good, but there aren't any mindblowing scenes (no real fighting or magic other than smoke and lightning). I didn't mind the villain being one-note, but I wish they did something better than the old ""7 deadly sins,"" or at the very least been more creative with the designs (which look like clay concept models of generic gargoyles and you couldn't even tell which sin was which).Maybe I'm just cynical, but I didn't find it very funny. Sure I had a few smirks and chuckles now and then, but there wasn't anything roaringly hilarious. If the trailers didn't exactly make you LOL, then you'd probably won't within the full movie. The comparisons to a kid-friendly Deadpool are apt, but without the wackiness that ""seals the deal"" as most of the jokes are simple/cheesy/cheap (At the very beginning, Billy steals a cop's lunch bag while he pleads against it. Later on he uses his adult form to buy beer and visit a strip club like every teenage boy's wishes. That's pretty much the bar of humor throughout, besides the numerous ""Look what I can do!"" moments of discovery for the powers.)There's a large disconnect between the ever-brooding Billy and the upbeat Shazam, almost like a reverse Jekyll/Hyde. I'd be pretty stoked too if I suddenly gained superpowers, but neither character is a natural extension. And except for Freddy, everyone is entirely one-dimensional and stereotypical: overly enthusiastic foster parents, the tech-wizard gamer Asian, the sweet 16-type daughter going off to college, bullies, etc. Billy has probably less than 10 minutes shown interacting with the fosters that him eventually accepting them as family is a giant, unsatisfying leap.Overall, it's highly forgettable, but kids will enjoy it, assuming they won't be affected by the CG monsters.",Shazam!
473,lhbaker-28783,Ugh,4,24 May 2021,"Honestly this could have been a 6. Overall it was pretty funny although the action and CGI sucked. What makes me rate Shazam a 4 is the final battle. It was so cringe and cliche I could have thrown up. Stay away from this movie. If your absolutely keen on watching a DC movie watch their one success: The Dark Knight trilogy. And maybe Joker, I haven't watched it yet.",Shazam!
474,tolunayd22,The children's film was as good but the last scene was too long and ridiculous!,6,21 April 2019,A superhero movie dedicated to funny and fun kids. I found the last scene too long and unreasonable. At some point in the movie there were logic errors. Visual effects were very good. The dialogue was very successful. And there were a few details we didn't see in most superhero movies. Acting was a success. Script can handle. The average superhero movie.⭐ 100/64,Shazam!
475,carlo_simone18,Enjoyable and entertaining,7,7 April 2019,"Shazam! is easily the DCEU's most light-hearted film to date and that helps to make it as enjoyable as it is. I really enjoyed David F.Sandberg's direction, which incorporates a lot of interesting shots, as well as the darker elements he brings in. Zachary Levi is superb as Shazam, and he delivers exceptionally well on a lot of the comedic elements. Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer were perfectly fine, but didn't do much for me otherwise with their performances.The story is also quite engaging, with it having the emotional centre focused on the foster family that Billy becomes a part of, which delivers a fair few heartwarming moments.I do have some minor issues, with the main one being that Billy Batson and Shazam don't feel like the same person at all really. A lot of Shazam's dialogue and actions didn't really feel like something Billy would say or do, so that was a little distracting.Also the film is a lot darker and more serious than the trailers made it out to be. Whilst it has some great meta moments where it makes fun of traits in superhero films, it mixes in a lot of darker subject material, which doesn't blend well tonally.Mark Strong's Thaddeus Sivana was also not hugely compelling as the main antagonist. Strong is decent with his performance, but his motivations for his actions could have been fleshed out a little more.Nonetheless, this was an enjoyable time at the cinema and certainly a step in the right direction for the DCEU.",Shazam!
476,JasonBelle,Superhero? MUCH more like a horror movie.,3,15 April 2019,"This is more like a horror movie than anything else. It's one of those odd, comedic, stupid horror movies, but there were tears in the audience and there will be nightmares to come. I'll grant it this much: the ending was nice and touching enough to allow a barely acceptable feeling inside upon departure. That said, the majority of the movie was simply horrific. Villain bullied for no apparent reason by his father, who he later murders. Hero separated painfully from a seemingly loving mother, who many years later admits to his face that she left him there intentionally and wanted nothing to do with him.",Shazam!
477,bogdanbalostin,It's a great movie but something is off,8,5 June 2019,"The trailer was way more funnier and well-putt together compared to the movie. It's to date the best movie in the DC Universe (I was totally unimpressed with Wonder Woman and Aquaman which I find them to be generic superhero movie, I also didn't get all the hype regarding Black Panther, truth be told but I digress).What we have?Billy adult, Billy Kid, pretty amazing, I don't say it couldn't have been better but it works great on screen. And hey, it's the most believable superhero to date. Even at 30 years old, I'd do the same thing Billy would do if I got superpowers.Personal drama. I didn't like how to movie started with the villain, it felt forced and also his whole story is not so believable. On the other hand, Billy is going through phases from really funny to really dark and not in a consistent flow. It's something really subtle that gives that something is off vibe.It's not boring (I get bored at generic superhero movies), it's a great movie, but it's not so light-hearted as the trailer promised.

I was especially excited to see what appeared would be a well developed villain. Unfortunately, it all fell apart in the second half. As soon as the first fight happens the rest of the film is just the bad guy punching the good guy because he wants more power.

Big surprise for the Shazam family eventually.The only lack of this movie is Asher Angel is not Zachary Levi. I would say it is wrong casting for Angel. Billy Batson and Shazam are supposed to be 100% same person, and they are not. Billy is so serious while Shazam is so relax and funny. I don't know if Angel is not well directed. Do comparison to Jack Dylan Grazer (Freddy) and Adam Brody (Freddy Shazam), they did the matching well.Keep up DCEU!",Shazam!
481,zeionara,Yet another superman,7,3 April 2019,"A movie is not significantly different from what we've seen earlier in that category, however, there are some points to notice which could be reviewed as advantages: the picture is mostly not just a set of well-known stamps as Aquaman was; there is in some degree original and interesting plot with few unpredictable occasions; the visual effects have been made nice enough. Simultaneously we haven't got new ideas expressed with creative view of director; film leaves a viewer with feeling that story is not finished (precisely story, not the idea which might be given to viewer for expanding further); some parts of graphical design might be better. In the whole what we've got is a definitely watchable fun picture which, in the same time, could be declined by one who is not a big fan of this kind of cinematography and commonly searching for something unusual and eccentric.",Shazam!

485,ShitizSays,DC can never be as good as Marvel.,4,10 July 2019,"So they tried a little bit of Marvel here.
No more Dark setup and little bit more of comedy, but it didn't work for me.
First fifteen minutes you don't know what is happening because the scenes are badly joined and none of the characters are introduced properly.
You don't understand what is happening till you reach half the film.
The film moves very fast.
I guess they were under pressure to make an entertaining film.
The kid who turns into Shazam is basically an arrogant kid who does not like anybody and the entire world bores him.
But the moment he becomes Shazam, he becomes funny and intolerably talkative.
I didn't understand the personality change.
In the film, there are no other people except Shazam and the people around him.
No one cares that there is a freak with superpowers roaming around the city.
The screenplay is badly written and there are scenes which doesn't lead to anything.
For example, there is a scene where Billy (the kid Shazam) and Freddy, his foster brother, are recording videos to see what Superpowers does he have and later upload it on YouTube getting millions of views.
After that it is not even shown what happened to it. No one cared I guess.
There is no police involved and no media. The general public is also takes this weird costume wearing superhero for granted.
The film is a collection of badly written scenes joined together.
One thing happens after another.
Shazam doing a public display of his powers and accidentally punctures a bus.
The bus is about to fall down but he saves it.
The moment he saves it, the villain appears. Then there is a fight between the two. the villain then kidnaps Freddy. Shazam comes to save him and gets beaten up... blah blah.
I mean how convenient plotting is that.
The film is supposed to be comedy but there is not a single scene where I even smiled, let alone laughing.
Good attempt but I think they have to try harder next time.",Shazam!

It was a good superhero movie, but it earned it's PG-13 rating. Billy is a kid struggling to find his place in the world and in his new foster home. Add to that super powers that could be used for good or evil and you have a super hero origin and adventure story. We're big Zachary Levi fans and really enjoyed this movie. But we were disappointed with the advertising. There was a lot more cussing than in your typical DC super hero movie (yes- this is DC), the villain is very dark, and there were plenty of scenes that might disturb younger kids.

A call back to the classic, somewhat cheesy, superhero movies of the 70s and 80s, Shazam! is relentless in its ability to put a smile on your face. There are sequences within the movie that one cannot not smile! However, it does not fall into the common Marvel trope of not getting serious when it needs to. Shazam! brings a darker side to it as well, and this dark side only raises the stakes, and it also packs an emotional punch as well as it delivers its heart-warming message about family and those who truly care about you. Shazam! does this all by marvelous performances by its two leads Levi and Dylan-Grazer. Shazam! may be predictable, but that is part of the beauty it. It reminds us why the classic hero arc is something we all love.",Shazam!

That said, I believe the people who made this movie put in a descent effort and provided pretty good special effects. But don't expect any serious edge or interesting plot lines.One issue for me was how the character Shazam! was portrayed by actor Zachory Levi. Shazam acted more like a child than the teen Billy Batson. When a superhero acts like an eight-year-old, it's a problem for me- it's distracting and cringe worthy at times.If you want to watch a better take on Shazam, I recommend the short animated movie: ""Superman - Shazam! The Return of the Black Atom."" The film was too brief, but it still represents a better portrayal of Shazam and Billy Batson.",Shazam!

1)When learned, Sandberg is the director (Annabelle's creator), I realised why I didn't feel It was comedy.... Of course, it was funny in a lot of scenes, but it doesn't make you laugh out loud. It mostly makes you feel excited and worried about Billie's destiny. The weird sense didn't let me go. Now i know why.
2)Guys, you could really do more. You have a creativity to invent interesting superheroes, but you didn't use their potential in this movie. We could have seen here much more!

500,jakebirkel,The future is bright for the DCEU with chapters like these!,9,27 March 2019,"I got to see an early screening of Shazam! at my local theater, and boy did it not disappoint. It's not flawless, but the good outweighs the bad more often than not. With a bright story, boundless energy, and an irresistible sense of fun, this is certainly one of the best-if not the best-installment of the DCEU so far.Direction: I feel like David Samberg is the DCEU's Taika Waititi. He's this movie director that really isn't known for much past some horror, which made him an initially odd choice for this movie; a choice that paid off tremendously. He helps some light shine into this world, but doesn't underplay the action. His direction and coordination through framing helps us laugh and, in some cases, feel the punches. The action isn't jolty like the other DCEU installments and due to the bright vibrant colors, we really know what's happening, where it's happening, and who it's happening to. Well done.The writing was uneven, but definitely fun. It's a basic story that converts Billy Batson's origin into a modern-day retelling with some elements of Big in there. The humor is well-timed and consistently funny; a lot of meta jokes and inner humor help the story obtain its brighter feel. The relationships written in are heartfelt and the story itself has a lot of heart. One part that causes a rift is the central character of Billy. His two versions, between the adult and the kid, seem to be two completely different people. It's an inconsistency that's fine being just about the only part (besides typical villain problems) that bugs you about the writing.Performances: I swear, Zachary Levi was born to play Shazam! He carries childlike enthusiasm and a heart in effortlessly. He oozes charisma and really... I won't be able to say it enough so here it is: Zachary Levi is perfection. The rest... Kid Billy was somewhat toned down but still played quite nicely. Mark Strong played a menacing villain. The child actors, especially Jack Dylan Fraiser (Grazer? I'm sorry I don't remember off the top of my head), were VERY good. Child actors really are improving. Any other supporting performance was played nicely and everyone knew who the real star of the movie was: I'm sorry, I'm gonna keep coming back to this: Zachary Levi is a national treasure.What else... music was nice and heartfelt, I talked about the action sequences... every other part of this film is mainly there to add to Billy's story and I like it. The world is undeniably fun and we're not really pulled out of it.The future is bright for the DCEU with chapters like Shazam! (9/10)",Shazam!

503,pokedom,DC's comeback starts right now,7,6 April 2019,"I have been heavily critical of DCEU movies since BvS. No one defends BvS anymore so lemme just skip ahead to the present day. I walked into Shazam expecting Aquaman 2. I got something so, so much better. Shazam is a good superhero movie to add to the ever growing batch of good superhero movies.Please note that while I did generally enjoy this movie, I did find things to criticize that were indeed a hindrance to my movie going experience. I'll list the positives first, then I'll get into honest criticisms that don't paint me like some Marvel fanboy or some superhero fatigue'd fool. I'm not either of those things - I just like good movies. DC made a good movie. Get off my back.* There's some really funny stuff in this movie. So much humor is actually well written and funny. People call this movie like Big but with superpowers, and that's not entirely false.* There are actually jokes and fun things in the background of scenes! Too often we see films using the empty spaces of shots as just a way to throw in advertisements. There are multiple times where I caught something funny behind the main point of action in shots, and those are always the most satisfying moments in all of film.* Zachary Levi does a great job as Shazam, he really nails the role of an adolescent trapped in a grown dude's body. All of his mannerisms and even small things like the way he talks, it feels like he was perfectly cast.* The journey of Shazam learning to become a hero was very engaging. I love how he just wants to show off how cool he is instead of learning how to help people, that's exactly what anyone with these god-given powers would do and you know it.* I really enjoyed the themes of family and how it's so important, without it being shoved in your face the whole movie. The themes of how power is a dangerous substance in the wrong hands or the unknowing hands is also pretty interesting to observe throughout the runtime.* The color pallet was very appealing. Most of the cool stuff is at night but it still looks great, everything pops out to the eye. Bright costumes really help as well.* Even though I predicted the film's climax perfectly within the first half hour of the movie, that didn't ruin how cool the climax was for me. It's a pretty good action scene, I wish it had a little more style to it but I liked it overall.* Without the backstory, the villain is awesome. His costume is very cool looking, and he sicks the seven deadly sins on people! That's so evil!Negatives now.* The villain including the backstory and context is trash. He's just a bratty manchild who wants something only for the reason someone said ""no"" to him as a kid. What was he even going to do with the power of Shazam? He never explains his motives other than ""I was a good boy (except when I was in front of him but I'm just going to act like I've always been an angel) and he said no... I'll show him..."" I guess he's corrupted by the sins into wanting it? Doesn't show that much.* This movie needed more of a look to it. The color pallet is nice, but the cinematography was fairly flat and at times the editing was extremely and noticeably poor. The YouTube montage was so poorly edited it kinda hurt me. Like, even I, a guy with primarily WeVideo experience, could have done better here.* Music was either another selection of pop music a la Suicide Squad or boring and forgettable score. If Shazam had theme music on the level of Doctor Strange, which isn't even that hard of a level to hit mind you, I'd love it more.* Child actors! Oh do I love kids who can't act convincingly when in mortal peril. Hey at least the gamer kid's Hadoken reference later in the movie made sense, pity points for a good chuckle (even though it wasn't even him saying it, but it was the same character so it kinda counts). Everyone else was pretty bad.* Shazam does the floss. Instant -1 star.TL;DR: So the DCEU did finally knock one pretty far into the infield. However they've still got a ways to go before I can claim it's a home run. I will admit that they don't even have to hit the ball much harder to get there, everything they need is finally here and all they really need more of is style. I will likely see this again very soon.",Shazam!
504,markj-02556,SHAMAZING,8,12 April 2019,"Shazam! Is a delightful romp that stands as a template for what all Hollywood blockbusters should be like. David F. Sandberg directs this film with inventive camera angles and movements highly influenced by his horror background.Zachery Levis performance as the titular Shazam is perfect and career defining, I had a wide grin on my face every time he was on screen and so did everyone else. Levi is supported by an excellent cast with all members of his foster family being superb, especially the dad played by Anderson Cooper, who delivers a warm and overpoweringly charming performance. Mark Strong's supervillain is on the right side of cheesy as well, so what could possibly be bad about the film. Well, the films final battle highlights one of my biggest annoyances in cinema. It is where characters involved in a battle stop to say a line, maybe exposition or in this case gag, after gag, after gag. Just get on with the fight do the gags before or after, or not at all.Shazam! Is excellent from start to finish for all ages, everyone in the cinema was laughing and everyone left with a smile on their face.

Heads bitten off and some really funny jokes in there without feeling rushed or slow. First DC movie in a long time where there wasn't at least a minute stretch of me wanting to fall asleep.

I haven't read the comic book but I was compelled and intrigued by billy Batson from scene one when he locks the cops in the porn shop. We are instantly drawn in to this troubled rascal and his unfortunate family to family upbringing. Asher Angel and Zachary Levi bring Bill to life and Zachary really does give the illusion of a child in a grown mans body. Jack Dylan Grazer plays Freddy Billys unofficial sidekick and superhero knowledge geek and he gives us a reason to name one decent sidekick!!! When Billy first moved in with his bizarre new foster family i get nostalgic feelings of watch Home Alone the original. The train stopping at the lair is also shades of Harry Potter. But Shazam is its own thing in the wizard world and doesn't take itself too serious and why should it, it's a superhero with wizard powers after all. Mark Strong also does a reasonable effort as the super villian. The character reminds me of bullseye from Daredevil. The child whom is sick of being told he isn't good enough and lashes out at society. He will envy everyone and everything. From a cinematic perspective I partically liked the scenes shot in the Lair and the foster home the sets were neat.",Shazam!
515,ksharath1999,More fun less action formula proves fruitful,7,4 August 2021,"The movie follows the adventures of 15 year old kid, Billy Batson who has turned into SHAZAM a powerful superhero. He is forced to face Dr Thaddeus Sivanna and much more evil before he could realise his true potential.Starting with performance,Zachary Levi has nailed as Shazam. His timing of expressions during humor sequences are mind-blowing and he never fails to amaze us till the end. Asher Angel who plays Billy Batson too has done well all the scenes he performed especially his emotional sequences are lit. Dr Thaddeus Sivanna has an excellent development with a well defined childhood and a much serious adulthood. He turns to be a stylish villain than a serious one. His getup with the cool sunglass and the stylish coat is really glamorous. All the other members of the foster family too has done their part in the movie especially Jack Dylan and Faithe Herman are worth a mention.SHAZAM! Redefines the concept of superhero movies. Shazam is something much different from usual superhero movies. The movies tone almost felt similar to Home Alone movie's tone. The movie is built on more fun less action formula. The movie is filled with hilarious sequences which has the potential to make the audience burst out of laughter. But to be exactly precise there is no forced comedy in this flick,all the humorous scenes are situational. The movie has some suprise waiting for the audience in the very end which are worth goosebumps. The movie can only be criticised on terms on its lack of good cgi in the climax fight. Still it felt an ok sequence. The movie needs to be applauded for its Rock Of Eternity which is really beautiful and exotic place to watch.On the whole David Sandberg's SHAZAM! Is worth a watch flick and the movie is a revolutionary attempt which might redefine superhero movies in the near future.Rating:72%",Shazam!

S H A ZZZZZ A M !!!!,7,10 November 2021,"It was ok, the movie is drastically different from other stand alone superhero movies, it is a kid that becomes a grownup superhero every time he says Shazam! It's rated 9+ It makes sense bacheé the movie is just simply childish, but in a ok way, it does not have a lot of action but it does have some fun humor, it's kinda disappointing for the people that wanted the more serious Shazam we have seen in the comics but it's whatever, I think some of the seriousness the movie had was just overwhelmed by all the humor, with some changes it could have been better, but generally a pretty different and fun superhero movie that is also suited for most kids, so a good fun movie you can watch with family as well.",Shazam!

Its truely lifeless. Thing is the character background has been done before, and better too but not in this movie.SFX, it was average, it was weird but you could see the parts of the movie that were CGI, it was low-budget taste.Shazam himself is somewhere between Spiderman-Superman-Batman, all the guys he laughs at while being worst than himself. It was truely an odd duck this movie. You know what they set out to do, a Kick-Ass style parody that both conveys a new direction for the superhero cliche while keeping the satire fresh.
Shazam's direction is that of fast food stuff, they removed all the parts that could have transported us to some genuine emotions instead gave us a short-cut-straight-to-your-emotions kitsch. It gives you the feeling that hasnt earned its humour by being not funny, that was a funny phrasing, and it hasnt earned its agency by being not serious at all.3/10 for curiosity and being bored so had to suffer through it.",Shazam!

Is another great hit for DCEU MOVIES I knew this was going to be good and no way it was going to be terrible. The best parts of this movie are it's drama and Comedy. The story is one I remember the story from the justice league show of the early 2000s and also Young justice Show and this movie was great I went to this movie with a Great Friend of mine and he was surprised that this movie was not only jokes but for the story's drama,is great having the protagonist (Billy Baston)a foster kid who still searches for his mother. In which you feel sympathetic for him. I do love the jokes in this movie making fun of this Dark time of superhero films(Marvel's Avengers: infinity war).The drama is profound having to live with other people who are not related by blood to you but are still family to you and this is what the message of this movie is Family and staying with them even though you're not related by blood but they are your family.",Shazam!
520,zanghi_james,"Great fun, but with some surprisingly dark moments!",4,11 January 2020,"The latest official film in the DC Extended Cinematic Universe does not disappoint and I really enjoyed it. The Comedy held up to the expectations raised by the trailers for Shazam, which mainly show-cased it was much more humorous than anything DC had done since Batman Begins. However, it doesn't skimp on the drama, either. There's some good family drama at the group home and the opening scene with young Thaddeus Sivana being rejected by both his father and the Wizard is chilling. Also, the scene with Billy's mom is pretty well-done.The music is not bad, also, but nothing memorable in comparison to Zimmer and Junkie XL's themes from the earlier DCEU films and Aquaman by Rupert Gregson-Williams.I loved the looks of the Seven Deadly Sins, They were quite creepy and gave the film some good darkness.The fight scenes are not as impressive as Man of Steel, though the special effects were pretty good. I did like how in the final fight between Shazam and Sivana they did far less collateral damage than Superman and Zod's iconic fight from Man of Steel. They also didn't seem as fluid here and there than the action scenes in most of the other DCEU films. Despite the less-impressive feel, they were quite entertaining.All in all, this was a good film. It evokes imagery here and there of Harry Potter and the Wizarding World, as well, which I think is appropriate since Magic plays a primary role in this film. Also, I think it's pretty impressive since this film was done by a director who is best known for creepy horror films. I hope that David F. Sandberg directs the sequel. Also, can't wait for Black Adam with Dwayne Johnson!(Plus, anybody notice who played Sivana's father? Lionel Luthor from Smallville! Nice casting choice there!)",Shazam!

You want to see a good kid's movie, watch any Harry Potter movie not Shazam. It was long, boring, and trite. Think 'power ranger' cheesy. I suppose if you have a ten year old that is a Shazam fan in the house, it might be worth a watch, otherwise, save your money.",Shazam!
523,HorrorFan6969,"Shazam is perfect superhero for everyone, the reason i prefer DC !",9,13 April 2019,"Action, humor and heart with a positive message make this big screen adventure entertaining for most family members. Only some intense scenes, language and suggestive material are inappropriate for young children. Zachary Levi is this film's best asset, with his brilliant portrayal of a teen trapped in an adult body. One minute he is in shock and awe at his powers and the next minute he's frivolously using these abilities for teen tricks. The movie slows down when Levi is not on screen. That's not to say the rest of the cast isn't good. Asher Angel delivers a believably intense Billy Batson and Jack Dylan Grazer gets the most out of his sidekick role. Superhero films work best when the villain is as formidable and interesting as the hero. Mark Strong may not be the most interesting or even the ""strongest"" of villains, but he is powerful enough to keep things menacing and his Dr. Sivana is driven by past failings - a bad guy with reasons beyond just wanting to rule the world. Also threatening, but in a good way, is Djimon Hounsou as The Wizard. He towers over Billy as he tries to give the teen powers to defeat evil. Director David F. Sandberg (""Annabelle: Creation"") fills the screen with jokes and sight gags while advancing Henry Gayden's predictable screenplay (from a story by Gayden and Darren Lemke). The uneven special effects range from astounding to cheesy, but far outshine the television series with the same name from 1974. There are a few surprises along the way - some involving Batson and his foster family, but no spoilers given away here. Stay through the end credits for sure. With just one word, ""Shazam!"" becomes a winner for the DC Extended Universe.",Shazam!
524,sagniknath,"Finally, a popcorn movie that actually is ""about family""",7,7 April 2019,"This is probably the 2nd best DCEU movie we have right now , after Wonder Woman. The film certainly knew its limits and the premise it was given , and didn't unnecessarily up the stakes just for a super spectacular showdown. In fact, towards the 3rd act, it sort of lightly parodies the chaos and frenzy that was Man Of Steel.Given that the protagonist starts out as a foster boy trying to search for his mother he got separated from, it was fitting that the core of the film was about finding family and bonding with your siblings. Their is good chemistry developed among the foster kids although some of the scenes still were corny. The child actors were refreshingly competent, in the sense that a lot of the new ones they bring in movies these days are just so bad at acting. The main kid was pretty alright himself and gave his character a lot of credibility.The third act was very reminiscent of the 90s kids movies. I was getting a lot of Jumanji (the Robin Williams one) vibes for some reason.My main complaint is that they went exposition heavy at some places , which took away the general flow. They could have easily supplanted that with scenes depicting the action and giving enough visual clues to the audience to indicate what is going on. Also the demons that Shazam fights vary in their effectiveness to entertain the audience. At times, they appear menacing and violent, ready to draw fear from us. But at other times they engage in cliched CGI slapstick as in Age OF Ultron or Justice League.But overall,a great movie to help keep off any worries and relax for two hours.",Shazam!

The music is boring, doesn't feel like you're watching a superhero flick. The humorous moments are forced on you, which will only make you cringe and not laugh. The storyline is bizarre, doesn't develop any kind of interest. The villain is the worse, just wants power, why? Intentions? Is he sane ? Crazy? Zero aspects of a villain.

528,WillsFilms,Shazam is as cool as he thinks he is!,8,18 April 2019,"Shazam! was awesome! The film gives us an interesting and relatable protagonist in the form of Billy Batson, a foster child searching for his mother. His reaction to gaining superpowers is how we'd all react to gaining superpowers; we'd be extremely excited and thrilled to see what we could do, instead of just going off to save some people. Mark Strong also delivers a great performance as the villain, the best one in the DCEU. His backstory is relatable and makes his actions almost justifiable. The film also has fantastic comedy, it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. Every joke came at the right time and felt natural instead of forced. The film is over two hours long and if I had one complaint, the climax goes on for a bit too long and just when you think that the final confrontation's all over, it starts again. But other than that, Shazam! is an entertaining movie with funny dialogue, great writing and a touching message about family.",Shazam!

I don't think I've laughed so much, aah'd so much, and cheered out loud so much throughout a movie. That, in of itself, is worthy of this 10-star review. Brilliant directing, acting--especially by Zachary Levi, as the titular character--and all the child actors...Kudos all around! There is so much heart in the movie that it kept the light and dark elements in check. (So, I'm sure it disappointed some viewers who wanted it to go to the extremes in CGI, action, evilness, etc.) But the film stands solidly on a crisp dialogue, depiction of friendship, family love, and the journey of a child learning to become a hero, while maintaining a child-like innocence throughout. This will become a classic and is great for the whole family! Fans of ""This is Us"" and ""Fresh off the Boat"" will see some familiar faces.Lastly, sorry to hear some people did't like this movie, but everyone is entitled to their opinions. Don't go expecting to see the typical flashy, over-the-top superhero movie. This is a fun, heart-warming spectacle that leaves you feeling good long after.",Shazam!

532,CinematicGarbage,Best of DCEU and one of the funniest superhero movies I've ever seen!,6,27 April 2019,"Shazam! is the lastest accomplishment of DC Extended Universe. It was quite thrilling when I saw it for the first time at the cinema!
Shazam! starred Zachary Levi as Captain Marvel/Shazam, Asher Angel as Billy Batson, Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy Freeman, Mark Strong as Dr. Thaddeus Sivana and Djimon Housou as the Shazam Wizard. I love how they act in here. Zachary Levi took an outstanding lead of the movie and he could prove that he was born to play this character. Next is Mark Strong as Doctor Sivana, he was well-acted being a badass supervillain trying to take Shazam's powers. He was filled with anger and did some violence like punching Shazam high and attacked him roughly. I could see Shazam bleeded his nose.
The story was like....not bad: a kid trying to find his real mother and ended up in a cave just to say the word Shazam! and turn into Shazam. Shazam set out to save the world but he only took selfies and did tricks which didn't impress Freddy much. I didn't criticize the plot that much. I could only give it 8/10.
The movie was unforgettable with really EPIC fight scenes between Shazam and Sivana or when the whole family (except the parents) say ""Shazam"" and all turned into superheros with different strength and fought the seven monsters. The CGI was ""okay!"". I wasn't impressed with the monsters, they kinda looked like Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars Episode IV in 1997 Edition. The movie got some good scares in here. I jumped twice in terror. The sound was quite loud so it was really possible that anyone could jump.
The other scenes were really funny and some made me cry like when Billy's real mother doesn't want to raise him anymore. The funny scenes gave a high laugh factor. They were also really unforgettable like when Shazam told his siblings to say his name and they said ""BILLY!"" or when there was a car crash at the beginning, the music made the accident hilarious!
I really love the references they did like Freddy wearing T-Shirts with Wonder Woman and Aquaman symbol, a Batman batarang and a Superman bullet. Also in the end, we could see Superman invited by Shazam to his school. I also loved the end and mid credits, Sivana being in prison trying to make his way to the cave and heard Mister Mind talking and Shazam talking to fish. They were really unforgettable.
Shazam! was one of 2019's greatest movies I have ever seen. I gave it a 8.9/10. The movie was great, better than Wonder Woman and probably the funniest of all DC movies.",Shazam!

Super hero movies are supposed to inspire a new generation just like batman and super man did for me in theb90s early 2000s and I think shazam has captured that perfectly.It's not a dark movie and it is aimed at family's but look at marvel, they are currently the top dogs so I am glad DC have taken a snippet from them and finally relaxed and found somthing they are good at.Praying for a batman cameo in the next, the last 30 seconds had me so excited when super man shows up!!!!!Great family movie but most of all great super hero movie.",Shazam!

Shazam was originally suppose to be a superhero similar to superman. Not some awkward buffoon like The Greatest American Hero. Not even suppose to be a parody. Always when movie makers turn some show that isn't known to be funny into one, is when they ruin it for everyone to enjoy.

But Zachary Levi (I miss ""Chuck""..) is no Ryan Reynolds (or Tom Hanks). The greatest superhero of the production has to be Mark Strong's agent who still somehow manages to convince Hollywood that his client is worth hiring.The good: depiction of the foster home and the child actors. Best of them, in my opinion, was the diminutive, adorable Faithe Herman (from TV's ""This Is Us""). Some of the comedic scenes work nicely enough. And there is a great scene between a boy and his long lost mother, which seems more real than the rest of the picture. Other than that, the themes of family, standing your ground etc. take second seat to the action and comedy.""Shazam!"" is a calculatingly passable family distraction with unsurprising problems: in one scene a horrific mass murder takes place, but not a single drop of blood is anywhere to be seen. This is just lying to kids. And the end resolve takes way too long.

First I want to emphasize that for the first time, in a superhero movie, we were all WOMEN at the cinema, something I never thought would happen, and I really liked it because the genre does not matter, DC always makes movies for everyone. We laugh, we were thrilled and surprised. At the end of the movie, we were still talking and commenting on this movie.
David F. Sandberg made his best film, he is one of the best directors and he would love to continue directing many DC movies, Zachary Levi as Shazam is the heart of the whole movie, he was born to play Shazam, the Shazam Family loved it, Those SCENES were wonderful. And Mark Strong as Dr.Sivana EXCELLENT, a brilliant performance and one of DC's best villains.
There is a scene that is the most important for Billy Batson that made me cry and reflect a lot, few times a scene reaches my heart. And seeing scenes EQUAL to the comic made me get a smile. The FINAL scene is the SURPRISE and my favorite scene of the whole movie. This is the movie that in years will be the classic that we will see every Christmas with our families and friends, the most inspiring film, with a heart and a beautiful final message. The best superhero movie and the best comedy of the year. Shazam is LOVE and INSPIRATION.",Shazam!

547,Brantford_Mark,A Christmas/Superhero Mashup Chock Full of Good Family Values,8,5 December 2020,"If you're looking for a dark, brooding superhero movie, look elsewhere. This is a charmingly funny family adventure film targeted at the age 10-14 set that takes place at Christmas time in Philadelphia. It's apparently DC's origin story cornerstone for the 1940's comic book character Shazam. Essentially, the title character is chosen by an ancient wizard to become the vessel for his powers. All he has to do to change from an ordinary 14 year old into a buff superhero is to say the Name of the Champion, ""Shazam!""The acting and writing is far above what you would expect in a Saturday Matinee type film. Although it's pitched for a younger audience, there's enough sly comic references to make it interesting for Mom and Dad too. Some genuine laugh out loud moments in this one. I particularly enjoyed the scenes where Shazam and his sidekick were trying to establish what superpowers he had. Lots of pretty impressive action sequences as well.There are many children who will see themselves reflected in this film. Isn't that really the key to this genre? Kids watching should be able to envision themselves as righteous, powerful people. It was nice to see an ethnically diverse child cast and a physically disabled actor among them. The movie provides ample lessons about the importance of family and the power of words to either uplift or degrade others. Some parts that might not be appropriate for younger children though. Occurring with some frequency are scary monsters doing violent things, adults/children in mortal danger, and some language that'll get your mouth washed out with soap.I was very surprised at the production values in this movie. Nothing was done on the cheap here. Its special effects equal nearly any other superhero flick I can think of. Clearly, DC sees this as the start of a new film franchise for them. If you watch all of the end titles, there's a strong video hint inserted there that a sequel is coming in short order.",Shazam!

551,pinemaples,"If Wonder Woman, Aquaman, and Shazam were all strikes, would this be a turkey? (/bowling)",8,28 March 2019,"We all know that DC got off to a bumpy start with its cinematic attempts, beginning with Man of Steel. Wonder Woman was the first movie we can all agree on being actually good, and after Justice League dropped the ball for many people, Aquaman was more or less able to pick it back up and keep running. I don't really know where else to take this sports metaphor, but Shazam is pretty awesome.
While I am a big DC Comics fan, I didn't know much about Shazam going in, so roughly 90% of the story here was all new to me. Shazam was formerly known as Captain Marvel, but this was changed a few years back for obvious reasons. (Speaking of which, fun fact: In a wild coincidence, Djimon Hounsou was in this movie, in the MCU's Captain Marvel, AND in Aquaman.) The character of Shazam has had a few different origin stories over the years. For this movie, Henry Gayden and Darren Lemke adapted the story from the New 52 version, where protagonist Billy Batson is an orphan, bouncing around from foster home to foster home before being summoned by an old wizard who gives him the ability to turn into a superhero by saying the word ""Shazam!"" Director David F. Sandberg and the aforementioned writers are well aware of how silly and dated many parts of this concept are, and wisely play a lot of it for laughs. For the most part, this works REALLY well. A good portion of this story is Billy figuring out what exactly his powers are, with a couple really fun montages that reminded me of Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man movie.
Asher Angel and Zachary Levi portray both sides of Billy Batson smoothly, despite Zac being in a padded suit the whole time (you get used to it, though he did actually do quite a bit of working out to prepare for the role to be fair). The only big thing Asher's really been in before was Andi Mack, which I've never watched, but he was an awesome lead actor and can definitely carry a movie by himself. I have to confess that I'm a big fan of Chuck, that TV show from about 10 years back, so I'm very biased, but I've always found Zac Levi to be a lot of fun to watch. I won't say much about his character, because I didn't even know he was in this move before I saw it, but I will always argue that Mark Strong can do no wrong, even if his character isn't quite used to his fullest potential. It was also fun to see Smallville's Lionel Luther himself, John Glover, playing basically the same role I grew up seeing him in. All these names aside, my favorite actor in this movie was also one of my favorites in the 2017 adaptation of Stephen King's It, Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy Freeman. I really, really hope this kid keeps up this career because he's absolutely killing it right now.
I mentioned that this movie is funny, and it really is, full of both self-referential and self-deprecating humor, but it also knows when to dial it back a bit to hit you right in the feels. Billy isn't the obvious choice for a kid to get superpowers; he's selfish and untrusting, and quite a bit of a jerk through most of the movie, and because of this, he learns some hard lessons. But to say any more would be saying too much, so I'll leave it there. I'd be dishonest if I didn't mention this, but most of the last 20 minutes or so just felt like they needed just a bit more time to smooth out the writing because it really dipped in quality to me. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good as it should've been, and wasn't near where the movie was leading up to it. It was like they tried to do too much in this last bit, and as a result they left it feeling pretty thin. The VERY end, though, was absolutely perfect, and mostly makes up for it.
That said, the vast majority of the movie is a blast, and it'll fit nicely on my shelf next to Wonder Woman and Aquaman. Also, remember to stay after the credits for two more scenes. I don't want to say DC's planning something big, but it's looking like there's more to come, and I'm completely onboard.Side note - not to be that person, but... I loved Justice League. Although, Steppenwolf was a terrible choice for a villain, I'll admit.",Shazam!
552,hasansevik,Very good watching it again,8,22 January 2020,"Admittedly, it's easy to walk out of a cinema and be on a false high about a movie you've just watched. It's when you leave it alone for a few months and come back to it that you get a real sense of it's quality (Avengers Endgame is a great example of huge hype but not much substance when rewatching it).Shazam actually holds up. And that's not being condescending in any way. Since Man Of Steel, DC has struggled to make a decent movie (BvS sucked, as did JL, and WW was acceptable but acceptable is actually not acceptable given the standards of her full origin story).This movie isn't just a comedy take on a superhero. Nor is it so dark and serious that it skips beyond character development. Shazam has a bit of everything. And, given he is one of the oldest DC characters, it's quite an achievement to pull this off, especially in a world where Shazam has been largely forgotten and overtaken by Batman, Superman, The Flash, The Green Arrow, Wonder Woman and those Marvel heroes.DC needs to take over from WB and rewrite their movies, potentially to include (rather than preclude) those that they have said are stand alone projects like Joker and The Batman (2021). Shazam can easily jump into these worlds, as the movie isn't too fantasy driven that it makes it silly, yet isn't too dark and serious to make it miserable. With the delays in making the stand alone Flash movie, one way to achieve this would be to have The Flash cause his now infamous Flashpoint Paradox, undo the damage of the aforementioned DC movies that failed so thoroughly, and start afresh with Shazam and The Flash leading the way.I hope (with all my fingers and toes crossed) that DC can learn from this teachable moment - as Lex Luthor might quip.",Shazam!
553,devojonesy1977,7.5 ? Really??,5,14 May 2019,"It's laughable reading the ratings for this film. I honestly DO BELIEVE that some reviewers are genuinely being paid for these ratings, because there was no way that if anyone were reviewing this film honestly would have given it anything over a 7 rating.
Now don't get me wrong, I expected silliness from the trailers, however I did expect it to be funny! With a superhero formula there were a million ways to have made this film entertaining and humorous, but it was neither. It was made for the kids and that's ok.
As someone mentioned earlier, this REALLY could have been a movie made strictly for Nickelodeon seeing at how this film is targeting that particular audience. Again, that's not a bad thing at all considering that it's for the kiddos. But whomever greenlighted this for a major motion picture release should be fired.
I can't see how this character will fit into the DC film catalog, but that remains to be seen.

556,chasemykleby,Shazam! is DC's most joyful and sweet movie yet!,9,7 April 2019,"""Shazam"" Review
(9/10)Shazam! is DC's most joyful and sweet movie yet! A funny yet earnest coming-of-age story about a boy who learns that, well, with great power comes great responsibility. And also rethinks what having a family is really meant for.
Shazam's carefree mood as a child, is to just have fun despite having to inevitably grow up and confront some very adult concerns along the way. Namely, how streetwise orphan Billy Batson must accept responsibility for his behavior if he's going to prove truly worthy of the magical gifts bestowed upon him. Billy is a flawed character who screws up, but it's in watching him learn from his mistakes that we grow to legitimately care about him. The film largely avoids the maudlin and manipulative when it comes to this story of a 14-year-old boy seeking answers, his way in the world, and finding the true meaning of home among a misfit foster family.
The movie nicely provides a rarely seen positive depiction of foster care, as the most recent family to take Billy in are legitimately good people who truly want the best for him. But none of it would matter if the center of the movie, its key performer, was weak; thankfully, that isn't the case here. Zachary Levi is perfect as Shazam. He's hilarious, heartwarming and completely believable as a 14-year-old boy trapped in a muscle-bound superhero's body, excelling in both the action scenes as well as in the more vulnerable moments.
This isn't an action movie per se but a coming-of-age comedy with some action in it. There are some very funny, very knowing superhero moments to be had. These are the scenes where the movie shines brightest, poking fun at all the superhero movie tropes even if nothing much of consequence happens. But once Billy/Shazam realizes he can use his powers for more than just cheap tricks, his true hero's journey begins.",Shazam!
557,nizzambaharuddin,STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR DC?,7,13 January 2020,"Hate DC films before because they're too dark and emo? Don't want heavy expositions or implications because they're ""just superhero films""? Just want to enjoy the film because they're basically make-believe? Then this film is for you. In fact, I'd say this film is for everyone. Especially the kid in you.This is a good lighthearted film. A film that's enjoyable for the whole family. It has Easter eggs, references to other superheroes, old rock songs, and new pop culture references. This film shows that you can go nuts with superhero films, without taking the R-rated route like Deadpool.So what if the villain is one-dimensional? It's a story about a kid who's chosen to be a superhero by an ancient wizard. No need to take it too seriously. And it works. Definitely recommended. Kids will definitely love this film. I can already see kids dreaming of becoming Shazam. A good fun movie for the whole family to enjoy. Have fun.",Shazam!
558,Iusedtobeacat,Mediocre,4,29 November 2019,"Well, wise man once said that even if you can write elaborately and eloquently, no matter how great your choice of words is, it doesn't matter how good your command of the language is if the plot of the story is weak your story sucks and this is exactly what this movie is. Good use of FX, good directing, good acting, however the plot just sucked.The beginning was fine, the fact that little Billy was trying to get to his mom seemed promising but as soon as we get into the superhero transformation the movie gets super dull real quick.The great wizard spends years and years trying to find a worthy hero, someone whom he's able to transfer his superpowers to, and who will use those powers for good. He never found anyone worthy, but we are expected to believe that somehow Billy is the answer? Well, it seemed quite contrived how he chose Billy to be his successor. He required everyone else to go through a test to which they all failed and that's why he never selected anyone, yet with Billy he just knew from the very moment he saw him or even before, that he is the chosen one. How?
If he was able to know that from the beginning, then why spend years looking for someone worthy? He could have waited till Billy was of age to transfer the powers to him, it would have even spared him from encountering the villain of the story who ended up releasing the 7 sins into the world.
There's no explanation given, I'm not familiar with the comics nor do I intend on reading them anytime soon, if this is a subplot then I expect it to be shown through this film but it isn't.
Billy himself isn't even worthy of being called the chosen one, he uses his powers to drink, go into strip clubs, rob ATMS, and perform street magic shows to make people donate money to him. Yet, he's the CHOSEN one?
Yeah, right... okey.
He spends most of his time arguing with his annoying foster brother. I found Billy to be more mature before he became SHAZAM.
The villain sucks, he's a comical version of what a villian should be like and not in a good way.
I don't think I'm the intended audience, this is clearly not made for adults.",Shazam!
559,mossow92,An actual fun DC movie.,7,29 June 2019,"It goes without saying that most modern DC Universe movies tend to be on the dark and very serious side. So, this was a nice turn. Once the villain is introduced in typical DC dark fashion, the movie tilts to the lightness of youth and the chicanery that can ensue. So many light-hearted fun moments throughout. Zachary Levi is brilliant as the quick-quipping hero and embraces his child alter ego with ease. While the gaining understanding of powers and defeat of the villian seemed a little simplistic to me, overall it was just a fun, enjoyable film. The time flew by. It had laughs. It had heart. The cast had amazing charisma and chemistry. (Though the incredibly charismatic Cooper Andrews is kinda wasted in his supporting role.) While I think Batman and Superman need the gravitas, the light tone fit perfectly here. Great job by DC and a hope that they are making changes for the future thread of films in this universe.",Shazam!

The final fight scenes lacked any punch and seemed to go in circles. Shazam hardly looked like a bonafide superbeing. Kinda reminded me of Optimus prime (appearing weaker than his counterpart)....Hats off to Zachary's performance though- he was slightly let down by the poorly devised ending. PS- thought the monsters were cheap CGI and detracted from the overall look. DC are doing a lot better and Shazam destroys Captain Marvel. Two credit scenes to look out for btw",Shazam!

I'm not saying this was a better film than GOTG, although close I'm strictly stating it is better suited for a younger audience while still being enjoyable for adults).Ive tried to be fair to DC by not comparing them or holding them to the high standard set by Marvel, but when you make the worst casting decisions that fans recognize before (Ben Affleck and Jarrod Leto) before the studio and producers see it there's a problem. Not to mention these decisions were made on what should have been DC's biggest box office draws and unquestionably the most important films of the franchise ar the time. Luckily for DC there have been some glimmers of hope with movies like Man of Steel, Wonder Women and now Shazam which honestly blew me away!For fans of the latest superhero films this is a must see and certainly one of my favorites because of the lightheaded approach without losing the seriousnees needed without makint a makary of the threat the villian exposes.",Shazam!

Its not perfect by any means, but its well done and more than entertaining enough that you just dont bother to look for anything to criticize. Slightly predictable at times, but, hey, movie critics are not its target audience, the kids wil like it and parents can enjoy it too.

Yes- there is a strip club, but seen from the outside only, and they're more interested in the 10© wings, yes, they buy beer, but spit out the first sip and go buy junk food instead and yes they zap an atm, but run away empty handed and scared when money starts flying out. Send ups of adult dreams (liquor, free money and trip clubs). No big deal.
It is not Shakespeare, nor will it stand strict scrutiny by super-serious superhero fanboys n girls, but, fortunately, they are not the target audience. So take this movie for what it is, not what you think it should be, relax a little and enjoy a funny movie with a decent message about family and friends.
(And to the haters who pretend to be critics by pointing out (supposed) borrowed elements from other recent movies: guess what? those movies have too borrowed from movies past.

I really miss the mature world and story idea the Zack Snyder had built.I can't believe Aquaman and Shazam! have garnered higher praise from critics than previous DCEU movies, its a sham and a shame, so they obviously prefer simplistic storytelling with no depth, fun or real danger in superhero movies.This was such a basic story, a 15 year old boy gets superpowers and then needs to be responsible to defeat the bad guy and that's it, and in between is just filler, nothing more, kids arguing or getting bullied. Basically it's an imitation of the Spider-Man origin movies but waaaaay simpler and one dimensional, absolutely nothing in between besides kids stuff. I'm sure young children will enjoy this for that reason.It's saving grace and relief came in the form of the action scenes, i'm not saying they were anything WOW but they were a well needed relief for me from all the bland kids stuff. The budget for Shazam! is the lowest of all the DC and Marvel.C.U movies so don't expect the action sequences to be anything better or original than all of those previous movies. Its a far cry from those films.In my opinion if you want to watch a great and more fun kids action adventure with goodies and baddies then Goosebumps is so much better than this.5/10",Shazam!

Every Child cast was different on their role, liked Jack Dylan's performance as disabled foster kid and loved the uniqueness on each character.

And say hi to superman's crotch.I would say that I really looking forward this movie for a long time (yes, I do have a life) and the high score on IMDB, which is 75, makes me feel that this may be the one, the one finally can success. However, no this movie has terrible logic, terrible line, terrible storytelling skills and terrible fighting scene. All of these make me think this movie does not equal to 75 on IMDB. But yes, this movie is brighter and funnier than before. It does make me and other audiences laugh in the cinema.Now SPOILER ALERTLet's skip discuss why choosing a 5 years old child as a successor at the beginning, but the dad as an adult should stop the car immediately when his son gone crazy (Background knowledge: the boy was chosen and teleport into Shazam's place from a running car and got expelled back to the car, because of he does not have a pure heart to accept Shazam's power. He was so upset when he back to the car and force to open the door of the running car. This boy's brother try to stop him and their father distracted by them. So here comes the car accident. Boy's father squeezed out the car.) And that line ""You did this."" said by his brother to the boy after their father was broke out of the car. I mean...WHAT??? Genius? That is all you want to say to your young brother? First, it is not the time to blame each other, your father is bleeding on the ground, and if I were him, I would just stare at him angrily instead of saying that lame line.
The fighting scene is horrible, wait, didi they fight? The only thing i remember is those people hit other into sky or ground, just like the superman movie again. Yes, we get it, you guys can fly and super strong.
The Shazam family should be the biggest surprise in this movie, and this movie do give relatively quite lots scene to them. One thing for sure, they can be invisible. They are so ordinary, and they are inconspicuous in a bunch of special effects just like their superpower, invisibility.
The good thing about this movie should be the horror scene. The director is from Annabelle and the writer also is known by writing horror movies.

I'm not disregarding this movie out of hand just because I think that its silly moments and the general stupidity of the whole plot turns this into a bad movie. It is not. Let's get that out of the way, first of all. It's got some nicely developed characters, some truly well written moments and some of the jokes are not half bad. What doesn't do it for me is that the seriousness of some of its most dramatic moments gets taken down due to some very misplaced humor. There's a time and place for everything.
Now, I don't know if the main character is written to be like this in the comics, since I don't know anything about the source material, or not, but what I do know is that the right balance of humor is never achieved and the whole thing ends up being a goofy silly fest.

The biggest plus this film has is Zachari Levi's performance as the adult version of the lead character. He actually makes for a better and more likeable teenager than the actual teenager does. The foster home scenario is also really enjoyable, although the feel-good wholesomeness of its parents and kids owes more to The Little House On The Prairie than it does to reality. The story's villain is emotionally superficial, given that he's a man in his fifties who is still exclusively focussed on the bitter resentment he feels for his father's rejection of him when he was a child; but Mark Strong is as reliable as ever and makes him good fun to watch. The other kids in the foster home also have their moments in the spotlight, and none of them are annoying. I could happily watch this again at some point, which is not the way I felt after watching Captain Marvel, since Shazam has all of the charm and humour which that other movie lacked. Great, undemanding fun, which is something like a child-friendly Deadpool in its depiction of a hilariously-flawed superhero who rarely takes himself seriously.",Shazam!
582,joshteggert,The future of the DCEU is electric; Shazam! sparks some youthful fun into this otherwise brooding and bleak franchise.,8,12 August 2019,"Following the unexpectedly immense success of 2018's Aquaman (currently grossing $1.1 billion worldwide), and 2017's fantastic Wonder Woman (boasting the highest Rotten Tomatoes score for a DC Extended Universe film), it appears the DCEU is on somewhat of a roll with its solo projects. Shazam! promises to be another huge hit for Warner Bros. who have struggled thus far to really get this epic franchise effectively going.Shazam! opens with enough context for any viewer to comprehend the skeleton of the story; the dying Wizard Shazam (Djimon Hounsou) is seeking a ""champion"" to inherit his powers in order to prevent the seven deadly evils from unleashing their wrath upon the world. The opening half an hour is admittedly rather slow, but once fourteen-year-old Billy Batson (Asher Angel) is chosen to champion these powers, transforming into adult hero (Zachary Levi) by simply uttering the word 'Shazam!', the film provides delights at every turn.In its effortless blend of humour, story and action, Shazam! provides consistent laughs, CGI spectacles, weighty character development and gratifying cross-franchise nods as if the studio at the helm has been doing it efficaciously for years (note: it really hasn't). This is one of the most fulfilling DCEU movies to date; director David F. Sandberg nails everything you'd expect from a modern superhero flick, whilst also injecting a uniquely fresh spin on the genre.This owes considerable thanks to Levi's incredible lead outing. He makes it seem believable that his teenage alter ego is indeed trapped inside this muscular thirty-or-so-year-old man. That said, Shazam! is Freddy Freeman's (Jack Dylan Grazer) show; stealing every scene, Grazer's hilarious performance as Batson's best friend embellishes amazing on-screen chemistry with both the younger and older iteration of Batson. As a result, the film flows superbly through the script's excellent use of Grazer's character, who manages to tie the two opposing identities of the lead hero together seamlessly.Shazam! is not without flaws, however. For the most part, the story is rather predictable, and sadly it suffers from the notorious 'villain curse' overshadowing most modern superhero films. The motivations behind antagonist Dr. Thaddeus Sivana (Mark Strong) are flimsy, despite writers Harry Gayden and Darren Lemke's attempts to make them relatable on some level. Indeed, Mark Strong's third crack at comic book villainy is by no means as intriguing as his brilliant display in Kick-Ass, though it is far less contrived than his other DC role in Green Lantern.But on all other fronts, Shazam! shines. The CGI is pristine - which is rare for a DC film of this scale (read: Justice League) - and the script really is hysterical. Though there will be those (with nothing better to do) who will complain that this feels more like a 'Marvel' film, it is nonetheless pleasing to see that DC is willing to take itself a little less seriously from time to time and produce what is undoubtedly a genuinely entertaining film to experience.",Shazam!

Marvel and Frank Coghlan Jr as Billy Batson, it had everything, a terrific villain called the Scorpion, dressed from head to toe in a black mask and coat covered in white scorpions, the story lie was excellent better than this rubbish l have just tried to watch, l would hasten to add that l was not alive in 1941 but l collect old Saturday kids Matinee serials and A.O.C.M was one of the best, special FX were by brothers Howard and Theodore Lydecker, superior in every way.",Shazam!

Overall still a fun installment which I would rate around Wonder Woman level, but not as fun and well told as Aquaman.So depends on your frame of reference: are you happy with BvS and Justice League? Or do you demand MCU level production quality and story telling? If yes to the former, you'll love this movie!",Shazam!

586,grantpaulsen,Shazam!,6,7 April 2019,"Shazam is a great time! It's fun, exciting, and filled with a lot of heart and soul. This film is also very funny. Zachary Levi is fantastic in this film, he perfectly captured the spirit of a joyful child inside the body of an adult superhero. Nothing felt forced, everything felt natural. The character development is really good, in fact my favorite parts of the movie are the first two acts, because that's where the heart and soul of the film lies. The scenes when Zachary Levi interacts with his brother, and the scenes at the foster home are the best parts of this movie. This feels like a fun throwback to the days of fun comic book movies such as Spider-Man (2002). What an amazing course correction for the DCEU. If they just continue with this series and this character, then DC has a lot of potential here to make great films in the future. The film isn't perfect, it's got some mixed acting, a mixed soundtrack, and I have mixed feelings on the villain. But other than that, this is a great course correction, and probably the best DCEU movie.",Shazam!
587,mail-19035,This was awful...,1,29 June 2019,"Was this intended just for 8 year old kids? If so, the humour is certainly on point for that. It's very childish and far from funny. The choice of main character is also really bad, Zachary Levi is not a good actor.Was looking forward to seeing it but was disappointed at the end. Maybe your 8 year old kid will enjoy it, because it's certainly not for adults.",Shazam!
588,pruz-55801,Surprisingly Disturbing,8,5 April 2019,"A very good movie with great heart and humor. But one thing I was not expecting in Shazam was the horror aspect. DONT TAKE KIDS UNDER 12 TO THIS MOVIE!! There are surprisingly very dark moments in the film. Deaths, alot of jumpscares, scary monsters. No gore though.The movie wasn't pure fun as I imagined because alot of the horror and monster apsects took up that piece of the pieI was psyched for shazam since the very first trailer, and surprisingly it left me a little flat, but just a little.
The only reason I feel this way is that the marketing campaign and the actual film are two different things the ads and trailers would have you believed that this was going to be an all out comedy fest, light and with a touch of heart, something like Thor Ragnarok which was a we'lll balanced movie. While the movie for sure has it's great moments as it has alot of funny moments and bursts of originality, it has an equal amount of trademark DC darkness to it. You sense the difference between this and marvel. Marvel somehow has a way to balance drama,horror,and comedy into a perfect blend. Shazam? Not so much. At times I was wondering, where is this movie going? If it wants to be a dark movie, ok that's fine just establish that. If it wants be a fun family flick, great just established it. Those two aspects didn't blend in at all, and I could feel itBut then again this movie is great and a rating of 8 is no small feat! Leaving the theater I was raving about the best parts of the film, and beleive me it was hard, as there were too many!The only complaint is the focus of the movie, and that's a big issueBut overall, I'm sure you'll have a great time at Shazam because it is a the best DC movie so far! Just don't say I didn't warn you when the 10th jumpscare in the movie pops upPruz Reviews",Shazam!
589,sophaljonesy,7 comparisons/reasons why it is awesome,9,7 April 2019,"I love superhero movies and love all DC movies, so it is no surprise that I really enjoyed Shazam! This movie draws several comparison to other superhero movies. First, I noticed some people compared Shazam to Deadpool, but they are making the wrong comparison. Deadpool is a foulmouthed adult who knows he is in a movie. Shazam! is a kid in an adult superhero body who gets lost in having fun. So the comparison is like apples and oranges. Second, compared to other DC movies, this is truly a lighthearted family entertainment. It has its mix of great action sequences, humor, and heart. Billy Batson, Shazam's alter ego is just a kid searching for his family, but comes across awesome powers. His actions as Shazam really illustrate the immaturity, and innocence of the superhero. Third, all superheroes have an origin story, this movie has two. We get to see beginnings of both Shazam and his nemesis Savinna. It also makes the villain more interesting, especially if you have Mark Strong playing the villain. Strong is well-casted as a villain, and he has played villains several times already. Fourth, like all modern day superhero movies, this movie deals with some dark realities of life such as abandonment, family, and even idealism, manages to make the movie lighthearted and uplifting. Fifth, like Deadpool,the movie is also self conscious and has the characters directly discussing about superheroes. This is interesting, and blends well with the story. Sixth, it has post credit scene(s). Like modern movies, it as a post-credit scene (or two), but unlike Marvel DC does not make it mandatory to have one, so having one makes the movie extra special. The credit rolling is also fun as it acts like a humourous epilogue to the story. Seventh, like Aquaman, it has some horror elements to the story. The creature design is even better than the parademons, and Steppenwolfe of Justice League. They could have come from a straight-up horror. This makes the villains truly threatening, and considering Shazam is mentally 15, the stakes are raised as we wonder how he could manage to defeat Savinna and all the monsters. So in the end, there are 7 comparisons/reasons Shazam! is a great superhero movie, and I suggest you watch it. I actually think it is on par with any Marvel movie",Shazam!

Then my wife said she wanted to see it, so there I was. I had some Marvel family comics as a kid, saw the Saturday morning tv show, I don't remember billy staying billy after he shazamed. He became captain marvel. The whole kid in a superhero body theme was awful. I was wish this movie over. The last 15 minutes got ok, but didn't save it. Who is giving this 9 and 10's?",Shazam!

By all means make a superhero movie that's tongue-in-cheek, poking fun at the genre (see Deadpool for how to do this correctly), but this was a complete farce from beginning to end.Young Billy and old Billy were nothing alike; the costumes, cgi and some of the sets looked tacky; the story was generic and dull with no real character development, especially with Mark Strong's character; and for a comedy I only laughed 3 or 4 times!There seemed to be no effort made to make the relationships between the kids believable. I certainly don't understand how Billy suddenly felt this all powerful bond with the other kids at the end.Overall I came out of the cinema feeling very disappointed.",Shazam!

Yes, I thought I was ""Captain Marvel"", That's originally Billy Batson's identity. The TV show of the 1970's really put the hook in me. Now as this Film, I enjoyed it. I appreciated how the film begun. Poor Billy Batson who was abandoned as a child who been through several Foster homes. Yet, when he met Freddy and some his new foster siblings this started to change for him until riding on a subway in Philly somehow he runs smack into the Powerful Wizard SHAZAM and he was chosen to display his powers for Good battling Evil. I really enjoyed watching this Film and the memories of FILMATION when I was a Kid in the 70's. If you're die hard SHAZAM Fan you will love this film. Of course, it points out a Sequel.

So, it begs the question about what was the point of this movie?TV for young kids usually have adults that talk funny, and they are supposed to talk this way because that is the way adults act when they create TV for very young children. Well, let's just say that the main adult character acted like a 5 year old. Adding to that most characters in this film are shallow & tried too hard to be funny which totally backfired.The comedy in this movie is totally off the mark. Silly and unrealistic to say the least.I wanted to walk out on this movie half way through. A total waste of time. Just goes to show that sometimes ratings here at imdb are totally off the mark.

I would not say the movie keeps you under pressure for what's happening.The character of Shazam is childish and Zachary Levi portrait him perfectly. The action is fine, the humor is ""okay"".The effects are on point, The villain...Dr. Sivana...well I would not say it was memorable, but Mark Strong portrait him well.At the end Shazam learned some basic lessons about his powers for one of his next big fights (with Black Adam).Generally, the movie is predictable and not so special, but it's ""okay"". There is definitely no ""WOW"" moment.I put this one somewhere behind ""Man of Steel"" and ""Wonder Woman"". I think I enjoy it a bit more than ""Aquaman"" for what it is.",Shazam!

610,emily-39235-15776,Started great and slowly went down,5,9 April 2019,"It was a sweet and funny movie. Definitely good for the fam. I liked that Shazam acted like a teenager, because let's be honest, none of us would be mature and responsible with powers. I took 5 points off because some of the plot felt forcefully squeezed in there and some moments were too cheesy for my taste.Additionally:1. the villain had a better origin story than Shazaz.2. Why are the kid actors soooo annoying?!? I understand they are children and ""that's how kids are,"" but the boy with the walking disability and the youngest sibling were too much for all of us who watched the film.3. If Shazam didn't fully understand his power, why would dividing his power among his siblings make sense? How would they suddenly understand how to use and control their powers when he couldn't? Divide and conquer...I get it, but still didn't make sense.",Shazam!
611,ulex_stovetop,A Great Christmas Film For The Whole Family!,7,9 August 2021,"After seeing The Suicide Squad this weekend I needed to go back and rewatch this movie to determine which was the best in the universe. After a revisit, it's clear that this movie takes second place, but it is much closer than I thought.SHAZAM! Is a great family Christmas movie! The theme of finding your family, even out of blood, and learning to appreciate the things around you is spectacular. The entire foster family is super fun and acted perfectly by the cast. I love the focus of the number 7 throughout the film combined with the unclaimed thrown to hint at Black Adam without calling him out by name. Unpopular opinion, but I also love the costume. The way it is over the too and over-padded really makes Shazam feel like a kid with superpowers.Not all is great, however. The villain is incredibly generic. The sins are not much better. I could not tell which is which with the exception of Gluttony (and maybe Greed as he is called out by name in one scene). The CG is very rough at times, often very rubbery and improperly lit. The cinematography is also a bit flat. None of this really takes away from the fun of the film, but it is worth mentioning.Overall, it is a fun adventure for the whole family and the SECOND best of the DCEU as of August 2021.",Shazam!
612,goodriddance_92,Pleasantly surprised!,8,5 April 2019,"I would like to say that you should probably ignore the trailers, they do not do this movie any justice. Sure it has some cheese, but not that much at all, it's actually a pretty dark film and even has elements or horror but the comedy is used very well to make it very fun. Probably the most solid 8/10 I've ever given, definitely where it belongs. Zachary Levi portrays a kid in a mans body so very convincingly!
Most importantly, this film has so much heart! It makes you care so much, it's all about family, trust and self belief.
I am kind of surprised how well put together the third act was, sure it was a kind of typical CGI fightfest but a very good one!
Hopefully we see more!",Shazam!

With the exception of ""Suicide Squad"" I tend to rate them pretty high-usually for entertainment and escapism. Shazam hits all the typical superhero marks, but its core is a story about family and maturity, selfishness and sacrifice. The performances are all top notch. I loved the family dynamics, especially the parents. For a change, I wasn't bored by the fight scenes. The evolution of Billy Batson is excellent and the portrayal of the kids is realistic. For once, being a brat is identified as being a brat. I kind of wish the horror scenes and language was toned down so a younger audience could see it because the moral of the story-the transformative power of family, and the limits of individuality-is one worth the widest audience possible.",Shazam!

624,drawnsupreme,A Fun Superhero Movie,8,13 July 2019,"After watching Shazam, I thought it was a fun little movie. There's plenty of humor and the movie doesn't take itself too serious. There's some cool fight sequences and special effects, along with a few dramatic scenes. In a nutshell, Shazam has a little bit of everything for everyone.The story development throughout the film was well-paced but I found the second half of the movie to be slower. The fight sequences towards the end of the film felt a little drawn out, and a tad boring because it wasn't as breathtaking, over-the-top and action-packed as, say Transformers, Man of Steel, or Batman v Superman - the action sequences in those movies gave me the chills. So awesome.The dialogue exchange between Zachary Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer is goofy, a bit animated, but entertaining - and I mean this in a good way.I was entertained, I laughed, and I felt that I understood the characters well. It seems everything was true to the comics and the character. I enjoyed the movie over all and look forward to a sequel(s) as long as the main cast and crew remain a part of it, and they continue to expand the DC Universe competently.",Shazam!

626,ahsawesa,Joyful and Wholesome Even Though Quite Cliche,6,11 April 2019,"Shazam! was fun :D Didn't quite love it but I did enjoy it6.8/10. By no means a bad rating, my process of rating is quite strict so this is actually pretty good. I gave Man of Steel the same rating.If I had to pick out cons to justify my rating I'd say it has way too much exposition thrown at us with on the nose dialogue, unnecessary humor, too much flashbacks even when they're not needed, over the top acting here and there and a last act that really drags. Also, it gets too silly at times and suffers from the usual MCU problem where they don't focus on the consequences.But Zach Levi is awesome as this character. The kids had great chemistry with each other. The film does a good job of handling the family theme and packs a good emotional punch at times. Also, when the humor was on spot, jokes were hilarious.I'd say it's worth seeing if you are generally into superhero movies and even if you are an MCU fan because this is a different direction from DC's dark and gritty style but I was able to digest that because Shazam is supposed to be a fun and lighthearted character :)",Shazam!
627,tfclougher,Foster homes are only the beginning,10,11 April 2019,"My wife worked with children and is always pissed by the way foster parents are depicted. She liked how Shazam presented them. The grumpy kid? He nods hello. Close enough. Real enough. And the parents know it.Beyond that. My wife thanked me for ""dragging"" her to this. I grew up on Captain Marvel in Fawcett Comics. I said where's Dr. Sirvana? It's Sivana and he's here My Sivana had a wicked overbite (you might say buck-toothed, almost like a stereotyped Japanese about whom we were still uncertain in 1954) with a hatchet face. I think he worked in a laboratory. Mark Strong played him as relentless.I looked for the subway. Billy Batson had a crutch and sold newspaper and would go down into a subway station to get his powers. The movie had a subway once, maybe twice. Good enough. He turned into someone who looked like Fred McMurray who was a friend of the artists who used his image for Captain Marvel. Here Freddie has the crutches. Why quibble?In short, the positive reviews are right. As Gomer Pyle would say, ""Shazam!""",Shazam!
628,lmathc,"A Great Comedy, an Average Superhero Movie",7,17 April 2019,"Shazam is the most lighthearted and fun DCEU movie to date. This is both its strength and its downfall. The comedy is top-notch and Zachary Levi knocks it out of the park with his portrayal of a kid in a superhero's body. The other kid actors are also very likeable, though Billy Batson himself as a kid is moody and one-dimensional. This leads the viewer to ask: Do the Shazam powers also include an improved personality? Because there is a stark contrast between the adult and child versions of Billy that is pretty hard to ignore. Other than that, Mark Strong's as Dr. Sivana is good, but the dialogue he is given is pretty cliche.The superheroics in this movie are decent as well. The power discovery montage that Billy goes through is hilarious and one of the best scenes of the movie. Other than that, the hero vs. villain action is a little dissapointing, and there's not really any big payoff in the 3rd act. Also, the movie can't really decide if it's a movie for kids with virtually no stakes or if it's a darker movie with some monster violence that will undoubtedly scare younger viewers. These scenes don't run through the whole movie, but they are worth noting.Summary: If you are looking for an enjoyable movie with heart, Shazam is for you. It's funny, compelling, and relatable. However, if you're looking for an objectively great superhero film, it may dissapoint ever so slightly.",Shazam!

Sorry Kevin.And my new favourite super hero movie and for me it is honestly better than many others out there. I'm here for entertainment and I found it very entertaining.Fun. That's how I describe the movie in one word.There is funny, but not too much funny. It is kind of a comedy, but not really. I laughed a lot.
There are dark moments, but not all dark. I was shocked how dark some of it got. Not really a kids film. Earns the PG-13 rating. Having said that, it is a big departure for DC from previous dark films.
There is good action, but not all action.
There is drama, maybe too much drama for a super hero film of this type, but it mostly works fine.
There is CGI, but not too much CGI.Some minor plot holes I noticed, but nothing glaring.
The movie follows the traditional hero's journey story and I felt it was very well done. It was fun and entertaining and not trying to take itself seriously. The plot is somewhat predictable, but I didn't predict all the twists and turns.Zachary played the role of a 15 year old very well. Great facial expression.
Mark Strong played an excellent villain who has clear motivations and is clearly evil. Maybe too evil. But a very good opponent to Captain Marvel.Ending was well done.Decent score too.My main complaint would be that the trailers really did not do this film justice at all.As a long time DC Captain Marvel fan I was a bit sad they didn't ever refer to him as such, given that is the characters' real name. Kinda silly having a hero who can't really say his name, but that isn't the fault of this movie. Maybe he just hasn't decided what to call himself which is fair enough.",Shazam!

635,moviemonki,Imagine a 90s Joel Schumacher Batman movie but with the right character.,7,18 October 2019,"It features cartoon violence and physics. The hero catches a falling bus on its windshield without breaking the glass or hurting anyone inside. However, it also has people being thrown to their deaths from a high building. And a person getting their head bitten off. It's too graphic for the target audience, probably seven to 12 year-olds, and too juvenile for adults. It was an odd choice for a film that knows what it wants to be and mostly delivers a campy, fun kids' movie. There's a strip club, but the camera never goes inside, only the characters. This is played for comedy. There's a bad Santa, which is also an odd choice for the target demographic. But these are nit-picks for what is mostly a fun family movie.",Shazam!

638,MekkaMax,The funniest and best film of the DCEU currently,9,9 April 2019,"I was excited to watch this movie since the first trailer dropped last year and with each trailer after that it just pumped me up more. Having watched the movie now, I agree with most people that this is not just a great DCEU movie, but a great movie in general. This movie brought me back to my childhood as this movie reminded me of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies. Shazam! had a ton pf heart, jokes and great characters. The entire cast did great things with the script as the characters felt real and everybody acted their age. The idea of giving superpowers to a teenager is shown realistically as many teenagers would do the same thing that Billy does. Mark Strong's Dr. Sivana was good, but not great. He worked for the movie but you probably won't remember him after a week. But he's not terrible, just good. The fight scenes are ok, when compared to the rest of the DCEU which makes sense considering Billy is a kid and the rest of the other characters are adults and gods. Overall, I had a great time and would recommend this movie even if you gave up on the DCEU as this one might win you back.",Shazam!
639,shashthezarch,10/10??? Really???,1,13 April 2019,"Dude, seriously who gave it 10/10? If this is 10/10 then what will happen to movies like Dark Knight???(I am not gonna include marvel because some people may get pissed).
Its seriously not that awesome movie. It has many problems in it.1)Levi has without any doubt done an extra-ordinary job as Shazam!. He was funny...his portrayal was awesome. And I can say that he really looked like an apparition of a 14 year old kid. But that doesnt make even a small drop of sense. Billy Batson, the 15 year old kid was a serious kid as shown in the movie. He didnt really joke much when he was just being the kid. But when he became Shazam!, lol what happend to him? He just became funny? Levi has done good acting but the character of Shazam! does not even match a slightest with young kid Billy Batson2)Kid???????????????? The chinese kid literally hacked into anything and was able to know about the parents of Billy Batson. This part of the plot really puts a black cloth on a fact that he is still a kid. But he hacked into Police files? Another fact is that Billy Batson spent most of his life looking for his parents. But here comes this 10 year old kid. Hacks into database and accomplishes on finding Billy's parents. Just awesomwe!3)I dont know about others...but it was very much predictable to me. Some of them were just at another level. Like when Sivanna literally catched that bullet...that was awesome. Or Sivanna making a ""climax"" wjere he threatened Shazam! But he wasnt able to listen. That was just seriously cool. But some scenes were predictable.4)Some people claimed that it was funny in some serious times which made it trash. Well I dont think so...they being funny was really awesome. I thought that the 3rd act of the movie stretched far too long.5)In short it was funny...worth a watch. Worth the time and worth the money. But it wasnt a magic which critics and other people were talking about. Maybe I expected too much from this film when people said its best DCEU movie till now. But in vain!!!My rating would be 7/10. But I have given it 1/10. And if u a regular user of Imdb..you would know why I did it.",Shazam!

643,rolando19552001,Shazam,9,5 April 2019,"ShazamThey say and there is the often repeated saying that is sometimes it is sometimes trite that the young stay young at heart and most importantly for Shazam, for Billy Batson is the saying that family and home is where the heart is, and there is no better saying to be true for Billy and Shazam. Billy Batson is the young rebel soul who was margined and derelict at a very early age of four in an amusement park where Billy´s mother tries hard to win his kid a tiger stuffed animal, but she only manages to score and get a compass so that Billy never loses his way and always would know where to go. In a tragic incident of how some parents are never supposed to be good parents, Billy for 10 years always trying to find a woman in his mother that maybe never truly cared to find her son. This transfixion and contrast of how a family is the one that loves you and not the blood of my blood, Billy Batson would discover this lesson the very hard way and is very hard to watch young Billy realized the very hard truth about his mother, you can feel the despair and the loss of words of young Billy grasping what he never thought it was true. Thankfully for Billy he finds a new family and new home with the new foster family. The roommate of Billy is Freddie, the young man that began to appear as a new promising star in the Stephen King´s based film It, indeed many said this but it is indeed true, Jack Dylan Grazer, in the film It, the character that changed from Loser to Lover his cast, the young man like Levi both steal the show, especially Jack Grazer with his obsessive compulsive obsession with all things super heroes, Freddie loves both the caped crusader Batman and the Man of Steel in Superman. When Billy stops the bullying of Freddie, the only remaining wizard of the counsel of wizards in Shazam, in a regal sorcerer played by Hounsou who finally in a desperate move finally gives his powers to Billy and the others wizards to come, the Shazam counsel of wizards will be back. The reason why the regal sorcerer Hounsou gives away his powers to Billy is that there is no time left, Thaddeus Sivana who was rejected by Hounsou when he was a boy, now played with scows and commanding character by Mark Strong as an adult who does not take rejection very well as he attest to his own brother and his own father. Dr. Sivana wants the powers of Hounsou´s Champion, Shazam and is able to get the truth from Freddie. The first half of the film is very funny and it is true, this is the most any had laughed in a film in this year of 2019, a lot of jokes. The first half of the film is when Freddie played by Jack Grazer as the super heroes expert began with Levi, the adult Shazam to play what super heroes power does Shazam has, there is a few surprises, like bolting electricity and lighting, also flying among others, the flying a very near call. It is true the film is a bit too long, 10 minutes to long at least, but overall you have fun in the film, you laugh a lot, it is like they say Tom Hanks´1988 Big with Superman. There is a cameo of the last scene in the school cafeteria of Shazam bringing one of his super heroes friends to school to eat at the cafeteria with Billy. Shazam have the laughs, the emotional ride and gravitas to ask oneself what a family truly is, and like Billy Batson learns with gratitude and humility, home is where your heart is and Billy and Shazam finally finds their way home and where they belong, where they are loved unlike Dr. Sivana. Shazam delivers the drama and the many laughs.",Shazam!

I'm so glad I didn't part with my cash to see this at the cinema because I found the actor who played Shazam! incredibly irritating.I mean, the Billy Batson character, who, although is a bit of a loner, is a very self-assured teen, yet when he turns into a superhero he is a stuttering mess. The 2 characters are meant to be the same person, yet they did not share a single personality trait. It was all very distracting - hence I couldn't finish it.",Shazam!
646,pulsar-16,F-U-N fully arrives in the DCEU,7,4 July 2019,"F-U-N fully arrives in the DCEU with SHAZAM! Although a few dark moments occur, these occur naturally, unliked the forced pseudo-nihilism of the Zack Snyder vision. The sheer joy and wish fulfillment of being a superhero are the primary mood & theme here. Billy Batson discovers the unbridled thrill of super-powers, all with the single utterance of a magic word! Asher Angel updates Batson without compromising what defined this endearing character over the decades. Zachary Levi perfectly embodies the unlikely juxtaposition of godly might and childlike awe. Despite never sharing screen time, Angel & Levi still pair nicely as the Billy/Captain Marvel combo.The supporting casting works, too, especially with the superb young actor, Jack Dylan Grazer, playing Freddy Freeman! The foster family who take in Billy nicely round out his cast, especially with the adorable Darla and snarky know-it-all, Eugene. Mark Strong plays Thaddeus Sivana, the OTHER arch-nemesis traditionally associated with the SHAZAM franchise. Unlike the snickering mad scientist seen in the cartoons, Strong's Sivana skews darker as an imposing rival for Billy's power, fueled by the ""Seven Enemies of Man"" (the Seven Deadly Sins for the casual fans). He's more ""Sabbac"" than ""Geeky Mad Scientist"" for this version. I appreciated the menace that wafted off Mark Strong, reinforced by an outfit and demeanor subtly referencing another Shazam villain, Captain Nazi.It's breezy at times, but strong overall for the heart and enthusiasm. Considering the dirge of the Snyder Superman entries, it seems possible that Captain Marvel/Shazam might become more popular among DCEU fandom, just as he was arguably more popular in his comic book prime of the 1940's. Following the breakthrough of the powerhouse WONDER WOMAN, and the box office success of AQUAMAN, perhaps SHAZAM signals the cinematic equivalent of the Golden Age of comics that first introduced these beloved heroes to the world?",Shazam!

Recall the ole serious dark DC Batman and Superman movies...yeah Shazam was nothing like that.Go catch it! Bring the family.",Shazam!
649,redcanofevil,2nd best DCEU movie,8,12 June 2019,"Before I begin I know a lot of people were heralding this movie as the best DCEU movie so far and even if I am not quite sure on that, it clearly is one of the better ones yet. To put it frankly it is almost as good as Wonder Woman (2017) and just barely misses the top spot, which is mostly biased due to my love for Wonder Woman since childhood. And it finally feels good to see DCEU find a considerable footing even with the lackluster Aquaman (2018).
Normally it doesn't seem that important to have basic knowledge over Superheroes from the comics as the movie tries to allot a few moments for Bruce Waynes parents to get gunned down or Uncle Ben reciprocate the immortal responsibility speech any way possible. Shazam not being as popular a character and being a totally different type of superhero, it is not as easy to cope with the vibe and the mood the movie presents. Many people, even so called revered comic geeks (who shall remain nameless) tend to find the goofy attitude off-putting. So it is important to associate yourself with the fact that Shazam is basically a Mortal god who is actually a teenager and is super hilarious and goofy in the comics.The plot of the movie is simple as it's just another origin movie and there is absolutely no mucking around trying to deny it. The plot progression is character based over anything and that is what you want in an origin flick. Key Orphan tropes are at play with three stages being defiance, loathing and acceptance. The simplicity of the plot doesn't put it ahead of the curve sadly and nor did it needed to.The most off-putting part of the entire film has to be the bland and emotionless acting from the older cast. The opening scene in the car is almost unwatchable and you'll end up shaking your head at how bad it can get. Thankfully it gets better as the movie progresses and the honest work by the younger cast does ease the pain. Zachary Levi was always a likable dude and he does an adequate job at portraying Shazam, with adequate being somewhat an understatement. Mark Strong felt monotone but it did feel like he was doing the best with what he was given. The actors playing Freddy and Billy were also to the point and I loved all their older versions more or less.Timeline might also be an issue if you take time to think and it's totally up to you if you want to fault it. Superhero movies have been prone to timeline inconsistencies. The whole movie basically takes place over a very short time and it might compel you to ask where the main villain was during all those time even after ""Captain Sparkles"" has been widely known in the neighborhood. Along with a comparatively weaker score and minimalistic script I don't have major gripes with the movie.Some parts needed to be fleshed out more for the sake of depth and gravity that plays out in later scenes. The whole foster home cast was great and they all had their moment. It truly felt heart-warming whereas it could've easily come off as artificial since child actors are known to botch roles. If the movie spent a few more minutes on the foster home and actually establish a deeper bond between Billy and his siblings then the pay-off would've felt better. As we see later on how the foster home influences Billy in later scenes, I wouldn't mind spending a couple more frames inside the foster home. Billys mother should've also been presented in a wider focus as his meet with his mother is what his origin moment turns out to be.The soundtrack was fitting to say the least and the whole movie has a giggly boyish charm that is essentially the core of the movie. ""Feel good happy-go-lucky"" movies tend to over saturate themselves but Shazam manages to find a decent balance. It plays out exactly it would've for any teenager that was caught in the moment.Now comes the comedy and boy they were good. I normally don't compare movies in a review but since I watched Captain Marvel (2019) a day before I am inclined to do so. I didn't realize that Captain Marvel had no funny moments until I finished watching this movie. Don't get me wrong, Nick Furry and Talos tried their best to come off as hilarious but it just didn't work for me. Shazam (2019) on the other hand had plenty of moments that were organic and genuinely chuckle worthy. Zachary as I said steals most of the scenes he's in and it's hard to keep a straight face even if some of the jokes are elementary level. Freddy too shines but never goes off boat to come off as funny. Basically the kid in you will appreciate the humor and you'll love it.I'll be honest the fight sequences were kind of a letdown but I felt like they wanted to put more emphasis on character growth than mindless CGI. Speaking of CGI, DCEU manages to keep its reputation of being subpar in the graphics department and had this movie been of a serious tone, it surely would've fared badly. I do not have any problem with the Shazam costume or rather any of the costumes; well to be honest I actually love what they did.
Now is the part where I fanboy over stuffs that were faithful nod to the comics. They don't usually carry over to the rating but if a movie does justice to the source material, I have absolutely no problem in giving those a shout out. And the best part of the entire movie has to be the Shazam family. I was in awe and loved every moment of it. It was such a special surprise as I never thought I'd get to see that especially in the very first movie. Zachary Levi can safely be put amongst the list of ""successful comic book character castings"" as he managed to bring in the essence of Shazam straight outta the comic. The movie could've easily been a disaster had they failed to find a line between hilarity and emotions. Needless to say this could be the most faithful adaptation among the DCEU movies and is also the only movie to have consistency throughout all the acts. Oh and did I mention the members of the Shazam family were taken straight from the New-52 storyline other than Freddy, whom they went with the Bronze-age version. I also liked the tie-ins and nods to other DCEU movies with characters like Batman and Superman; you can never go wrong with including Easter eggs.All in all Shazam does what it sets out to do and does so with suave, charm and innocence. It wants to chronicle the coming of age story of Billy and expands on his relationship with his foster home. And also do general Shazam stuffs like every 14 year old envision to do had they the opportunity.",Shazam!

653,Koma-Mo,"It doesn't deserve the high praise it's been getting, but it's still good.",7,30 August 2019,"As of late, the DCEU is doing a good job of establishing their universe after how their ensemble film basically ruined everything due to the producers poor decisions. From ""Aquaman"" to this film, I'm glad that I got to see another superhero done well on screen; although, I do have some gripes about the film that didn't make me like as others have.It's a big risk and rather difficult task to make a film of a child becoming an adult and I thought that this film did it quite well; it's basically ""Big"" with superheroes, as people have mentioned. I liked how they introduced the main character and we got to know him on why he does what he does. You understand Billy Batson well enough so when he turns to the superhero Shazam, Zachary Levi does a good job of capturing the mannerisms and the same personality that we saw from Asher Angel. I personally thought it worked fine and that we were able to see his growth and although he was a troublemaker, he still was likable to a point. He does something in the film that is clearly his fault, but he never goes to the point of feeling responsible for it. Instead, we are treated with an action scene and given no time for him to reflect back.Out of all of the characters, Billy Batson was possibly the one with the most depth and is the most interesting. Everyone else, on the other hand, was not, especially Freddy, played by Jack Dylan Grazer. He is possibly the most annoying and the least likable out of everyone due to the fact that everything that he gets himself involved with is his fault. Sure he is the comic relief, but he never made me laugh and because of how unlikable he is, I wished that the director and scriptwriter would have changed him a bit more to be more involved with the plot and to be more responsible. The other characters just have one note to them and are basically there to be there until something arises and they are given something to do. The villain was menacing and we understand him, but I just felt more pity that that was his main reason for being the villain.One of my biggest gripes here was that the film deviated away from the subplots of the film. I'm talking about the ones that will be able to add more depth to the characters and to add more impact to a certain situation that Billy Batson wants to do, in order to add comic relief. I did like the comedy and laughed a bit while watching Billy get used to his powers. But the fact that the movie wanted to focus more on the comedy rather than blending all of these elements together kind of hurt the film for me. Since director David F. Sandberg has made more horror films, I liked that he added a bit of a horror element at one scene. Also, when you do see that side story of Billy's take place, it does bring in the impact that I want and it shows how serious this situation was; it's sad that the film had us forget about it until the climax.All of the superhero stuff is fun and I have to give major praise for that. They were able to blend the action and comedy well, so when you see Shazam fighting, there will be a joke in between the fight and it never felt like the film stopped to tell this one joke. I did have fun and the film did surprise me a bit with how they executed the fight scenes and how things played out during the climax.I'm glad that this film is not as panned as the other films in the DCEU, but at the same time, this doesn't deserve all of the praise that has been given. There are major flaws here and I couldn't turn the other way and act like it wasn't there. I saw it and it bothered and despite that, it was still a fun movie. I'm glad the DCEU is going on the right track after they crashed and burned.",Shazam!

Billy is pretty much a good kid, or at least has good intentions, with a goal. But also has a bit of a chip on his shoulder. When he is suddenly given the powers of a super hero he uses it pretty much like any kid would, he goofs around. But through the course of the film he learns responsibility. So it really is a coming of age story. The action is really fun and as a Philadelphia native I was really surprised to see how much of the city they showed off.

Shazam!, as a 14-year old turn late-20/early30-something hero, is ripe with opportunity! Unfortunately, they use 75% of their ""funny"" to promote the movie. What you get in the theater, is the story, which is good, the action, which is good, and the profanity, which is way too much. Thus, what could have been GREAT, turns out to be good.Wait, wait, profanity? Yes, though it's more of the garden variety, Shazam! has more sh** than probably all of the Marvel Studio movies combined! They had to earn that PG-13 somehow, so this is how they did it. And since PG-13 has accounted for nearly half of all money made by all movies made over the last decade, there was no way this move could be ""just PG."" And that's a real Shashame!",Shazam!

Wait, perhaps Hangover or something about marry but what I really wanna say is, this movie is so GOOOOOOOOD. God dammit, ITS GOOD!I watch it for second time last night and I still laugh of my ass.

Older teenagers and adults will find this movie tedious, unimaginative, and hard to watch for more than 15 minutes. The reviewers who gave this a ""10"" are purposely fooling you; they likely were paid to do it. Don't fall for this amateurish mess. I've seen better CG on cable.

680,MJL_Uncensored,Shazam Is the I Like You But I Don't Love You of Superhero Films,7,7 April 2019,"I didn't LOVE Shazam! as a movie, but I have to admit, the film is pretty adorable, and it leaves you with some good memories that it's tough to say anything wrong about it, so my review is a little conflicted.Shazam! is your typical origin story movie (which I really wish filmmakers would reconsider revising like Black Panther did). It follows the story of a troubled kid, Billy Batson who is moved into a foster home with a group of misfit kids that are so irresistibly charming that you can't help but want to adopt a quintet of diverse foster kids. The film follows Billy's struggles to adapt, but when he's forced to stand-up for a family member (Freddy Freeman)--a socially awkward boy with an undisclosed physical ailment--he is deemed worthy by an eccentric wizard (a former Shazam) to take his place and become the new Shazam! That's not a spoiler, that's canon, and the trailer already told you that.Pretty straightforward, right?What follows next is Zachary Levi's best Tom Hanks impression as a child in a man's body, and he executes it with the kind of glee you expect from an actor in a Christmas movie. And yes, this film takes place around Christmas, so Shazam! could quickly become a Christmas movie that's in heavy rotation in years to come. Levi finds the right balance of goofiness to keep you smiling without becoming annoying like that kid that keeps doing his one trick move to get the family to laugh during family gatherings. And the story of Billy Batson's quest to find his mom has enough emotional heft to pull the movie into more grounded territory when needed.Of course, what would a film like this be without a super villain? Enter Dr. Thaddeus Sivana.As villains go in movies, Sivana is as tropey as they come. Daddy-issues and weird childhood obsessions seem to be Hollywood's analysis of how to turn children into sociopaths. His motivations are weakly defined, and his performance is clearly classic Bond-villain inspired, but his creepiness as an onscreen baddie is elevated by some pretty cool CGI that I won't spoil. Sivana's appearances created some moments that caused a little girl in the theater with her parents to cry every time he came onscreen--so as a kid villain, his shtick works. For adults, he's a bit of throwaway character.The film's strength is its children and the story's conclusion--a feel-good story that has some genuinely lovely surprises for the audience. Hats off to the marketing team for not spoiling it. And as formulaic as it is to have that one foster child that is so irresistibly cute that you wonder how anyone could ever abandon a child like this--Faithe Herman as Darla Dudley--was an absolute scene stealer. They could have done an entire movie about her, and I would never tire of seeing this young talent onscreen. The children are the real stars , and I wonder if they were removed, would this character or this movie be able to stand alone. What I mean by that is, if you slap adult Shazam! in the Justice League (comic nerds, back off, I know his relationship with the JLA) would he work or hamper the film? This isn't a slight on Levi, it's a slight on the character.The film's weakness surrounds its villain (as previously discussed), and it's costume design. As much as I love seeing classic comic outfits in cinema instead of the S&M leather worn in the early X-Men movies, this is one of those times that an update would have been better. I'm sorry, Shazam's muscle suit is distracting and so 90's retro that it's annoying to look at.There's always the conversation of ""superhero"" fatigue amongst reviewers, and that is probably a legitimate state of mind right now when you consider the extraordinary number of films (and television shows) that have been based on comic book source material. But that's not me. You could fill my entire plate with serving after serving of comic book films, and it would never taste stale to me because it hasn't since 1989's Batman. But Shazam, like the first Ant-Man, seems to feel like a snack until the main course arrives. Wonder Woman and Aquaman are now the new faces of the DCEU while DC tries to figure out how to reboot Batman and Superman for the umpteenth time. Where Shazam! fits in the scheme of things is too be determined. But for now, Billy Batson is here and he's fun to watch, even if his hair and outfit annoy you.",Shazam!

683,Reelnerd,The word is Shazam!,8,9 April 2019,"The word is Shazam!
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Gary F. Sandberg the director behind acclaimed horror hits Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation helms the first ever big screen adaptation of the DC Comics superhero known as Shazam. Shazam is a B-list character from the pantheon of DC heroes so it is somewhat surprising that they decided to adapt this character but it also isn't. Speaking as a DC fanboy and someone who has liked the films in the DCU with Man of Steel being my favorite the DC brand is a tainted one. Many of the films in the franchise have been divisive with the exceptions being Aquaman and Wonder Woman.
Shazam has been seen by some critics as the reset button in this shared DC universe. Shazam is a character that has as of yet not been seen in this universe and therefore doesn't carry with it some of the baggage that other films in this franchise have had to deal with. The filmmakers were allowed to tell an origin story without having to adhere to a set of criteria established in a previous film/s.
This film had a really solid cast with the leads being Zachary Levi, Asher Angel, Jack Dylan Grazer and Mark Strong. This film has been marketed as the Big of superhero movies which is pretty much what it turned out to be. This film was a lot of fun and the marketing labeled it as a comedy for the most part which is true but the film is so much more than that.
It is a film about family at its core and the friendship between Billy (Angel) and Freddy (Jack) is the driving force behind the narrative. Freddy a comic book geek at heart serves as a sort of mentor to Billy as he deals with his newfound powers and abilities. The kid actors in the film all had great chemistry together.
A lot of the marketing for the film touted it as a lighthearted superhero romp which it is but there were some surprisingly dark moments within the film. The opening sequence when we are first introduced to the origins of the film's main villain which is revisited in a very in your face and hard hitting way later on in the film. I think this is where Gary Sandberg's horror roots really shines in the film. I was very surprised by these moments in the film but in a good way and they helped to amplify the stakes in the film by our hero and by those that he loves.
Both Shazam and the villain Dr. Sivana suffer childhood traumas that affects them throughout their lives moving forward. Both become obsessed with achieving an outcome that they think will ease their respective pains and bring them some sort of resolution. Both are filled with anger, loneliness and despair. That is one of the layers of the film that makes it so compelling how does one overcome childhood trauma.
Also the theme of family plays an important role. Sometimes familial bonds go beyond bloodline and birthright. Sometimes we can choose whom to call family because certain people have earned that right by having your back and being there when most needed. One can choose to be defined their past or one can overcome it and this film also addresses that issue.
Shazam had a bit of nineties vibe to it as far as the filmmaking style. Mark Strong made for a surprisingly good villain and there is a scene in a boardroom where you see how truly powerful and mad Strong's villain is. Shazam is a family film that falls a bit on the darker side but that's what I liked about it. The marketing did a great job of not giving away too much and depending on how well the film does box office wise may determine whether or not it was a good idea.
I highly recommend this film which is full of magic and wonder and feels very much like it's own thing in the larger DCU movie franchise and yet still very much a part of it. Zach Levi is great as Shazam but if I do have a criticism of the film he does seem to be portraying a very different character than Asher Angel is playing but it didn't bother me all that much. This is another step in a new and brighter direction for the much maligned DCU franchise. Go see this film and when you get to the box office just say the word, Shazam!",Shazam!

685,bareth-51861,Excellent,9,9 April 2019,This is the best superhero film I have seen in some time. The performance from all the cast was positively excellent.Asher nailed the performance in his first film. This film will unfortunately be overlooked in awards due to the excellent films that are coming out this year Spider-Man and Avengers. Not a film strictly for young kids it has some scary moments which could leave some individuals very put off.,Shazam!

Zachary Levi does fantastic work in playing a child trapped in a grown man's body. The plot is easy to follow and thankfully, it never gets boring. Only actual flaw in the movie, is that the villain is a bit cliche, but I can overlook this, since the movie is just that enjoyable.There is good humor in the movie, but it also has its serious moments and frankly, this type of film I enjoy the most. I am hopeful about the DC cinematic universe and I really hope that this movie is a return to form for WB.",Shazam!

690,ZombieGirlORV,Pretty sure this is my first 10/10- Well done. :),10,7 April 2019,"Fantastic! Amazing acting, genuine comedic moments. I absolutely love the origin version they chose to follow. I was a little disappointed that they chose to go with the older Billy, but at the same time I understand why it was a better choice to go with a fourteen-year-old version rather than a ten-year-old. From start to finish, it was a masterpiece. Having given mostly negative reviews for stories brought to the big screen it is a relief to finally find one that I actually like. The comedic moments in the movie made the serious ones that much more ominous and caused us to care about the characters while also being able to relate to them on a realistic scale. A favorite moment would be difficult to pick with such non-stop edge of your seat enjoyment. I would have loved to hear the name Captain Marvel mentioned at some point too, but I'm guessing there were copyright issues, even though it should fall under fair use. Still, we're all calling him 'the real' Captain Marvel after that. Also, if the problem with saying his name was a legal issue it was handled with extreme skill and tact, to the point where I honestly wouldn't have noticed they never said his name, until my husband mentioned it after the movie. Well done there too. With special effects on point, believable acting and characters, a well-directed, and well written rendition of the story-line, well balanced emotion toying, and getting high praise from all three of my kids (ages ranging from 9 to 12) such as: ""Very, very, very, very, good"", ""AWESOME!"", and ""Funny."" I'd have to say it's one of the best live action movies DC has released, and I'm happy to give it my first ten out of ten in...I think ever... Very well done and thank you to the creators for producing such an amazing movie. 😊",Shazam!
691,cyraswest,Movie full of heart! Solid.,9,14 April 2019,"Shazam has a great plot, well-written, with great actors. The only two complaints I have are that this movie was cut weirdly, and that it wasn't released during Christmas.
Dr. Savanna wasn't anything to write home about, but the seven deadly sins looked really cool. The character arc between Billy and the family is amazing.
So yeah, watch it!",Shazam!
692,rossmichael-75248,Overated and average. Felt more like a PG movie!,6,7 April 2019,"I don't understand the hype around this film? It was far from a bad movie but don't see how anyone can give this 9 or 10 stars? I found the action to be very repetitive and thought it needed more of an impact in terms of the execution of fight scenes.I found the film to be aimed more at kids and family where I can see how they may find this film more appealing. However, in terms of everyone else, I think it misses the mark with the humour beeing very light and childish. I didn't find anything in the movie 'hilarious'.Overall, not a bad execution of a DC Movie but this is not for everyone I am afraid. Easy film to watch but could have been better!",Shazam!

The only real difference is that Shazam can turn back into Billy and doesn't have to hide the fact that he's an adult the entire film.The film was funny and I did laugh a lot; although, the jokes were really just the same jokes from Big. Maybe there are just so many jokes to really pull off when you have this type of storyline, but I fell like the writers could have given us something new.The ending was great, and I won't mention anything about it to spoil it. The FX were spot on. Overall, the film was done really well. As far as DC films go, it was probably my favorite so far really. DC should stick to more family fun type of films and rely on their series to pull off the more serious adult themes. That's my opinion at least.I think a 7 out of 10 is a fair and honest rating for this one.",Shazam!

Zachary Levi was born to play this superpowered man-child, delivering lots of laughs alongside sarcastic but amiable co-star Jack Dylan Grazer. After an awkward and obligatory opening, the latter three quarters pack some big surprises for comics buffs and offer enough mainstream appeal to win over new fans. While Dr. Sivana ties in nicely with the themes of how adults can influence children, this villain is ultimately little more than a means to an end for the story of a boy who must learn what it takes to be a (super)man.",Shazam!

I get why he was the way he was and I totally get it and the reasons for the way it played out, but on a personal note I really wanted him to step up more and for me he just didn't.

If you don't like violence, this is not the movie for you, however I, being the sick sort of person I am, liked it.
Amazing casting. A really, really great cast. Mr. Levi did very well, and some of the best child actors were picked.
But, there's more criticism: I hated the villains, not because they were bad, but because they were... bad at being bad. They were not threatening and super cheesy, probably the only really cheesy part other than the opening.But yes, an overall good movie. I suppose if you're childish like me you will enjoy it as much as I did. But I wouldn't suggest showing this to young children. While I myself am a child, I'm not easily disturbed.

714,The_Man_XX7,A Fun DC movie With A Lot of Heart,7,18 April 2019,"With movies like Aquaman and Shazam DC are starting to find their footing and I look forward to more from the .In short the story of Shazam is about this boy with a pure heart gets powers from a wizard, now the movieis not too different from this premise but there is a little twist to it without spoiling much the pure heart thing goes a different direction and I liked that. Billy Batson played by Asher Angel did a good job, the dude is a good actor and him Jack Grazer who played Freddy Freeman, Billy's friend and adopted brother and Zachary Levy carried tnis movie. All of them had charm, wit and had very good emotional scenes when needed. Zachery Levy was good as Shazam you actually believed he was a child in a mans body , he also looked cool, goofy, funny and charismatic in the role so that's a big up.The side characters like Billy's adopted brothers and sisters were okay until the last act when something really cool happened I didn't suspect with all those characters and DC nalied it perfectly. The action to be honest was subpar and there weren't any memorable action sequences maybe some flashy moments when Shazam used his powers but the action was forgettable not necessarily bad but nothing spectacular. The tone and pacing of the movie was done really good, the overall tone of the movie was light-hearted and fun but emotional and serious when needed to be and you can't ask more than that. The first half took time to flesh out the characters and to have fun,be silly and didn't take itself seriously especially Shazam and Freddy. The move really nailed the concept of ""what would a kid do if he had superpowers"" and the movie portrayed that point nicely. Although the second half was really slow and the action was underwhelming, the story was great, suprising and slightly unpredictable along with its convincing character development.Like a said the movie had a lot of heart as you cared for the characters and they motivations, even the villain Doctor Sivana and the story arcs get resolved pretty satisfyingly. Now the villain Doctor Sivana played by Mark Strong had a pretty good story and the beginning of the movie and had a pretty compelling reason to beba villain he just turned out be be meh and generic by the end, Mark Strong was awesome but the character wasn't developed any further.The movie didn't have anything that was majorly bad but the pacing during the second half of the movie was rather slow and the action overall was underwhelming. Also the CGI was really good throughout the movie until the had to put some CGI on a certain character's muscles with was kinda bad but not completely terrible. The humor was also well timed and funny and not forced unlike some Marvel movies(sorry I just had to say it).I really enjoyed Shazam it was a very good movie, with a great story, funny comedy and the most interesting thing you can take away is it had heart, not the action or comedy but this DC movie had a lot of heart and I hope more DC movies continue on with this trend.",Shazam!
715,lmadorski,A very fun movie,7,6 April 2019,"Walking out of this movie, I knew I enjoyed it, but I didn't know to what extent. To tell you the truth, I still don't know. However, that doesn't change the fact that at the very least, this is a pretty good movie. Zachary Levi is absolutely fantastic as the lead role, and so is Asher Angel as the normal version. Both of them are really funny in their roles, though I would say Levi gets the majoryof the comedy, and Angel gets the more emotional stuff, which leads me to my next thing. This movie isn't just a comedy poking fun at the superhero genre, similar to Deadpool. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but we've seen it before. Shazam! does that, but it also makes you actually feel something for the characters. In order to do that, the other foster kid's performances have to be good. This is where the movie slightly fumbles for me. I don't think any of them are bad, but I do feel the ones outside of Jack Dylan Grazer are on the weaker side. I think Grazer does an excellent job, so they did a good job casting him. In terms of the story, there isn't much to really take in. The best parts in the movie are with Levi/Angel and Grazer's characters figuring out the superhero stuff. The villain add the threat that's needed to the movie, but I almost feel I could've watched a movie without a main villain and had it just focus on the hero for the story. Also, some of the cgi looks kind of iffy. I get the impression some of it was meant to be that way, but there are a few things that did take me out a little bit. I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a nice time at the theater with a movie they actually won't forget the second they leave.

717,abecipriano,"Fun, Funny and Fantastic",8,7 April 2019,"I'm happy to see DC / WB is on the right track with Shazam, after WW and Aquaman (never mind Suicide Squad and Justice League).Shazam is utterly enjoyable. Lots of rightly placed humor, heart and heroic stuff.Zach Levi is perfect as Shazam coz he has a great blend of child like enthusiasm, but projects a lot of heroism and heart at the right moments. His foster family is well cast, and they're great in their supporting role, providing the support, love and care that Billy Batson, a lifelong loner, needs.While it doesn't have some epic scale of some of the recent offerings by both DC and Marvel, I found it a very well made Origin story, and it appears to be closer to recent DC Comics versions of Shazam than the older ones I'm familiar with.I found some tone shifts a bit jarring, and some kids might be traumatized by the horror tones, but most teens and up should find it okay.It's not as highly rewatchable as Marvel's Captain Marvel to me, but I think it's a worthy addition to DCEU.Stay till the very end of the credits. There are 2 scenes.",Shazam!

I liked Aquaman quite a bit, and I don't hate Man of Steel. When I saw this trailer I was underwhelmed. To say I didn't like it enough was underselling it. I went to see it because of lack of choice in the cinemas. And I left the theatre absolutely loving it.It's not a perfect film. But it has a lot of heart and amazing comedy. Don't skip it.I also have to praise the marketing department for not revealing any of the major plot points in the theatre. More studios should learn from this. We don't need to see the whole movie in the trailer.5 out of 5 for me.",Shazam!

721,Artist_TRS,This Movie is Champion,10,4 August 2021,"2019's ""Shazam!"" is an endearing celebratory tribute of super-heroics and showcases the virtuous heart - what it means to be one. The movie draws focus to meaningful themes and demonstrates heartfelt morals like family, friendship, compassion, and trust. ""Shazam!"" surges deep charm that glows an effective homage to the genre. The world's mightiest mortal, the original and true Captain Marvel, ignites ""Shazam!"" with that same sense of unequaled glory from comics' golden age.I'm an avid fan and reader of the character's source comics; Captain Marvel / Shazam being my second favourite superhero below Batman. I'm very fond of the character and the imaginative story elements integrated, first depicted in Whiz Comics #2 of 1940. Elements of Ancient Greek mythology, magical fantasy, and the thematic and universally relatable internal conflict of the archetypal immoral human vices (the seven deadly sins).2019's movie ""Shazam!"" takes evident inspiration and derives most of its story beats from the 2012 New 52 comics incarnation of the character. Geoff Johns wrote an indelible story that revitalized and modernized Captain Marvel / Shazam for a new era. I personally believe it's the definitive version of the character. Gone were the duller traits of decades previous Billy Batson being a homeless boy with a blandly unwavering purity of heart; it was too simple and sanctimonious. Geoff Johns' run though, and superbly depicted in 2019's ""Shazam!"", has a delinquent orphan Billy Batson self-pitied and reticent, not readily sharing his feelings and thoughts with others. And often times in the character's beginnings, Batson is also discourteous of others, but that's what makes a much more compelling transformation of the character later in the story. Having that start, his character arc has a great contrasting evolution of ultimately learning the value of opening your heart to be strengthened by the support of others, family and friendships are what you make it to be - core themes of the movie's story - and Billy must sink or swim, must incorporate those thematic things to muster enough power to win against the conflict of Doctor Sivanna in the climactic third act of the movie. Billy Batson earns the status of a true hero by sharing his power, unlocking love and welcoming inclusion for his new adopting foster family. They form synergy through Billy. How is that not the epitome of the sort of traits that fans adore and admire about superheroes? It is to me. And that's why this movie is special.",Shazam!
722,joharitaylor,"Fun movie, but not the second coming",8,3 April 2019,"This is a rounded up 8/10 and a step in the right direction for DC and their first funny movie that didn't have forced humour e.g. I'm rich (groan).
While I mostly liked this movie there are a few things that didn't blow me away:
1. Special effects - I don't know what it is, but they just don't seem to do it as well as Marvel. Some of the flight scenes and monster effects were very average.
2. Superman's Cameo - no face shot? Really? What a cop out this is - it would have been better without the cameo. Going back to the MCU, they'd never do a rubbish no face cameo.
3. The Marvel Family - it's a little lame in this day and age, however probably suitable for a family audience.
That said I really enjoyed the movie and glad they didn't mess up my third favourite supehero.",Shazam!

727,lraimundo,A standalone DC movie in the DCEU,7,6 April 2019,"This movie is so entertaining. It stands by itself in the DCEU because it has it's own tone and tyle. The character development is well written, specially in Billy Batson. Zachary Levi as Shazam is the best part of the movie, he's made for this role. Freddy Freemam is a relly good sidekick for Shazam, he is like every kkd who is a hardcore fan of superheroes, so it's easy to relate. Mark Strong's character (Dr. Sivana) lacks of an original motivation, though, but his performance is good.
The CGI could be better, it was not bad, but neither was great. Even though, the Seven Deadly Sins design could have been a LOT better, they didn't matched with the tone of the movie, and they wasn't eaay to recognize.
The music was good, it emphasized some scenes, but wasn't memorable either. It reaembled me of the Avengers theme a few times.",Shazam!
728,arskhemnanilack,Shazam! - 8.9/10,9,31 March 2019,"This movie really revived DC's reputation for it's origin movies, and good ones are what it needs for its recently started DCEU. Shazam! executes the superhero genre so well and sets new standards for comedy in the genre, up there with Thor Ragnarok. This movie had an incredible plot, which implied a great moral in which is made sense of and truly works naturally. All of the people who played in this movie truly did a great job at acting, and Zachary Levi absolutely killed it as Shazam represents Billy Batson so well. The link between Doctor Sivana and Shazam throughout the story works very well, and they both feel like solid characters. The movie delivers very exciting and extremely powerful scenes, even without that many fighting scenes. The movie doesn't go too far and stays at a good pace in order to very much make it feel like an origin movie. The comedy in the film was implemented well mostly, and got many laughs throughout. The comedy is used a little bit too much in some scenes that I'd rather have it not be in, which takes away from the image and vision that we should be feeling and seeing in those certain scenes and the comedy tends to take away from that. This film also very strongly pulls strings to the comics, and therefore played it safe for this one. Shazam! delivers an outstanding movie, and many awesome surprises fans wouldn't expect, especially in the 2nd half. This movie is gonna stay up there this year as one of the best superhero flicks, and definitely one of the most fun movies in a very long time. Shazam! is definitely worth watching, and be sure to stay for the after credits, especially if you're a DC fan. The film sets high standards for what is coming this year, and it definetely seems we have a very exciting year for movies this year, especially with Avengers: Endgame right around the corner and Spider-man: Far From Home shortly after.",Shazam!

There are some tributes in the movie towards the old Christopher Reeves Superman films which is appreciated. I liked that the movie tried to make us feel like we're watching a comic book movie and that it was self aware .There were times they were actually making a parody of comic book movies. The acting is very good, Zachary Levi could easily had made the interpretation campy but he just hits every note and makes the hero feel like an adult kid perfectly.
On the negative side, I didn' t liked the motivation of the villain because it felt like that his motivation was forced. It's just felt weird he would keep the motivation so alive from the point where he gets the motivation to do evil to the point he is doing evil, based on that reason alone.",Shazam!
733,phoenixnethermoor,Film Review: Shazam!,7,3 January 2020,"Shazam! is an okay film. It is not great, but it does come with the occasional serious battle scene. Shazam! is mainly for kids, as there is the unfunny joke or comment that only kids would find funny, but there are also a few adult jokes snuck in there. Shazam! is about a foster kid, who lives in a foster house. One day, he escapes from some bullies and gets the chance to be a superhero. He accepts, leaving the rest of the film to be about his superhero and private life. But is it family friendly? There are a few swear words, scary scenes and tiny drops of blood but apart from that Shazam! is fine to watch. The scary scenes involve CGI monsters attacking humans. 7/10.",Shazam!
734,ma-01629,Surprisingly A Ton of Fun,8,5 September 2020,"Shazam is surprisingly a really fun DC movie. Most DC movies are usually dark and gritty but Shazam is the opposite. It's a fun lighthearted story with fun characters and fun jokes and a fun story. It knows what it's doing and it does it really well. The tone is very consistent throughout with jokes but there are still some really emotional moments like when Billy meets his mom that tug at your heartstrings.The acting as well is phenomenal. The child actors do a marvelous job and are clearly having loads of fun, same with Zachari Levi.There's also great characters and character development. Billy learns to accept his family, Freddie whilst being a very talkative and silly boy just wants to have a friend and stop being bullied, which you feel and Billy's superhero self learns ""with great power comes great responsibility"". Sounds familiar? Billy's family as well are also very charming and are very important in the plot and you care for the family. The villain is also well developed with understandable motivations.The problem is the 3rd act. The concept of 6 Shazams in a theme park sounds like a great idea. The execution is awful though. The choreography is boring and unexciting. It doesn't look like a final battle and the jokes just don't land. At that point they become oversaturated and don't work given the context of what's going on and I don't know if it's just me but the CGI is pretty bad. It is so clear the suits, the characters flying and the 7 deadly sins are CGI and it knocks the movie down.Regardless, this movie is still incredible and I'd recommend it.",Shazam!

Actually after AQUAMAN, I thought this movie could be good too and DC may be figuring its way out but boy I was wrong. This seriously feels like a spoof movie. I appreciate the humor in the movie but blending of humor, story, action etc. is important.

741,whiterose-54828,Big Meets Superman,8,12 October 2021,"Shazam! Follows an adopted boy named Billy Batson who gains the ability to transform himself into an adult superhero. With the help of his foster brother Freddy Freeman he comes to terms with his newfound powers and fulfils his destiny to fight evil.The movie is a lot of fun with a heartwarming story about family and fitting in, it's refreshing to have a superhero movie that feels self contained and tells it's story simply and effectively without the need to set up the next big crossover or randomly throw other superheroes into the story.Another aspect I like about the movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously and is full of great comedic moments, it helps it stand out from it's fellow DC movies which are often dark and gloomy in tone.The scenes of Billy testing out his powers make for some fun jokes and I like how they show that he's still a child by having him use his powers irresponsibly to show off and get what he wants while still showing that he has a good heart and is willing to fight evil and save the day when it comes down to it. Zachary Levi does a great job at playing a child in an adult's body trying his best to be a superhero.The villain Dr. Sivana fell a little flat for me, they do a good job of setting up his backstory early on and you can understand where he is coming from to an extent but once he gains his powers he just becomes a generic superhero movie bad guy complete with his generic evil minions. I would have liked more scenes between him and Billy as he seems to have a more sympathetic side to his character that isn't fully explored.Overall Shazam! Isn't the best superhero movie out there, perhaps not even the best of DC's output but it's a fun movie with a lot of heart and a concise story that's worth watching.",Shazam!

I wasn't disappointed. it's edgier than your average teen flick and does poke fun at superhero stereotypes. There are some laugh out loud moments and the characters are well defined opening the door to a potential sequel/ team-up. To be fair to this film, it's difficult to come up with something original when we are suffering from a Marvel/ DC superhero hangover. however this family friendly film ticks a lot of the right boxes.",Shazam!

Perfectly executed comedy with some family value morality. DC had it's blacklash after BvS and Justice league but after aqua-man this movie gave hope for the DCEU. Keeping the DC name up there with respect. Now my thoughts on the the casting are i mean "" Zachery Levi"" as Shazam, whoever casted him for the lead role did an absolutely fantastic job. His did the character justice it deserved. His comedic timing was perfect, his serious acting was perfect and so on. And that brothers and sisters of the wizard realm part was so surprising, i didnt thought they were gonna pull up something like that, which was freaking amazing. And the last part when Superman shoes up at the school haha great stuff only wish Henry Calvin made a cameo uff icing on the cake. GREAT movie one of the best movie of 2019.",Shazam!

749,pluem_chaisiri,A refreshing take for the DCEU,7,24 April 2019,"I went to watched Shazam a few weeks ago, expecting nothing impressive. However, I came out from the movie, quite impressed with the film. This is what DC has been missing with its recent films. Just a very simple family friendly film, Shazam is a great mix between comedy and light drama.The casts are great and they have good chemistry. I absolutely adore the boy who played Freddy. He was amazing, funny and very lovable. As for Shazam, I think that Zachary Levi did a great job, playing a kid in an adult's body. Although, there is a gap between young Billy and old Billy, it is something that can be dismissed. And I think the differences do make sense, since that's probably how I would also act, if I could suddenly turn into someone else.What I also like about Shazam is that it is something you can actually relate to. The hero, Shazam or Billy Batson is just a normal boy. He doesn't try to save the world or do anything for the greater cause, instead he just tries to protect the things he loved.In conclusion, I like this film and I think you should give it a go. It's great and it's a nice change for the DCEU.",Shazam!

752,ThisisFizban,Had it's high points but pretty uneven,5,19 May 2019,"I was not familiar with the Shazam comics hardly at all so I felt like I was going in with a clean slate. The movie was pretty entertaining BUT the movie had some problems and not all of it was the filmmaker's fault. The actual character and nature of Shazam has some flaws. First off the thing with him saying the name to transform....I mean...kind of weird in my opinion. And then at the end he just transfers the powers to the other foster kids? Does that mean he can make an army of Shazams or were the foster kids special in some way? Pure in heart perhaps? I don't know, it didn't make sense to me. I think this is the result of trying to adapt such an old character. I don't know, I'm probably putting too much thought into this but my brain just naturally wants to figure it out. Anyways, another complaint is that the story just didn't know what kind of movie it wanted to be. I could see it going in multiple directions but then it would switch gears. And this other complaint is connected to the previous but the pacing seemed off and uneven to me. Fight scenes just didn't seem to flow. Why was the bad guy just stalking around watching Shazam struggle? Wouldn't he just jump in and try to kill him as fast as possible? And the scene with the bus, why was Shazam struggling so much to save the people. I mean he had the power to do it but he was reluctant. He's kind of a loner and a bit selfish but he's not that heartless. The villain fell short. He was really interesting at first but then he just became the stereotypical bad guy that gave evil monologues and acted really serious. But besides all that, there were some good laughs. I liked all the foster kids and the parents. I don't think I would recommend this movie to others.",Shazam!

Overall a great movie with lots of fun element.,Shazam!
756,readjacksonporter,DCEU At Its Most Promising,8,27 March 2019,"Shazam! is directed by David F. Sanberg (Lights Out, Annabelle: Creation), written by Henry Gayden (Earth to Echo) and stars Zachary Levi as Billy Batson/Shazam.The film follows 14-year-old Billy Batson, an orphan boy who keeps running from foster homes. When he gets adopted by a couple who share a home with many foster kids, Billy is soon granted magical, wizard powers, and discovers that when he says the wizard's name, Shazam, he turns into an adult male with super-hero like abilities.The DCEU isn't much of a franchise at this point. Aquaman was so separated from other films in the franchise, it's essentially its own thing. Shazam! follows suit. While there are references to Superman, Batman, and other Justice League heroes throughout, the film isn't concerned with connecting dots or setting up a franchise. It tries to be its own thing.The strongest aspect of this film by far is Zachary Levi. A ravingly underrated actor, Levi brings this film the energy, charm, and humor it needs. He plays the role of a teenage boy stuck in a man's body not only well, but eerily convincingly so. Jack Dylan Grazer, who plays Billy's foster brother Freddy, is also great. Neurotic and hilarious, he helps further convince you of this film's ridiculous premise.Asher Angel, who plays young Billy Batson, got the short end of the stick here, as he's given a character who hides his emotions. So while he still feels like Billy, he's the less entertaining half of Billy. Nonetheless, he delivers a great performance, and the film lands because of him.The rest of the cast is alright, with some weak performances and a decent one from Mark Strong.The script is another strength here. It balances humor and drama, horror and light-heartedness, and character and spectacle better than any DCEU film so far. I cared about these characters. I understood their motivations and their desires.The film is a character piece more than a super-hero film, though. The story isn't about a boy who turns into an adult super-hero battling evil, it's about a boy learning to grow up and accept the things he's ignored his whole life. Billy must realize he must pursue what he needs, not what he wants, and he comes to understand that everything he believed to be true is wrong. It's fantastic, and it's what makes the entire third act land.This movie is self-aware. It carries a plethora of tongue-in-cheek references, and never forgets to make you laugh. The humor is natural, fresh, and never undermines the dramatic tension of the film.Sanberg's direction is strong here. There are definitely some horror-tinged sequences. I'll have to see it a second time to really analyze how this film was shot, but if I remember correctly, it rarely goes large. The movie doesn't try to be a spectacle, and instead simmers down and remains small unlike it's hero.The score is great. The soundtrack is amazing. I had some genuine laughs. While the film is definitely one set piece too long, and could have been tightened down in its third act, I don't have many complaints outside of that.It also brings its own spin to the super-hero genre. This is definitely a family super-hero film. I would argue it's even more of a family super-hero film than The Incredibles. And aside from some mild language and a couple scary scenes (it earns it's PG-13 rating), it's one of the more wholesome super-hero movies to come along in a while.I loved this film. Everybody here knocked it out of the park. It has heart and humor and a great message. Hands down the best DCEU film. I can't wait to see what they do with the future movies.So far, it's my favorite film of the year.B+",Shazam!

How superhero movie like this able to keep the balance between it's comical tone and center drama story is astonishingOther than another caped crusader movie, Shazam is a story about two people shaped by their families. Both Dr. Sivana and Billy grew up without getting love and affection from their parents to become selfish person of their own. (the choice of Billy as Shazam is a bit questionable here)
The only different is, Billy with the help of Shazam is able to find what is meant to be a part of family and learn about sharing and caring for one another, meanwhile Dr. Sivana doesn't (being set the film in Christmas time evokes the viewers sort of warm family film feeling)The casting of Zachary Levi is perfect. Kid actors are good too, especially I love Freddy. Visual effect are not in the same league as the it predecessor The Aquaman, but since this movie don't rely on them too much, it is okIf I had to give some criticism, Dr. Sivana makes a interesting and convincing villian. Unlike any other antagonists in DCEU, he is not ""I'm gonna wipe all the people of planet earth"" type, this man is power-hungry animal, he only wants to feel perfect. But as good as the character is, Mark Strong performances is not. Final fight is a bit dragged, could have shortened. The role of Seven Deadly Sins as individual feels a bit downplayed than they originally areBeing set in Philadelphia, the film gives a lot of references to Rocky and also to other DCEU characters, there is a suprise guest at the end.
Shazam, a story of a boy who turned into god like superhero when he said the six little words ""S-H-A-Z-A-M"" gives reference to other iconic movie about a boy who went from 12 to 30 years old. Sounds familiar? yeah, this gives a direct homage to Tom Hank's Big in one of it's fight scene and that is the most satisfying thing I got from movies this year so far",Shazam!
759,its_Suvo,Entertaining and enjoyable!,7,6 April 2019,"Shazam ! Dceu's latest film is throughly entertaining and hits the ball out of park.
Pros
Zachary levi as shazam
Simple story
Cinematography
Cons
Villain - this movie adds another forgettable cb villain. Dr. Sivana just wants to take shazam's power and he will do anything for it. That's it ! Nothing more nothing less.
On the other hand they developed film's main guy billy batson's character really well. Could've been a fun Christmas movie , but they released in limited period before endgame.",Shazam!
760,rowens-38622,Unfortunately I'm a grown up.,3,7 April 2019,"If ""You shave, probably have pubic hair""-Jason Bateman in ""Paul"", you will probably find this movie as uninteresting as I did. The plot of juvenile, and so is the script. The villain is unfortunately the exact same villain Mark Strong plays in every single movie. It takes way too long to get to the point, and to get past the origin, and struggles of new super powers. It's like DC made a kindergarten version of Deadpool, and sucked at it.",Shazam!
761,judicmr,Good Kid Movie,6,2 May 2019,"I went in expecting a mediocre movie, and that's what I got. But, I have to say, a movie about superheroes for kids makes more since than a one for adults.

762,kojap,not your typical super hero movie,4,6 April 2019,"Extremely lighthearted to the point I was never concerned about the wellbeing of any of the main characters.
The plot was a typical origin story, new powers, adjusting to his new role etc..as recent as this movie tries to be, the jokes are very dated, as is his lame dance(very 2016).
This isn't a movie I'd recommend and definitely don't need to see a sequelz",Shazam!

766,dmyrwood,Shazam! ( with the exclamation mark!;),8,1 August 2019,I was pretty excited for this one cuz it just looked like a fun DC superhero film and it delivered it's almost like the old style superhero films without it feeling outdated( even some of how the story goes and the tone reminds me of the first Raimi Spider-Man film) and of course Zachary Levi is very good as shazam so funny and the kid actors were pretty good only problem can be is sometimes billy batson and shazam can be different from each other and the villain was decent enough he gets some development so you can kinda understand him but at the same time is the typical super villain but he was a good threat to the hero which is good. And some great surprises at the end that I really enjoyed. Only problems can be like the shazam and billy thing and the villain that I mentioned and the movie while may look like a movie kinda one of those movies where it can be that at times and sometimes not cuz can get a bit intense for the little guys at times ( parents have been warned!!) and movie can get a bit slow in middle but not too bad and it picks back up very quickly overall came to get a fun superhero origin film and that's what I got it's a fun time and gives me a bit more faith in DC now;) ( fingers crossed for future films 🤞),Shazam!

Wish they would stop with the dark, brooding characatures and do something family-friendly for a change. I was impressed. The language was still too much, but at least the story was something not solely focused at the college crowd.
Hoping that DC will use this experience to learn before Marvel puts them squarely out of business.
The lead was absolutely PERFECT for the role. Kuddos galore for him.
As adoptive parents, we appreciated the underdog tone (much like Percy Jackson) that made Billy so relatable. Maybe this is a precurser of things to come.",Shazam!

I still prefer the DC TV universe but most of the movies have ranged from ok to ""really?""Then Captain Sparklefingers (see the movie for the reference) and I was blown away.Like Marvel, it's set in a real city (Philadelphia). It's not Gotham or Metropolis or Coast City.It's not grim. It's not ""Deadpool"" funny but I spent a lot of time smiling. It takes itself seriously enough to be interesting but not so seriously that the plot gets weighed down.It even has a pair of post-credit scenes!It anchors itself firmly in the DC universe, with references to other characters but it's enough to be charming and not so much that the film gets weighed down by their angst.This is probably my favorite DC movie since ""Wonder Woman.""

773,haydenagain,Just say the word and you get... A Darn good movie!,8,30 August 2019,"SHAZAM! That's right readers, a bolt of lightning has just turned us into almighty superheroes all for our next exciting review for the DCEU's next title, Shazam. In a long list of Dark and Gritty attempts to live up to the simplicity of Nolans Dark Knight trilogy of DC films, can Shazam be the one movie to defy them all? Well, let's get started.
Plot
Shazam follows the story of a lost orphan boy called Billy Batson. On an endless goose chase to find his mother. After getting in trouble with the authorities, Billy becomes a part of an estranged family who he begins to form a bond towards. But his life gets even more bizarre as a mysterious Magician turns Billy Batson into the almighty superhero of Shazam. As he enjoys toying with his newfound abilities, the mad scientist Dr Sivana and his power over the Deadly Sins has set him in his sights who plans to absorb the power of Shazam for himself. Leaving the fate of all mankind in Billy Batson's hands.
Likes
Shazam is a superhero comedy film that blends the magic of what made films such as Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy beloved classics. Unlike the previous DCEU entries that have gotten infamous due to their dark, gritty, confusing and mean-spirited nature, Shazam subverts them in the way that fans of the character would expect to see. Bringing in plenty of light, humour and sense of fun and excitement into the mix.
The characters and plot are cleverly well-written and enjoyable to watch. Teaching us the importance of life, family, friendship and putting the past behind you. And it also keeps itself in line with much of its adapted source material to the point it is literally Shazam himself coming to life.
Asher Angel and Zachery Levi are fantastic in the roles of Billy Batson and Shazam. Both delivering excellent performances in Kid and Adult sizes. Not once do these actors break character and completely stay in synch with their personalities.
Jack Grazer as Billy's adoptive brother Freddy Freeman was a good way to add in some well-needed comic relief and to help develop Shazams cinematic outing in his fight against crime. What I like most about him to is that he is a comic book nerd and a disabled person (like me). Who doesn't let others push him around and helps his friends and family to the best of his abilities.
Mark Strong returns to the DC Universe as Dr Sivana. Who undoubtedly is much better in this role than how he portrayed Sinestro in the failed Green Lantern movie. Giving us a menacing, but tragic take on a man who had little respect from anyone throughout his life all to be corrupted so easily by evil.
Dislikes
DC films may be getting better in the likes section of these reviews nowadays. But as always, there is usually a dislike somewhere on the line.
Now the CGI is much cleaner than what we got with previous DCEU entries. But it still does look pretty cheap looking in comparison to the clean graphics the MCU is used to having. The worst offenders are the Seven Deadly Sins as they kind of look a little plastic-like than being slimy evil monsters which one would expect to see. I mean, they could have had the potential to be pretty scary villains in this movie, but the special effects surrounding them is weak.
And lastly. No Black Adam appearance. I was hoping that when Shazam got a movie he would have the chance to fight his greatest enemy of Black Adam, the ruthless king of the nation of Kahndaq. But we got a lesser known villain of Dr Sivana and in comparison every fan would rather have Black Adam as the main villain in this movie than him. Not saying that Mark Strong doesn't do well with his take on him, just that it's not the villain I was expecting to see in the movie. But maybe if this film is successful enough we might see them fight each other in the sequel maybe?
But on top of that, Shazam aint all as bad as one would expect.
Verdict?
In a world where Marvel Studios dominates the local box-office while DC is all but left behind with their own failures of setting up a Shared Universe with Batman V Superman and Justice League. Shazam is proof that DC has learnt from their mistakes and know what it takes to deliver an interesting movie that doesn't need to have a certain Dark Knight to guarantee its success story. Offering tons of heart-warming humour, characters and action that cries out enjoyment at nearly every moment. Even if you aren't a fan of the character, but want to forget about how bad those DC films mentioned above were, you'd be a fool to miss out on this.
I give Shazam an 8½/10!",Shazam!
774,hesterroozeboom,Shamazing,9,29 March 2019,"I don't think I've ever been this enthusiastic about a Superhero movie before. Its original and very fun to watch. The comedy in this movie was so clever and very well written. The movie wasn't perfect, but overall they did a great job!
But what made this movie so great was Zachary Levi! He wás Shazam. Zachary was born to play this part. He really felt like a 14 year old boy who turned into a superhero. Without making it a stereotype.
Also, the villain played by Mark Strong did not disappoint. He made the character feel believable. He wasn't only a mad scientist, he was even kinda relatable.Just go and see it, you will nog regret it",Shazam!
775,thesupertomster,Fun and light-hearted,7,6 April 2019,"I think it's not too controversial to say that Shazam is one of the best superhero movies of 2019 so far - not that there's that much to compete with. The goofy and light-hearted tone is a nice change of pace from the serious and often depressing films that DC has become best known for, making for a film that is most admirable for its refusal to ground itself in reality (although the filmmakers could certainly have pushed this ridiculousness even further).That being said, many moments and scenes in this film were surprisingly extremely dark. While I'm not sure what the exact intention of this choice was, it creates a humorous contrast with the silliness of the Shazam character and plot line. It also gives a sense of real consequence and danger with plenty of death and destruction that actually feels impactful, as opposed to the larger-scale scenes in earlier DC films which fail to have any effect whatsoever. Although Shazam suffers from occasional superhero action fatigue, it's mostly quite tongue-in-cheek and almost parodic in nature, which naturally fits the tone very well.While Shazam certainly held even more potential than what was delivered, it's a fun self-contained story which does well to poke fun at the superhero genre, and marks a definite step in the right direction for DC",Shazam!

Word of caution, although its a 12A, I wouldn't recommend taking kids under the age of about as there are some very scary 'monsters' in it that are not in the trailer. I took my almost 8 year old and they were too much for him. Other 12A films are fine so there's a bit of inconsistency in the ratings of these films. Other than that he loved it. I don't see how it can be given more than an 8 out of 10 though as it's a superhero film at the end of the day.",Shazam!
778,lviniciusmiranda,I wasn't a fan of Shazam until I watched this,8,4 February 2020,"I confess. When I saw they were making a movie about Shazam I thought ""Why???"". However, when I watched this was one of the first times my wife decided to come with me to watch a superhero movie. I was worried because I thought she would hate it and it would ruin my chances of taking her to other super hero movies. I was wrong. This movie was a lot of fun, we laughed a lot, ate popcorn, had a good time and she left the theater saying ""I didn't think superhero movies could be so much fun"".

DCEU wouldn't be able to film a movie like Endgame in a million years. And I don't hate DC, far from that, Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy is one of my favorites ever, but DCEU is a massacre. Please stop making these stupid movies while Marvel is on top, cause anything won't get even close. Shazam looks like some '90s kids movie. And what's all about with end credits made like punk comic when it's already seen.. and of course, in Marvel movie, Spiderman Homecoming.

Billy is actually more mature as a kid than the adult Shazam. Who is the audience for this? Kids? Teens maybe? I really can't tell. I definitely wouldn't recommend this for fans of the original -- it's just too silly.If you enjoyed the 40's serial, this is not something you'll see as an homage story. It's basically a ripoff of the concept for teenagers who never heard of Shazam.",Shazam!

2019
Dir: David F. Sandberg
Runtime: 2hr 12mins
Rated: PG-13Synopsis: We all have a superhero inside us, in Billy Batson's case shouting the name Shazam! turns the 14 year old into the adult superhero Shazam.Busy busy day, which means for a late review of last nights film. Superhero films always will be my favorite even comic book or not but the ones that come straight from DC or Marvel will always hold more weight for me. I maybe own a single Shazam! comic from the 90s and its like a mid story arc issue so there's not much context. Pretty sure they stayed true to most of the origin story of Shazam. The subway train I'm pretty positive is straight from the comics and obviously getting his powers from the wizard is straight from the comics. They add a part that is kind of a twist toward the end but if you've read the comics or have seen the animated movies in the past it's almost expected and was a great addition to the film. Like most origin films it has a bit slow start but being more of a fun comedic superhero tale in the DCEU they kept the midway not boring as most struggle to do with origin films. This was a complete story arc that worked well with introducing the character and even giving the main character purpose as should the villain. The villain also was not wasted which is I'm not mistaken is just Dr. Sivana, not sure if he's a more important villain in the comics. But they gave the character Depth and reason for why he is doing what he is doing instead of just giving a villain and saying ""this is the bad guy"" no reason other than he's evil. The costumes and effects look greats although I know that Zachary Levi (Shazam) bulked up to play the role of the hero you can clearly tell that a lot of the suit is padding which almost gives it a cartoon feel to it. It's a little cheesy but I'm not mad at it considering it works really well with the style of the film. The lighting bolts the bullets bouncing off all looked great. The characters were great considering most are kids and I usually have a peeve about kid actors unfortunately. Usually they are too cheesy and not convincing enough but this cast did great. If you've read or seen any of Billy's back story you'll know that he lives in a foster home with other kids that are also foster kids. All different ethnicities and backgrounds which was really really well casted. The kids looked almost identical to their comic book counterparts. Mark Strong as a villain is always a good choice because although the film has a very light feel to it he can bring a certain kind of seriousness to the film the same way he did in KickAss. Absolutely a theater watch and it probably would have been more fun on opening night with a bunch of super nerds. I'll probably end up buying this as I've got all the DCEU films with the exception of Aquaman right now so I'm a little behind. My only complaint about the film leading off was at the beginning they tell the story of how Billy becomes an orphan but it's not explained until the end of the film. Which in turn works out but it didn't really set well with me at first.Rotten tomatoes scored it as 91% and I see why. It's literally a perfect superhero film which at its core is all it is. It's not an action film like an avengers movie or a dark comic book take like BVS. It's not drama driven like Wonder Woman but it's a pure superhero film on its own which hasn't been done since in a long time.",Shazam!
787,maylilyx,The worst superhero movie,1,6 June 2020,"One of the worst superhero movies that I've ever seen. Boring characters, rules for powers that keep changing. Weird premise of children and teens turning into superheroes and when they do, they also become adults? What does this add to the viewing experience? Also some of the worst humor I've ever seen.",Shazam!
788,fsimpson-23439,The Movie The DCEU Needed,9,9 April 2019,"So DC Superhero films are a mixed bag. When they are not in a universe, you have The Dark Knight Trilogy, possibly one of the greatest movie trilogies known to man. And then you have the DCEU. 6 films in, and only 1 of them is a critical and commercial hit (Wonder Woman, Aquaman is divisive amongst critics). Enter Shazam, the shining saviour the DCEU needed, and quite frankly it's DC's best film since The Dark Knight (I haven't fully seen The Dark Knight Rises). Whether it's better than Wonder Woman, you can decide. But for me, this is the best film in the DCEU. But that's not saying much, when it's competition is Batman vs Superman and Suicide Squad. Without further ado, let's talk about the film.The plot is fine and pretty good. It's not too complex, but it's not over simplified either. Billy Batson gets lots of powers from a wizard, who dies in The Snap immediately afterwards, learns to use them, and encounters a one-eyed man who has the power of religion on his side with The Seven Deadly Sins, who look pretty good. It's sad how this movie has a budget of around 100 million, yet looks prettier in CGI than Justice League which had a budget of over 300 million. Nice job DC. Tonally, the films work fine as well. It's light hearted, but delves into things like foster families in a nice touch. I nearly cried in one of the scenes, and I didn't expect that. But then again, I got scared in some of the scenes because this film has horror. And I didn't see that coming, even though the director's previous films are horror films (Lights Out and Annabelle: Creation). The film was very funny, and the comedy is top-notch. The characters are all great as well. Asher Angel as normal Billy was funny, but Zachary Levi as adult Billy was perfect, balancing the gap between the two different Billy's. I didn't like the way adult Billy acted, because he was basically being an asshole, but then I realised this is how a kid would act should they be given superpowers so I bought into his realistic arc. Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy, Billy's foster brother, was hilarious as well, and very believable as a character. As for the villain, it wasn't all bad for DCEU standards. Mark Strong as Dr Thaddeus Sivana was actually alright. He wanted to be super, for power, greed, and was an outcast just like Billy. And the final battle isn't great, but is passable considering DCEU's previous efforts. Also, The Seven Deadly Sins were in it, and they were alright. They were actually kind of scary, but didn't have much of a presence.As for problems, the pacing wasn't that good and the 1st and 3rd acts weren't anything special, it's in the middle where you get the most fun. So overall, if you liked the trailer, you will like the film. I highly recommend it, I can say that this Captain Marvel is better than Marvel's Captain Marvel (which I gave 3 stars) and it's one of DC's best in a long time. It's better than Wonder Woman (by a little bit) and has a feel-good attitude towards itself. So overall, it gets a 9/10, but I'll round that down to 4 stars. That's all from me.",Shazam!

You will witness a fresh story, unexaggerated acting, good editing, and an astute direction - all summed up in a natty and engaging comedy superhero flick.

795,ullasharma-95619,SHAZAM! Of laughter!,10,5 April 2019,"For starters , this movie isn't like any of your regular super hero movies. It is poles apart from other DCEU movies in terms of character and composition.The movie is not only suitable for all age groups , it also appeals to all age groups. It has a very good light touch to the story and doesn't get all that serious.
The movie has proven that it doesn't need to have adult jokes to be genuinely funny , and we indeed lacked it in theaters around us.Unlike how Clark Kent discovers his powers in a stoic , non funny manner and how he is taught by the Kent's to be responsible- Billy is quite the opposite , however with a good heart.Zachary has done a great job in bringing the kid out - but however Billy batson role is quite serious and doesn't sit well with Shazam. A little bit of humor and wittiness would have made the character of Shazam more streamlined with Billy.This movie is not loaded with special effects and spectacular fights but however ends up being thoroughly enjoyable.What led down this movie a bit , is the BG score - Shazam doesn't get a memorable theme like the dark Knight or Aquaman.All in all - I am SO happy to see DCEU coming around. 😊😊😊",Shazam!
796,battlecrusadersgames,The best DC movie in a long time,8,27 June 2019,"In a period saturated with superhero movies, this could have easily gone past without notice, but thanks to an awesome script and cast it doesn't just match others, it surpasses them.
The story revolves around a teenager from a foster home that has to change his rebellious attitude and outlook on order to save humanity and defeat a evil super villain. It may not sound particularly original, but thankfully this tried and tested format is done to perfection. The movie is filled with humour and doesn't take itself too seriously, unlike many other superhero movies and the best thing is, although it has that humour, it doesn't distract from the story, meaning it has purpose and we can actually care about the characters.
The cast is well chosen too especially the on screen chemistry between Zachary Levi and his on screen friend played by Jack Dylan Grazer.

I really liked this movie but somewhere along the way some things were just...wrong, I guess. I don't know, like, the story swayed a bit. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't give this a watch. Definetely one of the greater movies from DC. So give it a watch.",Shazam!
801,tabachoi,Parent-approved 👌,9,7 April 2019,Watched this with my 6-yr old daughter and we had lots of fun! I saw her face light up with awe that reminded me of the first time I saw the first Christopher Reeves Superman movie. That moment alone deserved this 9-star rating.,Shazam!
802,x-69785,Unexpectedly wonderful.,8,15 May 2020,"Although Shazam! is similar to some superheroes in character setting and plot development, this superhero looks more like ""a small potato"". I like its relaxed and humorous style. Although I can't tell the specific difference, I feel that it is different from other superhero movies. Maybe the whole background is not ""American"" at all?",Shazam!
803,cotita-1,So they can make AWESOME DC movies.,9,6 April 2019,"I have to say this is the most fun and exciting DC movie.Everything just fits.
The acting, the story, the villain, the jokes, the cameos are top notch.I had little faith in Zachary Levy, but man does he deliver. He is perfect for the role, its like Tom Hanks with superpowers in BIG.The only downside is that I don't think it will make as much money as other DC much less Marvel movies, as its stuck between Captain Marvel and End Game.I only wish WB resurrects the idea of Justice Leage.",Shazam!
804,jelaniwilliams305,I LOVED SHAZAM!,9,5 April 2019,"I was able to see the Fandango pre-screening of Shazam on 3/23 and this film is awesome. It has a little bit of everything; it's HILARIOUS, it's family-oriented, it has tear jerk moments and it has horror elements...literally OH, CRAP type horror...the director leaned hard into his horror roots. The trailer didn't do this film justice at all...tons of other surprises in store. The cast was great all around; Zachary Levi was perfect as the titular character and his chemistry with Freddy (Jack Dylan Grazer) was excellent. Dr. Sivanna (Mark Strong) was a great villain; he was a straight up SAVAGE and you'll see why. I loved ALL of the foster kids but Darla (Faithe Herman) was my favorite; she was so adorable and she stole EVERY scene she was in. My only nitpick is the 1st part of the film was a little slow; I find that happens with most superhero origin films but if the ends justify the means, then I can forgive it, and the slow build up was worth the wait because this film ends on such a high note. Also, the CGI is a little wonky at times but it's a low budget film and it wasn't nearly as bad as some other CBM's. If you're a reader of the Shazam comics (especially New 52), you'll notice a lot of references and Easter Eggs but you don't have to know the comics to enjoy this film. I definitely recommend it.",Shazam!
805,danstevon,Brings out the kid in you!,8,1 January 2020,"I think DC have done a good thing here, this isn't massive, it isn't even trying to compete with Marvel's universe and the spectacle that is The Avengers. Shazam is a good family film like they made in the 80's. Yes it's superhero, but it has (in my opinion) more in common with the tons of family films that came out way back when, it just gets something right. It's got a great and simple story, great laughs and action. A great slightly over the top villain and a good message about family. Not bad when I thought I'd turn it off after half an hour. If you like Gremlins, Ghostbusters, Monster Squad etc you're in for a treat.",Shazam!
806,liuliuliuyifei,"Pretty genetic, nothing new",2,5 April 2019,"Recent years, the only type of film I keep watching is superhero film. So compare shazam to another superheroo, I will rank it between capital marvel and Thort 2. Most of the jokes I don't really find it funny, I don't find it organic either. The conflict such search for Belly's mom, The bond between his foster family, the final Superman suddenly appear, How shazam grow from a coward to a hero, all these details I don't find myself believe any of them. I don't know is this because of my superhero fatigue or what, but I don't find this movie watching experience great at all, even make me want leave during the film.",Shazam!
807,AttorneyJenn,Another DC disappointment,6,13 August 2019,"Another DC disappointment but then again, besides Wonder Woman, it's the only kind of movie they make. I felt like I was watching an episode of Power Rangers which I never watched even as a child because it was so ridiculous. The difference is, Power Rangers didn't take themselves seriously. I don't think DC means to have terrible effects (particularly the 7 deadly sins) and writing. I know this is a kid's but that's exactly what it is. There's very little subtle, snappy humor that will keep adults entertained. Between terrible acting (save Zachary Levi), terrible script and terrible effects, it's just a cheap Nickelodeon-like superhero take on Tom Hank's ""Big"".",Shazam!
808,IamRage7,It's fine,5,7 April 2019,"Good humorous jokes with lame climax. Watching 2nd half felt like watching some kids movie. Neither the director nor the script thought of telling us the name of the villain (no-one spoke his name). Wish, the sequel to have black Adams in it. Besides some drawbacks movie is somewhere fun to watch.",Shazam!
809,mopar-50246,Total let down,1,2 September 2019,"I watched the DC animated movie Shazam and the portrayal of Shazam in the cartoon Batman The Brave and The Bold and enjoyed those two versions immensely. But this just sucked, there was no meaningful dialogue between characters, for instance when billy finds the wizard Shazam, Shazam gives no explanation as to why he's there. Where as in the animated movie he gives a whole poetic speech about the seven deadly sins and how they must be tamed.
Zachary Levi played more of a dope than an actual kid, borderline mentally disabled kid. The costume clashed with the really bad lighting in the film, which was always dark and he just stuck out too much. I couldn't watch more than half of it because it was just too dumb.",Shazam!

This movie gave me so much 90's wizard and magic nostalgia and was absolutely hilarious.Zachary Levi & Asher Angel gave such a good performance, especially when it comes to making the audience believe that 2 separate actors are the same character.DC have absolutely brought their movie making game with Shazam! showing that Wonder Woman wasn't just a fluke.",Shazam!

On the other hand, it's a little bit difficult for me to combine this with the initial DCEU style (Superman and Batman V. Superman). Although, once again, it's easy to combine it with the Aquaman style.

814,tennisboyn,Entertainment at its finest,8,5 April 2019,"Firstly, I'd recommend this movie for anyone wanting a boost, it's full of fun and exhilaration. This movie excels in acting, writing, and directing. Levi is able to pull off a perfect impression of a kid slowly coming to terms with the power he receives. He is supported by a strong cast that is able to further emphasize the loving nature the protagonists carry. The humor is consistently strong, and I'd like to note this is all tame, the movie doesn't rely of profanity or obscenity to get its message across. The last highlight I'd like to mention is the beautiful camera work, and the vibrant color scheme they pulled off, really satisfying. Yes, the villain is cliche, that wasn't really surprising and is not dwelled on too much where it bores the audience. The strengths of this film are strong, it is a humorous family movie that fashions great action sequences and develops the characters sufficiently. Although it's slightly lengthy, this movie was entertaining and reinstitutes the power of sharing your privileges.",Shazam!

818,cupofsoulshow,DC finally got it right,8,11 July 2019,"In recent years there have been some questionable moves made over at Warner Brothers more specifically DC.We shook our head at the announcement of Ben Affleck as Batman and the thought given to a revival of Green Lantern. It seemed things were so bad at DC that one wondered if it was even accurate to compare them to Marvel.In comes Wonder Woman followed up by Aquaman and now we have Shazam.Shazam is the Superhero we never knew we needed. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.Here are some of the reason why. I absolute loved this cast. Zachary Levi is amazing as Captain Marvel. He strikes a great balance between adult and teenager. His discovery of his talents is hilarious especially his attempts at flight. Asher Angel as Billy Batson makes you root for him. His drive to find his biological mother makes us the viewer hope that their will be a happy ending. The foster kids may be my favorites out of all the cast. Faithe Herman as Darla is pure joy, Ian Chen as Eugene Choi the techie, and Jovan Armand as Pedro Pena the quite one are more than supporting players. They are the Cheer squad as well as Billy's conscious.The one character I wished they would have us given us more context on was Freddy Freeman as Jack Dylan Grazer. His disability was never really addressed. They missed an opportunity to educate with humor how it is navigating the world as a disabled isn't always fun especially in high school.Is this movie perfect, no but what is does do is entertain us? It shows us that even Super heroes struggle and must be taught to do the right thing.This direction that DC is taking with focusing on secondary characters and humor is working. So take your time finding a new Batman and Superman. We are doing just fine with Shazam. Keep giving us laughter because we could use the break from the bad brooding.Diversity- this movie gets a six we an Asian, Latino and African-American Character.Scale- eight for sheer fun.",Shazam!
819,christianolivarez-78828,Hadouken!,8,16 April 2019,"Hey folks, we're talking about Shazam today. Might I start off by saying, ""what a relief"". Shazam was like any other DC film, in my opinion. Young Billy Batson (played by Asher Angel) is chosen as The Champion by The Wizard (played by Dijmon Hounsou) who transfers his powers to an immature Billy Batson. The movie consists of the super villain Dr. Sivana (played by Mark Strong) as he hunts down adult Billy Batson (played by Zachary Levi) while also following young Billy's journey to a new home. Young Billy is roughly 15 years old and was separated from his mother as a child accidentally. Now for Dr. Sivana, he had a similar encounter with the wizard, but because he chose the ways of the 7 sins, he was declared unworthy. Followed by an accident with Dr. Sivana's brother and father, this initiates a life-long journey to get back to the wizard and get his revenge after being told he was not good enough.Here we go, people. The beginning is decent. Nothing to rave about but there's not much to criticize either. What I did enjoy was that they didn't soften it up. The dad and the brother are kind of assholes to the young Sr. Sivana. He's a child and the dad does nothing as the brother straight up says he'll never be a man. In comes his encounter with the wizard. It was kind of cheesy with the way the wizard approached him. It was the typical generic ""dark and ominous"" voice, but the crash that followed definitely brought back the intensity.I really feel that the chemistry between the actors worked in a way that is hard to fake and brings some authenticity to the movie. Young Billy meets his new ""family"" and is introduced to Freddy (played by Jack Dylan Grazer.) You might recognize him as Eddie from IT. Freddy is kind of weird but it totally fits. You probably know that Billy doesn't really accept the new family because that's what happens with movies with foster children so we won't spend much time on that. What we will spend time on is Dr. Sivana's transition to becoming the super villain. Man oh man. DC didn't let up on making sure that the audience knew that he was a merciless being and that his heart had turned cold. I think you'll enjoy him.Fast forward a bit into some critiques of the the adult Billy. A lot of the film is Billy and Freddy messing around as they become accustomed to his new powers. It's a lot of humor but it is just enough. However, the length of time that this steady humor lasts is a little long. Although it takes a while and you want more from him, we got to remember that this is the first movie and that he is roughly 15 and didn't want the responsibility of being a hero in the first place. Plain and simple. He didn't want this so why would we expect him to go into full super hero mode. Now I know what you're thinking. Peter Parker in Homecoming was so much more exciting. Yeah sure, but Parker literally begged for more responsibility. Two different characters. This whole movie is a great set up to get to know Billy and show his character ark. It will really allow for the next movie to be more action-paced I believe.Before the big ending, there's a moment in the movie that tugs on the heart strings. I won't mention what it was, but you can kind of see it coming but the acting is what does it for me. It fulfills his character ark and the ending fight begins. It's not too short and you are relieved it's finally happening. Some great special effects and cinematography. Again, some humor is involved but it isn't forced. A great ending. Definitely enjoyed it.It's an old lesson about how home is a place you choose and and not where you sleep. This movie takes you back to the old comic book feel with the wardrobe and dialogue. The actors mesh well together. It's not too long and it's not too short. A great and fun movie. Before I leave you, THERE ARE TWO SPOILER ALERTS. DON'T LEAVE.",Shazam!

Zack Levi brings a flawed breath of fresh air to Captain Marvel, I mean Shazam of course. His portrayal was unique, entertaining, & did a great job of portraying a teenage boy in an adult male body.

829,dpandlisa,Another standalone success for the DCEU,9,31 March 2019,"I'll admit that the early teaser trailer for this film did not excite me. However, after seeing Shazam! in an early screening on March 23rd, I can tell you that the various trailers have mostly covered content from only the first half of the film. I can also say that you are in for a treat that is filled with surprises. This movie is fun and funny, heartwarming and exciting. It immediately cracks my top 10 superhero films of all time, on a list alongside the first two Superman films, the original Iron Man, the first two Captain America films, Wonder Woman, Batman Begins and others. Not only is it a great movie, it's a crowd-pleaser - perhaps one of the most crowd-pleasing of all superhero films.It's one thing to tell the audience THAT your main character is a hero, and it's quite another to SHOW them why they're a hero. Shazam! does the latter. This movie takes its time developing the characters so that the payoff in the second half is worth it. It's well-known from the source material and from the trailers that Billy Batson lives in a foster home with other kids of various ages. What this movie does well is surround Billy with characters that are kind and admirable, especially his new foster parents. Surrounded by a surrogate family, Billy gradually does the right thing and stands up for others that struggle to help themselves, which catches the attention of an aging wizard looking to pass his power onto a younger person. This backstory is very well-developed.Zachary Levi is perfectly cast; in fact, I can't imagine anyone outside of Tom Hanks (whose Big performance is a clear inspiration) who could've pulled this off. Levi projects the emotions of a 14 year-old boy trapped in the body of a superhero throughout, in a performance that is undoubtedly harder than it looks. The remaining cast is excellent, as well. I'm especially happy for Mark Strong, who gets a second chance in a great DC movie after his turn as Sinestro in the disappointing Green Lantern (2011).The enthusiastic crowd cheered aloud no less than THREE TIMES during this movie, including one moment that brought down the house. Think about Superman saying ""Zod ... perhaps you'd like to step outside!"" in Superman II. Or Wonder Woman emerging from the trenches in that film. Or when the Hulk gave Loki a toss and called him a ""puny god."" This moment ranks up there as one of the biggest crowd-cheering moments in this genre's history. Five full seconds of applause and cheers filled the theatre at this moment.When we left the theatre, I hear fathers telling their kids, ""We're seeing this again when it comes out!"" I saw little ones jumping in the aisle, holding out their chests while yelling, ""Shazam!"" These are the indicators that this is going to be an enormous hit for DC. I can't wait to see it again.",Shazam!

832,brkamp,Color Me... Pleasantly Surprised!,9,4 August 2019,"DC is extremely dubious with their titles. Just not great. C'mon, be honest, you know this. No surprises there. And it's understandable! They have REALLY stiff competition. Marvel is on a serious roll, lots of momentum. You can count on one hand DC's good movies...I am totally not a fan of the character, never did like DC comics. And so I was extremely doubtful on this one, But this... is actually a fun flick! The writing is fun, and the comedy is not stupidly over-the-top (as I completely expected it to be). The banter is well delivered. The special effects are pretty. I liked the bad guy...Give this one a try. It's worth a couple of bucks to check it out.

He met him at the shopping centre and got kicked, he then met him in the house and went through the door and fought him. He then ran away and ended up at the carnival. And then he fought him.

I'd also like to tell that I'm one of the few, who doesn't like the Dark Knight trilogy and how it's being praised, while Nolan clearly gave us a false, distorted version of the characters. Shazam is the live action DC movie I've been waiting for, it's one of the most respectful adaptations I've ever seen. It's very true to the source material from Geoff Johns, and the changes they did only made the movie better, and didn't serve the crazy, selfish visions of some moronic director. Shazam was actually made to please the fans of this amazing, lovely hero and they did a great job! It's funny, exciting, touching, it's everything I wanted it to be and even more. Casting Zachary Levi was a great choice, he really nailed the character, but all the actors did a very decent job. I can't wait for the sequel with Black Adam!",Shazam!

837,blueclementinex,Finally a dc movie that is worth watching,5,2 April 2019,"After many bad movies such as justice league, batman v superman, suicide squad, and aquaman dc finally brought something that is not utter garbage. It isn't perfect, though.
I'm going to say what i like about this movie first. The characters are okay. But the main character shines out of the others who only serves as plot devices for the main character. Although it doesn't mean i don't have any complains about him. We'll get to that latter. The humor are okay too... for some moments only, though. It's basically what builds and destroys the movie sometimes. The acting is okay, the child actor in the beginning of the movie sucks, but other than that the actors did quiet a good job. Even the kid actors.
I think this movie is focusing more on the dramatic and humane side of the story and kind of abandoned some elements like the action and fight sequence which is terrible. it made no sense at all and the cgi is so bad.
Now, i don't really complain that this movie doesn't have many action scenes. The thing is, i actually appriciate at the first half they don't focus that much into it. But, because it's a superhero movie, the third act must involve a lot of action scenes (because conventionally, the good guy must fight the bad guy.) And i'm aware of this and i predict the movie would get worse as it went along. And it did. The action scenes basically are just characters wreck stuff at location number one and then they move on to another. There's no stakes to it, so i'm not really excited watching it.
Billy batson has quiet a good character. But billy and shazam are so different. They basically change billy's character overnight. Billy is this loner, unlikeable, and somewhat a mature, independent kid who don't like anyone and his obstacle is that he must learn to let go of his past and accept his new family, learning that he needs other people too. But, somehow when he is shazam he's this friendly, charming, and childish person. And his obstacle is that he's abusing his power and that he's a coward, and he has no idea what he's doing. They try to make these 2 characters as one even though they are fairly different. And yes, both of their obstacle had a similiar theme that is that they are basically a selfish person, but i think i would appreciate if they had more similiarities, like mannerism and their personality trait
The humor gets super annoying especially towards the end. There are scenes where they could raise the stakes but it end up goofy because they try to hard to be funny
The ending is also predictable, from the beginning you could possibly just know how the movie would end
Nothing really stands out from the visuals. There's no style to it. And the story itself is very cheesy and clichèd. It became progressively bad as it went along and the third act is very boring.
the product placement is also kind of annoying... like, i get that it makes sense that there are people wearing dc character's merchandise an d that they are still trying to build a cinematic universe.. but just because it made sense and that they have a purpose doesn't mean it's not irritating to see it constantly.
In conclusion, i really appreciate this movie. Dc finally starts to take a better path at making movies. They tried to make an edgy depressing realistic superhero movie that is batman v superman and they failed, they also tried to make a family friendly movie that is justice league but they failed too. And now, finally they learn their lesson and create a movie that would probably be enjoyed by many people. So props to dc. This time i'm not that disappointed",Shazam!
838,andresromerocompain,"A wonderful, fun, and entertaining superhero movie",8,2 August 2019,"Shazam is by far the best movie to come out of the DC cinematic universe. It's really funny, massively entertaining, full of great performances and fun characters, and also being really fun and capturing the feeling of being young again. One of the best parts of the movie is the fact that is very reminiscent to The Sam Rami Spider-Man movies and the new Spider-Man with Tom Holland, that definitely helped the movie and made it stand out, and it didn't copy anything from those properties, it more feels inspired by. Probably the best part of this movie, much like Spider-Man: Homecoming, is the fact that it is small scale, it hardly has anything to do with any of the other DC stuff and only uses it for comedy, and the grand stuff and steaks in the movie, was all centered around family, and that's why i love the movie. It's a lovely, light hearted, and wonderful family film that dropped every single thing that made the DC cinematic universe awful and boring.",Shazam!

842,MaxGMason,A Superhero Origin Story made with heart and love,7,5 April 2019,"It's one of the best DC movies. It's round, the superhero and the villain are a reflection of one and other, the villain is developed in a way that makes sense (thanks DC because I was tired of the absurd CGI monstrosities) and has heart, I'm glad that it is a movie that doesn't have to fit into a universe because what I liked most is the adoptive family story over Shazam's.
But personally it seemed to me that there was a lot of contrast between Billy as a child and when he transforms so much contrast like if they were two different people, Billy behaves like the typical troubled teenager in a reserved way but when he transforms into Shazam he behaves like a clown, funny, absurd, humorous and it is a dissociative sensation between both characters for me, the bus scene has been the most cringe, the absurd humor...In short, it is a good Superhero Origin movie with the typical structure of these movies (get the powers - learn to control them - something emotional happens - unleashes the full potential of the powers) but done with love, heart and spirit the adoptive family is the heart the last part was unexpected and beautiful and smart (kinda weird tho) that's what i like the most.",Shazam!

847,paulblawrence,Shazam succeeds where Captain Marvel failed...,9,7 April 2019,"Recently Marvel has had Black Panther, Captain Marvel and now Chris Evans, all on a full liberal rampage. As righteous as they might feel in doing so, its only detracted hundreds if not thousands of fans, and have them looking elsewhere. Fortunately for those fans, they found what they're looking for in Shazam!
This movie has a solid story, great acting, loads of fun, laughter and action as we follow DC's newest superhero.
The movie thankfully refrains from any sjw messages which Marvel has been nonsensically adding to their newer ""hero"" films. The movie itself is very well filmed and definitely worth seeing again.
DC may still be in second place, but at least they leave politics at the door.",Shazam!

I've waited for Shazam! to become a reality for years now. I don't blame Zachary Levi although it was he who did not fit his costume with his lack of build and tiny body you cold clearly tell he was out of his League. Zachary Levi Had no right to be made a lead man what was Hollywood a thinking you don't bring C list to A list he was best as chuck stick to what you know Zachary Levi and Hollywood please come back to reality and realize we won't just accept who you decide to shove down our throats. At the beginning I must admit I almost tried to overlook Zachary Levi odd face portrayed as Shazam! But right I as thought that! The movie took a slippery slip off a Banana Peel down a 84,000ft skyscraper landing directly on top of its head cracking its skull spilling blood all over at the movie theater and audiences face, what a terrible tragedy somebody please save me!",Shazam!
852,Sigmazyal,"Light, fun and inspiring.",8,11 July 2020,"Shazam has everything a superhero movie needs, captivating characters, good fights, scary moments, story and an original style. To me, the protagonist breaks the cliche in many aspects, making the movie experience different from the classic approach superhero movies normally have. We get to see the growth of the main characters, the supporting ones aren't there just for show, they actively influence the story and the interactions between them is very realistic.
If I had to improve something, it would be the CGI in certain moments and, in my view, the way the protagonist's personality seems to change when he uses his powers, I guess that wasn't supposed to sound that way. The acting is great, the movie explores very important subjects like family, friendship, responsibility and acceptance in a very genuine way, I loved it. To me, it's a movie to be watched and re watched many times, it will always be fun and light.",Shazam!

I can't remenber a crack-up film that was as enjoyable since the first Guardians of The Galaxy, and while the initial twenty-minuets had me thinking that we had wasted our money, the remainder of the film delivered and kept delivering past the end.

858,cristiadu,"Silly, but enjoyable.",7,24 September 2019,"Pretty much the title of this review sums it up, the movie is funny sometimes, Shazam being a kid is a good idea as it makes pretty silly moments of a grown up man acting like a full child (without forcing too much on it as well), but it's sort of predictable, so not a masterpiece by any means. After a while some plot conveniences start to happen, so you sort of know what is going to happen and the movie becomes cheesy instead of a story with some comedy bits.The story makes you sympathetic to the characters, but not too much. You get the feeling that his mom is an horrible person right from the beginning of the movie, as it's hardly believable she didn't find him on the park after the policemen help him announcing it, so the moment where the shazam kid sees here you already know she abandoned him even though he doesn't want to believe it. His grief over this is super quick as well so it goes into the Adam Sandler movies direction for a bit there (dramas solved in 2 seconds, characters immediately feeling good and going fight villains), but the cheesy ending is a good ending nevertheless",Shazam!
859,Begbilancien,They cancelled justice league for that?,5,13 May 2019,This movie was just pathetic and boring. I liked DCU because of it's a bit more serious and adult than MCU but this is a child movie.,Shazam!
860,Jarodaily,Unexpected!,7,7 April 2019,"DCEU is slowly picking up with MCU every movie and I am here for it! The story progression is perfect but halfway it became predictable and stereotypical. From introducing Shazam's superhero powers to rescuing his friends and family from the grasp of the villain, it's all deja vu. Until they introduce Marvel Family, I changed my mind from giving it a 6 to 7.8. It's a good thing they cut that part out from the trailer, it's a huge MARVEL surprise to all DC fans. Although I was really hoping for a Black Adam cameo or a quick cameo in Shazam's post-credits I did get a quick hint of how they'll include Black Adam on its sequel.Major props for keeping Shazam! just as he is - quirky, fun, and childish. On a personal note, Instead of Shazam being compared to MCU's Captain Marvel I now feel like Shazam is a counterpart of Deadpool, you'll understand why if you stay to watch the credits.If there's one thing I learned from this movie, it is not to pull out your phone when disaster strikes and put it online. Instead, take action and be a hero. That is a subtle way and a very obvious scenario you'd see in most scenes of Shazam!",Shazam!
861,2013venjix,A Momentum of Awesomeness,10,6 April 2019,"It was a momentum of awesomeness. It had everything, intense action, tone, humor and heart. Lot of easter eggs. Asher Angel & Zachary Levi embodied the world's mightiest mortal. Mark Strong was excellent as Silvana. Nice to see him portrayed another DC supervillain since Sinestro in Green Lantern. The remaining cast were outstanding. Jack Dylan Grazer, Grace Fulton and company are the scene stealers in the film. Hats off to David Sandberg for making this film comic book accurate! A MUST SEE!

867,rohan-mahey,This film wasn't what I thought it would be.,6,8 April 2019,So SHAZAM! is part of the dceu or dc universe or dc verse or whatever name dc wants to name it. This film is a bout a boy who is chosen from an elderly wizard to save realms as an adult after a power craving villain lets the seven deadly sins out from its rock form. This film has been reviewed as a good superhero film but I think it's a decent superhero film. I mean it doesn't really add anything to the slate of comic book films like the marvel films do. The film is kind of inspired by big as it basically is a boy who to turns into a man. The film has good humour which worked. The acting was good Mark Strong and Zachary Levi worked really good. I have a few issues like the ending. They decided to add superman but it's not Henry Cavill. It's a shot from shoulders below. The film has redeeming moments like the scene where billy is finding out what powers he has. So I would recommend this film but like dont get your hopes up for a big superhero film as it's more of a small scale superhero film.,Shazam!
868,nicovanbelle,Refreshing take on the whole superhero theme,7,7 May 2021,"I generally skip every Dc Comics or Marvel flick as it's not my taste. I did however like this one as it's very refreshing. It does not take itself too serious. It actually laughs at he whole superhero genre and all clichés in it.Still very brainless, but it contains lots of guilty pleasures.",Shazam!
869,user-81-131504,Just say it.Shazam!,10,6 April 2019,"SHAZAM is a super fresh entry in the DCEU and is easily one of the best films you will see all summer.What works for the film is its screenplay.It is so taught and well knit in terms of character development that you as an audience instantly feel for the protagonist and his foster friends who are sooo adorable that somewhere deep down you even root for them to overcome all the obstacles in life.Zachary Levi is a perfect cast as Shazam and infuses new life into the character.His mannerisms are 100% in sync with the comics and makes this film a laugh riot throughout.Although I do feel that his sequences with the villain lack some impact and could have used some more VFX's but owing to a meager budget of $100 million this was always going to be the case.Nevertheless cinematography and BGM are another strong points of the film that make this one of the best to come out of DCEU till date.
Overall Shazam is a small film with a gargantuan heart that works purely because of the soul that rubs instantly from the get go and is highly recommended to be watched with your family and friends.Go for it and just say the word Shazaaaaammm!",Shazam!
870,mh37434,This movie is a dream come true...!!,9,5 April 2019,"I was fascinated with this film. It was simply amazing. I have been only moderately interested in the films from the DC Extended Universe lately, but this was refreshing. I have always loved Shazam!...er well...Captain Marvel. That his name...yeah, I know, that Marvel film that came out a month or two ago? Yeah, that wasn't the first Captain Marvel. That wasn't even Marvel's first Captain Marvel.It gets so annoying trying to talk to people about this. Explaining it to them. So many people think that ""Shazam"" is a genie played by Shaq...although some think it was Sinbad. (there's no such movie) Also the movie with Shaq was called ""Kazaam,"" and he was not a DC superhero.Shazam is a wizard, not a genie. And the hero is called Captain Marvel. I don't know why Geoff John decided to start calling him Shazam. He can't even say his own name with out transforming...it's so stupid.Anyway back to the movie...I loved it, it was just perfect and I felt it was made of the stuff that movies are supposed to be made of. It had a great story and great soul. I'm hoping for a sequel that has Black Adam. Also the Monster Society of Evil is clearly being set up here...I'd love to see that as well.Anyway keep the good films coming DC...it's about time. There was plenty of scenes in this movie that I felt were very moving. It had so much heart. My nephew went with me and he said it was his favorite movie ever! It was really good. I've only watched it once though, and that was at eight-o-clock last night, and I'm the type of guy that only gives high ratings to films that have a strong rewatchability factor. For now though, I give it a nine...for sure...it was that good.",Shazam!

Plus the Shazam character is relatable along with emotions whenever it comes to cartoons or movie, The made the movie with lots of love and that could be seen for sure. The cinematography was good, the story was also nice. The connection between Billy and his mother could be given a better direction but its okay. Zac killed this role, kudos to him. It could be seen that he was an adult at outside and a child inside. All the other cast did their part nice as well. I really enjoyed the movie, I regret a tiny that I skipped this movie earlier. Definitely you should watch with your loved ones it was capture different emotions very accurately. Also I would like to mention that I think I should like the Shazam more than Deadpool. This was a really wonderful film from DC, after Batman Trilogy. Peace out SHAZAM!",Shazam!
873,pointbreakk,Groundhog Day,2,6 April 2019,"There seemed to be a sticking point in the time line. No one could ever stop being amazed at each and every superpower long enough to work towards a plot. ""Oh, look super speed!"" ""Oh, look super strength!"" The comedy didn't even exist... and I can tolerate many sucky senses of humor- British comedy, juvenile Beavis and Butthead humor, and even drug culture stoner Cheech and Chong material but this stuff was no funny at all. No one in the theater laughed except some 5 year olds. ** TO BE OPTIMISTIC, this movie will be a whole lot better when it shows up on Mystery Science Theater 3000 in about a month and Crow and Tom Servo are heckling it. So, there is that chance for redemption.* as other reviewers have noted- Billy Batson is of average teenager maturity. Then he becomes the adult SHAZAM and is somehow the equivalent of a 6 or 7 year old (mentality-wise) and possibly brain damaged. I gave a pass until the transformation happened a few times. Each time SHAZAM seemed dumber than dirt. DID YOU REALIZE that the S in SHAZAM is for ""wisdom of Solomon""?I actually hoped that Billy Batson would just remain a kid and let the twelve other SHAZAMs in the movie just finish the powerless bad guy.",Shazam!

Instead, they just figured they would target the juvenile population and try to scare the hell out of them.
Toss in a few scary monsters, some inappropriate language, clumsy references to strip clubs and alcohol. What pre-adoleslent would love this?At Best this movie is an abomination of the comics and an abomination to confused script writing. They were a few moments to levity and even a couple moments of cleverness, but for the most part this movie could not make up its mind.There's a reason DC will never catch up to Marvel, and this movie is a demonstration as to why.",Shazam!

Took him a while to learn his powers but his little brothers and sister know what powers they have and can masterfully use them seconds after getting the same power?

881,joeisboss,An Enjoyable and Fun Superhero Film With A Strong Moral At The Heart,8,18 June 2019,"So I went into Shazam! without much background knowledge of the character. I knew his origin story and that the character had been transferred from other comics multiple times, but I knew near nothing. Going in, I was at first thinking the film would take a more dark turn, in the introduction scene. It soon became apparent, though, that this would be a more fun-filled adventure. The villain, Dr. Sivana, wasn't really developed much until about midway through the movie, after Billy Batson gets much development. Quickly, it turns into a superhero style film we are more used to. With many fight scenes and in the third act, a strike for not only the heart of most superheroes, but also the movie. Billy being a mostly runaway kid and not staying with foster families, he finally finds his place with Freddy and the rest of the kids. They all get powers after bonding together as a family, and take down the Seven Deadly Sins and Dr. Sivana in the final fight scene at the carnival. The sins are trapped and Sivana is out in prison. The gang also finds a new lair. I overall enjoyed watching this movie a lot and cannot wait to watch it more this year. The best DCEU movie yet in my opinion and hope they can keep the franchise moving in this direction.",Shazam!
882,Akaanksh,Unexpectedly refreshing and wonderful,9,6 April 2019,"'Shazam!' is, unexpectedly, a wonderful movie with a great plot and solid characters hidden beneath the cover of good acting and brilliant comedy. The show-stealing factor was not Zachary Levi's Shazam but actually Asher Angel's Billy Batson.
The entire film is a huge relief from the typical superhero films as it has probably the least destruction ever in a comic-book adaptation. Ever since their inception, most comic book movies had a final fight in New York or in a replica of it disguised as a fictional city. 'Shazam!' breathes in life to the story by changing the setting to a much better setting of Philadelphia.
It also gives the main character a satisfying character arc, which the DCEU has failed to do so far.
Even the supporting characters feel much more human and alive, and have their own motives and moments.
What's wrong with the film? A Christmas release would've suited the film's setting more than a mid-summer release.
In the end, there is a cameo from a JLA Member which isn't that good.",Shazam!

885,donz-8,A decent super-hero 'comedy',7,22 July 2019,"Fun, but slightly over-rated. From what I've observed with reviews scattered all over the internet, DC fans are presumably so desperate for a hit after a significant number of 'duds' have been released over the past several years, that they really want ""Shazam"" to be recognized among the massively growing list of super-hero movies. On a positive note, I'll say that for a DC movie, ""Shazam"" is quite good and reasonably funny with some very entertaining moments throughout. Actually, it reminded me a lot of an 80's style action-comedy, which is certainly a good thing as today's comedies just don't hold a candle to those of the 80's and 90's. However, ""Shazam"" is nowhere near as good as most of Marvel's films and relies on a somewhat childish ""wizard/magic"" plot, which makes it feel more like a fantasy movie than a super-hero movie. Having said that though, ""Shazam"" is worth the price of admission and I'd be willing to watch it once or twice more when I have the time",Shazam!

So I went into this movie hoping simply for a comedy, but was pleasantly surprised to see the character grow through the story to value wholesome ideals. My son said it wasn't realistic to always expect a superhero to be good all the time, but I think that is the point of a superhero movie.

He truly understood the DC characters and everything that goes with them. Remarkable work. Now, for Shazam, I just asked myself ""what the hell am I watching?"" Horrible movie. This is not DC. This is DC trying to be Marvel. The DC characters are everything Snyder did with them, absolutely not this. The only good thing about this is the actor that plays the villain. Awesome work. Everything else is pure garbage. I can't understand why so many people liked this, so this is my opinion.",Shazam!

899,littleted,Great for Marvel fans.,7,30 June 2019,"Ok, before we start this isn't the type of movie I would usually watch, not really a fan of the whole Marvel universe and heavy use of CGI. Wanted to see this movie mainly because I've really enjoyed Zak Levi's performances in the TV series's ' Less than perfect' and ' Chuck' although popular they never really got the recognition they desered ( check them out ). Shazam does not disappoint, Zak's easy going charm and natural comic ability really shine through and its nice to see this great actor get a shot at a big budget movie. I recommend this movie if you love superheroes, may be a little softer than other Marvel movies but is all the better for it. 👍",Shazam!

903,Kalirados,Awesome,9,7 April 2019,"Go see this movie guys. The movie is great because each character is compelling. The performances are great. The dialogue is natural and the humor hits the spot. Movies often suck because the writers say a character is a certain way but they don't show it. This movie takes the time to introduce the characters and it doesn't just skip to the superhero stuff. The superhero doesn't just become a superhero when he get's his powers. The superhero starts off as a broken foster kid. The character arc of the superhero in this movie is one of the things that makes this movie. The villain in this movie is great because his motivation is real and understandable . The protagonist and the antagonist are dealing with the same issues. A lack of parenting. The movie shines because it's relatable. It's genuine. It's about 2 kids messing around. It's about an emotional journey about a young superhero who's being an ass towards his friend. The movie has plenty of funny DC references. The plot is basic but the direction and writing nails it. While being basic it is still a surprising movie, plus is has a cool plot twist.This director understands what a good superhero movie is about: character. A good example is the Spiderman movie (2002)This is one of the most engaging movies I have seen in a long time. I tend to be very bored when I watch a decent movie but I didn't want this movie to end.",Shazam!
904,jcucchisi-77-755989,A whole lot of fun,9,28 July 2019,Shazam! is a very funny superhero movie about a teen boy being able to become an adult superhero. The film is also about family which the scenes with the foster family interacting with each other are some the most scenes in the movie. Zachary Levi is great at playing the hero Shazam and is great at being a man child. All the child actors were also good especially Jack Dylan Grazer who plays Freddie. The film is hilarious and is very similar to Big but with a superhero(which is not a bad thing). The action is very great and creative especially at the end and the scenes where they test Billy's powers are very fun and funny. The villain is meh. They explore his character pretty well in the beginning but when he becomes an actual super villain his character just becomes an other bad guy the main character has to defeat. Still Shazam is a very fun film and a step up for the DC Universe movies and as a Marvel fan I still recommend this film.,Shazam!
905,paulroberts-53775,Fun magical and an epic blockbuster,9,6 April 2019,"Shazam is so good and hilarious super hero movie I can't wait to see it again.
Zachary Levi is a comic genius who embodies the titular character and you can believe he's really a 14 year old boy trapped in a adult body
Let's not forget the young star who adds heart to this movie and puts some adult actors to shame with his craft.
Go ahead and see it you won't be disappointed.",Shazam!
906,gwyckoff,Great kids movie! Nice to see the DCU put the fun back in. Pretty slow for adults.,5,6 April 2019,"Shazam is the DCU's answer to Marvel's GOTG; i.e. a fun comic book tale with lots of humor geared to younger viewers. Unfortunately, it has little of the GOTG wit and story telling; thus making it a slow watch for adults. Most of the movie is Billy exploring his new powers. Sure that's fun for a while, but it gets old pretty quickly; particularly since the best gags were given away in the trailers.The third act is a mess with a lot of shifting venues and repetitive action. You get the impression of a bunch of FX people sitting around pitching ideas like ""Heh, it would be really cool if they fought at a Carnival!"", and everyone said ""Yeah, great idea! Put that in"".Mark Strong is great in this film. One of the best comic book villains ever ... well maybe not as good as Loki from Thor I, but he's up there. Also the resolution to the main character's plot line is very touching. Its great how they tie everything together in the climax. I just wish they had made the journey to that point a little more entertaining.",Shazam!

909,needhamdave,Just say Shazam and you're an idiot,5,1 February 2021,"Let me explain my main gripe about this movie. The young hero here is very likable. He looks and acts like a cool 16 year old kid. Then he turns into Shazam and suddenly he is an adult that acts like a two year old. Maybe if the old Wizard who gave him the power would have explained something like, ""My son, when you say the name Shazam you will gain incredible powers beyond your imagination. However, there is this minor downside that you will become a nerdy, incompetent, immature whiny baby too."" This is a major flaw in the movie. It is annoying. Either someone was grossly miscast or somebody needed to tell these two actors to coordinate. As it is it looks like just what it is in reality: two different actors taking their scenes in their own conflicting directions.",Shazam!
910,lisamba,Funny but dark,5,7 April 2019,"The trailers made the movie look very funny but I was very disappointed when the movie showed a dark demonic side. For a little kids it would be very scary especially if they are not used to demons in movies. If I had know it was so demonic I'm not so sure I would have paid to go see it. Acting was good on all parts, script was o.k. just didn't like how ugly and demonic the 7 sins were.",Shazam!

912,pjenny-87773,This is what 'Cool' is all about!,9,8 July 2019,"Our expectations were very low before watching this.
My family and I were not even going to watch this after enduring all the pretentious and utter P.C garbage that Marvel and some D.C movies have been coming out with for years.
The Star Wars franchise is a perfect example on how to destroy a cinematic icon (Disney following the same path ) with minority appeasement
No tokenism,no minority groups pandered to, no liberal snowflake triggering no safe spaces,and definitely no overdosing of CGI
This was a big breath of fresh air.
I wasn't expecting to laugh or relate to anything but boy...was I joyfully wrong!
What a wonderful,funny, feel good movie.
Marvel have absolutely destroyed the superhero genre to the extent that a lot of well known story lines and characters are not even recognizable .
Most superheroes they cast, look like they're straight out of a pilates or aerobics class with no larger that life characters worth admiring
With so much reliant on CGI where it begins to look like a poor Manga rip-off...
DC were kicking the can down the road as well.
Shazam proves that the K.I.S.S (keep it simple stupid) method wins hands down.
The director David F. Sandberg deserves full kudos for this delightful and entertaining piece of work.
Zackery Levi,Asher Angel,Mark Strong,and the rest of their co stars really did shine as a behind the camera, family group, and it shows in their performances
The casting/director/writers were spot on and will continue to win more fans as long as they stick with this winning formula.
Most other movies have a collection of try-hard actors who really show how bad their acting skills really are with the typical ho-hum,mundane,cliche',dribble that's just downright insulting
My only negative... I was wanting for more that the 2 hrs and 10 mins
COOL with a capital C",Shazam!

916,sofijassir,Really good,8,23 June 2019,"I'm not a DC fan, so I was actually surprised with how much I liked this movie. I thought the acting was great and the cinematography was really cool and had a 'classic' comic book vibe to it. The only feedback I would give is that a few times in the film I thought the dialogue needed a little work and could come off as a bit cheesy. Regardless, I think this was good superhero movie and I'm looking forward to the sequel!",Shazam!
917,michaelktfc,"It's good, but not incredible.",7,8 April 2019,"I can give credit to Shazam for being original in some ways... for example, it's refreshing to find a superhero movie which doesn't try and force the concept that all superheroes are inherently good from their origins. Watching the story progress at no point does the main characters goodness feel forced, but most of the time he's just a normal kid, and in the finale his reasons for fighting are fairly believable. On top of this the movie has some genuinely fun/funny moments and the film does feel more authentic in terms of characters reactions and engagements then most of the other superhero movies out there. Some acting as well is fairly good, well except in the case of the older and younger versions of our lead.It's at that point that the movies flaws start to be pointed out. The lead that you see when he's older and the lead you see when he's younger are two entirely different people... and honestly I think the younger one is more authentic. Whenever our older superhero pops up he just seems way too smiley and jolly for someone who's supposed to be a kid dealing with abandonment issues, amongst a host of all others. Essentially, it's not just that the two actors play the role completely differently, it's that Zachary Levi doesn't even play a version of the character that's believable.But it's not just that, the opening scene is awful and full of bad acting/bad pacing/plot holes. In fact the magicians whole character is pretty bad... it's not believable and it's a pretty desperate attempt at the character. Also although there are many good things, I just don't feel like all the good things are good enough. It leaves me having enjoyed the film when I leave, but I'm not impressed enough to feel it's a spectacle, it's good... but like I said in the title it's not incredible. It's lacking in areas, and for the sake of keeping the review shorter than it could be, I won't outline them all. But it just feels like in some ways it comes up short",Shazam!
918,antonyjereynolds19,Brilliant,7,13 April 2019,"From the trailer I could not tell if this movie was going to be a cringe fest or was going to be DC's redemption, after watching I can confirm that it is the latter.
The latest film in the DCEU franchise was a delightful surprise, through comedy that hits, charm, a good story and heartwarming deeper message. The acting was also grand, in my opinion, with a fantastic lead who embodies a huge hero with the mind of a teen. Golden.
There were a few minor things that didn't make sense if you fully pay attention, that sometimes just get on my nerves but nothing too bad.
In conclusion, if you go and watch Shazam, you'll have a blast, I did and will again next time I watch. One of the biggest surprises of 2019 so far. Deadpool done better (much better). This film reminded me of Deadpool in the first two acts due to the lead (I won't spoil just see for yourself). GO WATCH SHAZAM.",Shazam!

Discovering the bitter reality of his past life, and discovering what it meant to have a ""real"" family. The movie really give the protagonist a character development from an opportunist boy becoming a hero realizing his responsibility. Have to take out 2 star because 1) the cgi of some scene and some villain is not very good. and 2) The final battle scene is taking too long. There are a couple unnecessary scene in the final battle.

For me this didn't have the same DNA the other movies have and felt more like a Marvel fun family movie then a kickass dark DC movie.Don't get me wrong this is a good watch and the younger generation will enjoy it but I was expecting more.It has a cool story and some wicked references to the other DC movies, I was impressed with Zachary Levi as Shazam he looked the part and was funny, it has some cool action scenes but I'd of preferred them to stay on the same path as the other DC movies are on and been a bit more darker aimed at the adults not the kids.",Shazam!
922,sumanthakurofficial,They could make it better,7,25 December 2020,First of all I skipped this movie for long but I watched it when it's available on Netflix. I've watched almost all DC movies but none of those movies like Shazam because all those movies are sentimental sensitive and dark. But Shazam is a really funny humorous movies campare to all those movies. Story is same totally simple and predictable. They could make it more better. Every characters did their best but not much like Freddy. I liked him more then others. His was the only one who actually did his perfectly. And others some seems like doesn't fit or feel boring. But it worth watching for once.,Shazam!

924,casejaddy,The best DC film since WW,6,11 April 2019,"Shazam is fun and family friendly. It has a few genuinely laugh out loud moments. The concept of a teenage boy in a grown man's body evokes a bit of Spielberg-ian magic. I particularly enjoyed the allusion to Tom Hanks' ""Big"" featuring one of those floor pianos.The backdrop of foster homes also provides poignant moments that tug the heart strings. My favorite performance was the father in the foster home.Tonally, the film feels off. The antagonist's power is derived from 7 demons representing the 7 Deadly Sins. This is interesting but feels out of place. The only other mythology the film mentions is Shazam's powers (strength of Hercules, power of Zeus, etc) . This combination of christianity, Ancient Greek mythology, and wizard magic just felt strange. Also the movie would've benefitted greatly by shaving 30-45 minutes off the runtime.Overall it's worth seeing if you're a fan of the genre or have kids who are. Everyone else, you're not missing much",Shazam!
925,biggyofmt,Funniest comic book movie of all time,8,31 March 2019,"Shazam is more comedy than it is action. But it manages to be the funniest movie of the year. It does so without playing exclusively for joke, and without resorting to slapstick or gross out humor. The test audience where I saw it was in stiches for most of the opening sequence.Zach Levi is perfect in the lead role as a child in an adult body. The child actors are also very good, avoiding the distraction that bad child actors often bring to roles.On the downside, the third act drags a little long, and the dramatic elements miss their mark slightly. The premise is also a little silly, and the villain is a one-dimensional mustache twirling type. He has no relatable motivation whatsoever, which detracts from his impact.That said, the positive far outweigh the negatives, and this movie will charm you most of the way through.",Shazam!

It is funny, sweet, exciting, has mild peril and, most of all, there seems to be some heart in the middle of it all.The kids are all bloody fantastic actors (you WILL be seeing these little bleeders again, older) and seeing Zach Levi on the big screen, where he belongs, brought a tear to mine rheumy, aged eye. He's been great since Chuck, finally he gets a chance to shine.This is a first-class family action film.

Chaotic themes: too many. Humor: lacking. Villain: cliche. (I could neither love or hate him. He has been pitiably poorly written.) Main character: unlikable and suffering from a personality split. (Seriously. As a teenager, Zachary was reserved and uncommunicative. As an adult, perky and zealous. They were NOTHING alike.) I could ramble on for hours about all the weaknesses of this movie. But what maddened me the most was how they resolved the issue with Zachary's mother. It was his main motivation, and they wrapped it up in one short unsatisfying scene that left us with more questions than answers.",Shazam!

939,krishkhatiwada,Shazam is another solid movie for DC,8,5 April 2019,"Summary: Shazam is another solid movie for the DC universe with a great sense of humour and a fitting story.Shazam is about a boy named Billy Batson who turns into a super powered hero after being grated powers by a wizard.Pros: The movie is surprisingly funny and it does not feel out of place for the most part. I have not laughed this hard at the movies in a long time. Although the movie is funny, it does not miss out on the emotional beats that make these characters feel real and relatable. The movie makes some surprising decisions with Billy's character that brings something fresh to a familiar plot point.Family and finding out where you belong is a big part of the movie and it's executed pretty well. Supporting cast do their job really well, with the standout being Darla and Freddy.Cons: When young Billy says the magic word ""Shazam"" he transforms into the superhero of the same name, and with that the adult Billy actor comes into play and frankly these two characters feel very different to one another. Young Billy is more mature and has more attitude, while Shazam doesn't feel as mature nor does he have that same attitude. Now you'll get used to it but it can be jarring at first.Another con is that the film has pacing issues. The movie doesn't have the flow that I wanted. Certain scenes feel like they were thought off at the last minute. I wished they had more scenes with the family.All in all: Shazam one of the better DC movies to come out. It has a fresh take on a familiar superhero story with some great surprises towards the end.",Shazam!

944,rich56,Sorta fun but nothing special,6,13 January 2020,"OK for starters I really knew nothing of the Shazam comics or the character at all so I went in with no expectations. It seemed to get fairly decent reviews so I was hopeful. First things first, it goes on way too long. This isn't Avengers Endgame here, hardly an epic tale. The setup seemed to take forever too, I kept thinking lets get on with it. So anyway, as the story played out it was all very predictable. Perhaps young kids get more out of this story of abandoned and abused kids than I do, an older male. That's ok i guess but for me I just saw one cliche after another. The suitably diverse cast is decent but nobody really excels i thought. When Zachary Levi finally appears as Shazam the story finally gets going. He's fun as the title hero and playing a 15 year old in a man's body he gets to overact all over the place. Think Tom Hanks in Big, but less subtle. The villain Mark Strong's motivations for being evil are sketchy. He's evil because he's well...evil. The big villain vs. superheroe(s) climax is well staged and everybody lives happily ever after. The final sight gag gave me the biggest laugh in the whole movie.
So, it's a moderately entertaining film that kept me interested but is probably more appealing to teens or even preteens(who might not get all the jokes). They could have cut out about 20 minutes with no loss of narrative. Just have lowered expectations despite the plethora of 10 star reviews here.",Shazam!

956,Merlin-Knight,My Two Cents,7,29 April 2019,"There are several things to consider when it comes to going to see this movie.. The first is that I found that it was very much geared to children. Which isn't a bad thing. I do wish it had well a bit more adult appeal in it though.
I also felt as they did take a great many creative liberties in regards to the character, its back story, as well as the adding of all the other Shazams, I have read the comics and the truth is I remember there being 3 of them not 5.
I also feel that the Dr. Sivana character left a great deal to be desired as I felt it left me wanting for well a real villain to come along.. I found the character lacked depth. I understand the child like nature for Shazam. He was after all quite literally a child in an adults body but the villain was supposed to be a full grown adult, yet it seemed to come across like a child that was throwing a tantrum .
In the end it was alright, but I felt it could have been a great deal better..And that's My Two Cents",Shazam!

961,aadishah,I do not see how this movie saves the DCEU,5,5 April 2019,"The movie had an alright start and I actually felt that it would be worth watching it. It continued and was decent up until a certain point. The portrayal of antagonists has always been trash in the DCEU and this is no exception. They could have done that so much better, but well... The music was horrible and I felt like I was watching this stereotypical, old age movie. The action was as bad as any DCEU movie and I had not set my expectations high for action. The genuinely good thing about the movie was the comedy, BUT! this too felt overused by certain characters towards the ending and got annoying. The story and the concept had so much, and I mean SO MUCH potential but I don't know, things started falling apart quite fast. The bright side would be that it would be a fun watch for kids and families, but it's not really a 'superhero' movie as far as my definition of 'superhero' movies is concerned.",Shazam!
962,NeoChrys,Another excellent chapter for the DC universe.,10,5 April 2019,"It is absolutely ridiculous how in love I am with this movie. It has such a unique character.

964,rctguy75,One of the most fun Comic Book films ever!,9,6 April 2019,"The DC universe has gotten on track ever since Wonder Woman. I can safely say that they are continuing that trend with Shazam. This film is extremely fun!The story follows the last wizard of the council that keep the Seven Deadly Sins contained. For countless years he has searched for a champion to inherit his powers. The wizard eventually finds high school kid Billy Batson, who got lost from his mom when he was young. He is taken in by a foster home with other lost kids of varying age. Billy Batson meets with the wizard and is given the wizard's powers. With the help of his friend Freddy Freeman, Billy Batson discovers his true potential of being a superhero. When the villain Dr. Thaddeus Sivana is given powers of dark magic by the Seven Deadly Sins and arrives in their home city, Billy Batson must defeat Sivana and show all his friends that everyone has a superhero hiding inside themselves.First, the comedy in this film works really well. The film doesn't take itself too seriously, and the comedy in the film works well. It is well written, executed well, and always plays a role.Second, the villain Sivana is a well-defined and threatening villain, better than some of the other villains in the DC universe. He has believable motivations and provides a real challenge for Billy to overcome. The Seven Deadly Sins that follow him around are also well designed and quite threatening at times. I did not expect the villains of the film to be this good.Finally, the film got serious when it needed to. Some other films cannot balance the comedy and drama well, but Shazam does it very well. All the dramatic moments and heartfelt moments are believable and realistic. You feel the weight behind what the characters are doing. Most superhero films lean more towards the comedic side, but Shazam balances its tone quite well.In conclusion, Shazam is undeniably fun. It has great characters, a good and compelling story, a solid villain, and loads of laughs. This film, combined with 2018's Aquaman, gives me great confidence it what Warner Bros. is doing with the DC universe going forward. Shazam is just FUN, why can't more movies just be fun?9/10",Shazam!

973,steveovell-98604,At last the DCEU have got it right!!!,8,28 March 2019,"Went to this with low expectations, due to other offerings like BvS Yawn of Justice (still leaves bad taste in my mouth), and the beautiful but utterly messy and dull Aquaman (sorry guys, I fell asleep through parts of it!)
But boy....WAS I WRONG!!! not only is it the best DCEU movie to date (sorry Wonder Woman), but its absolutely a blast to watch!
First off, Zachary Levi nails the titular character and delivers a performance of such quality and sheer innocence, that you actually believe this buff dude is really a 14yr old kid trapped in an adults body. He is hilarious, and undoubtedly the best hero in the franchise thus far.
He handles the action sequences with ease, and brings the character of Shazam to the big screen with a grace and purity that easily knocks Supes outta the ball park (sorry Henry Cavill, he's more super than you dude)
Mark Strong brings villainous menace to the screen with ease as Dr Silvana, he clearly had a blast playing this part, hes versatile playing either hero or villain, but villain is definitely his niche.
The kids in this movie are absolute quality, Asher Angel as Billy Batson, the runaway street kid you really feel for, and Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy Freeman, the nerdy cripple (sorry guys,even he calls himself that) kid who latches onto Billy and 'helps' him with his new abilities are superb in their roles, amazing casting. All the other kids in the foster home are brilliant, as you'll see lol.
This movie has a plot that's easy to follow and won't leave you going huh?? Its straightforward story telling at it's best.
We left the cinema with massive smiles on our faces, vowing to see it again when its actually released, as we were at an advance screening.
By the way...stay for the two end credit scenes!
First one is a set up for future sequel, and one right at the end is a laugh.
Bravo DC! More like this please!!!
P.s. look out for the Annabelle doll cameo near the beginning, as she made a blink you miss it appearance in Aquaman too!",Shazam!
974,kmchahine,DC's Ghostbuster spinoff,7,30 March 2019,"This review was written on March 23, 2019 (Shazam! Fandango early screening)It might be unjust to judge this movie from the eyes of an adult. As such, I will evaluate some of it from the eyes of the child I was several years ago.""Shazam!"" was really not a bad movie. Its blend of comic and action sequences draws away from all (literally ALL) previous DC films and makes it have its own signature.CASTING: The roles were very well chosen. Throughout the movie, all actors generated the feelings their characters aimed to depict. The way their relationship evolved in the film was also very well crafted and enjoyable. Kudos for that.*** From then on, SPOILERS ahead ***CHARACTERS: As stated earlier, the movie must be seen through the eyes of a child, where the nature of ""fight or flight"" can sometimes be, well, missing. ""Fear"" as such, was not really seen in the eyes of the kids in their worst moments, which one might argue might have been an exaggeration.STORY/PLOT: My major issue with this film is the story. Though the main characters are there, the premises of the story seem too fantasy-like, too unrealistic. Yes we are aware of the seven sins and their association with the Shazam! universe, but the way they were introduced to the world lacked conviction, making this movie feel like a ""Ghostbusters"" spinoff. (I mean really, look at those ""Sins"", some are really funny-looking especially as they are chasing the kids).Moreover, the seriousness of the action sequences oscillated from completely dark and shocking (e.g. killing of the Sivana Industries board members, including father and sibling) to a mere child's play when Dr. Sivana has the kids in his grasp and does not seem to be intimidating.Another annoyance in the scripting of the plot is the way the ""Shazamly"" mastered their powers. Their introduction in the movie was no doubt in place and absolutely did not feel forced, but they seemed to have become ""pro"" too easily when it took Billy literally over an hour of runtime before he learned how to fly.*** End of Spoilers ***SUMMARY: All in all, the take-home rating of any movie resides in the way it makes us feel. Although the movie is a really nice addition to the DCEU from casting to effects and does get emotional, serious and really funny, I can't help but feel that it did not reach the climax of satisfaction I expect from a superhero movie. Nonetheless, it is safe to say it was a unique film, adding to the Renaissance of DC.",Shazam!

980,ldcsp,Shazam-A breath of fresh air into the DCEU,8,17 April 2019,"Billy Batson, 14, is a rebellious boy with a difficult life.
One day he comes across a sorcerer who gives him his powers, so he becomes the superhero Shazam.
Dc has not enjoyed critical and public success on the part of his previous films as expected, however the success of Aquaman and now Shazam has finally come to show that it is possible to make good films with these characters, and create a bright future for this DCEU(DC Extended Universe).
Shazam affirms himself above all as a lighter film compared to his predecessors, comic, without being taken too seriously (at least for the most part).
It's a well directed movie with a good cast, Zachary Levi is great at playing the hero. He has a comic timming that perfectly fits the character. As mentioned earlier, it is a very funny movie and pretty much all of the jokes work. However behind the comedy, there is also a beautiful, touching story about acceptance, family and friendship.
As it is a superhero movie there has to be a villain, here we have Dr.Sivana in a good interpretation by Mark Strong, the villain is truly evil, yet there is a reason that I believe to be clear for the reasons that lead him to do whatever he does.
There is nothing significantly bad that i can say, however if I had to mention, it would be the CGI, there are certain scenes that could be a little more worked. Another aspect would be a certain darkness, the movie becomes exaggeratedly whenever the villain is on screen, those scenes do not fit tonally with the rest, because it is a relatively light film.
Shazam is great, funny, moving, very entertaining. It's exactly the breath of fresh air that DC was needing.8.0/10",Shazam!

982,cinemaloversclub,A brilliant origin/coming-of-age/comedy cocktail. DC IS BACK!!!!,10,4 April 2019,"A brilliant cocktail of coming-of-age story, superhero origin, Christmas movie, and hilarious comedy with a lifetime-casting in Zachary Levi, dark villain in Dr. Silvana, & nostalgic Reeve-like heart while expertly handling the Seven Deadly Sins mythos. 9.5/10....Review: S-H-A-Z-A-M. Solomon-Hercules-Atlas-Zeus-Achilles-Mercury. Once the biggest/most popular superhero in the world, even over Batman and Superman for a brief stint in the 1940's, a being mired in Greek mythology was concocted with the radical notion: what if a kid got to be the superheroes they read so much about in comic books? It sold like hot-cakes and mesmerized millions of youngsters seeing the red, white, and gold comet race across the sky stopping bad guys and become a connectable hope-symbol and wish-fulfillment for young and old audiences-alike. The *original* Captain Marvel - he donned the name decades before Marvel stole-it for their subservient Green Lantern-clone - he was a hero I related and looked up to for years, and finally got a movie. And I'm here to tell you, something I never thought I'd ever say: It might be the best DC movie, and possibly overall-*superhero* movie along with WW & Spider-Verse, since The Dark Knight.The cocktail of different ingredients on display. Director Adam F. Sandberg has mixed up a dazzling array of ingredients to reinvigorate and innovate the increasingly-tired superhero genre: It works as a coming-of-age story with immaculate character development and emotion, superhero origin with powerful theme explorations and villain action, Christmas movie I have a suspicion might elevate itself to the top of some lists there, mythology adventure masterfully handling and palatably-presenting the iconic Shazam/Seven Deadly Sins-lore built over 70+ years, and most of all: comedy. It is a peculiar, refreshing, brilliant mash-up of elements I've never seen presented in such a way, like the creators of the titular hero putting their thinking cap on and trying (successfully) to do something that's never been seen before - and it works on every possible level.Next, Zachary Levi. Oh boy, I cannot even find the words to describe how much joy he brought to this canvas. I will guiltfully admit: I was not sold on the casting when it was announced. I was even *gasp* disappointed. I had heard buzz about Derek Theler to Zac Efron to even John Cena and was delightfully intrigued (except Cena) about the prospects. However, when they announced an ~unknown presence would be taking on the iconic Captain Marvel mantle, I did not know how to react. Disclaimer: I sincerely apologize for ever doubting and will exercise extreme caution ever doubting casters again - who clearly know what they're doing. Zachary Levi was BORN FOR THIS ROLE. in fact, I might need some convincing he's not actually a teenager in a man's body. He has an effortless delivery, comedic presence, and fun atmosphere/vibe that brings honor to the lore, fits with the muscular strength superheroes should have, and exudes an old-world, nostalgic, classic-Superman class and aura. This is a lifetime-casting and I couldn't possibly be happier with the results. Beyond Levi, everyone else in the film is perfectly cast with phenomenal performances as well, especially Asher Angel playing a *perfect* Billy Batson, Mark Strong's Dr. Sivana (will get to later), Dijmon's haunted wizard-Shazam, Jack Dylan Grazer's side-splitting comic relief Freddy Freeman, and the rest of the *certain* family that cameos in the end (!!!!!!). Incredible.The cinematography, score, and tone. *This* is how you do superhero comedies. DC captures lightning in a bottle with its tonal craftsmanship here. The film is first and foremost a comedy, wearing its heart on its sleeve in that regard and backing it up with absolutely *HILARIOUS* gags that are realistic and necessary for the character, and might be the funniest I've ever seen in a superhero movie; even Deadpool. From the ""I can fly"" revelation while getting hit by a bus.. multiple times, to Billy's police-trick intro to the screaming Santa to superpower-testing slapstick and Captain Sparkle Fingers, it truly gets the essence of joyous wish fulfillment and childlike wonder the genre first became popular for; like Big-with-superpowers. Even with all this laughter, however, the film maintains an edge and seriousness about it, letting you know it doesn't mix business and pleasure. Heck, it even borders into dark sometimes, but balances the line perfectly. The biggest problem many audiences (myself included) cite with Marvel movies - colloquially known as 'MCU-trapping' - is that they inject unnecessary silly humor into serious situations to prevent it from ever feeling weighty or scary and appeasing kids it was (likely Disney-forced) made for. But here, that problem is completely avoided by keeping clear boundaries between its comedic stylings and serious reflections. In fact, the film even borders into DARK at some times, doubling as a family drama with serious emotional gravitas and pathos in its coming-of-age story of Batson's searching for a home and backstory revelations, while wrestling with self-worth, purpose, and heroism themes as well. The cinematography is stunning like in its roof-jumping blue-tinted Shazam yell and final fight rendered with arguably the best CGI in many-a-superhero film (surprising since it had one of the comparatively-lowest budgets to work with) and classic compositional shots set amidst triumphant orchestral themes.Finally, Dr. Silvana and the handling of the mythology. Mark Strong's Dr. Sivana is an INCREDIBLE villain, having a seriously dark presence and backstory, power-exudance, sublime characterization/writing, and the (new) notion of a villain that was given the chance to become the hero but then went down the other trajectory of childhood being eaten up by his rejection and self-doubting ""why not?"" From the opening 8-ball tragedy scene (whole film is impeccably-locationed as well to add to its Christmas-y feel), I knew they got one of Shazam's best comic-villains right. Testing kids with Biblical-feeling temptation trials for the mantle is brilliant, starting with it to introduce us to Sivana and adding stakes by revealing it's a second attempt after a tragic fate befell the last champion leading alternate-religion-like to our current state. Sandberg's handling of the complex and 70-year mythos (and powers; can you imagine him going head-to-head with The Rock as Black Adam?!?!) is downright impressive and a triumph, being entirely comic-accurate while also skillfully presenting a great, palatable, and understandable curated version of it for mass audiences (that post-credits tease too, F-YEAH!). Lastly, them deciding to dive head-first into the famous family in the end, plus execute and pull it off in a way that works this early in the series was shocking and an absolute triumph. Incredible.The only real (miniscule) flaws I could think of are not naming Shazam in-film, plus a somewhat-lackluster final post-credits scene. It's simply an expectation in an origin film that the titular hero gets his name from himself, friends, family, or bystanders, and there was talking going into it he'd be named in a clever way poking fun at the Captain Marvel-issue saying something like 'how about (naming you) Captain Marvel?! Nah, that's lame.' This would have been perfect to include and I can't imagine why they left out that opportunity to name him while also sneaking in a jab at the theft of the IP. Even in the post-credits scene (first one was sublime but second one was kind of lame) would have been another perfect place to include the name-bait-and-switch. A missed opportunity, albeit nitpick.Overall, Shazam is a masterful product that transports you back to the childlike wonder that made you fall in love with superheroes in the first place, and might not only be the best DC movie since The Dark Knight (even over Aquaman and Wonder Woman): it's one of the best *superhero* movies since The Dark Knight - along with WW and Spider-Verse. A brilliant cocktail of coming-of-age story, superhero origin, Christmas movie, and hilarious comedy with a lifetime-casting in Zachary Levi, strong villain in Mark Strong's Dr. Sivana, nostalgic highs, and impressive direction and character writing, DC has captured lightning in a bottle here and the perfect what-if-a-kid-could-be-Superman film (that reminds me: stay through to that last scene's easter egg. Trust me!!). This new partnership with New Line Cinema is off to a miraculous start.Overall Rating: 9.5/10",Shazam!

989,gaussgoat,A damn good super hero movie and a much needed lift for the DCU,9,7 October 2019,"I had ZERO expectations heading into this movie, and I am pleased to report that Shazam delivers across the board.Yes, the movie is a super hero origin story, and it comes with all the trappings therein (a scene from the past with future consequences, a hero struggling to find his way, a morale dilemma, etc)... but the beauty of Shazam! is that it KNOWS what it is and plays to its strengths brilliantly.Shazam is, ultimately, the introduction of a mostly unknown hero to the world who is, for the comics educated, insanely powerful and is effectively the only hero in the DCU who can go toe to toe with Superman... but who cares? Because the movie is REALLY about Billy Batson and what he brings to the table.Zacary Levi is absolutely brilliant in the lead role. This guy NAILS this character in a truly meaningful way, by making you completely forget that Captain Marvel and Billy are played by two different people.David Sandberg deserves huge credit for making a movie that is mystical, fun, bright, and yet impactful all at the same time.I HOPE TO GOD that DC doesn't squander this marvelous (ba dum ching) opportunity to inject Shazam! into the broader DCU.

The movie is not very grand like Ironman, Aquaman with Super villains and super aliens but whatever is in the movie makes sense.
This is actually how a superhero should be brought in, keeping it simple and small, thus leaving the scope to build towards a larger plot and storyline.
The movie kind of loses a bit towards the end but I cant complain much about it.
The best thing about the movie is a kid living in this big body with super power wearing tights, trying to discover his super abilities and values as well.

992,mykzmails,A beautiful story and a new light for the DCEU.,9,16 December 2020,"This movie was great, so good. I loved it.The story is engaging, the villain is perfectly portrayed by Mark Strong and the adult version of Billy Batson FEELS like it's really young Asher Angel in the body of Zachary Levi, it really FEELS like they're one and the same, and the humorous tone works for this movie.The cinematography isn't perfect, unlike some of the newer DC releases like BOP, Joker and WW84 but it stands on its own.The movie is goofy, it feels like a Sam Raimi movie at times, and I sure as hell love his movies.Anyways, all I want to say is that this movie rocks. And I can't wait for the sequel from the legend of David F. Sandberg, one of the most inspiring filmmakers out there.",Shazam!

Sparks Hope!,7,7 April 2019,"If anyone who reads this that has never read the comics, then do not worry because I have never read them either.This movie is a drastic change in tone from the beginnings of DC, and also a different tone from Aquaman. That tone is a welcomed one that greats people in a positive way.The Actors and Actresses all played their parts excellently. Let's be Honest though, they should have brought Henry Cavill in at the end instead of getting some person to wear the suit.The only problem I have is that this movie feels like a PG rather than PG-13 movie. Maybe I am thinking to much into it but this felt more so for little children than the fans and adults.I'm not going to say that this hurt the movie because it does follow kids. They are doing everything right in the movie by its intended audience.I was expecting this to be more like Aquaman, which that was a mistake on my part. Anyone will still enjoy this movie because it has a family friendly vibe. They put in good laughs and the action sequences are great.

I just wanted it to end when we finally walked out I asked the kids what they thought they looked at me and I said be honest and both said it was the worse film the had ever seen and it went on forever, I was annoyed as I would of took them out after the first 15 mins and asked for a refund. how on earth do DC keep making rubbish they haven't made a single good film yet.",Shazam!

But, I gotta be straight up and say I actually really enjoyed this movie. It was quirky, funny and an interesting watch.Storyline: A teenager, Billy Bateson, stumbles upon a wizard that gives him magical powers that he can activate by saying SHAZAM!Characters: I thoroughly enjoyed the performance of all the actors. Especially Zachary Levi; it's not an easy task for a grownup to play a fourteen old kid without looking completely silly but honestly Zachary nails it ( and looked awesome doing it ) Asher Angel as the young Billy was extremely watchable and had a relaxed ease to his performance. Jack Grazer was equally as watchable and charming on screen. The rest of the supporting cast held their own and left no complaints for the audience.Costume Design: I loved Shazam's superhero costume. Was it completely different from what we have seen in the past? Not really but it was fitting and appropriate none the less. I loved the addition of the white cape, gave a grand feel and added gravitas .Action: I really enjoyed the action this movie had. It wasn't over the top but rather fit the needs of the characters and situations, adding to the storyline. Watching superheroes kick some villain but never gets old and this movie delivered as well.Final Thoughts: I think it's a fun watch and to be honest I am looking forward to the sequels, and I bet you will too after the climax . Also pro tip for people that aren't familiar with DC movie making. Wait until the credits are over for a little surprise .",Shazam!
1015,siddhantraiz,Lighthearted superhero movie done right!,10,5 October 2019,"Superhero movies have become massive with their worldwide appeal guaranteeing a upward of 500M $ earning worldwide and with such huge box-office the stakes and the scale of these movies has also gone massive - Thanos wiped out the half the universe , Aquaman called out all the ocean life to unite the seven seas whereas Wonder Woman single-handedly put a stop to world war I which is great but I miss the charm of old self contained movie where stakes were world ending only to the protagonist itself which I think made the story more personal and made the stakes have move emotional depth in them. One very good example being Raimi's Spiderman trilogy, Peter Parker was relatable so were the people he cared for and later on in the movie when the stakes where high we felt the emotional depth of losing a loved one. In that regards Shazam is very similar where the stakes were high for the main characters of the movie and by this it was able to tell us a very personal, character centric story with family values at heart.
Shazam is a superhero movie where action was never the main priority of the movie , before the word ""Shazam"" are first spoken we are well versed with Billy Batson (Shazam alter ego), Freddy( Billy Foster brother) , the rest of foster family and the villain. It may be called a slow start by some but what it does is that later on in the movie when these character makes a huge decision or anyone of them is in peril you feel the emotional impact too as the viewer. The actors were very well casted especially the character of Freddy, Billy Batson and Shazam who are played by Jack Dylan Grazer, Asher Angel and Zachary Levi respectively. Jack stole the show in every scene he was in , Asher successfully bought depth where it was needed and Zachary played a 14 year old like a 14 year old and not some adult acting stupid and weird. The villain played by Mark Strong is also set up a little bit to provide contrast to the protagonist. There was nothing special about him other than providing the stage for protagonist to grow as a character which is okay for an origin movie.
The Movie was directed by David F. Sandberg who is a huge inspiration for young film-makers, he only had a Youtube channel few years ago and now he has directed 3 Hollywood movies. I liked his direction for the most part especially how he was able to tell a great story with developed characters and he also managed to inject some horror elements ( his usual genre style) which were great although I think the actions scene could have been better like in final battle slow motions were used unnecessarily . The final battle also seemed a tad bit longer than it had to be, although it was able to drive home the point of true meaning a family successfully which was the whole point anyway.
I think the cinematography was very basic and didn't worked for me and the soundtrack was nothing special too which were strong suit of previous DC movies.
Having said that Shazam delivered in most of the areas like characters, story and humor and never in its 2hr 12min run time it made me bored, although I wished the cinematography and soundtrack were a bit better. Ultimately I think this movie was not about saying ""Shazam"" but what it means to say the word ""Shazam!"".",Shazam!
1016,jhowington32,Over Hyped reviews,6,6 April 2019,"I look through these reviews and see so many 10/10's. GIVE ME A BREAK! Either people don't really understand how to rate movies, or here we go with the DC fanboys desperatly trying to pump this movie up! It was a fine film! The hype fanboys are trying to put behind this film will probably end up disappointing you, because you are expecting to see some phenomenal piece of cinema. This is NOT a phenomenal piece of cinema. It's yet ANOTHER superhero film, that the sheep shell out money more then then over react like it's the best thing they've ever seen. It's not.... and they know it's not. This movie is corny, and I understand that's the tone they've set from day 1. Avengers endgame will make more money in pre sales, then this films entire opening weekend box office take. The money, and audience for this film will NOSE DIVE, and be all but forgotten when avengers endgame comes out. WB made a mistake releasing Shazam in between captain marvel, and arguably the biggest movie of all time. If Warner's would've held back and either released this at the beginning of they year in January, when there was nothing worth seeing in the theater this would've done better. Or waited till the fall when there were less things to compete with. Shazam will not get the money they could've because Endgame is going to mop the floor with the box office for weeks to come.",Shazam!
1017,bensee-50800,"Good film, with tons of room for improvement.",7,16 April 2019,"Let me start off this review with saying that this was not a completely awful movie. Along side other DC films such as The Dark Knight and Superman, this was definitely the one that was the most goofy and lighthearted. Although the tone of the movie is somewhat dark with the concept of the seven deadly sins and there frightening appearance, though the vision of a 14 year old being a superhero draws the dark tone to a more goofy perspective. Good performances from actor Zachary Levi and Mark Strong were definitely what made me enjoy the film. And don't forget actor Dijmon Hounshou whose performance elevated the movie (although we all know that he can do way better). The one aspect of the film that was a let down was the strange screenplay, which was full of unnecessary impulses that at times felt a bit strange and stupid. Although it at times felt a bit annoying, this dark and goofy DC film is one in a million alongside the more dark and stern DC movies before it.",Shazam!

1027,lev772,Cool Young Billy becomes the Sissy Shazam (or is it Chuck!..),3,22 August 2019,"I am not usually bothered with the plot thickness etc in a movie but expect:
1- A PG-13 movie to be not aimed at 5-7 year olds and
2- to have some consistency in the story and acting. The movie started OK with the 14 year old, street wise Billy acting as a significantly more mature person would do but then, when he becomes a superhero (nobody must have told Zachary that the 14 year old Billy was quite a cool kid), he starts acting like a 5 year old. The problem is this continues throughout the movie, 30 year old looking superhero acting as 5 years old and the 14 year old Billy acting as a 30 year old.
As the others said, it appears the director hasn't decided on the target audience, 5-7 year olds or adults. The movie feels like it was directed by two directors, one doing the parts of regular Billy and the other doing the superhero.",Shazam!

1032,ichbinsonderbar,Shazam! is a breath of fresh air,9,10 April 2019,"I can finally say that DC has hit one unequivocally out of the park! From the first moments of setting up the villain to the goofy post-credits scene, Shazam! is funny, wonderfully cast, imaginative, relatable, and refreshingly *different*. The rapid-fire jokes and quips, self-awareness and poking fun at itself (without falling into the ridiculous), and heartfelt look into the bonds of a foster family create a movie that we have needed for a while. Remember the magic of seeing a superhero movie when you were a kid? This film captures that fun and excitement, and gives it a pretty face with Zachary Levi (who is fantastic in this role).A word of caution for families with smaller children - the bad guy runs around with some pretty scary-looking dudes (the Seven Deadly Sins), and while there is surprisingly no gore at all, they are violent and frightening.All in all, I absolutely LOVE this movie. It brings back the magic of childhood and wraps it up in a smart, colorful, and meaningful package. It brings home the importance of family, even when you find them in totally unexpected ways. And it underlines the need for *good* guys, for people who are looking out for the best of others.5/5",Shazam!

This movie was very childish, predictable and boring.
I think teenagers and below will enjoy it but unlike other super hero movies

Instead, there is an inevitable showdown with a supervillain.On the plus side, the film is funny and sharp, and the teenagers reaction to superpowers believable.This superhero movie could have been so much better if they had just focused on the origin story and left the villain to the sequel.The finale could have been Shazam rescuing people from a natural disaster, for example, rather than a prolonged punch up with the baddie.

1039,ajk232,A Fun Diversion from the DC Formula - More Like This Please!,8,4 April 2021,"General Thoughts:The most fun I've had in a superhero movie since...well I was going to say Infinity War but that plotline is not very fun. Point is: this movie is fun. It really feels like it was made for kids, with a sprinkling of adult themes here and there. As someone who is suffering from extreme super hero fatigue, this is an excellent film to enjoy without having to put too much thought into it.The Good:The characters do not feel like they make stupid decisions. Every time I was questioning something that was being done, I could essentially chalk it up to the kids being...well kids. The film treats its children like children in the best way. There is no profound philosophical dialogue coming from the mouth of an eight year old. The film was just plain fun.The Bad:There are some minor continuity errors throughout the film that would not distract most people but if you are thinking about the film-making it may take you out of the film for the briefest of moments. Two examples I can think of are characters swapping their locations very quickly (likely in-between takes), and a character flying through the air faster than a plane with absolutely no wind affecting him or his clothing whatsoever. The movie does make up for this with a comical flight scene near the end of the film which I wont spoil.",Shazam!

1063,jonathancarthy,Shamazer? Shamalright,7,12 May 2019,"This is a fun and light adventure story, but suffers from the age old superhero problem of dragging in places by being too earnest. Likeable leads are watered down somewhat by having an ensemble cast of types who feel in need of development. Similarly an under-explored bad guy makes him just seem a bit on the meh side.

Good laughs, strong action scenes and some very well rounded actors mixing it up with a very young cast who play their roles very well. Great casting, very good effects and a very fun movie that isn't afraid to be itself. Thoroughly enjoyable and slips in well with the current DC movie titles. I first thought the role would be difficult to fill, but I think Zack plays the role perfectly and really did find himself toward the end. It has a few good surprises which offer the viewer some warmth and giggles in a superhero world turned dark and serious. Shazam gives young viewers something they need- a fun super hero who doesn't lose their identity to the crowd. I'm excited to see where Shazam takes us, and can see him easily fighting alongside the Justice League while not taking that end of the world too seriously.Shazam really is a breath of fresh air and a fun movie to see with children, when they come out of the cinema yelling SHAZAM! You can't help but smile. The many, many little cameos and easter eggs are a treat for the seasoned comic reader. Very well made film and a great addition to the DC lineup.

MILD Spoilers:
It's not an instant classic, doesn't have oscar-winning performances, or even a surprising story. But it's well done, enough to keep you interested, throwing jokes and slapstick comedy in decent doses to lighten up the sad details of the story. Zach Levi hits the right tone for a troublesome-child-gone-buffed-hero.
There's a general feel of a 1980's comedy (first half is basically Tom Hanks' Big, only with superpowers), the children make for a great adventure squad, the villain works (even if as a single-layered bitter, vengeance-driven bad guy). Probably the weakest link are the Sins Monsters, that are given little development and backstory, and a silly design, way too reminding of the 1980's vibe.
Generally enjoyable. Beware: there's one or two very graphic violence moments, that may be too much for younger children.",Shazam!

Most origin stories start out pretty slow, but this one never seemed to drag or get boring. Freddy just about stole the whole movie from Billy. The villain was decent given I don't know much about Shazam. Unfortunately the Pops kind of spoiled a big moment in this movie and that would have made for a great surprise. The cameo at the end was pretty funny considering what happened with the actor. I did think it was a little easy for the villain to figure out Shazam's identity, but it did make sense.

You'd think that is something very fundamental yet we have only explored the responsibilities that come with power (think SpiderMan), the empowerment that comes with it (think Wonder Woman), the sacrifice that comes with it (think Batman, Captain America) and so on.It's a movie with a lot of heart, offers a lot of chuckles and is a genuinely good time at the theaters.",Shazam!

1089,viva_la_dube,Just about what I expected,7,27 July 2019,"I grew up on DC, but outside of Wonder Woman I haven't truly enjoyed a DC movie since Christian Bale was Batman. I waited for this film to come out on disc since taking my family to the movies only seems to end in me paying $60 just to leave disappointed anymore. I'm glad I waited, but I dont think I would have left the theatre disappointed. I don't get the 10 star ratings but the 1 star ratings are even more off base.Of course a movie about a kid that turn into an adult superhero would geared toward a younger audience. My kids loved it and I'm glad. Kids need superheros they can relate to and they need softer gateway superhero movies to help edge them into the better stuff. Compared to the new Batman movies the old ones are soft and stupid, but I loved them as a child. The kids are the future of the franchise and DC made a smart move giving them something less serious to enjoy.Shazam had a decent plot, the messages were good, and it was a refreshing change from the typical superhero movie. The dialogue wasn't extensive to the point where kids lose interest like other superhero movies. The comedy was so-so but not near what I had imagined. The story had an odd way of feeling a little rushed but also slow at points. The graphics were decent but the demons were a little soft looking (I assume so young viewes don't have nightmares). The soundtrack could have been beefed up a bit. Some scenes may cause sensitive parents to get angry, it does contain underage drinking and curiosity toward strip clubs but nothing graphic.
Overall the movie was a solid seven and a nice step back for DC to welcome younger fans. I hope to see more like it in the future.",Shazam!

Although the main protagonist has a strong personality, the rest of the characters - kids - are very unimpressive. The storyline is poor and there is no plot.

1111,a_nella,The most fun DC movie,6,20 April 2019,"Shazam! is a sight for sorer eyes in the DC universe, up until this point DC has yet to capture what makes super hero movies captivating. Shazam! offers a heartfelt story with loveable characters and fantastic humour. However it is held back by the classic super hero tropes. The Main villain was better developed than most, but still isn't very memorable. The seven deadly sins accompanying him were quite boring, the concept lends itself to more unique monster design than just grey, scaly, monsters. Another aspect holding the movie back is the boring final fight, it felt like it dragged on for way too long. The fight introduced an interesting aspect near the end that had a lot of potential to change the fight for the better, but never felt half baked and under-utilized. The story also featured some more harsh and terrifying aspects, people actually being eaten and killed. It was refreshing to see some of the more brutal side of comics. All in All a decent movie with some great characters and a good story, but lacks in the technical aspects (cinematography, CGI, music composition...).",Shazam!
1112,snknight-98010,A total mockery of a great DC character who could of had great potential in future Justice League movies.,1,30 April 2019,"Warner Bros does it again, they take a great DC character and make a complete buffoon out of him. Their biggest mistake is, they don't listen to the DC fans, don't care what DC fans like and have no respect for the DC characters they bring to life on the big screen.
Shazam had the potential to be something big and a great addition to the Justice League. But instead of getting a powerful comic book version, we got a character who when in his Shazam character is more immature than the actor playing the 14 yr old Billy Batson.
This movie was total miss and I am surprised it got so many likes yet made so very little at the box office. The reason it got some likes on Rotten Tomatoes is, the people that went to see the movie, the majority of them weren't DC fans and didn't know any better as to who the Shazam character truly is. And to turn the ending into a Jumanji ending with a bunch of kids turning into their own Shazam version was the straw that broke the camel's back, huge mistake.The Shazam trailers were so disrespectful and clownish that true DC fans like me, didn't want to bother to go see the movie. That's why it got many likes but did so poorly at the box office. Warner Brothers/DC needs to bring in true DC fans to consult on their movies, to get to know the characters they bring to life and a director can't get this from just reading 10-20 comic books of said superhero and say ""Ok, I know this character and I got this"", instead of doing this, let's try this and that. Don't try to re invent the character and try to stay as true as possible to the comic book version. That's why Marvel kicks DC a$$ at the box office, they try and stay as close as possible to the Marvel characters in the comics. And have had great casting, except for them casting ""Brie Larson for CM"", they got it so wrong, yet still got a billion out of it. I've been a DC/Marvel fan for 43 yrs and stopped collecting in early 2000's. I amassed a nice collection that was appraised in the low $50K's in 2001 and passed it on to my son as a family heirloom and was happy when my son decided to continue growing the collection. The market being what it is right now, I'd say it gained in dollar value for sure. Why am I telling you this, because people like me are the people you want to get excited about your DC movies, we'll buy movie tickets for the right movies, we'll continue buying comic books, merchandise, collectible items and so on. And to do that, you need to have DC fans attached to your projects as consultants. MCU Iron Man was such a success and the beginning of something due to being directed by John Favreau, a true Marvel fan and with Stan Lee as a consultant, they created magic that lasted 11 yrs, 22 movies, and $18 billions gross.
So far, Warner Bros/DC's best movie was ""Wonder Woman"" in my opinion, aided by her cameos in Superman vs Batman and then part of the team in Justice League. You screw up a Wonder Woman movie and you're done, no point trying to make other DC movies.",Shazam!

Till one night he gets chosen by a wizard to take his throne and rule the world with his powers. He can always activate those by saying Shazam. I find this movie very funny and entertaining. Its jokes and punchlines are perfectly added in. The only downside is it doesn't have the greatest acting, this is mainly because most the actors are really young and will mostly improve over there acting carrias. I really enjoyed this movie.",Shazam!

1116,kenobio-68005,Say the word,7,31 October 2019,"Shazam! is the 7th movie in the DC extended universe, and offers a comical interpretation of the well-known superhero Shazam.The movie tells the story of Billy Batson, a 14 year-old running around the streets going from family to family, as his mom left him during his childhood. Shortly after being welcomed to a family with adopted children, he is encountered by an old magician who gives him all of his power. By saying a simple word, Billy transforms into a superhuman gifted by the powers of the gods. He develops his powers with the help of his new ""brother"" and friend Freddie, against a villain who has the powers of the seven sins, Dr. Sivanna.The movie lines up within the DCEU, and is probably one of the best of this cinematic universe, even though having a different tone. Indeed, the movie has a comedic theme, which matches with the immaturity of the 14 year-old. It seems like it comes straight out of the MCU, who has a tendency to transform its movies into comedies. However, even if it has some unnecessary jokes, they aren't cracked up every time like in Marvel movies.The casting is decent, Zachary Levi plays Billy Batson's immature personality extremely well, the young Batson interpreted by Asher Angel. Jack Dylan Grazer's Freddie Freeman is seen as the victim of the school, but his friendship with Billy is portrayed amazingly, resembling more to a brotherhood. Dr. Sivanna, played by Mark Strong, has a compelling backstory that makes him a decent powerthirsty supervillian with an interesting skill.Shazam! is an entertaining comic book movie that offers a different view and tone from its predecessors Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, but still a great family and friendship movie.",Shazam!
1117,justinns-28568,Dialogue completely ruined it,4,18 March 2021,"The plot itself was good, could've been a very fun movie, but the dialogue was not only unrealistic, it was impossible to ignore it. The writing for some of the high school characters was so unrealistic, they almost seemed like unintelligent 5 year olds at times, I felt like I the writers have never ever met a person, not just a kid but any person in general. It's hard to concentrate on the plot when the hero or some kid is doesn't talk like a normal person, they stuttered at everything, the only realistic dialogue I found was when Shazam was first introduced to Freddy at the house, that was funny and somewhat realistic.",Shazam!

Zachary Levi gives an absolute spectacular performance, Mark Strong gives a solid performance but his characters motives are confusing at some points. The side plot with Billy's mom was kind of pointless and doesn't add anything to the story, but the adopted kids were actually pretty funny at some points.

My guess is that some people are too engrossed in whether or not the CGI was perfect or too much into details. The movie was pretty true to the comics and had a pretty good storyline and acting.I went with my kids and wife and we all enjoyed it. If you are a comic book freak that is mindful of every little detail then you will most likely find bones to pick with this movie, but if you just want to watch an enjoyable movie, then this one's for you.

1124,FredOnFilm,'A film that never quite lives up to its potential.',7,4 April 2019,"In a cinematic era where comic-book movies reign supreme, Shazam! is the next in line to hurry out the gates and wow audiences. While the genre is taken a lot more seriously these days, Shazam! pokes fun at superhero tropes and stereotypes and for the most part there is a lot of fun to be had here. For many this will feel like a welcome change of scene from the DCEU's usual dark, gritty, dramas. While I certainly had an enjoyable time with Shazam!, I can honestly say that this is one of the weaker entries in the current DC franchise and ultimately a film that never quite lives up to its potential.Shazam! tells the story of 14 year old Billy Batson (Asher Angel), a rebellious orphan who is constantly on the run searching for his lost Mother. One day Billy encounters a mysterious Wizard (Djimon Hounsou) who bestows upon him the power of the Gods instantly transforming him into the adult superhero Shazam (Zachary Levi). The central plot of the film follows Billy's attempts to integrate into a new foster family, all while coming into conflict with the villainous Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong). In terms of the overall story there is nothing new to be seen here. The movie really excels, however, in Billy's personal journey for acceptance and the heart-warming relationships that he forges within his new foster family.For the most part, Shazam! is a hell of a lot of fun, with laughs and gags abundant throughout. I really bought into the relationships found within the foster home. The clear stand-out was Jack Dylan Grazer, who portrays Freddy Freeman, the superhero-obsessed foster brother who helps Billy come to terms with his new powers. The sibling dynamic between Billy and Freddy is dynamite. It also goes without saying that Zachary Levi is simply outstanding as the grown-up Billy who lights up the screen with his child-like exuberance.With all of that said, there are still many things that unfortunately failed to hit the mark. While Angel and Levi were both equally brilliant as Billy, I never once felt they were playing the same character. Angel's portrayal was much more serious and mature as opposed to Levi who is given one-liners and slapstick humour to work with. Though I get that this is supposed to play into Billy's character development, it felt jarring. The film walks the fine line between being a satire and a straight up generic comic-book film. This delicate balancing act feels tedious at times; it's almost like the studio were unsure which direction they wanted to take.Overall, I had a great time watching Shazam! and I highly recommend going to check this one out. If you are someone who has been disillusioned with recent DC superhero films then you will probably fall in love with Shazam! It brings a great deal of humour and heart to the franchise that a lot of people felt was lacking. For me, however, this is not one of the more memorable superhero films in recent memory. A solid, entertaining blockbuster for sure, but no Man of Steel or Batman v Superman.FredOnFilm Movie Rating: BVisit the FredOnFilm movie blog for all the latest news, reviews and discussion in the world of cinema .",Shazam!
1125,shaif,A movie for the whole family,8,6 April 2019,"I was never a great fan of Shazam when it ran on tv. I watched it sporadically but was never was attached to it like I did to Spider-Man.
I went to the movie with some trepidation but came away very satisfied with what I have just seen. I see some reviews that give this movie a 1 or a 2 stars!!!
How can that be? We had to watch entirely different movie. Even if a viewer is a child hater there are still many things to like in the movie. I thought that Mr. Levy did a great job bringing out the 14 year old Billy Baston within him. And how can someone not like the sarcastic Freddy who basically becomes his coach and mentor. The movie is funny all the way through and is in contrast to the dark undertone that DC movie universe maintains. I gave it ""only"" an 8 since a 10 is a masterpiece and a 9 is a bit below. A 1 is reserved for a movie without any value whatsoever. People keep giving it to movies willy nilly just because they were disappointed with it. You don't like a movie give it a 3 or a 4. A reviewer should be just as stingy with their high ratings as their low ones.",Shazam!

Noooo that's so repetitive, why didn't it try something unique?!?Well guess what, it did!! Ignore all those ignorants.

Other reviews say this is for kids but I completely disagree, I normally even hate kids in films (with the exception of Stranger Things) but this film is made to be fun and not to take itself seriously, other terrible superhero films try be serious and are cheesy and awful but this film knows exactly what it is.

DC Comics, in the 1990s, decided to take the name ""Shazam"" and published excellent stories aimed at a more select comics audience. This bad film however does not follow one period or another, it's pure clowning with poor effects and absolutely ""infanto-horrible"" script. Nothing in this production has any interest for fans of the comics hero or for the moviegoer. To add insult to injury, destroy all the characters with stupid ""reimaging"", for example of arch-nemesis, Dr. Sivana, here just an invention of the head of lazy writers. Pure rubbish.",Shazam!

Add this to the list of awesome comic book movies. I don't want to compare it to Wonder Woman or Aquaman because honestly, it's not the same sort of movie. It is a very heart felt, warm, and hilarious film. The portrayal of the foster family, I think, was great, having worked in group homes for over 7 years. The comedic moments are plenty but that suits the overall tone and aim of the film. Great villain, excellent action and effects, truly hilarious moments, if you're looking for a great light hearted comic book movie with laughs and real emotion and feeling, then look no further.

It has a lot of heart. Asher angel doing his first feature film and nails his character. JDG was a great casting. He holds this movie together. And Zach Levi just nailed Shazam.There are so many funny moments in this movie and none of them feel forced. Every joke lands. My jaw was hurting I was laughing so hard. The movie balances comedy, scares, stakes and of course family. At it's core Shazam is a family movie firstly. Even with the background story for sivana there was lots of family ideals involved. You'll fall in love with every character. Even the siblings are all very relatable and grounded.Sandberg, who was initially viewed as a question mark choice to direct a superhero movie involving a kid, did an amazing job. He kept the tone well balanced and used some of his horror movie background.Grab some popcorn, leave your worries at the door, and enjoy this funfest.

The second half of the film comprises of long sequences of Shazam running away and being generally totally useless regardless of knowing how much power he has. The teenager-in-a-superhero-body concept is laboured to the point of total boredom. The laughs are eye-rolling and forced and the amount this movie is pitched at kids only is annoying. The violence is totally dummed down and powers are frequently simply not used at all as if they've been totally forgotten.

I couldn't tell if they were going for young audience, adult, comedy, or action. It never really pulled any of those things off.It seems disconnected from the other dc stuff lately.

And this movie is better.This film is not a masterpiece. It's an okay film, and a good superhero flick. It's no Dark Knight or Avengers obviously, the tone and production is way different. Shazam! is a comedy. And a good one. Now the key to comedy is timing, and this movie is nailing it. Its not pushing it (Guardians Vol. 2 anyone?) knows actually when to say what, the screenwriting is on point.But the best thing about this film is it's self-awareness. It knows it's a film about a kid becoming a superhero, you should realize that. It knows it can make jokes about hitting your head and peeing in the suit but also make clever comic book references.So really strong points; comedy (timing, consistency) Zachary Levi was born for the role, screenwriting and script. Directing, Jack Dylan Grazer and the rest of the supporting casting, visuals were all alright, nothing to complain about.I didn't really like the third act, but can't talk about it without giving spoilers.All with all, a flick you can easily enjoy without taking it to seriously. Sets an example and new tone for the DCEU, it might just be my favorite film so far. 8/10",Shazam!

It has some really funny moments...but it is not a good comedy, because it takes itself and the superhero- idea way too serious!
For the same reason, it can also not be classified as a parody!
But for a true superhero- movie, it is way too childish!
I really welcome the breaking away of DC from the darkness and and nitty- gritty of some of it's movies, but this is just a step too far!

-Lightheardted fun movie
-Genuinely funny bitsCons
-Casting: Unsuitable actors cast in the main roles especially Jimmy, Darla and Freddie's roles. All of them overact and almost all the scenes involving them make you cringe.
-SJW checklist: There has to be diversity. Black girl? Check. Chinese guy who is also a nerd? Check. Fat guy who doesn't talk much? Check. Disable person? Check. Mexican/Spanish parents? Check. What is this? A crossover episode? Check!
Oh almost forgot this one: Real parents aren't true family! Check.Overall, the movie is fine. Plot is okay. Special effects are below average. There are some fun moments.

The highlight of the movie is the comedy it has many good jokes and it's genuinely funny . Apart of the comedy your not getting any epic moments , or cool action sequences , there's really a lack of CGI usage and it makes the look of Shazam kind of dull .
As a comic book fan I love Shazam and he has so much potential to be such an amazing hero. But unfortunately he doesn't look that awesome like man of steel . Lack of action .
An entertaining movie but wouldn't watch again . It's a kids movie basically.
But I'll give an 8 for the comedy .",Shazam!

1182,victorsilva-23877,Fun exciting ride,8,2 June 2019,"Shazam is another home run for the comeback of the DCEU. Its a fun ride that delivers on all aspects you expect from a superhero flick today.
The leads are extremely likeable and Zachary Levi is the perfect fit for adult Billy Batson. He really sells the teen in an adults body well bringing many laughs and fun moments. The humour here is done well and gets plenty of laughs from the audience.The main villain isn't anything special, but he does his job well and has some brutal moments you may not expect in a film like this.The action is entertaining and does not disappoint while also bringing a couple of suprises along the way.I think the story was done well and they really sell the relationships of the kids in the foster home. By the end of the film, you really come to care for these characters. The film also has some gut punching emotional moments as information is reviewed to characters.David F Sandberg also taps into his horror routes and implements a few nice and timely scares that will get a few jumps from the audience, but they are not overused.
Overall this is one of the funnest and most light hearted films in the DCEU and is a strong outing to compete with the MCU. Definitely check this one out!",Shazam!

What detracts a bit from a perfect score is occasional Marvel-like quipping, which takes away from some of the scenes, which actually are quite scary - some decent horror movie quality even. It would have served it well to have Billy Batson having to suffer more under his own mistakes - here he stays mostly a prankster.

(That's what I liked about it) First, In it's origin it was realistic in the ways it should have been yet very fictional and ""silly"". I really liked the acting from all the children and how it caught onto the adult actors and actresses. It really did fit in well with the story with it's realism...and second, I really was surprised by how I knew the outcome in a sort of way, but really had a feeling of worry for the characters. It caught onto me that this was a very well made movie, and the fun moments really had me unexpected yet hinted clues along the way sneakily. Finally, the heartwarming family moments warmed my heart.

1187,garyg-94974,Great concept defeated by miscasting and directing,6,7 April 2019,"This movie fails because Zachary Levi doesn't even try to make us believe that he is a specific person in a new body. The movie BIG worked because Tom Hanks captured the specific character of a child in an adult body. In this movie, the adult Billy Batson seems emotionally about five years younger than the child Billy. The child Billy is serious with serious problems. The adult Bill is goofy, giddy, and silly. This child Billy wants to find his mother. The adult Billy wants to eat snack foods.
The adult Billy's character disconnects use from any emotional connection with the film. Why should we care about Billy's problems when he himself doesn't?
There is some clever stuff in the script that is completely missed by the actor (and apparently the director) that would have helped us make an emotional connection. This is one of the few times where I would say that script was better than the execution of it.",Shazam!
1188,rhysmatthewwardrop,Better than justice league.,3,27 March 2019,"I got the chance to see Shazam early, being a lover of cinema myself I decided to accept the invitation to be able to see Shazam before most of the general public. While I do not regret my decision to see this film before anyone else I'm not going to pretend like I enjoyed Shazam.Firstly the acting which I expected to be outstanding considering I'm a fan of many of the actors other work was ultimately lack lustre. The most disappointing part was that there was little to no chemistry between characters. However I did enjoy the numerous callbacks to other DC comic and film characters but little to my knowledge Henry Cavill would not be Superman in this film rather Warner Brothers just blacking out Superman's face due to difficulties with his contract. Never the less I found the scenes with the Shazam family to be quite funny at times.I also felt like the plot was thin at most points choosing to do the predictable and rather boring than fleshing out its characters in a fun unpredictable way. Seems like the writer wasn't really that experienced or interested in Shazam as a character. The CGI while good for the most part became quite shoddy towards the end and evidentially became really unrealistic. I would have preferred there to be more practical effects rather than all being CG. Another thing is that while actors find it extremely gueling to work out and gain muscle for roles the padding in the suit was excessive and frankly so noticeable I don't see why Zachery Levi even worked out for them to just ruin it with some stupid looking costume. I wouldn't recommend seeing this film at the cinema but maybe watching it when it comes on a larger site like Netflix or Hulu. I've enjoyed many comic book films as of recent but Shazam wasn't one of them it's ultimately weak like films such as Venom and Aquaman.",Shazam!

Especially since i'm a dc guy, but unfortunately, not really a fan of comics outside Batman. So i didn't know much what to expect.I felt the main character in his teens wasn't written very well. He is a good actor, as shown in the scene where he meets his mother again, but the moments when he tried to act tough, or an angsty teen didn't feel right. It was more awkward then realistic to me. Especially with all he's been through, i feel he should be more mature after those hard events than like every emo teen with issues.As a DC movie, this is a good one. It has some problems with the pacing, some scenes feel more solid than others, some feel really out of place like the cgi, some are good, some are not. The monsters are surprisingly plain. I didn't quite make up my mind did i like them or not. It was a surprise, but then again, there wasn't much to look at.It's really a mixed bag.

Its monsters are poorly crafted and executed, and they don't work with the tone of the film.However, the chemistry between the incredibly talented kids and a hilarious Zachary Levi is outstanding, and that's what really saves the movie. They're a feast to watch when they're on screen.

1202,deeschild,Shazam is the DC Universe's future.,7,6 April 2019,"Shazam is a enjoyable film that DC should use to head into a new cinematic direction. It pays homage to DC greats Superman, Batman, Aquaman and also the most obvious Tom Hank's ""Big"". Zach Levi perfectly embodies the teenager Billy Batson trapped in the buff body of a newly ripened adult with superpowers.Billy Batson is a foster child on a determined search to find his biological mother. His journey sees him getting removed from several homes until unbeknownst to him he is placed with what will be the perfect family. Freddy his new foster brother played by Jack Dylan Grazer is the perfect sidekick for young Billy and Shazam. His comedic timing is effortless. The other children in the household are very engaging. My favorite scenes involved this endearing family that had each other's back. Billy in an attempt to protect Freddy from bullies is bestowed with superhero gifts well beyond his imagination. He does exactly what a fifteen year old wth power and freedom would do.Inevitably Shazam meets his rival, Sivana, a villain adequately played by Mark Strong but underwhelming nonetheless. The violence throughout the movie warrants the PG13 rating and adds to the dark undertones of the film. Children under 10 may be find some of it frightening.Shazam is fun and has a wonderfully exciting final scene. Definitely stay until the end for two post credit bonus scenes.",Shazam!

The ""Super Hero"" doesn't appear until about an hour into the movie, with no explanation of why this kid was chosen whatsoever. There's no explanation for the villain's motivation as well, and how did he come to be a mad scientist (or evil genius) .. the rest was a complete mess. How did the villain master his powers so quickly even though he had them a little before the hero?
The fight scenes were pathetic. The plot bad. I found myself skipping over to the end for most of the second half of the movie.

1211,askrapitsalex,DC's Spectacle of Fun,9,23 May 2019,"Warner Bros. came a long way through transitioning the DC Extended Universe. It started out dark with questionable casting and decisions that polarized critics and audiences together. However when ""Wonder Woman"" became a critical and commercial success, the studio slowly starts making their future projects lighthearted and fun. Sure, ""Justice League"" made an awkward first impression with through its heavy re-shoots and editing, but ""Aquaman"" was swimming into the right direction with its adventurous tone. With their next installment, ""Shazam!"" exceeded my expectations and easily become one of my favorite DC movies of the decade.A teenage foster child named Billy (Asher Angel) was magically chosen by an ancient wizard (Djimon Hounsou) where he was given the power to transform into an adult superhero known as Shazam (Zachery Levi) every time he shouts his name. Now, with help from his fanatic foster brother Freddie (Jack Dylan Grazer), Shazam must learn to control his new powers while protecting the world from the evil Dr. Sivana (Mark Strong).Hearing this synopsis alone, the story sounds conceptually generic with some cliches you've seen before in most superhero movies. However, in terms of execution, the story works pretty well. Imagine the concept of the Tom Hanks classic ""Big"" combined with the campy nature of the Sam Raimi ""Spider-Man"" movies. It SOUNDS crazy but once you SEE it, it works. The movie also has good use of foreshadowing when it comes to the story and characters.Horror film director David F. Sandberg really surprised me on how much fun and humor you could make into a superhero flick. Throughout this movie, there will be familiar and refreshing jokes that will make you laugh non-stop. Sometimes, you'll come across references from previous Sandberg and DC movies. The action scenes are energetic and blends well with the comedic tone.The cast did a phenomenal job with their performances throughout the movie. Asher Angel captures the rebellious yet kind-hearted nature of a child while Zachary Levi provides big laughs as both the ""child-trapped-in-grown-up's body"" trope and a mighty superhero. Billy's foster family are so likable and charming, especially with Jack Dylan Grazer cleverly portraying a fanboy who mentors an adult superhero.As for Mark Strong, his role as the villain would be debatable among others. On one hand, he plays a typical power-hungry villain who seeks Shazam's powers for reasons I will not give away. On the other hand, once you do see why, you will feel sympathy towards his character.Did I forget to mention it takes place around Christmas? Ever since ""Iron Man 3"", you will get a feeling that this movie will become a new holiday classic for unique reasons.Overall, if you're in the mood for a superhero film with fun and laughs, this is a must-watch. Being released on the same month as ""Avengers: Endgame"", it is considered an appetizer before settling on ""Endgame"" as the main course.Shazam!!!RATING: *** 1/2 out of **** stars (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)",Shazam!

1213,ethanbeard,Generic and un-funny,5,30 March 2019,"SHAZAM! is a weird movie. The stuff it does right is done very well, but the stuff it does wrong it does horribly. I was able to catch an early screening of the film on March 23 so, naturally, the theatre was packed with eager fans. I'll get to it later, but this audience would go on to become an instrumental part of my negative film-going experience.As for the movie itself, the cast is the easy highlight. Zachary Levi does a really fantastic job as Shazam and perfectly captures the fun and innocence of being 15 years old. Asher Angel plays his ""alter-ego,"" Billy Batson, and when he is given the opportunity he really shines in dramatic scenes. Another stand-out was Jack Dylan Grazer's comedic performance as Billy's best friend, Freddy Freeman. Mark Strong plays the antagonist, Dr. Thaddeus Sivana, though his talent as an actor is wasted in the minimal screen time he is given. Besides a few poor actors such as the little sister and the two bullies from their school, the cast was quite excellent. In particular, a scene in a convenience store was very well done from an acting/writing point-of-view. The action is also pretty good. Though it is nothing all too special, it kept my attention, and I was never bored during the action scenes (which is something I cannot say for other DCEU films). They found many creative ways of utilizing Shazam's abilities, especially the power of changing between a kid and a super-powered adult. As well, the special effects were very effective and never felt fake or cheap. While this film doesn't have as much VFX as most superhero films do, the scenes where they are most prominent are quite good, save for some strange-looking creatures primarily featured in the third act. To round out the pros, the best thing about this movie is how fun it can be when it's not taking itself too seriously. It knows what it is, and relishes in that. Unfortunately, that's where the pros end and the long list of cons begin.This movie is so poorly written. It is one of the most predictable superhero films I have ever seen, and that's saying a lot. I don't just mean in terms of how the overall story will play out, but also individual scenes and jokes. Things are set up so obviously that it is impossible to not know what the payoff will be. If you're watching a scene and you think you know where it's going, then that's likely what's going to happen in the scene. Even little moments such as characters turning around and seeing their car isn't where it was a moment earlier and it being SO OBVIOUS to the audience that the car is about to fall right in front of them. I know that might seem like a nitpick, but when predictable things like that happen every few minutes, it takes away from the enjoyment of the film. This movie is not only very predictable, but is also not very funny. I'll admit, there were a few moments that made me genuinely laugh, but there are so many jokes in total that the real funny ones likely only comprise 5% of all the comedy in the film. It tries so hard to make the audience laugh that it does the opposite effect for me. For crying out loud, the characters in the film pause after many jokes to give the audience time to laugh. It's hard to sit through at times. Many of the jokes overstay their welcome and go on for way too long, and other jokes are either really obvious slapstick humour or jokes that have been done a million times before. There's one moment when Shazam and the villain are really far apart, and the villain does his generic bad-guy monologue and Shazam can't hear him because they are so far away. This EXACT joke was done (to much better effect, might I add) in Kung Fu Panda 2...eight years ago!This is where my experience with the audience came in. With Shazam, I am convinced that no one in that theatre had ever seen a film before. Every single slightly humorous comment got UPROARIOUS laughter. People were wheezing, gasping for air, and honestly it was annoying because the movie was simply not that funny. People also clapped and cheered a lot, which I found weird because applause works for a film like Star Wars: The Force Awakens or Avengers: Infinity War; big anticipated films that can be akin to a sporting event. But this was Shazam. This wasn't some massive team-up film or a long awaited return of a beloved franchise. Something else that really bothered me was the choice to acknowledge other DC superheroes such as Batman and Superman as icons of popular culture. It makes sense that if superhero really existed they would become icons for which they would sell toys and merchandise, but in this film it seems overdone and creates a few potholes in the continuity of these films. For instance, a kid at the school has a Batman backpack, but within the world that these films have established, Batman was a vigilante that the press and police deemed too brutal as he would brand his ""victims"" with bat symbols on their bodies. Even though he's a very different character in Justice League, I don't know that he's now become a friendly neighbourhood superhero that a five year-old would have a backpack of. Another example is in the toy store scene where they are literally selling toys from the Justice League film, complete with the films logo and the DC logo on the side of the packaging. I know this sounds very nitpicky, but remember that on a film there are hundreds of jobs. Someone's entire job is to decorate the set, another person's job is to work on wardrobe. How did things like this get overlooked? This may seem small, but when you notice these things it makes the film feel lazy and cheap.Moving on, the villain's motivation seemed almost non-existent and seemed like he was evil for the sake of being evil (he even acknowledges at one point how evil he is). Finally, the ""drama"" element of this film felt so forced and underdeveloped. If the filmmakers wanted the strained relationship between Billy and his foster family to be the main focus, why do they devote such little time to developing all of them as characters? The only developed member of that family is Freddy, but his primary focus is on the Shazam/superhero parts of the film. And again, not to nitpick, but the little sister character is given way too much screen time for a character that matters so little. Her only purpose is to make jokes, but in a comedy film we already have many other characters that serve that purpose. I'm also annoyed at the new trend of-in order to put a twist on the stereotype and to be funny-making the little girl character the most defiant and brave character. If a six year old is going to be picked up and almost eaten by a giant monster/demon, she's not going to make some one-liner or boldly tell it to let go of her. She's going to cry and scream and be a realistic depiction of a six year old girl. ""Let go of my brother!"" isn't something a little girl would bravely say to a giant demonic monster, but at least my audience got a kick out of it.This film jumps the line back and forth from taking itself very seriously to acknowledging the silliness of the concept and having fun with it. At one moment, I'm expected to care about whether or not Mary is going to get into the college of her choice, and next I'm shown a homemade video of Shazam trying out his powers. Again, when the movie lets itself have fun it can be enjoyable to watch, it just feels like two people with opposing ideas of how to adapt Shazam for the big screen decided to write this film together. It's very generic and adheres to many of the same tropes that have been done in other superhero films.

However, Zachary Levi was excellent in the lead and for the most part the supporting cast was good. Yes, there are a few plot holes. Yes, the movie sputtered a bit in part. However, if you remember when you were 14 and you could have been a superhero (most likely remembering you wanted to be one at 5 or 6 or 8), you would have jumped at the chance. There are a few points about the mythology of Shazam that you get later in the film so it is a bit unknown territory for some viewers. Overall, the movie is cute, sweet, with enough action coupled with excellent special effects=a good movie. Some of the scenes were very funny. I think the director and actors have lived and learned in this movie; when they come back in Shazam!2, they will be more seasoned with a bigger budget and a bigger movie. This move was barely marketed for whatever reason but maybe the two trailers were all it took. It is a kids' movie and an adults' movie. It was exactly what we wanted...a mature enough movie for us to see as a family, yet kid-like in parts, with understandable and clean humor in many parts. It is something fresh for a change. We spent two hours on a Sunday as a family and it was a great time had by all.",Shazam!

-Doctor Sivana was yet another very

Despite the DC-Marvel cross over of the same actor playing old Shazam and Korath in Guardians of the Galaxy, the movie was funny, touching and well executed.
Zachary Levi was the perfect cast for the role of a 30yo acting's like a 12yo.
The kids casted were great (except the generalisations of the Asian kid, not so much).
And there were only a few cringe moments in the dialogue.
I thoroughly enjoyed the movie :)",Shazam!

Seriously to me is very funny throughout the movie. This movie also suits family to watch together.

1222,jatinkm,A good time but not much to remember it by.,6,7 April 2019,"The movie is more of a comedy . There's a bit of high school nostalgia to the movie which was, according to me, the best part of the movie which gave us some moments of emotions and the most funny scenes as well. The first and second act were the best parts. The movie was most entertaining around the second act and started getting less precise about what direction it wants to go in. The third act was not what I was expecting and it was a dissapointment.I loved the acting of Jack Dylan Grazer, who plays the role of the protagonist's friend. He was the key element to most the humour as well as some thought provoking scenes.The action was not done well. Though the CGI looked great, there wasn't much of a fight in the third act. The movie keeps building up to the final battle but it doesn't pay off well. There were many plot holes and scenes where Physics is disregarded for the theatricality. There were some campy dialogues as well.The most endearing part of the movie was the drama among the kids with high school and family, just mix that with superpowers.Overall, it's an entertaining movie to watch in the theaters, you'd probably have a pretty good time watching it.",Shazam!

It was not a comedy,it was very childish..People have to be able to realise what is a nice funny joke,what is comedy but also have to realize that when you overdoit it can become boring,annoying and childish..And unfortunately the producers of this film ended up destroying this movie,by making it childishThe movie begin very promising,very nice ,with very nice effects and story..But after this guy became a hero,everything changed..the movie became a joke..and very childish..It was funy the first 5 minutes but after that we were just waiting when it will become more serious,but unfortunately this kept going and going till the end of the movie..They ended up making a movie for children below 16 years old.And this movie its supposed to be for adults..the way the producers made this film is not good for children as sometimes there some scary scenes (for anyone below16) but the rest of the movie is not good for adults as the jokes are childish and annoying for anynone above 18!The kid who was the ""hero"" was much more serious as a kid..but when he was changing to a hero,they just overdid it with the childish behavour and jokes..The actors are good,the cinematography and speciall effects (cgi) also good ..the story started well..but they have to work more on it..Add a few funny jokes here and then,thats ok ,but dont destroy the whole movie by making it look childish..Its really boring that hollywood is not able to be serious for once..or at least make a good comediy with nice funny line and not childish",Shazam!

This is definitely one of their best movies and I do believe it was worth the time and money seeing it in theaters.

Recently the DCEU has been producing better movies (Wonder Woman, Aquaman) than before (Justice League, Suicide Squad). This movie was very entertaining with great comedy scenes and action scenes, with a good flow that didn't feel like it was to much of either genre.

Really enjoyable during watching,and it's really a fxcking big fun!!!
Sandberg did a great job,he's perfectly blended family and friendship. Who could imagine that actually he's an expert for thrillers if you don't know him ha? Certainly,there are some creepy scenes that may freak you out.
As for its flaws,the biggest one is the fighting parts. It's too dull. Besides,Sivana and Sins are not bad ass enough. Such a pity!
Just expect the prospect of DC. And......

1234,degisa,A decent film,7,6 April 2019,"I enjoyed this movie, I don't think it is deserving of an Oscar but I do believe it has one of the things many movies today lack, heart. The film is a bit cliche but it handles it well and I suppose the entire family getting power is a bit of an upsetting twist if you don't have any comic knowledge. The villain is your usual super-hero movie villain with paper thin motivations but has moments where he feels like an actual threat. I enjoyed the theme but it wasn't groundbreaking and besides that I don't really remember any other music than the ending music. A common misconception I believe people are have with this film is that they wanted an action movie, but that's not what it is about it is a character drama inside of a super-hero movie. Levi's performance is good, as are the kids who played both Freddy and Billy but the same can't exactly be said for the other actors some did better than others but none were great. The scene where the sins were killing people in the meeting room was unexpected as well as well shot but I would worry about your children watching it. Overall a decent film that I would recommend, just don't expect well shot or choreographed action scenes and the third half drags a bit.",Shazam!

It has a much more light-hearted tone compared to other DC movies nowadays, and it simply has a feel to it that can't compared.

The CGI and direction for most of the movie was great. There were some parts towards the end that looked a little wonky, but overall it looked really good.
Story (counts twice): 8/10
Great story. It never slowed down. It was always fun at the minimum and intruiging at its best.
Characters: 7/10
The characters were also very good. I felt like some of the foster kids lacked development, but the lead, the foster parents, and his mom really drove this section. The villain was pretty good on the whole as well.
Themes: 9/10
Family and siblingship over all else. You have to look at for you, but don't over do it. If you have a support system, use it. Some more perspective on what it means to be a hero as well. Phenomenally done here.
Overall: 39/50",Shazam!

In Billy Batson's case, by shouting out one word - SHAZAM! - this streetwise fourteen-year-old foster kid can turn into the adult superhero Shazam. It is wonderful story to watch in this film. I went into this a little sceptical and found I came out rather chuffed with such a good film. Far far better than I was expecting and pleased I had gone to a preview screener for this. The acting is spot on, the comedy is spot on and the action is.... You guessed it, spot on. I certainly recommend any super hero fan to go watch this and big praised to WB for leaving this alone and letting the DIrector get on with it.",Shazam!

1245,goharddamnit,"Mediocre at best, only for up to 15 years old",4,11 April 2019,"The movie disappoints, all the hype about the best DC movie but no. Honestly, I am never trusting the hype again, so calculated and rehearsed.The movie starts really slow and it drags a lot until the plot progresses. Totally unnecessary and it goes on for over 30 minutes.Afterwards, the movie has maybe 4 or 5 good laughs through out but the main issues to my opinion are:
The kid shifts personality 100% when he is transforming into Shazzam, which is not accurate, only his appearance should change. I mean he doesn't even act like himself! He is a very serious teen and transforms into this goofy, happy little clown. Too much. There should have been some continuity.Zac plays well, don't get me wrong, I like his acting and movements. But the way he lands when flying...oh my god so awkward, you can almost ''see'' the cords dragging him when flying, like these Christopher Reeve Superman movies. So my question is, why Marvel has got this spot on and you cant make your superhero look cool when flying? You dont have the budget? Or is it that you don't know how?The suits make him extremely buff and every time he turns, he does so like a truck. It looks super corny and weirdThe plot will satisfy teens and kids. Very shallow.The villain knows from the start that he is weaker! What's the point?There is no real struggle, no redemption, no true coming of age story.If you are to take your kid to the movies, yes they will enjoy it. I honestly believe this. But if you like superhero movies as an adult, don't.. just don't..",Shazam!

1247,someetramay,HEART OF DCEU,8,7 April 2019,"This movie takes place right on the timeline of previous DCEU and still manages to carry its own vibe and feel. 14 year old foster kid having fun with his superpowers which he got from a wizard, is something we have never seen before. The approach to the concept with a Simple and warm plot along with modern humor, Creating situational comedy and Mocking some cliche superhero situations without breaking the fourth wall is an amazing attempt on Shazam's character. David Sandberg pulled it off perfectly. The movie has a heart. Its funny, its silly, its emotional, it has a beautiful message to it. Which was delivered perfectly and fluently throughout the movie. How Billy used his powers to gain attention. How his mind changed to do something good with his powers. Learning how to use them. And then passing it on. Billy is the only superhero I've witnessed who thinks that everyone should have that special thing he has. And yes, Marvel Family did appear briefly. Rumors were correct. As Shazam couldn't defeat Sivana and Seven Deadly Sins alone, he passes on his powers to his foster siblings to bring Marvel Family to life. And How can I forget, Superman made a cameo. It was the most comicbook inspired appearance of Superman in DCEU. Child friendly and fun seeking boy scout appears in his red and blue spandex to join Shazam and some HighSchoolers for lunch in school mess hall. Although we didn't get to see his face. We indeed got a glimpse of The Rock as Black Adam, which indicates their plans with Black Adam in future. I loved the movie overall. Music was a Nostalgic hammer to heart. CGI was pretty amazing, considering the low budget. David Sandberg managed to pull off it with perfection. Can't wait to see more of Shazam in DCEU. Specially interacting with other JL members.",Shazam!
1248,ikjones-08629,The Real Captain,10,12 May 2019,"Everything I expected, and more! Shazam is wonderful in comics. How cool would it be, as a kid, if you screamed a word and turned into an empowered superhero who could practically do anything: fly, throw lightning, shoot beams of electricity, teleport, move faster than the speed of light. I have always found Shazam super interesting not just him as a character or his comic book history. I think his history out of the comic book world was interesting. Now known as Shazam since the terrible copyright laws back then, was originally founded by Whiz comics. DC comics thought that Shazam was too similar to their largest character Superman. They tried to legally take Shazam away from them but failed to. So instead they just bought Whiz and caught the ownership of Shazam. Did you know the king of rock, Elvis, loved Shazam Jr in the comics? He loved the character so much that he designed his iconic costume after him. They changed his name to Shazam since that's what he said when he transformed. Shazam actually was an initialism. It stood for the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles, and finally the speed of Mercury. Also for emphasis an extra exclamation mark. By the way this film may not be suitable for kids. It has scary moments. Families have had to walk out the theatre because of how scary it is. This is the real Captain Marvel.I have actually read Shazam comics. And I believe they absolutely nailed the origin of Billy Batson. Not the original origin, just the latest. I believe back then there must not have been anything wrong if a teenager followed an anonymous old man into an abandoned underground train station. My main concern was - judging from the trailers - big difference between Asher Angels' Billy Batson and Zachary Levi's Shazam. Of course, they are literally playing the same person. Fortunately, they portrayed their role perfectly. The suit was astonishing (all of them). Doctor Sivana was brilliant. I am glad that Mark Strong came back from his lost performance in Green Lantern to put on a fantastic one in this DC movie. I believe, as I said, Mark is a fantastic actor and his character was out of this world. One big part of the film was a scene in the office. Not big in the lines of the plot, big as in supposed to be a horror. That scene was terrifying; monsters were biting heads off of innocent people and throwing them out the top of huge skyscrapers, making them plummet to their death. it felt super out of place in the movie. Although the seven deadly sins were fantastically CGI'd and the relationship between it and Doctor Sivana was excellent. I slightly not surprised they added a dash of horror since David Sandberg is well known for his horror films (Annabelle). By the way full spoilers from here and through the review.The costumes for the other Shazam siblings; Pedro, Eugene, Mary, Darla, and Freddy - were beyond fantastic. And the resemblance between the adult form and the original were even better. It kind of scary how similar Jack Dylan Grazer and Adam Brody look. I also liked the clothes color they wore in reference to their Shazam form. Like how Billy Batson wore a red shirt and when he was shazam'd, he was wearing full red. I was exhilarated to see all the Shazam family on the big screen in front of me for the first time. I wouldn't call how they got their powers a plot hole, but more need of explanation. The origin of the main Shazam was pretty smart. In the comics, he just gets his powers and already has the good guy minds set. But in the movie, he has to develop it. He has to learn how to deal with his powers. With great power come great responsibility... right? And you get to see Billy adjust to his new life as well. One of my many concerns was the fact that Mary and Billy might have a relationship. I just didn't want it to happen. It would feel weird and cringe-worthy. Coming from a person that has read the comics, Mark Strong nailed Doctor Sivana. Especially towards the end - post credit scene. In the comics, he has a huge powerful addiction to magic. To the point, he could kill his family or an ounce of magic. I think there were a couple of slightly bad short CGI scenes. So to sum up: comedy landed, the script was incredible, amazing antagonist, profound protagonists, and brilliantly represents how a real teenager would react and take action given adult privileges and superpowers. Phenomenal.",Shazam!

The action scenes where really well done with when billy try out his powers and the store scene was really well done. The fight scenes with Dr Thaddeus Sivana vs Shazam was really good and the scene at the ending was a surprise and there was more when we got there in the movie. Since when talk about the action how was the performances. Zachary Levi as Shazam was perfect by having great one liners and humorous moments I thought he was the best. Also mark strong as Dr Thaddeus Sivana was really believable that you know he really that evil but overall everyone did a great job.The Shazam costume was like the comic book and Dr Thaddeus Sivana costume made him look really bad including the jacket he was wearing was really cool!. The set design was really nice looking at with how some of the scenes took place where beautiful.

While the plot might be predictable, and the villain might be bland, there is some good that comes from the film. Like witty one liners and great comedy. I am glad to see that DC can leave their dark gritty movies once and a while, and just make something fun and enjoyable.

Nothing new, original or creative (see Ragnarok/Spiderverse for comparison). It was boring, the score me rolling my eyes, same exact beats as all of DC movies with the exception of Man of Steel... Not much action and humor was forced and obvious. Also, all those references to Batman and Superman was just depressing since we now know they've been scrappedShazam never really had many great titles in comic books to begin with.

But the writers have sort of made Shazam an adult character, not as a teenager in an adult body. I wish they would've made more similarities between Billy and Shazam, except for how they argue with Freedy Freeman (Jack Dylan Grazer).If we put that aside, with a few other minor flaws, the movie is great.
It's like ""Big"" meets ""Man of Steel"" with a small touch of cartoon ""Justice League"".It's not in the ""Avengers"" territory, but It's like a PG-rated ""Deadpool"". It's just plain fun.",Shazam!

I also love all comic cinematic universes equally, dceu, mcu, fox, sony/marvel etc. That being said, dceu has REALLY made dramatic improvements as of late by focusing on character development. That all started with wonder woman because we got to see who they were at the core and we got to see them grow and build relationships with other characters in the movie. I thought this movie would be lame based on what i saw in the previews and i was wrong. The comedy is so perfect because it was my type of humor and the pace was great. The only thing that i didn't care for was the main villain and the fight scenes were decent but nothing special. Everything else felt true to the comics and i really enjoyed it. 8/10 for me.",Shazam!

After a great hit in aquaman DC has again striker back with Shazam. A superhero movie with light action but full of fun family comedy. Zachery Levy is a complete actor and does not make shazam look boring at all. His comedy and actions makes Shazam an interesting character for everyone to like. DC has shown again that how the justice league is coming to formation. That superman cameo at the end is amazing though 😀,Shazam!
1290,saikrishnaklu,DC got it right yet again!,10,10 April 2019,"Shazam is a movie where the audience feel come out of the theatre with a smile on face. While many movies of this genre are hackneyed with the routine plot of saving the world from evil, but this movie offers a different and never before experience of Childish Superhero trying to use his powers for fun. This itself is a unique selling point of the whole movie and not to forget the amazing cast who were just germane for their roles. Zachary Levi is worthy of the praise that he is receiving and undoubtedly he is born for the role.Another most interesting aspect of the movie is the foster family which sets up an amazing relationship among the members of the family as the film progress. The humor, love, and affection between the family is what makes this a better film while separating from their counterparts.Overall, Shazam is an exquisite experience unlike any other superhero and gives a glimpse of 80's storytelling with tons of humor and heart throughout the film.As a comic book lover - It can't get any better than this - 10/10 Normal Movie rating - 8/10",Shazam!

Something about adults acting really well like children makes this movie gold. We loved it. My son loved it and now says SHAZAM! way to much. Fun loving for sure for family in the sense that it shows not all who are family are blood. Really sweet movie. The deadly sins were a little rough for my 6 year but again it's pg13 and well I can't baby him I understand he is still 6. He can't get over kids being super hero. So I think he is good.

Once he got the power from a wizard, its full of humour in theatre while he try to figure out what are the powers he have and how to use them. On the other hand, the boy in the thrilling prologue have got evolved as a villian. Rest all actions.

The constant yelling of jokes were plain annoying. The kid Billy and Shazam Billy had 0 similarity in their personality. I am a DC fan but I'm sorry to say that this movie was crap. After it was done I had the same feeling I have after watching typical superhero movies. Hero beats villain. End of story. There is absolutely no dark tone here and maybe that's what makes it look like a poorly made marvel movie.",Shazam!

1305,olivasevan,"Great Hero, Weak Villain",7,6 April 2019,"Shazam! was a great movie and a big step forward for DC. It starts off really slow, had my mind thinking ""oh, it's gonna be one of these movies."" Surprisingly, the villain isn't this stereotypical ""I want to take over the world and kill everyone I run into"" you can see where his motive is and it almost makes you want to side with him. The beast side kick villians though, that is what I am giving this movie a 7/10 for. Horrible design and idea. CGI wasn't strong at all for the beasts. The comedy is GREAT in this movie, almost as good as Marvel's comedy side, especially in Avengers. 7/10, go see it, good for all ages, worth the ""admit one""",Shazam!

1307,bmurphycgtx,Just Another Parody People Seem To Love,1,11 April 2019,"This movie made me want to draw a bath to contemplate my life choices before dropping a toaster in with me and yelling SHAZAM as my last words. Seriously, this movie was so bad. I don't understand how so many people are liking it. The acting was cringeworthy. The plot was stupid. There was hardly ever a score of background music like most super hero movies. The movie was set in Philadelphia rather than Fawcett City, but violated so many more things from the comics than just that. The villain was incredibly underwhelming even with the help he had from multiple extremely powerful beings. The jokes fell flat. This was such a let down after Aquaman. DC finally made a decent movie besides wonder woman then they went and did this. DC is not a comedy!!! It's supposed to be dark and serious. Stop giving us movies that make fun of the genre! This felt more like a parody than a super hero movie. How do people like this trash??",Shazam!
1308,starlord-84597,"Amazing movie, with a strong message!",9,4 April 2019,"Shazam! is a great example of what a superhero movie should be. Entertaining, accurate, fun and a bearer of a great message.Hats off to Zachary Levi, it's like he was born to play the role, perfectly balancing that immature attitude with wisdom of Solomon. The movie has some darker moments, more than enough to intrigue a watcher, but not so much that they cloud sunny and happy appearance of the titular hero. You won't see many amazing shots like you've seen in Aquaman for example, but they weren't that much needed to be honest. And one thing they should have done better is the last scene, where they missed the chance to tightly connect the DC cinematic universe together.",Shazam!
1309,yogi_martins,One bad actor ruins it a bit,7,19 December 2020,"Good story, good actors apart from adult Shazam (Zachary Levi). His job was to play 14 year old Billy in an adult body. But he is not at all like Billy (Asher Angel), not the way he talks nor body language. The actor basically just said ""no I won't imitate that kid, I just do my thing"".",Shazam!
1310,keithleyland,Childish,3,4 January 2020,Why is this film a 12a? Even one reviewer said his 8 year old loved it!! This film should have been rated a U or PG as it's nothing more than a child's family film... Very disappointing,Shazam!
1311,lahejarishabh,Shazam made my day😃,8,6 April 2019,"A fresh, light hearted take by the DCEU and yet an unexpectedly fantastic one. I had very less expectations with Shazam but I left the theater with such happiness and joy. DC fan or no DC fan, regardless, you will thoroughly enjoy this film. This isn't just any superhero movie with just a typical storyline of the protagonist gaining powers to defeat an enemy. It is more than that. It delivers life lessons from time to time, describing the life of foster kids and balances quite well between action, drama and humour. The film has genuinely well written good comedy. From the beginning of the film to the end I don't remember not smiling or not laughing. Those two expressions of joy never left my face. In every superhero movie, one anticipates to see how the story will be built around the character when he first begins to realise his super powers. In the case of Shazam, this whole phase of learning his powers is irresistibly hilarious and by far the best part of the whole film. Coming to role performances, Zachary Levi pulled off the role of Shazam impeccably. He is charismatic, exuberant, naive, a perfect teenage kid in an adult's body, born to play the role of shazam. Freddy played by Jack Dylan Grazer is simply excellent, a true friend and an epitome of superhero nerdiness. The friendship between Freddy and Billy Batson (Shazam) is just perfect, full of ups and downs nonetheless. The film even though maybe defined as just joyous, it does have a strong villian, Dr Sivana, a horrifying, intransigent and a nefarious character giving a tough fight to Shazam. Although the film could have improvements in its action and animation, there is a cornucopia of comic book references, DCEU references, good humor that will keep you buckled up to your seat and refresh your mind.

1314,samarthsehgal,Best superhero intro movie ever!,9,5 April 2019,"Say it! Just say it! SHAZAM!!!! Wow! DC has really learned how to create an electrifying movie! From Sandberg's direction, to Mark's (Sivana), Asher's (Younger Shazam) and Zachary's (Shazam) acting, to some surprise role by Ross Butler, everything moulded out to be just perfect. The comic elements were top notch and you can find yourself laughing in the most serious situations. Bring an introductory movie, this was surely not a nail biting one, but I'd be happy to call it a supercomic. I have not really read the comics, but as an amateur viewer, I think this is the best version of an introductory superhero movie that can be created (yes I mean it!). So open your apps and book your tickets for the movie, i don't think you will like to miss it. Rating it 4.5/5, not 5 because I felt the story could still have been trimmed a little bit and could have more links with other superheroes. Still, a must watch!",Shazam!
1315,gofalcons-81940,SHAZAM!!!!,10,9 April 2019,I loved this movie from beginning to end!!!! I literally felt like I was actually there for the full 2 hours and 12 minutes instead of feeling like it was only an hour long. The story had a great pace and a good feeling to it. The characters who played little Billy and Adult Billy did well both emotionally and physically in different terms of how their roles were handed to them. I would definitely buy this once it hits digital for sure and watch over and over again.. When I was in the theater the atmosphere felt great we all laughed and joked about. When I walked out of the theater I said Shazam a lot in my head. And even the next day I did it too. If I could see it in theaters again I would.

I prefer Marvel but for once I think DC have made a solid movie apart from Wonder Woman.

I would definitely recommend this movie,Shazam!
1319,setsedrakyan,Yet another disappointment...?,4,7 April 2019,"After a handful of films DCEU produced left us hoping for the better our dreams and expectations were strongly tied to the latest film; ""Shazam"" it was promoted and accepted as the first step towards the righteous path of DCEU, high rating on IMDB, high rating on rotten tomatoes, everything made us believe that the film is a success and we can be relieved to find a worthy concurrent to the MCU's monumental success. Everything is just fine until you watch the film...
Motivation of both the protagonist and the antagonist are raw, primitive, premature and just childish. Of course as the main character (Billy Batson) is a 14 year-old teenager a certain childishness should have been expected, but what we got to see eventually was a complete joke, interaction between characters were unsophisticated and underdeveloped, the inner conflict of the main character is uncultivated and so was the conflict between ideologies of the characters. The concepts that were promoted through the scope of the film such as ties and bonds that can be found in places least expected and the importance of support from the loved ones were presented haphazardly and so weren't any convincing. Overall the film was a failure and we can only hope its box office isn't such as well.",Shazam!

1335,andfloy,"Great Movie, But Doesn't Fit With DC Films",7,7 April 2019,"This movie was exactly what I expected it to be: very well made and funny, but not at all the same type of movie as the other DCEU films. It was very campy and more about the story of a foster child learning the value of friendship than about a superhero. It had a few mild to moderately large plot holes but was still very well made. Very different from other recent DC movies obviously, but if you're looking for a funny movie with some action and a good message its worth seeing.",Shazam!
1336,diamondjack-48430,Very good,8,11 April 2019,2 out of 2 for the DCU as Shazam follows up Aquamans success with another entertaining yet enticing film. Zachery Levi brings humour and strength to the role and I'm sure will be a corner stone for the DCU for years to come. Viewers are left entertained throughout the film by the characters humour yet still (pardon the pun) marvel at the new superhero's powers. Subtle references to previous DC films give the film structure and cements it's place in the ever growing list of great DCU films. The mid and post credit scenes left much to be desired as it didn't really entice fans enough in my opinion more humour based rather than hyping the next set of films. Still a far way off of catching up with the MCU but this is a step in the right direction after the last two successes for the DCU,Shazam!

Because it's not a typical superhero movie, it's ""atypical"" superhero movie. The storyline is clear, the villain is reasonably bad. The story is less scientific than Marvel's movies. The fun part is not only the battle, but every part of the movie after our protagonist acquired his power. He is a very relatable person, not a perfect human like Marvel's hero, and I think that's what makes this movie so good.",Shazam!

I was very disappointed, my son spent half of it on his tablet as he found the film dragged and was barely amateur in the acting department. Also, the cgi and chemistry between characters felt as though it had been conjured up by a fan fiction creator. However, the scenes that featured the shazam family were amusing and quite quick witted, but the superman cameo not being Henry Cavill was pretty disappointing. I would not waste your time watching this film as the action was evidently cgi'd poorly and the minuscule use of onscreen physical fighting is lazy with its choreography and a quite evidently a cash grab.",Shazam!

That's one thing really nice about the movie.A villain with no real purpose. Lacks depth.
Few parts will keep you thinking that you've seen this movie here and there before. Effects are nice. The cast is really good.

It lacks so much superhero-vibes and it was very childish, which I understand since Shazam is basically a teenager but he was just acting too childish. You get a sense of ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" vibes in the movie, but at most times Billy was just fooling around which annoys me so much as it shows me how unworthy he is to possess powers. The movie may have some good laughs but overall it just wasn't a fovourite for me unfortunately.",Shazam!

However: 1) a little predictable, 2) adult Billy doesn't look or act like kid Billy at all, 3) ""Shazam"" is supposed to have, among other things the ""wisdom of Solomon"" but is still just as clueless as he is when he's a kid.A few of my favorite things about this film: 1) charming and funny, 2) use of mild swear words and adult references plus elusions to others apparent to adults but hidden from kids who can't infer them from context (comparable to MCU films), 3) Adam Brody's brief but charming appearance, 4) brief hint of classic John Williams Superman music.",Shazam!

I dont want to spend 1.5 hours watching sibling drama just to see 2 super human fights. this movie is a total let down. this was suppose to be a movie about a young teenage super hero but its not. Instead its a high school drama about two nerds that are friends that have issues when one thinks he is soooo cool after getting super power. there is almost no actual super power/ super human plot. its all teenage high school drama with about 30 min of CG. total waste of time and money,Shazam!

I was a really big DC fan and was hoping I could finally share it with my younger siblings because the trailers made it look nice like DC might be turning over a leaf from the dark stuff... And I was wrong. I was not expecting there to be demons. It would have been okay if they didn't eat people on screen like a horror movie. I mean if they just panned away or didn't show the bodies people being picked off one by one through the glass it would have been fine. I suppose the fact that David Sandberg was the director could have been a hint, but come on. The entire movie couldn't seem to decide if it was going to be dark or comical and ultimately never chooses to be either. It sort of just... is there as both, which is kind of stupid. I feel like it was a reverse Venom. It was advertised fun and ended up a horror film. Enough said.",Shazam!

1366,TheCountVictor,Something the DCEU really needed.,8,8 December 2019,"The DCEU is a franchise I really don't care about. In fact I hated most of their films up to this point. It started out strong with Man Of Steel in 2013 but after that it went on a downward spiral. Batman V. Superman: Dawn Of Justice was just a huge disappointment, Suicide Squad was ruined by the studio, with them not giving David Ayer enough time to write the script, Wonder Woman was one of the most overrated superhero films which had huge plotholes and bad CGI, and Justice League was a huge piece of garbage and was a complete mess, again because of the studio. The DCEU was so bad at that point that I completely skipped Aquaman. But now, earlier this year, DC looked to fix it's mistakes with Shazam, a film about a kid who gains superpowers from a wizard and needs to use his newfound powers to save his family and the world from evil. So how does this stack up against the rest of the DCEU? Well, I am happy to report that Shazam is a step in the right direction for the DCEU. This is a heartwarming and humorous film for a franchise that thus far has been mostly dark and edgy. The acting is quite good, Zachary Levi and Mark Strong being the highlights. The directing by David F. Sandberg (Lights Out, Annabelle: Creation) is really good, it's a step out of his comfort zone as this is a superhero comedy film but he did a great job. He even puts a little bit of his horror elements from his previous two films in the form of the Seven Deadly Sins, the sort of henchman creatures for the bad guy in this film. The cinematography is very nice especially in some fight scenes near the end. The script is very good with funny jokes, moments that tug at the heartstrings, and when necessary, does take itself seriously and doesn't feel like a clash between 3 different tones. It all works together well. The visual effects aren't the best of the whole year but it still looks good and fits the film well. Overall, Shazam is finally a good film for the DCEU after a lot of bad ones. This, along with the not canon standalone film Joker, proves DC has had a great year.",Shazam!
1367,ali_mulya,"You may want to say ""Shazam!"" after seeing thise movie",8,5 April 2019,"I live in Indonesia and saw this movie, which was released on 2 April 2019. I like this movie even just from watching the trailers. The trailers do not speak much of this movie, believe me. There are more heart-warming things in this movie.Billy Batson is introduced to us as a kid who keeps looking for his mother's whereabouts. He is then brought to a foster family which taking care 6 foster children. Billy Batson's foster family is the central of this movie. It is what makes this movie so heart-warming. One little scene so thoughtful to me is when the car of Vasquez shows the plat reading more less like this ""My super power is a foster mother. What's yours?"" Yeah, there is super power around us to be find in real life.Shazam though has the super power it does not make him a super hero instantly. As a kid, he even misuse his super power. The learning process is the interesting one.I also like Mark Strong as the villain. To me he delivers the character well.To conclude, Shazam! is all about family, not just a super hero movie. It is funny and hilarious in clever ways. The movie is so memorable even without excessive CGIs. The movie definitely delivers a good message. And I just can not wait to see its sequels. Hopefully to see Dwayne Johnson a.k.a. The Rock as Black Adam in the sequels. So to say, you may want to say ""Shazam!"" to share your goodness to your family and people around you.",Shazam!

1369,Mickytankbank,You'll probably forget you watched this,3,30 April 2020,"I am not a huge fan of live action superhero movies, but I love them in comics and animation. That said, I really wanted to like this movie. Who doesn't want to see Captain Marvel in action! Unfortunately, this movie leaves a lot to be desired. This movie follows a foster kid Billy Batson who receives powers from an old order of wizards to protect the world form ancient evil. If it already sounds generic, that is because it is incredibly so. It is a troubled hero who is searching for his mother so that he can feel complete, only to have this search complicated by this new condition.
What I thought the movie did well was how Billy initially reacts to his newfound powers. Suddenly, he has the powers to be an adult and he takes full advantage, engaging in adult activities teenage boys fantasize on. He buys beer for he and his friend, he goes to a strip club, and he excuses himself from school. It neat to see that he isn't a completely good hero because his main interests aren't to be traditional hero, but to use this power for personal gain. But this novelty quickly dissolves under the same tired formula we see in all origin stories. I for one am tired of watching training montages. It was good in Rocky and it worked in Spiderman but at this point, it just feels like padding for a movie that barely has a story. This montage isn't anything new, it is the same jokes you see in every other movie where you see Billy fail over and over until he has some small form of mastery. If you are still watching the movie at this point, it doesn't get any better.
What you get after is an uninspired forgettable villain that he must defeat. And he is forgettable. When he shows up for the big fight, I had honestly forgotten he was part of the movie because there is nothing interesting. You get a bit of backstory, but not enough to set him aside as this menace. There is no pressure for him to become stronger like there is in other movies of the genre because the villain is mostly absent from the movie, save for the times he is sprinkled in to remind the audience. Early on you get the feeling that there aren't any real consequences, even though people do die in this movie it doesn't matter because you can probably guess that Captain Marvel will win through the power of friendship. It literally tells you minutes into the movie, and as generic as this movie is, you should not be surprised. It is apparent that this movie was just a cheap attempt to cash in on the super hero craze and it is a shame because I have seen DC movies where they are able to tell a compelling story without reverting to the same old tropes.
Because there is no story, this movie lacks the character development to make even Captain marvel forgettable. The movie will flat out tell you important character traits, it's an incredibly lazy way to fake a story. For example, there is a scene after the training montage where Billy sneaks back into the foster home his foster parents are disappointed that he ran away after the first night. He conveniently walks in at the end of this conversation and somehow understands the trouble he is causing. This is shown through a zoom cut to a remorseful Billy. There are no scenes where they spend time together, breaking down the metaphoric walls he's built to protect his heart. There are no heart-warming scenes that suggest that maybe this collection of misfits could be his family. Instead you get a kid playing with his superpowers for a day and the movie telling you that Billy is experience character growth because it is written in the script. I wouldn't have an issue with this if the movie hadn't put so much emphasis on it's importance. In the end when things seem the darkest, it is the love for his newfound family that gives him the power to persevere. See, it's the same thing you've seen over and over again but not very well done.
I wouldn't pay for this movie. If you were unfortunate to pay for it, I am sorry you got ripped off. I wouldn't even recommend this film if it were free because there is nothing really worth watching. It is a shame because I do prefer the DC universe, but it seems that they aren't able to get their formula correct. Oh well, skip it.",Shazam!

More importantly, it's so hard to find a movie that my two daughters will both sit through. My 11 year old is past most of the animated kids movies and my younger one doesn't sit through much if it's a cartoon or a Disney type product. This one hit the sweet spot. It was a light-hearted superhero movie with kids starring. I wouldn't really recommend it for adults, though. And that's the strange thing, I view it a movie for kids and tweens, yet there's more than a few cases of bad language. In this sense, the movie has a bit of an identity crisis.",Shazam!

Disappointed that DC is now just ripping off Marvel's style with the after-credits inserts and using the same humor, but in a more calculated and less natural manner. This is a complete take-off on Deadpool just as Aqua-dude was a Thor copy. Even the closing credits animation was reminiscent of Deadpool. Yikes! All that said, I actually enjoyed it as a lesser version of those movies. Originality isn't everything, right?",Shazam!
1375,MovieSeven,Nice to meet you Jack Dylan Grazer,8,6 April 2019,"I recommend this fun popcorn-flick. Jack Dylan Grazer really impressed me as the slightly neurotic, funny walking - (non stop) talking encyclopedia on super heroes! What an excellent friend to have when you suddenly turn into a super-hero, except for the neurotic part. The other kids are also fun and some are adorable.As with so many action movies, the end is a drag but really fun leading up to it, but I guess it's not boring for the young people.The special FX in this movie are flawless to me, as with most modern blockbusters.",Shazam!
1376,Coizado,"I'm not sad I watched it, I'm sad it could have been so much better!",5,23 July 2019,"The movie is well made, from the acting to the CGI.I think the main problem was the script. I did not feel any connection to the characters, to the point I caught myself thinking, ""Hmm, if the villain wins, who could defeat him with so much power, not superman he's weak to magic..."".It's not a good sign when you are not rooting for the hero, but merely, matter-of-factly, waiting to see who's gonna win, not really caring either way.The final showdown felt blown out of proportion for an inexperienced, unprepared hero, it's like, (if you watch Shazam you'll understand the reference), if NEO from The Matrix went straight to fight over-powered Agent Smith from The Matrix Revolutions.In the end, it tried to be light-hearted and jovial as Spider-man while being a little funny like Deadpool, and missed both targets.So sad for the potential wasted, it could have given the magic aspect just a little backstory so we wouldn't have been completely lost, develop the kids friendship a little more, maybe one or two bonding experiences, while having the final showdown with a little less world-ending stakes.",Shazam!

1378,originaLee,"This is not Capt Marvel, this is a Tom Hanks coverband",2,5 April 2019,"As a life long fan of the original Captain Marvel, I was very disappointed in this movie. Instead of basing it on the golden age Fawcett comics, and the epic contemporary material by artist Alex Ross, it was based on Geoff Johns' misfire reboot. The end result is part ""Big"" and part ""Superhero Movie"" with a dose of ""ABC Afterschool Special"". David Sandberg's direction is schizophrenic with a very pedestrian tone and very bad CGI. Zachary Levi is spastic, guilty of over acting, and incapable of handling the few serious scenes. Mark Strong is miscast as Dr. Sivana, giving a dull performance to a character that is watered down into a generic magic based bad guy. The only bright spots are Asher Angel and Jack Dylan Grazer, who both give great performances with the material they are given.

Top 2 DCEU Movie!",7,5 April 2019,"Now it's not hard to be better than Batman v Superman, Justice League or Aquaman, but when a system / creative process continues to put out bad products, it can be hard to break out of that mold. Luckily for DC and fans, Shazam! is able to break the mold. Unlike most DC films of late, Shazam! is not a film that takes itself too seriously. The movie is able to capitalize on its young stars to inject much needed humor and perspective to DC's film franchise.While the movie can seem surface level at times, and even cheesy, Billy Batson's adoptive family, as the centerpiece of the emotional world of the film provides a sense of innocence and discovery that you don't really get often. While the movie is perfect, it is able to be funny, fun and entertaining from start to finish. Ultimately I compare this movie to Ant-Man of the MCU: The movie won't win any awards, and it wont be in anyone's top 5. But you will watch it when its on and you will enjoy yourself. For the MCU that might be underachieving. For DC... It's a real home run.",Shazam!

I didn't mean this movie is unwatchable or I got relieved when the movie ended. But the end credit is really a masterpiece. The way they have mixed comedy with the inner psychology of a teenage boy, it's just fabulous. Kudos for that. I wish the entire movie was as good as that. It's not a bad movie, but it's not good either. It's just very very campy. Not as campy as Schumakhar's 'Batman and Robin', but definitely Raimi's 'Spiderman' level campy. In fact, deep down it is basically the same movie as Raimi's Spiderman (2002). Don't believe me? Here we go. This is a story about a high school student who gains some super power. Initially he gets distracted and tries to misuse the power in earning money, but soon realizes 'With great power comes great responsibility' which changes his mind. Almost at the same time a Middle-Aged brilliant scientist becomes successful in his research/ experiment and as a result gains some super power, but that costs his mental stability. At first he kills some influential board members of his family company (which is named after his surname). Then his 'inner demon' tells him about the hero. So he confronts the hero in order to take him by his side and fails. But in course he discovers hero's true identity. As an act of desperation he breaks into hero's house to attack the hero personally. Then he kidnaps and threatens to kill someone who is hero's life and as a result they have the final battle- End of movie. It's really sad that they are trying to sell the same plot even after 17 years. That too could be acceptable had they tried to serve it in a better way, but they didn't. As a result often you will get bored through the over 2 hours movie time. Billy's life, his psychology pre and post transformation has been given too much time and as a result they couldn't give proper arc to other characters. Even the villain character (Dr. Sivanna) is very much underdeveloped. I am not buying in the story that the villain had an abusive family from only one scene. They should have given more importance and exposure to this area instead of just showing him pure evil one-dimensional. That would have been given him a more human touch and would have been more interesting. And the great 'Shazam' the sorcerer supreme played by Djimon Honsou is probably the weakest link in this movie. They have created this character so carelessly that he has become a laughing stock. For example, he first invites a 10 year old boy at his cave, and then rejects him by saying that the boy's heart was not pure since that boy got attracted to a glittering ball. C'mon man! He is just a kid! If you reject him because he was attracted by a glittering ball, then it's you whose heart is not pure. Also if you think that the boy was not pure enough, then why inviting him on a first place? Also it has been shown that the sorcerer had been searching for centuries for a worthy person to take his power. While searching he rejects countless of people including Dr. Sivanna (when he was a kid) in 1974. Finally he gets his 'worthy' successor in a random foster child name Billy Batson in 2019. My question is, is there so much scarcity of a good person that a sorcerer had to wait for centuries to find one? Even if we exclude that 'centuries' part and consider only the timeline mentioned in this movie (i.e., 1974-2019), then let me tell you 51 individual persons and 12 organizations have won Nobel Peace prize in between 1974 and 2019. I am not even considering other countless of social workers who have been selflessly working and don't get recognized or don't win a prestigious prize like Nobel Peace Prize. Really, is there such a scarcity of good people? The reason why Billy got invited, I don't think his act was heroic enough to be invited to get a supreme power comparable to Superman's. In fact, his activities after getting the power doesn't justify his 'worthiness' which this movie tried to establish. Now it may sound nitpicking, but paying attention to such details actually makes a movie great like Dark Knight. Acting wise, Zachary Levy as the superhero Shazam (adult Billy Batson) is great. But the director failed to synchronize the acting of the young and adult Billy. As a result, young Billy is grumpy and adult Billy is light hearted- this should have been taken care of. Jack Dylan Grazer is superb as Billy's best buddy Freddy Freeman. A powerful actor like Djimon Honsou is wasted as Shazam the sorcerer supreme. Mark Strong as Dr. Sivanna is as usual good, but looks like he is being typecasted now a days. Others are okay. Ohh, also another cliché- an 8 year old kid can hack into a police server. Fighting choreography is average. Many superhero movies have shown better actions. Even though they had introduced a big and pleasant plot twist in the final act, that is wasted because of unimpressive choreography. Cinematography and CGI are average to good, but they should have been more careful in designing those seven deadly sins and would have given some characterization. They just look like seven scary demons that's all, you cannot say who's Anger and who's Lust. I didn't like any of the costumes, especially the hero's costume looks like a cheap cosplay- they should have opted for another option instead of a body hugging spandex type suit. There are some moments of genuine humor and sometimes it appeared forced. For example, a Santa character was shown three times to inject some forced humor- that was not needed. Some plot holes were also there, but they can be ignored. So that's all I had to say. The verdict, it's one time watchable, but not as good as some are saying. I can give it 6/10.",Shazam!

Think, Tom Hanks' ""Big"" meets Superman (1978).
I remember liking Shazam as a kid in the 80's (it took me a long time to call him Capt Marvel) but not much else I remember.
So I watched the 1940's serial & was impressed, so I watched the 1970's tv show and although cheesy was entertaining, so I moved onto the 1980's filmation series and fell in love with that.
This renaissance I had with Shazam only happened 5 months ago too!
Shazam! (2019) has all that 40's/70's/80's elements mixed together.
The bad guys look awesome, the movie has lots of laughs and tons of heart.
One bad thing: there is 1 short scene (parent scene) that gets too dark - it made me feel uncomfortable...it kinda pulled me out of the movie but thank god it's a short scene cuz this is one of my favorite comic book movies ever.

But the film industry are beholden to intense, ultra-fast, extreme, loud, dark violence. It swamped the 2nd half and was totally at odds with the nature of the first half.That web sites reviewing this barely mention the violence presumably indicates a kind of conditioning. Gratuitous violence that adds nothing to the story is simply expected. How many times must good throw evil around or vice versa?

It was enjoyable and not as goofy as some of the previews made it seem.My only real issue with Shazam is the fact that he seems more powerful than Superman. I suppose the fact that he's a teenager will keep him mentally inferior to the other members of the Justice League.All in all though, if you were on the fence about seeing this film, I suggest giving it a shot. Hopefully you find it as fun and interesting as I did.",Shazam!

The way these extreme ends are handled in Shazam are worth praising.
Billy Baston, Shazam and Freddy are the life of #Shazam.
A 14 year old becomes a superhero, who don't even understand his superpowers. Can anything get more funnier than this??? 😂. This film has a chidish feel attached to it, but in a positive way.
Shazam is as hilarious as any Marvel movie and as dope as Deadpool (without crossing any limits).
But again, it will largely depend on your taste.
Congratulations to DC for continuing the momentum (even with a not so popular character).
And its much much better than #CaptainMarvel.
And in case you didn't know, Shazam was actually known as Captain Marvel much before Marvel decided to reserve that name.

I love the fact that zachary levi has been cast for the role as he brings so much to the comedy throughout the film. in fact, i've originaly intended to rate Shazam! 7/10 as a superhero movie, but i've ended up giving it 8/10 as a family/comedy movie because of how much i liked zachary levi.nicely done!",Shazam!
1399,kenubu,Why The Hype???,6,21 May 2019,"Honestly I left the cinema feeling like I've been robbed of my money and time spent watching this. Everybody were praising Zachery Levi for his portrayal of Shazam, but to be fair I've never found him to be a good actor or funny (refer to the TV series Chuck). Like some people have pointed out, Billy and Shazam in this movie don't behave alike. Zachery is playing Chuck again, and the boy acting as Billy seems to be a good actor, because he does make you feel the loneliness, insecurity, and the sense of wanting to be a part of this makeshift family, but also really unsure of how to let them in, because he is afraid that if he does, he would have accepted the fact that his mother really abandoned him.Zachery Levi...Oh my!! You wanna know how shazam should act like, check out the DC animation, Return of the black Adam. He acts like a teenager, but even if he is a teenager, which means he is unsure of himself, temperamental, but his got an idea of how a super hero should behave, through observing and admiring Superman. When Zachery Levi tried, emphasis on the tried to make an angry super hero look (which tends to look cool and scary too..'Henry Cavill', he honestly looked like a guy constipating on the toilet. He doesn't exhume that super hero presence, and doesn't look at all intimidating. Because Shazam is intimidating, Superman Level Power , Strength, and the physics to go with it, but that Body suite on Zachery Levi, doesn't help him look the part, it actually makes him look stupid.All said, If your a kid, I guess you'll like this movie. They should have asked Jack Black to give Levi acting tips on how to behave like a teen.",Shazam!

I'd recommend this to every single comic book fan and even to non comic book fans for a great time. The CGI complaints in my opinion were unnecessary they were perfectly fine. Dr. Sivana not being a memorable villain is also false in my opinion. The story was perfect and Darla is just amazingly cute. The family aspect of the movie was also really good and shows us just how caring and loving a foster home can be despite various negative stereotypical depictions over the years.,Shazam!

1403,abdelrahmanashraf41,"""Say my name so my powers may flow through you""",8,7 April 2019,"Shazam! was very fun and entertaining. The cast is perfect. Casting Zachary Levi for the role of Shazam was a win for DC, you feel his energy and enthusiasm throughout the movie as if he's a kid trapped in a superhero's body. Asher Angel who plays Billy Batson is also very good and you almost feel as if he and Zachary Levi are the same person during the movie. The supporting cast was very good too, specially Jack Dylan Grazer the actor who plays Freddy Freeman, he was very funny throughout the movie and the chemistry between him and Zachary Levi was so good as almost every scene with both of them in it was very funny and well executed. Mark Strong did a very good job as Dr. Sivana, his acting was very good for the script he was given and the tone of his character. Speaking of the tone, it started off dark while explaining Dr. Sivana's origin story, but as the movie progressed towards Billy Batson's origin story, the tone began to be lighter and more fitting for almost the rest of the movie, Specially after Billy gets his powers and you watch him go through a lot while figuring out how to use his powers with the help of his ""Superhero Nerd"" friend Freddy Freeman and you see him doing what any of us would do if we get superpowers for the first time. The story itself revolves around family and how Billy Batson gets used to being with a new foster family and learns throughout the movie how important family is even if he learns that the hard way, so it's basically a superhero movie with a good family story at it's center. The movie is filled with easter eggs and hints at other DC characters, but the overall usage of some elements made it a little bit annoying, like you see Freddy Freeman wearing shirts with DC characters logos on them like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman and Aquaman and it was overused and i think they are trying so hard to connect this movie to the DCEU when there is no apparent connection, Yes this movie is set in the same universe and there are elements that show that like there are references throughout the movie about Batman and Superman and Freddy Freeman having a replica of the Batarang that is used by Batman in Previous DCEU films, other than that there are no references to other events that happened in previous movies and you understand that they are trying to take a different approach to their movies, but you don't do that while you're still attached to the past films. The visual effects were good throughout the movie keeping their consistency for the most part. The Third act was amazing as it holds an awesome surprise for the fans and it was well executed making you feel engaged through it all till the movie ends. The movie has two extra scenes, one in the mid-credits and the other one after the end-credits, now the mid-credits scene is good as it teases a possible sequel plot while the end-credits scene was time wasting having to stay through for the whole credits to end just to watch a scene that i think was supposed to be a scene in the film but was moved to the end for no reason. Overall the movie was very entertaining to watch and i recommend people to go see it.",Shazam!

1411,jrklumb,Zachary Levi is Shazam!,8,21 April 2019,"Shazam was a breath of fresh air for all of the superhero movies that are being released so rapidly in Hollywood. David Sandberg did an excellent job directing this movie with such a small budget for a pretty powerful DC superhero. The acting for the most part was pretty good, especially Zachary Levi as Shazam and Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy Freeman. Asher Angel did a fine job as Billy Batson, but he was definitely not the best part of the movie. Mark Strong as Dr. Sivana also did a fine job, but as a villain his character was pretty basic and was nothing special.The first part of the movie was pretty slow, but once the second part of the movie hits... it's really good. It was a lot of fun to watch Billy Batson discover all of the special powers he has with Freddy Freeman. Zachary Levi did an excellent job portraying a kid discovering his powers for the first time and Jack Dylan Grazer did a great job accompanying him during these moments. The third act was also pretty fun to watch as well, but the action scenes just were not that good. Could this be because of the smaller budget? Of course. But I still feel like the scenes at the end could have been executed a little bit better.Overall, I thought this movie was a great family movie and I can't wait to watch this movie again at the theater with friends.",Shazam!

I'm really sad that this movie was marketed towards children in a lighthearted way because there is nothing lighthearted about this movie.

There is one specific slow motion scene which is very bad. There is a surprise in the end of the movie which I didn't expect because of the lack of my knowledge about character's root in the comics. It surprised me and like it. In the final fight, some of the character's costumes (mostly men) are looked like they are in Power Rangers movie and I expect they are becoming MegaShazam.

1424,dinithagunathilake,"Earnest, Joyful and Inspiring.",8,28 March 2019,"Earnest, joyful and inspiring. DC's latest offering, Shazam! tells a classic superhero story of Earth's Mightiest Mortal buoyed by stars Zachary Levi & Jack Dylan Grazer's charismatic performances and a story filled with heart and heroism to the core.Shazam! follows 14-year-old Billy Batson learning to become the successor of the wizard Shazam. All the while struggling to find his place in the world and most importantly, finding his family.
Director David F. Sandberg takes the viewer on a nostalgic ride that harkens back to Richard Donner Superman, The Goonies, other Amblin classics and of course, Big. Thanks to a strong script and effortlessly well-timed humor, the film breezes it's the way through a solid first act and introduces us to an array of fully realized characters with real emotion. Its second act could've used a bit more breathing room before going head on to an incredible third and final act. Thanks to real stakes and excellent direction, Shazam! survives the third act crisis that most superhero movies face. And due to proper setup, the emotions skyrockets and the moments feel legitimately earned.
The costume design is a love letter to the golden age of comics, the score is a love letter to John Williams, the horror inspired sequences and the sense of wonder and adventure is a love letter to the Amblin era, the story is a love letter to children of all ages. And it does all this while being its own, standalone movie that will surely be a classic in the future.All in all, Shazam! is a breath of fresh air in a genre that is filled with generic, ready-made products. After witnessing heroes being pitted against each other, against big alien armies and against the very notion of being a hero, Zachary Levi shines brightly an earnest representation of a superhero that is both inspiring and empowering in all the right ways.
It is the return of one of the most underrated, and one of the most beloved characters in comic book history. It is time for the Earths Mightiest Mortal, the original Captain Marvel to return to his rightful place.
I left Shazam! feeling like a million bucks.
4/5 - Great",Shazam!
1425,lilalexwaybe,Awesome DCEU installment,8,5 April 2019,"Shazam!!!!!! review
Spoiler free.I didn't even think another human being could top ZACK SNYDER's visuals and vision in DCEU. Well, I wasn't wrong about that one.Just say the word! But the word isn't ""Shazam"". No, no the word is ""Fun"", a word that might scare some of you when it comes to comic book movies. Sometimes ""Fun"" in superhero movies means its campy or trying too hard. So I understand if anyone had these concerns when watching Shazam trailers. But let me tell you, this is probably one of the most heartfelt and fun super hero movies I've seen in years. Honestly it felt like a coming of age, edgy comedy for kids and adults about superheroes. And that's honestly it's most endearing quality. Let's break it down:THE GOOD:
-The Cast: Levi steals the show and oozes charm. He owns the Shazam role and honestly
Makes the movie for me. He's hilarious and portrays Shazam with a legit child like wonder that just jumps off the screen. The supporting cast is wonderful too. Jack Dylan Grazer was freaking fantastic as Freddy. Shazam and Freddy literally own this whole movie. But the rest of the cast was great too. (I have a soft spot for Darla in Geoff Johns New 52 Shazam story and boy did that little girl bring her to life in this movie)-The Balance: This Movie started off WAYYYYYY darker than I thought, and often juggles being serious and light hearted, both seamlessly and often. The movie is mostly light hearted and funny, but doesn't shy away from more intense moments or even sad ones. This really helps you connect with the characters and the story. It's not one 2 hour long wakka wakka wakka fest.-But Dammit it's funny: this movie isn't afraid to be funny, Meta, and self aware all at the same time. The humor felt 100 percent natural and organic.-It's original and familiar at the same time: The feel good, funny and lighthearted nature is literally a breath of fresh air and the concept of the movie feels new, but the movies DNA is classic superhero movie.-The Story: The story, narrative, and characterizations were top notch for a comic book movie. They nailed adapting Geoff Johns Shazam origin storyTHE BAD:
-It's more story oriented than action oriented. And it's not your typical superhero movie. While the latter is good, the lack of action made the movie drag here and there. I felt
Like they could have done a lot more with this movie than what they did.-The Effects: The special FX were mostly great... mostly. Sometimes it looks a bit underdeveloped. You could really tell this was a lower budget DC Movie at times.-The Villain: he's not bad, but a bit generic. Mark Strong tried his best with the material he's given.FINAL VERDICT: Shazam is a one of a kid superhero movie that does a great job blending a coming of age teenage comedy with a legitimate Superhero movie and making it work on every level. This strong comic book adaptation is elevated to the next level by a fantastic performance from both Levi and Grazer that has you smiling anytime they are on the screen. This is a superhero adaption made right thanks to a brilliant execution and tone, and while doesn't break the mold in regards to superhero movies, it's an unforgettable fun time.8.0 out of 10.",Shazam!
1426,summerking-62855,Pretty intense and may not be suitable for kids.,5,20 April 2019,"I think this would be a fun movie IF you weren't worried about having your kids there during the intense (frightening) scenes. We took a range of kids (10-6 years) thinking this was more for kids and ended up having some pretty freaked out littles (I ended up taking my 8 yr. old out for most of it).We realize it was rated PG-13, and would have chose a different movie had this been marketed as not quite so family friendly (which is why I gave it a lower rating). The kids we took have seen all the Marvel and LOTR movies and are not total scaredy cats, but this was intense for a few of them.Just be warned that this movie contains a few intense scenes that might be frightening towards some kids. Other then that everyone else really enjoyed it and I can't wait to go back so I can actually see it.",Shazam!

Why do you have to stick to same old super hero, super villain without any substantial screenplay or story. Where is the story here? So a brat gets choosen by the wizard who in turn waited for so many years only in the end to choose the most unlikely unworthy kid. And what about the villian? Just because his dad told he is not good he turns into a horrifying villian.If that is the eligibility to become bad then whole country is full of them. And of course the old man could have died because of you, you ignorant kid.
On the other side, an annoying handicapped helping his foster brother who in turn is a real jerk. Please stop making movies unless you come up with some good stories. Only console will be the foster parents and even in that the dad is kinda irritating.

-Billy BatsonThe DC Universe once again makes a great superhero film and I'm speaking about, Shazam. This movie is very entertaining from beginning to end and can be relatable to some teens when it comes to situations about figuring out about yourself and belonging to a good family, especially when it comes to foster families. Even though I wasn't overly keen on the costume because you can tell its padded, Zachary Levi was made for this Superhero. There was one part during a battle scene that really made me laugh, because of how they portray it in other hero films and made it realistic. You will laugh a lot throughout this movie for its humor and sarcasm.
Go watch it! You'll enjoy it or hate it, that's up to you.
Make sure you stay for two credit scenes after the movie!I wonder what will happen if I had that power all this time and I could walk after I said, ""SHAZAM!""... nothing happens.

1433,alexlunaros-27515,Should have trusted my initial impression,1,5 April 2019,"I should have gone with my first instinct after seeing the trailers. The trailers made it look like a throw away that the studio had no confidence in. The actor was poorly cast, the muscle suit looked like something out of an SNL skit, and the effects looked like they belonged on one of the CW Arrow-verse shows.
The preliminary reviews and RT critic scores gave me hope that maybe it was a sleeper-hit, so I actually allowed myself to get excited.
We went on Thursday opening night, which was super easy because the theater wasn't even 1/3 of the way full.
By the middle of the movie, I could already tell that all my original fears were actually true, and beyond that, the ""villain"" was insanely throw away and forgettable.",Shazam!
1434,alexlunaros-27515,Low Budget Easily Forgotten Garbage,1,5 April 2019,"I wasted money seeing this garbage on opening night, and all I can do is laugh, because this movie literally did EVERYTHING that DC Fanboys criticize the MCU films for doing, including using the ""marvel formula"" that they all claim to hate.We should have known when they decided to drop The Rock as Black Adam that the studio clearly didn't want to give this movie enough money to be done well, and in the end, it shows in the quality of movie we got. The effects for the movie look lower quality than what Prime has for The Tick (which is saying alot).The move was so awful, that the second it ended, I flew out of that theater without even bothering to stay to see if there was a post-credit scene, and I got immediately into the line of people who were demanding their money back. Luckily, the theater was understanding of how awful the movie was, because they didn't argue with any of us and just refunded our money.",Shazam!
1435,dipeshbasnet,I don't review movies but this has to be done.,5,28 March 2021,As a both MCU and DC fan i have loving connection with all the superhero movies but Shazam really got me thinking about loving or hating. The story is kind of good but as other superhero films this had some seriously boring part one 2nd quarter. Acting is amazing but too much cringy parts. The last part were kind of a nice but nothing impressive. Protagonist kept running and antagonist kept chasing like it has no that kind of feelings as if in another films. Hope the sequel will be more serious and sensitive rather than Shazam acting blizzare and shocked. He should now realize about his power.,Shazam!

1444,eap-45189,Blew my expectations away,8,21 April 2019,"I went into Shazam! with my expectations below zero. What I saw in the trailers seemed stupid and childish and I didn't trust any of the good reviews. Alas, I went to the theater to see it anyway, because what am I if not a movie fanatic? As a Marvel superfan, I wanted to check out the competition. After all, I sat through Man of Steel, Justice League, and Aquaman in theaters and I also watched Batman v Superman and Wonder Woman and was thoroughly unimpressed by all of them. My average rating for DCEU movies is a 5.5. However, once in the theater, I was actually smiling. I've never smiled in a DCEU movie before. This movie was really good. It wasn't without it's flaws, as the two actors portraying Billy Batson were great separately, but didn't really feel like the same person. I also deducted points for the flossing, but that's my own personal bias against any and all Fortnite dances. However, it was canceled out by Queen's Don't Stop Me Now. The villain wasn't bland CGI like the previous ones and while his motivation was a bit boring and generic, he still did a decent job of being a bad guy. There was a rich supporting cast, unlike Aquaman; there was a solid third act, unlike Wonder Woman; no forced romance (a welcome change); actual dialogue, unlike Man of Steel; and definitely wasn't the absolute mess that Batman v Superman was. The whole Shazam family thing put me off for a second but overall was kind of cool. It was a legitimately funny movie and I actually liked the jokes. It wasn't stupid and to be completely honest, I would have been the exact same way had I become a superhero suddenly. The movie wasn't so dark that I couldn't see anything, and the cinematography was decent enough. I also loved the Superman cameo at the end, especially because they played the original John Williams theme, and that is ALWAYS a plus. Don't judge this movie too much before seeing it. I did that and I was completely wrong. Go see Shazam! and see DC take an actual step in the right direction.",Shazam!

It would be an understatement to say I was disappointed, the movie was really boring and lame, the backstories of the characters developed really slowly, plot arcs were poorly written and the Dr. Sivana many comics fans could have grown to love was portrayed and developed very poorly. After 90 minutes of lameness and Shazam growing to learn his powers, we expect at least some sort of action, battles, at least something, and guess what, we don't get it. The movie was full of good humor, but it was TOO much, to a point you might think you're watching a comedy or some movie for children, it really suited its age rating, as it did indeed feel like one. On a good note though, some deep themes were brought up and explained pretty well, while Zachary Levi's acting was the only bright spot of the movie. 4/10.",Shazam!

If you don't like comic book movies OR you've reached your comic book movie saturation point, then don't review the movie. The truth is this is movie has more heart, more innocence and more genuine chemistry than anything else from DC or Marvel.You know how you can't help but rooting for the kids when you watch The Goonies or The Sandlot? Well, this group of teens has you cheering for them every step of the way. They're foster kids. They've been forced to grow up quick. But they aren't the least bit jaded. In fact they retain all their childlike wonder, hope and trust as they band together as a patchwork family. These kids are every bit the heroes of the movie as Shazam.If you like super hero movies, then you'll love Shazam. Zachary Levi was born to play Shazam, a 14 year old trapped in the body of an adult super hero. He brings all the same heart and fun and wonder to the screen as the rest of the kids. The action is amazing. The CGI is on point. The script is sharp and witty. The kids are mouthy. The bad guy is compelling. It's just fun.In short, this is a movie for anyone who ever day dreamed as a child that they had super powers as a way to escape or cope with a less than desirable reality. If this movie doesn't tug at your heart, make you legit belly-laugh and bring back childhood dreams of having super powers then you probably missed out on the fun of being a kid.",Shazam!

Shazam! , US movie
Release: April 4th 2019, april 5th in USA
Running time: 132 minutes
Genre: Sci-Fi, Action
Director: David F. Sandberg
FSK: 12
Main roles: ▪Zachary Levi / Asher Angel as Billy Batson / Shazam
▪Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy Freeman▪Mark Strong as Thaddeus Sivana
Important supporting roles: ▪ Djimon Hounsou as the ancient wizard Shazam

The movie takes place in New York and in the Rock of Eternity in 1974 and 2019.
The DC comic film ""Shazam"" is about the teenager Billy Batson, who has just joined a foster family and has to integrate there. Through an accident, he passes through a train to the Rock of Eternity, a cave.There he meets the old wizard Shazam who gives him superpowers and his life energy.Now, when he says Shazam, he transforms into an adult superhero with supernatural powers. But first he has to learn how to deal with it and tries out everything with his new foster brother, Freddy.Dr. Sivana notices him and wants to Take revenge on the chosen one because he also was as a child at the Rock of Eternity. However, he did not get these powers.
The film is very entertaining and has its own humor. Normally, DC films are rather gloomy, which was sometimes so.Angel,Levi and Grazer have a good harmony. The movie was partly a comedy but also gloomy. The funny moments perfectly adjust to the plot.The acting performance of Levi is really good, because he plays a mentally 15 year old The super powers were well used. Sometimes it was too much. The relationship with his family is very interesting because all siblings have a very different character and form a good but also a weird team. Sivana was not so good as a villain, but his superpower is very special and could be upgradeable. The CGI effects were great and deals well with the fight scenes.The opening scene had a good transition to the main plot even though the first act was too lomg The costumes were very colorful and well designed.
The mid-credit scene made me want a second part, and the post-credit scene was a good gag.Sandberg was the director of Annabelle: Creation and Get Out and I was surprised that he is so versatile in different Genres.The music has well underlined the key moments.If you love to meet a new kind of superhero movies which tell a story of their own you should watch the movie.Furthermore, the film combines the genres of comedy, action, horror and sci-fi which is very rare so far. Yes, there are also creepy elements that keep the movie exciting. With the main character (played by Asher Angel and Zachary Levi)maybe many teens from around 13-16 can identify themselves, because this superhero is also in this generation. To see this movie you needn't watch the other DCEU movies before.Rating:
▪ CGI: 9/10
▪Music: 9/10
▪Heroes: 10/10
▪Supporting Roles: 7.5 / 10
▪Villains: 6.5 / 10
▪Costumes: 9.5 / 10

It does so well in capturing the childhood wonder involving these caped heroes from an actual kid's point of view (well, early teen).DC took a risk by choosing to adapt a hero that many people, including myself, knew little about. And it shows when comparing the total gross of Shazam to other DC properties such as the recent Aquaman, yikes.

But Shazam introduce the 14 years old Billy, a lot of troubled kid who spends more time looking for the mother who abandoned him than trying to acclimate to any of the foster families he's been placed with. That all changes when he's placed with the Vasquez's, meets superhero buff Freddy Freeman and is turned into a superhero himself. After get great powers from the Wizard Shazam and becoming the hero Shazam, Billy needs Freddy's help to figure out what abilities he possesses. It's a fairly typical origin story as far as superhero movies go, though Shazam has a new twist because we get to experience it through the eyes of two kids who are more full of wonder and excitement than responsibility.

I liked the jokes, mom issues, geek stepbrother, and especially the last 20 minutes, I just did not like Billy because he was so cold whereas Shazam was absolutely funny.

Shazam the hero knows he is a 15 year old and cannot deduce deep and complex like other superheroes. But his antagonist(brilliantly played) is not simple and is prepared to finish him. So what does Shazam do? He plays along his strengths and keep learning them as the movie progresses
At the same time, even when in grave fights and tense situations, he has kept the energy and the humour going.
I have not read much of him, except Justice league comic books and Injustice(where he showed spine and died), but this is one origin story which we all need once in a while.
The movie clearly knows it's boundaries. The problem is complex and solutions simple, one a 15 yet old can actually think. Zachary Levi is excellent and so is all the supporting cast.
I can watch it again for the pace and the mood of the movie. I love movies which have a character arc, and one that of a 15 year old superhero , is certainly unique.I give it a 10 for raising expectations and then keeping them afloat",Shazam!
1480,darkfyer,"Fun, Good Movie, but there are flaws.",7,9 April 2019,"Shazam is great family film which is missed from the superhero genre. It's a lot of fun and will bring a smile to your face. It is not as good as a Wonder Woman or Aquaman, but way better than BvS, Suicide Squad & Justice League.The jokes are funny but they are overplayed. The story beats you over the head constantly to remind you that this is a kid transformed into a Superhero, which borders on annoying. There also times that the special affects are not at its best.With that all said, this is a win for DC because I'm very excited to see where they next with Shazam.",Shazam!
1481,john-godinez,Meh,3,20 October 2019,"It was just ok to me. Directing was awful, actors were chewing the scenery and the editing were awful. There were some funny bits and Mark Strong and Zachary Levi were good but really it was very mediocre for me. My wife couldn't event make it halfway and left. I loved the comics but this one is not worth your time, in my opinion.",Shazam!
1482,killermouse-imdb,really really not worth watching,2,29 August 2020,"I wasn't sure if it was going to be any good based on trailers, but i decided to give it a go, seeing it's dc i thought it has to at least be decent, but no, it was awful.very disappointed i wasted my money on this",Shazam!

It offers a combination of suspense, action, and comedy in a way that young and old can enjoy! The story is told from a kid's perspective, because the super hero is young teenager turned super hero. The cool thing about this movie is as he learns his super power, it is filled with comedy and action. He also learns how to trust the people around him - his new family. So, if you like a story that will uplift your spirits, then go see this movie. So, far this is by far the best movie of the year. Go see it today - will enjoy it from start to finish!!!",Shazam!
1487,NayanKumar,Sha...mazing,8,6 April 2019,"Shazam is a fun, quirky, well-done movie, that follows a similar trend to Aquaman. Whilst no masterpiece, it delivers exactly what you expect / want from a comic book movie. We get a mix of story and character development, and a little background of the characters, however I would had liked a little more. Zachary Levi does an excellent job portraying a boy in a man's body, and is very believable as a kid exploring his new-found powers. The rest of the cast come together well to support Levi / Angel (kid Billy). Visually the movie did well and much better than some of the earlier movies. The fights between Shazam vs. Sivana was well presented and it felt like this is closer to what we should have seen in Man of Steel, instead of the over the top mess that was shown.Overall, I liked the movie and it had much of what I expected - good visuals, funny gags and an enjoyable watch. It was a decent origin story, but could have had more development. To me it felt quite Marvelesque, which is no bad thing. But as Wonder Woman and Aquaman has shown, there is a stronger portfolio for DC, which I look forward to seeing develop in the future.",Shazam!
1488,kmcnulty76,So much fun.,9,5 April 2019,"I didnt walk in expecting more than a chance to watch Zachary Levi. I was pleasantly suprised to find a fun and action filled superhero flick.

1492,karansharmapoirot,What's all the hype about?,7,18 April 2019,"I'm giving it a 7 owing to the hard work put in but I didn't like it that much. The villain was a big disappointment. The CGI was laughable. Lots and lots of problems with characters. Action scenes are lame.
Especially the last action scene, instead of focusing on the main superhero they put in a lot of extra stuff that was not required at all. The reviewers here are mostly DC fanboys.",Shazam!
1493,theburt,Sha...zzz...am,5,17 May 2021,"Credit to DC for trying something fun and lighthearted. However, it's 40 mins too long, the kid playing Shazam has the screen presence of a lettuce and the adult Shazam is more juvenile than his 14 year old counterpart. It's hard to believe they're one and the same.Add to that a weak plot, lots of wasted fun ideas / creatures, an underwhelming ending and you've got a movie to watch if you want to keep the kids quiet or if you're 3 drinks in at Christmas and fancy a nap.5/10.",Shazam!

the content of this movie is something 100% guessable and there isn't any new thing which could be fresh or Exciting content at all.

Boy was I wrong! This film is so insanely entertaining, the cast are just so good and deliver every line in a perfect manner. There is a real sense of actors bouncing off of each other making it a very thrilling experience for the viewer. As the movie goes on, it reveals more and more layers to the characters, yet it manages to keep to tone light and comedic. There is a real sentiment to the whole story, homour is there, high school problems are there - what else would you want? A must see for me!",Shazam!

The superhero base line is basically how all other superhero movies go by, a hero and villian clash etc, but what makes the movie iconic is how the tone is set and how it never loses its momentum and the way the comedy blends in, and the best part is there is comic relief every few minutes, every few seconds it gives you tickles.I agree with everyone sayin",Shazam!
1517,atul-07119,A laugh riot,10,6 April 2019,"The movie is a perfect blend of comedy and drama which has a perfect tone and never loses it's momentum. The base line is the usual classic superhero villian story but what makes Shazam unique is the way they have depicted it.Hats off to the director and cast and all the other members of the crew as it is clearly visible they have given their 100%. And thank the crew of warner bros as they have learnt from the mistakes in previous DC movies and proved they have improved. A much needed improvement which opens up a bright future for the DC universe.Eagerly waiting for Dwayne Johnson's Black Adam as ones that happens I would like to see him pitched against the 6 wizards powers, it is clearly visible that out of 7 only 6 people get the powers somewhere around the climax stage of the movie which possibly hints the 7th wizard's power our with Black Adam, I am eagerly waiting for the confrontation as after watching this it is proved that is hope for future DC movies, I hope they do not prove me wrong.",Shazam!

1521,matejkaarnost,waste of great potential,5,27 May 2019,"Shameful use of the original concept. Zachary Levi is really good, however by script or by his intervention he made 14 year quite sensitive and well grown on his own foster kid into a amazing moron and useless pompous bully.
Black Adam animated or any previous incarnation is way better than even a best part of this movie. By his behaviour in movie he would not be picked up as choosen one in slightest means of the sense of choosen.
Self centered; pompous; immature; screw up off a child who steals and lie or cheats to his own advantage and goals no remourse or even slightest role model for anyone.Shameful adaptation of a great source material. 5/10 as there are some small parts which were good, the rest is pure .... waste of time. Am so glad I did not go for it to cinema; do note lose money on this....",Shazam!

the cast was great and precise Zachary Levi nailed it but why like am feeling am the only one who liked Asher more ok both were great Jack was great in Freddie rolethe villain was great glad that we have great actor like Mark Strongmovie was full with music and soundtracks you gonna love it, also i like Shazam's theme look like star warsmovie has good jokes really killed me most of the time, emotions when it came to the family their connections with each other Freddie and Billy friendship-in the end i want to say the movie was great but buttttt we don't have to get all movies like it, to be like each other am waiting to have movies with different tones which reflect the character's personality to wait BOP or Batman to be fun or something like that of course we can get light tune and dark tune together

I swear it's a GREAT movie and is so worth your time",Shazam!
1525,bhasurulakshan,DC's catching up?,9,10 April 2019,The answer is YES. They are catching up with Marvel which has a huge fanbase and a massive marketing strategies. I'm happy to say that Shazam got most things right the storyline is great. It got some comedy in it and also a family friendly movie. To be honest it's competitor Captain Marvel is a pretty bad movie it was super boring and predictable only valuble thing in there was the sneak peek at the end( I think). Overall Shazam is a really good movie a solid thumbs up from me. #peace,Shazam!
1526,buehlerfabian,Dissapointing,4,11 April 2019,"I was really looking forward to this, saw the trailers, was hoping for a Deadpool-like film with humour, sarcasm, fights, a little love/emotion and was happy with it in the first 20 minutes. But then the storyline turned out to be like having been written by a child: It took until the last 15minutes to get some action and even then the characters were still behaving too childish for such a movie. If I had these superpowers in that age, I would try them for some days and when a villain came to me I'd want to fight him and use my powers. But instead they were all just running away although they knew they were having these insane abilities.
All in all it's not only a disappointing film for people between 14 and 16, it's also annoying to see them acting and then boring to realize how predictable the storyline is. I can't recommend it if you are a fan of superheroes or want to have some fun. You could maybe take your kids to it.",Shazam!

We were able to watch an early screening through Fandango btw. I'm still referencing jokes from the movie. This is a comedy 1st and a hero movie 2nd, which works because Shazam is a goofy superhero.

Predictable at times, basic but acceptable CGI, and the sense of humor is directed towards teenagers. DC definitely tried something different with this. You won't regret watching this movie but you won't be in awe after watching this either.

Before this movie I have saw him in few superman's and justice league's cartoons.Unfortunately, movie was just average superhero movie. Slow start (I lost interest many times) and disappointed end fight. Action was lame and jokes not funny (except one where Shazam didn't heard what villain said).Speacial effects were surprisingly BAD! The sins look like there where from 90s movies.Actors were not special good in roles. I mean if they change actors in next Shazam movie, it would not even feel wrong.Shortly, Shazam was ok to watch once but also it is movie you forget fast.",Shazam!
1547,cerminarocbl,A Big Surprise! Very glad I went to see this movie.,9,1 May 2019,"Aside from a few silly things--the wizard's name (Shazam?!) the cheesy costume, Billy's sudden arrogance after a lifetime of loneliness, shame, searching and dedicated devotion to his mother, who abandoned him--this movie was surprisingly good. Cleverly written, good actors and good character development. The obvious bad guy was made truly evil, when he allowed himself to be possessed by the demonic Seven Deadly Sins. Parts of the narrative here seem a bit unfair, as evil possessed guy knows his own powers, knows that Billy is his enemy before Billy even knows who, and what, he is. The ending is brilliant (I thought) with the filling of the empty thrones. No spoilers, but good family scene, reconciliation and understanding is conveyed at the mealtime prayer. I love the family and friendship themes and messages throughout.",Shazam!

1549,enuen,Mediocre and slow rollercoaster meant for children,4,6 April 2019,"15 years ago I might've enjoyed this movie, it is not that I've seen too many superhero movies as of lately but rather because the theme of age is set too low. It was entertaining at parts and some of the jokes were genuinly funny however the non-realistic events accompanied by the lacklustre music took it away for me.I'll start with the not so realistic part, Dr sivana's father hadn't aged a single day whereas his 2 sons had grown so much 1 of them had apparently become bald. And the scene where he saves the bus from crashing down and everyone seemingly comes out unscathed- not so realistic. The seven sins felt horrifying at first but when they were put against the kids from the fosterhome I felt the urge to walk out of the theatre. I knew then and there that the sins had no chance of winning and what followed was a prolonged and unremarkable cirkusevent where the sins was potrayed as harmless.The music was generic and most of times made the action suspenseless in my honest opinion.This review is unfair if the directors and the writers intention was to solely target children in that case I give this 9~10 out of 10 otherwise it gets a 4. The acting from Zachary Levi and the smallest girl in the fosterhome (forgot her name but she was very charismatic) plus the jokes saved some stars.",Shazam!
1550,michoncarlos,DC at its best,9,15 April 2019,"This movie was way above all my expectations.Well paced, the comedy was on point...and also the villain was well portrayed.I never knew Zachary Levi (playing Billy Batson / Shazam) was this good of an actor. He portrayed very well the role of a child trapped in an adults body (he took some advantages of his body size to fool the school security, buy beers and hit a strip club).The story was very close to his comic version. I particularly enjoyed the old wizard Shazam (played by Djimou Hounsou).The villain role played by Mark Strong (Dr Sivana) was also one of the highlights of the movie. Very fun, but not forced.The rest of the cast and supporting actors also played well their parts. I would definitely recommend this movie, cant wait to see the sequel.",Shazam!
1551,woziak,Take all your Family this Easter to watch a truly wonderful Movie experience!,9,5 April 2019,"Ok so I generally don't like all cape movies and recently the genre has become increasingly stale and predictable. I really wasn't interrested in Shazam, it just looked far too silly to hold my interest but I got a free screening and went to see it.Wow, I was so surprised with how different the approach this movie took from the genre. Billy , a troublesome 14 year old boy is a runaway foster kid who is looking for his lost Mother throughout the movie but is then granted super powers by the Wizard Shazam, after abusing his powers and doing what most selfish teenage kids would do with Superpowers, he finally realises his responsibility to be the hero he was meant to be and save his new foster family from the evil Dr Sivana, brilliantly played by Mark Strong.The narrative is strong and operates on so many different levels with all the main characters getting fully developed arcs, especially the antagonist and the protagonist. The story is heart felt, humorous, dark at times with some brilliant acting by all the cast, the young girl that plays Darla is simply adorable but so too is Zachary Levy and all the other kids, especially Jack Dilian Grazier who plays Billy's new foster Brother, Freddie.The last act is a wonderful payoff to one of the better Superhero Movies and the film really does feel like it belongs in the Amblin Era or it could easily have been made by Stephen Spielberg, I didn't expect to like this movie, yet alone love it which is why I can't wait to go see it again in the cinema.Go watch Shazam, you will laugh, gasp, hide and cry in equal measures and after all isn't that what movies are suppose to make us feel? My rating 9/10 a wonderful thoroughly entertaining movie that will go down as a classic in the same way, Home Alone, Goonies and Tom Hank's Big did!",Shazam!

1553,vitorkamaral,"As some user stated in Aquaman, Shazam is a big step of DC in the right direction",8,25 May 2019,"All the mediocre acting and cliche writing of Aquaman and Wonder Woman is gone. Shazam brings us a clearly evolution of DCEU with a consistent (but not complex) writing and a right pick of actors.Now Shazam bring us a (good) childish, lighthearted superhero that every kid wants to be. It is a family, funny and distracted movie, that presents Billy Batson, a kid that is gifted with a immeasurable power.Yes, of course, still with some predictability that we see in most superhero movies today. Yes, the villain is lame. Yes, it is childish (I don't take serious who complains about the movie being silly, do you people do not watch the trailer? Spending money in this is your fault). But I'm sick of this entire DCEU negativity and I think that Shazam is leading the extended universe in a new path of glory.Anyways, most of DC plot errors and cast mistakes were fixed in Shazam, that leaves us with a really good film of its category.",Shazam!
1554,jackoflynn-75679,Best DC movie since the Dark Knight trilogy,10,28 March 2019,I thought it was hilarious. Zachary Levi played an excellent and funny 15 year old in a 30 year old body. I'm not really a huge fan of the new DC movies but this is a really good superhero movie I feel it's like a PG version of Deadpool without gore but with all the humor. I highly recommend seeing it if you want a good laugh. Also want to give credit to Jack Grazer he was also brilliant.,Shazam!
1555,jackmartinu,Flippin AMAZINg,7,25 April 2019,"Shazam is easily the funniest superhero movie ever. Zachary Levi was BORN to play this role. He just seems so much like a kid just got superpowers. Asher Angel was also pretty good. Jack Dylan Grazer was a scene stealer and Mark Strong is a natural villain. David Sandburg was a really good director and balanced action , comedy and horror. ( especially the Seven Deadly Sins in the directors board scene )",Shazam!

1557,jasur-73175,"Something fresh, but flawed nonetheless",6,28 April 2019,"I walked out the theater quite satisfied, but as some time passed I realized I was trying to convince myself it was good because that's what I wanted it to be.Now I hate to say this, but this is one overrated film. All it has been receiving is praise, and the critics seem to love it. So what didn't I like? Before I tell you my reasoning let's get into positives.This movie is something new for the DC universe. Whereas Aquaman had comedy sprinkled throughout, this one is basically a comedy all the way through. Not all of it lands (obviously) but most of it does. This movie knows what it is and doesn't take itself too seriously, which is nice because movies rarely do that. The casting choices are mostly excellent. Zachary Levy brings so much to this character. He basically carries the film. Levy has a childlike innocence about him, and perfect comedic timing. The interactions between him and Jack Dylan Grazer's character (who is also enjoyable) are just great fun to watch. It's a surprising family movie too, and the foster family element adds emotional value to the film.However, Shazam does suffer from several issues. Let's discuss the villain. Mark Strong is menacing as always, and in the first act they set his character up very nicely. I was thinking to myself that there is potential here. But in the second and mostly third acts, he falls victim to all the generic villain tropes. He becomes a power hungry foe that our hero has to overcome. The film has several tonal inconsistencies. It jumps from jokes about peeing in a suit to monsters biting people's heads off. That's just one example. The one casting choice that ruined it for me was the little girl in the foster family. Her lines were very cringy and made the movie feel very childish. My last and probably main issue with the film was the final showdown. It was so unbelievably stretched out and messy. I found myself looking at the time about 3-4 times during this sequence. About 10 minutes too long. I also wasn't a fan of how they handled the whole Shazam super family twist. It didn't make a lot of sense to me and their interactions were cheesy as hell. That final shot with Superman's (not Caville) head out of the frame felt like a deleted scene.Anyways, it's a decent but flawed addition to the DCEU. Check it out but don't expect anything great.",Shazam!
1558,rashmi-79589,Kids friendly movie,7,6 April 2019,"This movie is a time well spent with family and kids. I can safely say it's, probably one of the purest movie after ages, refreshing from the regular content and language perspective. The story and plot takes a little time to build but hang in there. The story line does not take a significant deviation nor is it overly dramatic. Worth the family time.",Shazam!
1559,danielsmith-43317,Straight out of the comics,9,13 April 2019,Shazam is a very well written and made film its basically the comic from the back of justice league #7 by Gary Frank the film is supposed to be silly and have them twists that pull on the heart strings. Theres a little nod to the Black Adam film in here as well but if you want to take kids to this there is a few swear words but overall it's a good film to watch and just switch off to,Shazam!

1571,Fortresswizard,Over hyped movie,5,1 May 2019,"I was fortunate enough to win a pair of tickets to see the premier of Shazam! To show my appreciate and to not be a downer I exaggerated my enthusiasm for the film. By no means is this a great movie. Some of the acting is terrible. For instance the father of the villain in this movie is a terrible actor and there is no insight into why the father of Dr. Sivana hates him so. The actress who played Dr. Sivana's assistant in the lab was also terrible.
One thing that bothers me most about this film is the amount of immature jokes. Just a lot of them.
I wouldn't recommend this film unless you are a huge DC/comics fan. The reason this film did so well was because of the amount of money that the producers put in to advertising.",Shazam!

It wanted to be a comedy, but veered far too often into being a standard superhero movie with the usual tediously endless fight sequences.",Shazam!
1581,Po1ntBlank,DCEU Again,7,30 March 2019,"Let's start off by saying that this review is a SPOILER review (watch movie before reading further).I will say in a brief paragraph: This film is a goofy superhero film that has a lot of fun scenes and the hero and Villain are exactly opposite but there are flaws to this good DC film as well.This is a CGI Blob Flick. The villains in this film are the seven sins of the world which look like blob monsters with demon eyes. Mark strong plays a very interesting villain that I believe is too overdeveloped compared to the protagonist Billy Batson. If they could develop Billy a bit more than they have done then the development of the villain and hero is balanced. I analyse a film's story based on if it is clear and if the writers can develop on this timeline. The story of this film revolves around a boy that is chosen to protect humans from the seven sins, clear story. Plot is how far they can develop this story. The only thing I can develop onto this story is that Billy is able to find family in anyone after a character arc in the film. The only character to have an arc in this film is Billy, the most developed character in the film is the villain and every other person is just there to fill up the story.The comedy in this film are jokes that poke fun at the super hero genre like their suits, and the credit scene consists of drawings of the wizards beating the justice league in a comedic way like strength, speed and flight. There are two end credit scenes but the last one pokes fun at Aquaman and his abilities.Overall it was a fun movie with interesting scenes about family and discovering who to trust. I guess that is the whole point of this film. Family. The CGI on this film was not the best and the villains were once again a CGI blob that fought our hero. The characters I believed weren't developed enough and the over exaggeration on the universe and the other heroes got to me in the end. I do believe the DCEU and Warner Bros. movies are getting better and more about story telling than Zack Snyder CGI but we still need to go a long way to reach a peak again like Man of Steel, then Aquaman.",Shazam!

1586,madpirate-24587,Shazam! triumphs where Spiderman : Homecoming failed,9,6 April 2019,"Believe it or not, I actually found Shazam! to be a ver Christian values film : makes a heavy emphasis on importance of family, reminds the audience to be strong against the seven deadly sins, the ""Hero's Journey"" is a about ""finding your way home"" and regaining a purpose in life, and finally, sends the message across that even if you are not 100% pure at heart, if are brave enough to stand up against evil, you can be a hero too.All in all, the family friendly humor is a breath of fresh air in the DC Expanded Universe, while at the same time managing to transmit an uplifting message. Zachary Levi does a great job portraying the human-sized-but-still-a-kid Shazam, while Mark Strong delivers a solid villain who is also not a bidimensional one, showing that, all in all, Dr. Sivana albeit power hungry is deep down a very troubled character with a complex family history.",Shazam!

1588,fduniho-38803,"The much, much better Captain Marvel movie",10,10 April 2019,"Although I have things to nitpick about this movie, it was such a good movie that I will give it a 10 anyway. I have been watching superhero movies since Christopher Reeve appeared in Superman, and even before that, I was watching Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, and Isis on TV. I have seen most of the DC and Marvel superhero movies and TV shows over the years, including the old Captain Marvel movie from 1941, and this movie is right up there with the best. Maybe it even is the best. It is the best DC Universe film, and it may just be better than any Marvel movie I've seen. Since the character in this movie is the original Captain Marvel, and since Marvel has its own movie out with its own Captain Marvel, I will mention that this movie is leagues better than the Marvel movie that bears the name this movie should have.This movie was both funny and touching. It had me laughing more than Ant-Man, and it had me crying more than Alita: Battle Angel. I adored Mary Bromfield. Even though she appeared older than Billy and so couldn't be his twin, I had to agree with the choice of actress. It was the scenes with her that I found most touching. It was never as gut-wrenching as what happened in Alita, but her scenes still got to me. I liked Freddy Freeman a lot as well. I found him very relatable. I'm not as familiar with Darla, because she was not one of the original Marvels, but I really liked her in this movie too. She is a lot funnier than the young Monica Rambeau in Marvel's Captain Marvel. The CGI was great. I really liked how it brought the Seven Deadly Sins and Mr. Mind to life.Although I loved this movie, I also came to it from the perspective of having grown up with Captain Marvel. I had a subscription to Shazam! back when C. C. Beck was still drawing it for DC, and I am more familiar with the old versions of the characters than I am with the newer ones. My first nitpick is that they couldn't use the Marvel name. So, the movie never identifies the characters as Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and the three Lieutenant Marvels. At least not using the Marvel name provided the opportunity for suggesting funnier names. My second nitpick is that Sivana was made into a completely different character. He was originally a mad scientist. While I did think that a villain who draws power from the seven deadly sins was a good idea, I would have rather they just created a new character, because the mad scientist Sivana is too good of a villain to lose. My third nitpick is that they used a different actress when Mary Bromfield became Mary Marvel. In the comics, Mary doesn't actually grow bigger or change her appearance like her brother does. Besides that, I really liked the actress who was playing Mary, and since she was older than the others, I didn't see the need for her to grow older too. The actress playing Mary Marvel looked enough alike that I didn't realize that they had changed actresses, but Mary did start to appear less attractive, and I was wondering if maybe the costume just didn't look good on her. When I checked the credits later, I found out that a different actress was playing her with super powers.",Shazam!

In shazam, me as huge fans of DC didnt know if this film will brought a shazam family too fast and once again you nail it DC.The origin of shazam is great l but for dr sivana's origin seems less information, based of shazam's chapter 52.A lot of jokes really work in this film but i was little bit disappointed with the music when billy batson as shazam tried to learn his ability, the music was to loud and ruin the funny stuff there. But thats okayLike i told before, never tought that this film will bring us shazam's family. I didnt expect that too fast but thats great from me.Hopefully zack snyder for upcoming justice leauge movies will nail it like this, i'm a huge fans of snyder and DC.

1593,kodiackironclad,"Well, I ain't getting paid for this...",9,23 August 2019,"As a comic book fan of several decades, and a parent, I have two stances on this film.
Comic fan stance. This admittedly was my first proper introduction to Shazam, and being a DC fan, I was a little irked by the cutesy nature of the film. However it's a 14 year old boy that's thrust into the lime light with super powers. I dare ANY of you to say you'd have acted any different should that have happened to you at a similar age. I certainly would have showed off at that age. And given kids that age today... yeah, so would my son. So whinging about that... yeah I'm calling you out on your bs. Given what's come before from DCEU films, this is a nice break. Simplistic, jovial, sometimes immature, but good cleanish fun. Or did ya all need more cursing or blood? If so that says more about you than anything else. Go watch saw or dead pool. Or was it just too bright? Red white and glowing yellow... oh wait that's Shazam's outfit colours off the bat... moving on.
Parental stance, this film was reminiscent of the films I watched when I was a young lad, fantastical, light and not so heavy on the... well ... heavy crap. So I would happily let my kids sit and watch this movie. On their own and as a family. Some swearing... but nothing my kids haven't heard when I'm putting up a shelf badly. Kids know curse words now. Frankly I could put up with what's in this movie. And the story isn't convoluted with twists, betrayals and over arching sub plots and interconnected nods to other story lines that are put in to satisfy YOU! Seems that's an impossibility anyways. Stop being so spoiled and just enjoy a goofy, family friendly story, with out whingeing that the spot of dust from page two book three isn't in the right place. Or it's too silly. Billy Batson is 14, and some of the family are younger still. They are hardly going to be concerned with social inequity or such Rot. They just wanna goof off. And they are super powered now with magic. Can you honestly say you would have expected any different a story than what was presented? All in all, a great movie. And one I shall enjoy again. With my family.",Shazam!

People are always waiting for cool effects, amazing fighting scenes, epic moments and stuff like that. In this movie the case is different. The script and the interpretation of the actors was so amazing that other stuff felt like secondary. Don't get me wrong, everything was good, but the script was really amazing. IM so excited to see what this Shazam can bring to the DCU and the Justice League.
Only bad thing is that the Wizard's hair looked funny 😂

Zachary Levi is the best choice for this role as he nailed it as a 15-year-old trapped in an adult's body.You are going to have a very good laugh (your stomach might hurt) on this film as the jokes are too genuine and funny.I also loved the chemistry between Freddy and Billy, as well as Freddy and Shazam! Also, the introduction of the ""family"" has got me so excited on this movie!!! I think that's the best part of it. :)It also has some bit of a horror feels on this film since the director, David, is a horror movie director.It's a movie for all ages but just to give a heads up, there are creatures in this movie that your 6-year-old son/daughter may find nightmare-ish.Overall, this movie is fun, heartwarming, cool, and the cameo is really really really great!

The performance by Zachary Levi was outstanding and really gave some believe-ability to the magic super hero man child. A few of the younger cast members suffer from... well child acting (think sorcer's stone level) but I was totally forgiving due to the overall character and cuteness of the kids. Some great stuff from DC, who have been suffering from a myriad of uncertainty of who they are and what their movies should be. For some of the quirks, (some characters seem really perceptive, who knows maybe they cut some exposition in post probably for the best, Billy gets a bit friendlier as Shazam, Sivana is a 2d bad guy but they own that ) of this film it certainly came across as if it knew what it wanted to be.

I didn't go in with high expectations at all, as I have seen previous DCEU movies that were dismal, to say the least. However, I was pleasantly surprised. The film has a fun and child-like personality, which is totally different compared to other movies in this cinematic universe. I was especially pleased at how they brought in the themes of hidden potential and masculinity (in a world where toxic masculinity is a tangible problem). I loved the initial scene of the movie, the dynamic between the foster kids and the inclusion of religious content.However, the movie took a very long time to get started - Zachary Levi was introduced about an hour into the movie. Additionally, the villain had the potential to be more threatening (something that didn't fit the underlying theme of hidden potential in this film). The only time I felt that the villain posed a real threat was when Dr. Sivana entered the conference room of his family's business and unleashed the metaphysical manifestations of the Judeo-Christian Seven Deadly Sins onto them. I predicted the 'twist' in the third act of the film at least an hour before it happened, and I'm not usually good at predicting events. Lastly, the end-credits scene was a complete let-down. We had already seen most of that clip in the trailers advertising the movie, so why include it? Also, I found the sub-plot of Billy losing his mum a bit tedious and misplaced.Despite all of this, it was much better than Captain Marvel (and I'm a hardcore Marvel fan)!",Shazam!

I thought that the fight scenes were a tad boring, but this was rescued by the humour, which was brilliant. I thought that the acting was brilliant. Shazam is a perfect superman esc hero",Shazam!
1606,jenhunter-17004,Still hoping someday DC will find the right tone,6,16 April 2019,"If you measure this film against other DCEU movies it's pretty good, but stand it on it's own and it just isn't. The biggest problem with the movie is its tone - is this movie for kids or adults? The thin plot and hokey bits don't play for adults and the strip club and demons biting off peoples heads don't play for kids. My own kids wanted to like the film but nightmares about the demons and an unwanted conversation about why Shazam wanted to go see naked ladies turned them both off. As an adult, the super simple story and ridiculously over the top antagonist were big turnoffs. I think we all want to like this film, and that we all want DC to make good movies. Unfortunately this is another miss.",Shazam!
1607,sophia-36373,*Sigh*,5,16 April 2019,"I honest to God do not understand why this movie is so highly rated. The SFX, *most* of the acting...everything was off. They were so close to making an okay movie.
Although, I absolutely loved the portrayal of the Foster family. Seeing kids of different races and backgrounds in one home was extremely refreshing. The strong family aspect was admirable, as well as having a disabled main/side character.
A friend phrased it as ""good at most. just good. nothing better.""
It was decent. Wouldn't watch it again, though.",Shazam!

1647,TheMailOnSunday,LeT's JuSt Be HoNeSt,3,31 March 2019,"I am a DC fan. I go see all the movies, then buy the blu-rays. I have character statues, posters and have read the comics including Shazam. There is a reason people become fans of certain things, and those things done well over time generate more fans until it becomes a ""Juggernaut"" like DC has. I fear that it's not unstoppable however, as the sub-par Shazam has painfully illustrated. The movie is a pastiche of poorly written scenes with a bit of uninspired action sprinkled here and there with barely any plot at all. Billy has no character development whatsoever, no adversity to overcome and no villain to fight. I know there are people saying they like this movie, but I feel like they either aren't being honest or they like it for personal reasons that are not present in the movie. Objectively speaking, in terms of the technical aspects of storytelling, Shazam just isn't effective. Subjectively, I was bored the entire time and the comedy parts made me feel as though JJ Abrams was poking me in the ribs asking me if I 'member the 40's. Yes. Yes I do. And for the record, people are criticizing this movie because it was bad, not because they ""haaaate the maaaaales!"" Dismissing legitimate criticisms using this tactic will not produce better films, which is the only thing most people want. The problem is that they built the movie around the idea of ""strong boy"" and promoted it as an identity film, so when the movie ends up being bad some people rush to defend it because they don't want the IDEA to fail. The movie itself is secondary - just a vehicle to slap their bumper stickers on, which is a real shame because this could have been a great addition to the DC universe. I hope they learn something from this, but from what I've heard it appears that DC actually plans to escalate the identity politics in the next phase which would be an absolute disaster for them. When pointing to the box office as a defense for how ""good"" Shazam was, just remember that tons of paying customers didn't like it at all.",Shazam!

It has a plot and humour that seems to be aimed at a younger audience but the viloence/scares and profanity seem aimed at an older audience.

I love superhero films, hardly slate any....I think Elektra was good for example. Yet, I just left the cinema underwhelmed with this one. Nice intro/background story and the film was above expectations at this point...but the action was just a bit lame. Nothing really happened. It was building up to a Capt Marvel type of fulfill your potential scenario without ever materialising. Most of the fighting was kinda grappling, minimal use of electricity powers n that.

1662,shortmantall,Can I say another word? Any other word?,4,10 April 2019,"So here we have the first DC movie in a long while that is better than they have been and yet still there are still bugs in the screenplay that nobody has addressed.This film is funny and really funny and human and the character largely are charming which has this going for it.Shazam also has the right colour palette for a DC movie and yet despite all this I wasn't involved in the story and I wasn't entertained as much as I should have been.Starting with the villain always pleases me but in this film the villain's story is only reduced to a handful of ineffectual scenes.I was happy to see John Glover in the opening and (only one) other scene. It was nice to see him because of his history portraying DC villains but only having him in two scenes was poor because it meant Mark Strong's character wasn't as effective as he could have been.Not to mention that Mark Strong and Zachary Levi don't meet for well over an hour which is a problem because it means the film doesn't have the necessary conflict that it should - funny, yes but not dramatically pleasing.This is because Zachary Levi doesn't appear for nearly 50 minutes.Some movies are only 80 minutes and to do this is rubbish because it doesn't leave much room to play with the hero and the villain.The film has to then do the superhero villain stuff in under and hour which is rubbish and means that everything is shoehorned in badly because there hasn't been the space to do this properly.There are some dramatic tools that are vital for any story - these are 'power of three' and 'power or status play'.These tools as far as I can see are not present and this also made the film for me bland and boring.I will add these tools were used in Batman vs Superman and Suicide Squad.So for me this film wasn't dramatic enough, despite many great gags.Having seen the cave for a couple of times undermined the surprise for when Billy Batson ventures into the cave and took that power away for me.The last things I want to say about the film which annoyed me greatly.The first thing is how predictable the film was.I knew that the climax would feature the cave somehow and it did.I knew that when Shazam is helping with the convenience store robbery that they would go for the face.I literally said in my mind - what about the face?I knew that the mother left because raising a child was too much and like John Glover only having one other scene did not do the drama any favours.There was a scene where Billy and Freddy are arguing and Freddy has just got his lunch and then for no reason, unexplained, explored or made a note of it - just bins his lunch.Surely he would have paid for it or is hungry?I understand that he wants to talk to Billy but what a rubbish, annoying piece of storytelling.Also as great as the other foster kids were - there just wasn't enough of them and here is my problem with the film - it tries to do too much too late and then too quickly.There are so many bugs in this script that needed to be edged out.I will say that people like it and it's doing well - so what do I know? But I really do want to say any other name... Shazam was disappointing, worse, it was boring.",Shazam!
1663,kwangyong_quek,SHAZAM!,8,1 April 2019,"Solomon, Hercules, Apollo, Zeus, Achilles, Mercury. A mouthful of mythical gods who have granted magical powers to one chosen as champion. A good soul, and someone with a pure heart.With that out of the way, let's focus on the movie of a superhero who bears similarities in powers with the Big ""S"" but whose origins are magical as oppose to ""non-magical"". By the way, not commonly known is that Superman is vulnerable to magic. (geek trivia)This origin story of both the bubble gum blowing hero and his arch-nemesis Dr Silvana, takes two kids with childhood trauma, abandonment/rejection along different paths. One in search of family and love, and the other on a darker path in search of power and revenge. And the eventual coming of age into their respective opposing identities.It is a fun, feel-good superhero movie for the family with dark elements to lend it a PG-13 rating. The humor is infectious and grows on you with amazing performances from the young/older hero. And while the main characters Billy/Shazam (young/old), his adopted brother and Dr. Sivana were strong in their roles, the supporting cast of Billy's adopted family were equally marvelous (pun intended), with particular mention of the adopted parents and youngest sister (Darla).Three storylines that resonate strongly with me are i) coming of age process of Billy into Shazam, ii) adopted group family dynamics, and lastly iii) the superhero/villain climax.The movie does an unexpectedly delightful job on the origin back-story, and that to me is it's biggest stand-out element and what sets it apart for a movie in the superhero genre.My favorite scene from the movie is the one of Billy leaping off the roof of a building as he shouts the magic word, S.....!Cast aside the usual expectation and judgement of superhero movies, and watch the movie taking things as they come along.

1667,flashbatmanquestion,A little known fact about the reviewers saying this movie is 'Just okay',10,28 March 2019,"They must have superhero fatigue. Why? This movie is at the very least comparable to every other. Here's what this movie has:First, a lot of really genuinely good comedy. You aren't going to laugh at dirty jokes, you aren't going to laugh at corny jokes, you're going to laugh at genuinely well written and performed comedy. In fact, probably soon to be one of the most iconic comedic moments in superhero movies to date with Shazam and his foe.Second, this movie has more than one cameo. The entire team did a great job of keeping a secret cameo (and it's not the one that people might think of at the very end).Third, this has such a great portrayal of Foster families. Very often movies have these really negative, terrible portrayals of Foster kids and the families they go into. The family that Billy gets into genuinely care about each other. It's easy to see why Billy would want to accept them. Especially after you find out some information which I will not reveal here.One common criticism is that this movie forces drama between the comedic parts and that it doesn't work well. This is only somewhat true. The drama is believable, but it's a little forced, but let me play devil's advocate. We have gotten very used to incredibly great dramas, but not every movie can have this. It's a superhero movie. In all honesty, the drama in most superhero movies always comes second. It is never really THAT captivating. This shouldn't be held up to the standard of great dramas films. Really, no superhero movie should. With that being said, I find the motivation for the villain to be persuasive. Imagine that you are a child that is being bullied. Typically if you cannot rely on your family and friends to help, you're going to probably grow up with anger in your heart. In this case, he has no friends and his family ARE the bullies. Someone criticized this, but they're completely wrong. That's a strong motivation to be someone who wants to take his anger out on others (especially family).Another thing I love about this movie is that Billy is never really just motivated to start doing good. He shows that he is willing to do good. He protects Freddy from being beat up, but only when it's gone too far. He's chosen by the Wizard not because he is some perfect, good-hearted child, but because he has the potential to be exactly that. The fact that he's willing to protect Freddy from bullies and that he gets his powers, then doesn't immediately start to save everyone shows the writers knew exactly what they were doing. This isn't some shortcut to being a good person. It doesn't show that he does all of the very funny things he does just to.make the audience last. He's learning. He's still not perfect. It's only when he has to save people from a problem that he created that he even remotely starts to start trying to understand the responsibility he carries. It's not until he begins to accept his foster family as his real family does he really understand the importance of helping others. You have to remember that he's always been a loner. He's never really experienced love since.. well, you'll see, but NEVER. In fact, I don't even think he's fully understood by the end of the movie. He's still learning. And why wouldn't he be? He's only 14.
This movie is absolutely great. It's much more than okay. It's honestly better than most comic book movies I've seen in awhile, but for different reasons than the other traditional superhero movies (like I said, this movie has those traditional elements, but also much more). The only way that it is ""just okay"" is if you have some serious superhero fatigue.",Shazam!

Fun of the movie lies in with the theme that ""what if a teenager became superhero, whenever he has power he physically grows up but mentally not"" . Zachery Levi stays on character through out. A big tall man acted as teenager. He stick into that mannerism and charisma. Go Watch it!.",Shazam!

This has never happened before.This is a truly great movie, with comedy elements that don't rely on dirty jokes, along with touching material on the value of family. The whole issue of a boy exploring super powers that he suddenly obtained is extremely well done.The cast was great, even Mark Strong as the villain.I really loved the ending at the family dinner.

1681,RonnicCasique,A very funny movie that is great to watch with the family.,9,7 April 2019,"Honestly this is probably my favorite DC movie from the last couple years. It was lots of fun to watch with my friends and very entertaining. It basically portrays the wonder and excitement that people would have if supper heroes where real. Also the movie doesn't take its self to seriously at time its playing into tropes while at times its turning it playing away from those super hero tropes. The only reason i didn't give it a hire rating is because towards the ending I felt like there where some minor details that took me out of the movie.
If you are looking for a fun movie to watch with your friends or family i would recommend it, however, if you want something serious and gritty then this won't be the movie for you.",Shazam!

1688,r-h-ashraf,Really fun time!,8,5 April 2019,"There's a lot of things I loved about Shazam! Despite feeling a bit on the long side, I did find a lot of enjoyment; having the film centered around a character learning his powers as he go's felt fresh to me, and Billy's reaction to gaining these powers feels exactly like what a 14 year old would do. The other children were also interesting themselves, not only bringing comedy but a family aspect to the storyline.The villain isn't the greatest ever here, with the Seven Deadly Sin monsters being your typical boring evil dudes. It was all very surface level, and I suppose going deeper would've added to the runtime, but I think it would've gone a long way.I would definitely recommend giving this a watch, there's a lot of funny moments (not all of the jokes land, but the majority do) and Billy is a great character who I loved seeing on screen.",Shazam!

But that's the comics adaptation and this is a movie obviously. Cutting straight to it this was a fun movie that one could thoroughly enjoy. My only two issues or one big one and one small one, the big one being that the kid acts more mature than the adult Shazam. Far too many scenes where the kid Billy is all serious about a situation then transforms and acts like a goof. This is most noticeable for me when you see bully",Shazam!
1692,grzywo,One painfully obvious problem,3,10 May 2019,"This movie was fun. I'll also mention Shazam is one of my favourite superheroes in the comics and that I'm a huge comic reader. Other than the small things that bothered me like the obvious and cheesy muscle suit and the villain being a tad too corny (sunglasses at night?). The big thing that held this film back for me was the contrast of the acting between kid Billy and adult Billy/Shazam. You have the same personality and if anything you're more mature with the wisdom of soloman and yet I couldn't get around everytime we see the kid Billy he acts mainly serious, calm and a little angsty right? Then we see adult Shazam act as goofy as the character gets, mainly cartoony. One of the most obvious scenes of this is when we see kid Billy go back to protect his new house mate and fights with a group of older kids at school, but then as Shazam a little later he cowers behind that very friend in a convenient store even before he knows the burgler is armed? This and many other scenes showing the difference in actual personality between the two of them is something that was hard to get past for me.",Shazam!

Some issues though: Character consistency of Billy Batson, feels like Zachary Levi and Asher Angel are two different persons. Some of the jokes felt forced and inorganic at times; Also wanted more emotion, especially in the scene where Billy and his biological mom meet. That story arc was a bit lackluster for me.

1700,jlemery,Don't really care what others think...,8,20 January 2020,"...but I got a charge out of this flick. It's pretty much the way a teenager would act when suddenly granted super powers in an adult body. A trip to the beer store, some petty larceny, some angst, some ego stroking. It's funny, it's light, and it's entirely believable in Billy's probable reactions to the situation at hand. Even the first fight with the arch villain goes pretty much the way that it would sith a kid who has the power, but doesn't really know how to use it...i.e. RUN! I hope that they can build on this with a nice sequel. In retrospect though, knowing Hollywood, that's probably asking too much.",Shazam!

I went in hoping it would be self aware or meta as the buzzword is these days. And there are plenty of references to super hero movies that brought laughs from the audience.I do think there was a missed opportunity though. It never fully committed to the comedy or self awareness like say Kick Ass 1 or Deadpool.The tone of the movie changed from comedy to family drama to full on super hero movie. If it stayed purely in comedy I think this could have been 9 or 10 out of 10 as the scope was there for it to deliver as both leads were superb and had good comedic chemistry.However, saying that the foster family scenes were superb and very believable and brought out the best acting in the movie.",Shazam!

It's supposed to be a movie for the kids that like superheroes, and it manages to be that! The plot isn't that great, and there are so many clishées that it becomes predictable of sorts.
It is however a fun movie to watch for the eye candy and stupid jokes.

The humour itself is excellent, alternating between slapstick and dumb pop culture references (Big for example), which generally I dislike, but this executes it so well I cannot help but be entertained.

1737,beckrussell,Solidly Average Superhero Movie,6,10 April 2019,"I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I don't really get why this movie is being raved about to the extent that it is. I came into this movie super super excited to finally see the first good DC movie in a long time, because the DC lore has always been my favorite. I was thoroughly let down though...-The action sequences lack action...Which wouldn't be a problem if they weren't aiming for an exciting climax resolved around superhero action, but they did. The Pacing for this movie was awful. The final fight scene is boring to watch. Legitimately. The villain who's built up as a smart man on a quest for more power behaves like an idiot towards the end. In my opinion there is no final fight scene-The main character's arc is unbelievable and forcedI'll keep this short so I don't spoil anything. The beginning character is a foster kid, and as such he doesn't want to be close with anyone because in his mind they're only there temporarily. Now you'd expect him to firmly distrust his new family at the beginning and for him to slowly evolve his relationships with siblings/parents into something meaningful. But nope. Instead he doesn't grow closer to any of them and barely interacts with anyone other than Freddy, but then out of nowhere 2/3 into the movie he's close with and completely trusts all of them. Why? Who the heck knows, because he sure didn't build relationships in any meaningful way.The main character is also incredibly unlikeable almost the entire movie (in my opinion) because he's just a jerk to people and he has no real motivations for doing certain rude things.-Almost none of the acting is believableI don't know what it is about recent DC movies, but I haven't watched anything they've made recently that made me forget I was in the theatre and feel like I was in the world of the movie. That's what movies are all about, but I'm not sure if it's the acting or the absurdity of the script, or what it is that I am just never sucked into DC movies. Shazam! was sadly another one of those movies-CGI was meh
-Many many many plot holesGood things about the movie:
-At certain points comedy was great. I'd say probably 3/4 for me was just cheesy, stereotypical, basic comedy, but the other 1/4 of everything was genuinely great.-Jack Dylan Grazer is a rare child actor that's incredibly talented in my opinion. His character was the only one in the family that seemed believable and everything about him made sense.",Shazam!

1739,andrewhsd,The super hero movie you didn't know you wanted,8,7 April 2019,"DC is hitting their stride. Their DCEU Batman and Superman movies were lackluster who h is surprising considering those are the most beloved, well known, and frankly marketable comic book characters ever. But they seem to be doing a fantastic job with some of their lesser known characters. Wonder Woman was better than anything before it. Aquaman outdid WW, and now Shazam has peaked my list for the top slot in the entire DCEU franchise.Shazam is very funny! Has heart. Action it does have, but it wasn't overblown (Captain Marvel) or infathomable (Age of Ultron). Enough to enjoy, but not souch you confuse it with Transformers 17. The graphics are great, much better than Steppenwolf in Justice League, God that was terrible. And most of all, it's genuinely relatable and personable (cough Henry Cavilll as Superman cough).How can I sum this movie up? Home Alone if it were a super hero movie, minus all the things you've grown to dislike about super hero movies.",Shazam!

1742,efehepdogan,The kid and the Guy are not acting like the same person,1,9 August 2021,"Street smart kid, acting edgy with the foster famil not caring anything, but when he turns into the guy he becomes a moron and caring for his sister and such.The street life in the movie is crazy. The two shoplifters look much more serious than people who would rob markets.A snow truck going full speed in the city not even braking for the girl,
The truck that hit Shazam when he first float in the asphalt came from far away how did it not see him and brake? Whats ewith the truck going fast in the city causing accidents?They were recording themselves and putting online doing tricks and such charging random people's phones with lightning in a crowded place and they are telling us that they are going low profile. Where is the authorities?Watching short clips from this movie may entertain you, but when it is served like a story it sucks :(",Shazam!

1750,dheevesh,Heart-warming,8,10 April 2019,"The DCEU has had its fair share of ups and downs. The real difficulty it had was to assembled it superheroes in one single movie(like the terrible JUSTICE LEAGUE and rather ok SUICIDE SQUAD). But, DCEU has got it quite right with its origin movies; MAN OF STEEL, WONDER WOMAN, AQUAMAN and now SHAZAM!SHAZAM follows the same approach as AQUAMAN in terms of tone. Now we are rather not totally far form the dark and gloomy atmosphere of MAN OF STEEL and BATMAN v SUPERMAN which is in fact a good thing taking into account SHAZAM's nature and characteristics and it all plays out well through the movie.The movie has a heart and stress more on what it takes to be a superhero, what is a superhero but mostly importantly, is a family greater than all the powers of a superhero. It answers all these questions in a simple but powerful manner mixing joy and humour with some dark moments. Sure it has its shares of weak moments like its villain.Mark Strong is always a win but they could have done better with him in this one.At times, it drags a little bit and also has a lack of action compared to other superhero movies but that was not the aim of the movie; its aim was to introduced to us Billy Batson first so we understand who SHAZAM is. The beautiful message about love of a family and its powers to create a sense of security and strength was developed in an effective way.To resume, SHAZAM was more of an introduction as to who Billy Batson is. It sets the foundation of an exciting world of magic and mysteries which will be hopefully explored in future DC movies. Some would say the lighter tone is a mimicry of the MCU formula but don't get fool by it because it is not; instead SHAZAM mix fun with DC's darker nature giving a heart-warming movie which will make you smile.",Shazam!

1771,mjdpretty,BEST DC MOVIE EVER!!!!!,9,6 April 2019,I went into this move with low expectations but I left the movie overwhelmed (in a good way) and happy. This movie is really a gem. Zachary Levi is PERFECT AS SHAZAM! The family is very good and I'm happy to see DC doing well. The cgi is off sometimes but it's only acceptable because of the budget but this movie is way better than Captain Marvel and this is a person who loves both DC and Marvel but Shazam takes the crown right now. Do I think it could make 1 billion? No but somewhat around that box office number? Yes. See Shazam. It's really good.,Shazam!
1772,coompaloompa,A great comic book film that brings you back to the more lighthearted days of Superman the Movie!,9,27 March 2019,"I was lucky enough to get tickets to an advance screening of this film and I was very excited, since I liked the trailers and the concept of the film. After seeing it, I'm pleased to say I really liked this film a lot.Let's start with saying that the acting is fantastic in this. Zachary Levi is incredible and very believable as a 14 year old in an adult body. He's funny, energetic, charismatic, and seems like he was totally born to play this part, I would compare him to Christopher Reeve's Superman. Even aside from Levi, the acting is great. I was a little worried about the child actors since they don't always work, but here they were great.I was a little worried about the character of Billy originally. Because in the trailers he seemed to be a very angsty kid, and then as Shazam it felt like a very different person. However in the film it totally works. He is an angsty kid in the beginning, but he goes through a very interesting character arch that makes both characters feel real and believeable.And then we get to probably my favourite part of the film, the heart and great story about family. Billy Batson is a foster kid who just kind of wants to be left alone but he is forced to adjust to a foster family. It's incredibly common for films to have a very negative portrayal of foster life, and this film refreshingly has a very positive take on it. The foster parents portrayed in this film are not abusive or negligent, but genuinely want what's best for the kids. This entire part of the film was brilliantly done and filled with so much heart and I loved it. One specific scene stands out to me at the end of the second act that I won't get into, but I thought it was brilliant.My only negative with this film is the same that I have with most comic book films, the villain. However in this case it isn't bad at all, it actually begins in a very intriguing way but there is a big gap in the characters story that bothered me a little. Mark Strong does a goon job playing the character of Dr. Sivana, and in fact the character isn't bad, but it's not one you're gonna remember.Shazam! Is a brilliant film that is a throwback to the old superhero days and a surprisingly self aware with some scenes coming off as a slight parody to me. It's brilliantly acted, hilarious, has a very heartwarming story, and is without a doubt one of the best films in the DCEU.",Shazam!

1776,angusk-95091,Sometimes Change is Better,8,7 April 2019,"Shazam! Was Great. One of the most fun superhero films I have ever seen and I hope to sparks a change in DC films in the future. Zachary Levi fully embraced the role as the superhero man-child and his teen counterpart Billy Batson is played really well by Asher Angel. This review couldn't be complete without mentioning Billy's best friend and foster brother, Freddy Freeman. Freddy is played magnificently by Jack Dylan Grazer (know for ""IT"" 2017) Grazer brings real charisma to the the role and does a splendid job of portraying a mentor-like, super hero nerd to Billy. The villain Doctor Sivana (Mark Strong) isn't one of the most interesting or fun villain I've seen but Mark Strong plays him well given how boring the character is. This film is Hilarious and the snappy dialogue between the characters is a breath of fresh air from the usually gritty and dark tones of earlier DC films. That being said the character designs of the Seven Deadly Sins are the stuff of nightmares (in a good way). Unfortunately some of the humour didn't land though. The film may seem a bit cringy or cheesy at times but I think it works as the film is trying to poke fun at other superhero films. Great Film go and see It. SHAZAM!",Shazam!

1788,chadmaddenphoto,A Hero In All of Us,8,6 April 2019,"Completely shocked when the first screenings came out and the rating it received from critics. I went into this film hoping Inwould feel the same way. This movie does not take itself too serious, just like the advertising stated. It pokes fun of the superhero genre and makes you laugh at how silly we take things as serious. Shazam explores what we would all probably do if granted these powers and how it would effect our friends and family. They heart of this film is the family and the bond it can bring when you're together. I laughed many times, but also felt the weight of the situation with the villain and the conflict between him and Shazam. If you go in expecting something serious, you'll probably leave a bad review. If you go in with the heart of a kid, you'll probably be like the masses and love this film.",Shazam!
1789,hshepard-43007,An Electric Joyride for Those Ready to Let Loose,8,3 April 2019,"For those who are planning on seeing this movie, you should know that if you have any preconceived expectations or you hold the belief that you'll be able to predict what's coming around the corner because you've seen other DC Universe or comic book movies , you're in for a shock. Moments of action, comedy, camp, genuine wholesomeness (one of which actually left me grinning from ear to ear) and even a couple jump scares hit you one after another like lightning bolts, leaving you full of energy and excitement with eyes peeled wide trying to figure out what the hell is going on and what'll hit you next. Don't get me wrong, there are places where it stumbles (couple of plot holes, some clunky dialog, pacing, breaking ""show, don't tell"", maybe intention of tone) that may be distracting for some, at least it was for me in the beginning; but the fact is that by the end you're having so much fun that you don't give a damn. I'd give this movie ⭐⭐⭐⭐ or an 8/10. Go see 'Shazam!' for more than a pleasant tingling sensation.",Shazam!

Sandberg gave us the actual Captain Marvel spin off which we comic book fans desired. Amazing casting and visuals. Mark Strong, Zachary Levi and Djimon Hounsou were absolutely living and breathing their characters. Not to mention THAT epic moment when the magic staff is handed to the children.

1810,afa-67914,JUST SAY ThE WORD AND MY REVIEW WILL BE YOURS!,10,5 April 2019,"Shazam is a great movie u can read any review u will see most of them are really positive. So here u can have my quick review, i'll endorse the good points i really liked and as i've seen people are already saying and complain about 3 items that were not great/bad in my opinion.First of all, the movie is about family, it fits perfectly as a ""christmas"" movie , it has bunch of good moments that are balance with the ammount of drama and emotional tone ,that both the protagonist and the antagonist pass through, they are enough, perfectly fit it right, this is a big HIT since most of the Super Heroes movies miss it or over do it.The kids were awesome, they are excelent actors for their age , they have enough frame time so we can start to liking'em. The movie does has more jokes then i'm actually fine with, but in this movie in specific the Jokes works, and are really great because afterall most of the jokes are made by the kids or actual situations we can see kids passing through. So even though they have plenty, plenty of jokes, most of them are actually realistic.Horror Scenes, so this is BIG BIG hit, this factor makes the movie more polished and flawless. Between the silly scenes/ family scenes, we have some tense moments of sadness anddd HORROR scenes, they really seem to be drawn out of some big hit horror movie and did fit the movie giving it a ""danger sensation"" that's clearly necessary so there are stakes in game, and the movie does stabilish it.The bad sides: Sin's appearances, they suck, they are horror creatures but they are too generic , even the same colors, maybe their eyes should have their sin color's, at least that. Other bad point is that silvana is a Black Adam, and not silvana ... and that sucks afterall it will be the same thing when we have black adam. And lasts bad point, Levi kindda overdo the kid in himself , cause Billy (kid) tries to be more mature and when he turns to kid he kinddas overdo it, but this is a (silly) problemn :P. And i disliked the Hero Cloths because they look too much tech oriented and not magic in my opinion ( most bracelets and lighting) but ok.I do recommend watching the movie if u like fun movies.",Shazam!

1813,wanderinglebo,disappointing,4,6 April 2019,"Although there are some enjoyable moments throughout this movie, most notably the scenes involving the young actors together as a family and the back story of Billy Batson's desperate attempts to find his biological mother. These are well done and engaging.
However, the movie loses it's way when it tries to turn into a superhero movie. Who is responsible for thinking it would be a good idea to portray Shazam as a blumbering, self-obsessed, ham-acting coward, at least for most of the movie. Quite frankly, he is just plain annoying!
In case some viewers are not aware, Shazam's name is an acronym:
S The wisdom of Solomon;
H The strength of Hercules;
A The stamina of Atlas;
Z The power of Zeus;
A The courage of Achilles;
M The speed of Mercury.
Zachary Levi's character does not seem to have imbued any of Solomon's wisdom, Atlas' stamina or Achilles' courage so he should be called ""hzm"".
Overall, shazam loses it's way and takes too long to find itself again.

First of all, the set up to the story was very repetitive and took way too long. Secondly, the animations of the ""bad guys"" was very poor. The biggest problem I have with this movie is that the fight scenes were very disappointing and consisted of people running away the whole time. The main character didn't even use his lightning super powers once again the main villain.... what? No one got hurt even once in this movie, there seemed to be no stakes at all. At least half an hour of the movie was dedicated to the super hero running away from the villain. It was just so monotonous and poorly done. Lastly, this movie was made out to be much funnier than it actually was in the ads. The pros of this movie just do not outweigh the cons. This is coming from someone who usually likes most movies.

It is is just so well-done it invites you to be part of it and believe you can be anything and actually that you do not necessarily need to be the CHOSEN one because you are always the CHOSEN one to your family and be part of it completes you. It is not boring it is does not feel long. On the contrary it keeps engaging you and the STORY compare to others from DC I believe is strong.

I give it a 8/9 out of ten. I think that your kids will absolutely love it. Highly recommended for family viewing.",Shazam!
1830,cacaceryt,"A great fun blockbuster, with some excusable flaws",7,7 April 2019,"If you enjoy superhero films, blockbusters, or want to watch something with your kid, this is perfect. It's a funny, enjoyable film. However, if your looking for a great film to watch, this isn't it.
Zachary Levi is amazing at playing a young boy getting superpowers and the rest of the cast do a great job too. Mark Strong has the weakest performance, but that might of been his character.
This film was brisk, and I never felt bored after the first ten minutes, the comedy was good, and it fulfilled a fantasy any kid has of what they would do as a superhero.
Going into it, I'd seen it's high ratings and was expecting a fun time, but the first ten minutes were a real drag of uninteresting backstory which felt underdeveloped, and the atmosphere of a bad fantasy film. Luckily it massively improves once Billy is introduced and the rest of his foster family are funny. However I did find that the ""gamer"" brother was written by a group of people who wanted to appeal to gamers. The blatant Razer product placement and the line of a 7 year old being able to hack into databases because he played Watchdogs was quite hard to sit through.
The villain was by far the least interesting character, and although they tried to give him a good motive, it fell into the trap that a lot of MCU films used to fall into by not giving him enough screen time to be developed. Some of his lines and actions were very cartoonish and inadvertently funny at times, however this overall made the film more enjoyable and fit with the tone.
Overall, fun dumb action film, but if your only gonna see one film this month, wait for Endgame",Shazam!
1831,maximo-50507,Poor movie,1,7 April 2019,Just waiting for avenger endgame. This movie dont show the real shazam power and at the end of the movie superman appeard but the head was cut woow what a great movie dc good job after the cgi mustache dc cut the head of superman lol,Shazam!
1832,miguelcoelho-13254,A movie that knows why superheroes exist,9,7 April 2019,"The super-hero genre was created for two reasons. The first is wishfull thinking, having the power to do amazing things and stop bad things from happening. And the second is to ask the questions ""What would you do if you had superpowers? Would you use them for yourself or to help others?"". These are simple yet thought provoking topics that Shazam! explores in a similarly simple yet thought-provoking way. And overall it's a very fun movie and in a natural way.
DCEU movies at this point have been way too serious, a little forced in terms of its humor. Even Aquaman, which I liked, felt a little cartoony. But so far Shazam! (and Wonder Woman minus the third act) seems to be the movie that is more aware of its tone: comedy mixed with high-stakes action, which fits perfectly with the story of a little kid that turns into a powerful superhero. When there were jokes I laughed hard and when there were character moments and action scenes, i felt invested.
But the best part of this movie would have to be the performances. Zachary Levi is great at playing a child trapped in a man's body, ashe usually is, but he also does it any way that is faithful to Asher Angel's Billy Batson, who by the way gets some really emotional scenes. Jack Dylan Grazer is really funny and has a great chemistry with Levi. Lastly, Mark Strong does a godd job at playing an intimidating, yet somewhat relatable, villain. A few nitpicks would be that the final battle was little drown out and the flying special effects felt a little bit unconvincing.
But overall, I really enjoyed this movie and the feeling of being a superhero it brought. Being a Marvel fan that also wants to give dc a chance,I loved that there's finally a year after a long time where a dc movie is the best movie of that year (so far, because endgame's looking pretty good). I feel really optimistic about the DCEU if they keep making superhero movies with this level of quality and charm.
P.S. There's an important mid-credits scene and a funny post-credits scene.",Shazam!

1842,TSzol,SHAZAM doesn't seem to know what kind of movie it wants to be.,5,10 April 2019,"I'll preface this review by saying that the last DCEU movie I saw was Suicide Squad, and before that the Dark Knight Trilogy. I'm not well versed in the DCEU and its internal tropes. I am aware that many critics find the movies lacking in motive and scope and I don't disagree with that where SHAZAM is concerned.The movie starts by introducing the young villain as a nerdy younger brother whose father and older brother mistreat during a dark and gloomy car drive to somewhere that never comes. He's transported away via his Magic 8-ball showing a series of runes and transforming the car into a portal. Upon entering the Lair of the OG Shazam, he is found unworthy of the powers of shazam and is called upon by the Seven Deadly Personified Sins to seek him out as he grows old.My first problem with this movie was how dreadful the OG Shazam was at acting. He was astoundingly bad. He only had 15 lines in the movie, but my suspended disbelief crash landed whenever he was talking. The second problem I had was just how flat the villain was in the film. Thaddeus never changed, even when his motives were questioned later in the film he is as flat as a board throughout the entire film. Ultimately, after meeting the OG, Thaddeus ends up causing(?) his father to crash the car, leaving him crippled and supposedly more discontent with his younger son.So far this is typical droll for a fantastical drama. There's nothing special about the development of the villain. In fact, the development of this villain is so boring that I practically forgot about his father and younger brother until they are brought up again for a scene that defines my experience with the movie.
Eventually an older Thaddeus crashes a board meeting with his father and brother after going back to Shazam's Lair and stealing the Macguffin power of the Seven Deadly Personified Sins. This scene plays out as a scene you'd expect in a thriller movie that borders on horror, just minus the blood and immediate displays of gore. Some dude gets his head bitten off for God's sake. I thought this was going to be a comedy based on the trailers. Up until this point it's been droll drama and non-bloody violence accompanied by troll-like demigods that just like to screw things up because that's what they like to do.The only comedy in the entire film comes in the scenes where Billy Banson is trying to figure out how to use his new powers after becoming Shazam. All of which is display in the trailers to the movie. Literally every comedic event in the movie has been shown off in the trailers. Everything else in the film flits idly between drama, thriller, or Fast & Furious style slow-mo action flick.The last problem I'm going to address (but not my last problem with the movie by a long shot) is the sub-conflict between an orphaned Billy Banson and his mother. Billy found himself lost from his mother at a fairground when he was about 6 and was unable to find his mother. He is picked up by police and eventually sent into foster care where he becomes a delinquent dedicated in finding his long-lost mother. There are so many holes in this conflict that are hardly resolved by the end of the film. Clearly his mother abandoned him intentionally. That's obvious from the moment you see him picked up by police and held until he may find his mother. It turns out that his mother saw him with the police and decided she (as a 23-year-old with a 6-year-old son) couldn't handle being a parent or couldn't provide a good life for this son or some excuse to put Billy into the foster home. Problems abound when you realize just how many routes Billy could have found his mother. The police have him, he knows (roughly) where he lives and maybe his mom's name or his family's name or the school he must have been going to at the time or something. But no, none of this is brought up and he's just put into foster care.
When it finally is time to resolve this conflict later in the film his foster family is being held captive (unknowingly to Billy at the time) as he approaches the apartment of his mother. He confronts his mother, and she says in no uncertain terms that she didn't and still doesn't want him. After having shut the door, Billy gets a call from his foster brother and must go save the day from the villain, who, did I mention was the flattest villain in any film I've ever seen? This entire scene is devoid of any emotional impact. There's no decision to be made by Billy whether to stay with his biological mother or if his foster family really means more to him that his actual family. It's just flat, like the rest of the movie. Maybe this is meant to drive home the fact that family is what you make of it, and not strictly blood ties, but that message would have had a bigger impact if Billy had to make the decision to leave his mother as opposed to just having the door shut on his face.Ultimately the film said to be one of the DCEU's finer films ends up as a disappointment, devoid of any emotional gravity, and lacking a motive or direction. The one saving grace for this movie was the acting of the children and Zachary Levi. He really sells the 14-year-old superhero vibe as Shazam, but his performance is undone by the lack of weight of the film as a whole.",Shazam!

1844,seveneight-76612,Reestablished the idea of why you should go to the movies,10,11 April 2019,"This movie actually reminded me what a good movie should be. This movie has true believable, and understandable character development and is a very tight story. It's actually funny, certainly took the title away from MCU movies for now. There is symmetry between Shazam/Billy and the villain and there are so many surprises, it's. real journey. Nails representation, the idea of acceptance and family is a strong message, some say parts are cheesy but personally I really don't remember something that was extrodinarily distinct of that.The villain might be the source of that but he himself was not bad, there was a believable dynamic with him, and not just a bad guy for the sake of being bad. If it was it isn't something bad. This movie has a lot of flavor, consisting of different genres, I even got Stranger Things vibes. Certainly one of the best superhero movies if not the best that I have seen in this modern wave of comic book movies!

Billy acted, which was kind of off, but the quirky jokes and hilarious relationship between Billy and Freddy made up for that. Zachary Levi is literally perfect for this role, and his ability to actually convince the audience that he's a child in a man's body is really cool. there was nobody that was a 'bad actor' and everyone played their roles well.special effects: the effects in this movie are really good-- they better be for the $100,000,000 budget, am I right? nothing was cheesy or corny, and you could tell that the directors, producers, and writers put a ton of effort into making this an enjoyable movie to watch. the cave where Billy meets the magician is really cool, and you get the cold and cavey feel while you're sitting there in your seat. also, the monster demon things are really lifelike and it's disgustingly funny.plot: no spoilers, I promise! the plot was interesting and paced well. it didn't move too sow or fast, and there was a perfect amount of humor, action, and ""oh shoot!' moments. there was never a moment where I zoned out and I was engaged the whole time watching it. overall, I loved this movie so much and hope that there's going to be a sequel soon.",Shazam!

Given a choice, he says, everyone picks flight. No one chooses invisibility, because it stinks of villainy. He wants to break these myths. And as it turns out, so does Shazam!.You don't need aerial punch-ups and dense word-building - even though Shazam! has both.

The little drama with Billy searching for his long-lost mom, while being unable to accept companionship from others, is alright. The special FX are good, but there aren't any mindblowing scenes (no real fighting or magic other than smoke and lightning). I didn't mind the villain being one-note, but I wish they did something better than the old ""7 deadly sins,"" or at the very least been more creative with the designs (which look like clay concept models of generic gargoyles and you couldn't even tell which sin was which).",Shazam!

1873,viliusnev,Great comedy !,7,3 June 2019,"This movie gives you everything that you want from it. I feel like this is a pretty accurate portrayal of what would happen if a child suddenly became a superhero (has some similarities to Spider-man).

He's almost like a PG version of Deadpool with maybe half the powers of Superman. Gotta admit, it did make me chuckle a few times here and there. Sorta reminded me of a superhero version of Big.

1887,carloranniti,I like this movie! (And hate fake account-haters),10,1 September 2019,"This movie has everything you could ask for: a smooth plot, a villain with a purpose, difficult moments, light hearted moments and a hero that finds his place in the world. The direction is also on point; no wonder it'll have a sequel.
Yeah, the budget was not huge like Aquaman and BvS, but it still managed to get the job done.
Now, the hard point: haters, the ones that say: DC is about darkness, like the Nolan trilogy taught us.
Spoiler alert: It's not. Shazam is a kid in a man's body.
Which means he feels joyful when flying, shooting lightning bolt and being super strong.If you don't understand all the spectacular good ratings that it had, it's not the critics' fault...it's yours. Are you upset for your own issues? We don't want to know it.",Shazam!

I have seen every single one and am the first to point out all of the flaws.That said, what we have here is a journey. While it may be a superhero movie, there is a much bigger thing happening just behind the scenes.This movie has what I can only describe as ""feels"". Sounds strange unless you watch it for yourself. It will rope you in, strap you down and take you on the ride it intended. The masterful acting and direction ensures that.I understand that all DC Universe movies cant be exactly this but my God, if even half of them were even almost as good, they would have a serious run on Marvel.One of if not the best Superhero film I have ever seen and much more than that, a film I sat through with all of my children while we cried, laughed, cheered and fist bumped.An amazing experience both cinematic and as enjoyed by my entire family.Thank you!",Shazam!

It could have been a fun movie as it had many elements to fulfill that however writer, screenplay, director all sucked...

While there were some dark scenes like when the Seven Deadly Sins kill everyone in the office, other than that it's more lighthearted.The scenes where he finds his mother however and the storyline around that wasn't necessarily a good part and didn't have enough plot to it. If that scene where he finally finds his mother were taken out the film, it wouldn't make a difference.Personally, this is one of the greatest movies in the DCEU in my opinion.",Shazam!

In that moment I thought to myself ""one superhero movie I don't want to watch"". I don't consider myself DC or Marvel but this movie definitely left a mark on me.Such a heart warming story; there were a few scenes that made it hard not to hold tears and if I were watching alone I'd probably be wailing. Character development could have been done better, like the power transfer scene I feel was a bit rushed. It's not a flawless movie but, I haven't felt this way about recent movies since Star Wars: The Last Jedi which is why I even took the time to write this review, something I don't usually bother to do. Hence why I give it 10/10, because it made me feel.Oh did I mention there was amazing comedy? I laughed hysterically at Mr. Moran; the jokes made were really well thought out and there wasn't any of the vulgar ones (or if they were probably minimal) which goes to show that you can have an amazing comedy without having to resort to it (I like you a lot Deadpool but, this one takes the cake).",Shazam!

I never thought I would say this being a life long Marvel fan boy, but DC is really getting more in tune with their roster. They seemed so focused on revamping Batman and Superman over and over again.Each movie they make now has gotten better and better and I think they are finally hitting their stride. I enjoy that they decided to take a more lighthearted approach and highlight a lesser known, but just as important hero and family.I will be keeping a closer eye on the DCU as I kind of step away from Marvel for a bit.

The rest have been average, BUT....That all stops here, I wasnt excited to see Shazam, in fact i was in two minds during the drive up to turn the car around and just go home as I was so uninterested. I'm so happy i didn't though. This is easily the best DC film put out in a long time and I would put it 3rd in my all time favourites between Dark Knight Rises (2nd) and Wonderwoman (4th).I was afraid when the movie started that it was going to be too much comedy based and child like for me to be able to enjoy it but no... there are parts in this film that could possibly give your kids nightmares if they're easily scared. The comedy and the action bounce nicely off of each other and the storyline is fantastic.Not one member of the cast plays a weak link, everyone is fantastic, I cannot fault one person. I had fears when I seen Mark Strong signed up to play a supervillain but he knocked it out of the park.Finally, I can say well done DC. Great film and a must see",Shazam!

Cons:
The script is one dimensional full of clichés and leading to very irrational conversations and occurrences which feel guided by desired plot points.Antagonist is not relatable at all, simply bad for the sake of being bad.Billy and Shazam do not feel like the same person and Shazam script is weak and tries to hit a punch line every other line.Pros:
Asher Angel's Billy Batson is terrific. Plays a believable relatable ""good kid with no luck"" who honestly is just trying to get by day by day with his head low.Fun and funny for younger audiences.",Shazam!

1932,timothy-kivi,DC is just not good at Movies,5,7 April 2019,"Shazam continues DC's market researched based scripts and it fails in the same way all the others have. They introduce a bunch of characters and give you no reason to care about them. The ""comedy"" is jammed into every scene with boring predictability. The story is deep and interesting but they never show you any of it.I've been reading DC Comics since the 80's and I adore these characters. I really hope they figure this out someday.",Shazam!
1933,munchtv,Fun! Finally DC you found the magic I've been missing.,7,5 April 2019,"Shazam is absolutely delightful! It's nowhere close to perfect but the moments that work are riveting. Zachary Levi, Asher Angel, and Jack Dylan Grazer all give amazing performances really making the comedy work the whole way through. Shazam and Freddy's characters work really well off each other which is definitely the best part of the film. There are so many incredible jokes in this that really made me laugh hard, again it's nice to see DC about all seriousness to just make a fun little experience. Random aside but I really loved the character design of the sorcerer, I found it to be the only *good* thing about the first act of this. The film does have weak parts. As mentioned the entire first act feels very weird, I assume most of the people giving this high praise are going to look back and realize 30 minutes of this is a 3/10. Most of the scenes where we are with Mark Strong without Shazam feel incredibly boring, which maybe should have been reworked. The cinematography isn't anything special and the score feels a little temp-y music at times.
What surprised me is how I bought the family dynamic, it never aims to pull on you heart string which makes it have more impact. Usually this by the numbers story would come across as lame, but even with bad child acting performances there's something nice about the comradery they share. This is hits it's strides when Shazam is just a fun hero learning more about his powers. Crazy that the lightning bolt is the new symbol of hope instead of a sad looking S.
Really excited with where DC is headed with the future, this definitely leans them more towards just create separate stories and make them fun events to go to. I never really felt like I could bring my entire family to see any DC film aside from Wonder Woman so it's nice to see a film with a broad outreach.",Shazam!

They are completely different character. Further more none of the characters feel very enagaging.The comedy will aloud a few good nose exhales with maybe one or two solid laughs.It had some solid potential but again it never really knew what it was and felt a bit disjointed.The CG was also quite lackluster. Shazam went from being physically rigged to smooth when being animated.I want DC movies to be good. I lower my standards going into a DC movie in hopes that I will come out surprised.

It blow me away and I have now seen it twice and I have tickets booked for third time,Shazam!
1945,Andyblake_gtfc,Great family fun.,9,9 April 2019,"Was sceptical beforehand with several flaws in previous dcu entries however this film really delivers, shows a lighter side to DC. A solid entry in the DC universe. Great family fun.",Shazam!

1948,easycheese007,I wish they'd have stuck with the Rock,6,9 April 2019,"The film for me was entertaining, but it could have been so much more. Levi is brilliantly cast and plays the role to perfection and encapsulates the immature yet buff Shazam to an absolute T, but I would have expected Black Adam with the possibility of Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson picking up the role as I understand he was approached... The film did see to drag on with some bits that seemed a little over kill and a more simple story line would have been far more effective",Shazam!

1953,nousiainen-velipekka,"Kid movie, know d director, kid cut, kid script.",5,6 April 2019,"The story just doesn't flow. It has been cut too short, probably for the kids sake. It simply doesn't work. Besides the child actors it seems like all the crew were kids. While there was action and comedy it didn't hold together. Maybe the screenplay was in srong order? The too main characters, Bikly and his friend were very good and villain better than the adult hero. As a whole I blame to movie being cut wrong. It is a mess. I hopr any 14 year old loves it though. The last battle includes fantasy for the girls, too. The coolest thing in this movie is last few seconds. The closing act. I can still see it in slow motion.
4 stars the child actors + one more for the okay villain

1956,k-pokerface,"Boring, too childish, bad comedy everything is there",1,30 May 2019,Just wasted my time sitting in cinema hall. Predictable storyline and comedy that you need try hard to laugh.

1957,VideoNomad,"Not terrible, but very very weak overall.",6,15 September 2019,"Maybe good for kids but for me it was quite boring. The storyline is very simple, which is not bad on its own. In this case though, it was also very plain and weak. Actors were ok, and overall acting is alright. CGI was terrible and painful to watch most of the times, and barely passable in rare occasions.
DC needs to start doing something about their quality level, because it is all wasted potential. With good writing and CGI this could have been a very nice and fun movie. Keep the actors, change everything else. Same was with Aquaman (though just like with Black Panther, a lot of people decided to praise that movie. Maybe it's Momoa Magic, idk).Barely 6/10, closer to 5.5.",Shazam!
1958,diequeeq,"I'd say it's a horror, not a comedy",8,15 April 2019,"At least first half of the film was like horror, not like a comedy.

It's a easy film, linear with some good humor. The major problem is that every thing about the movies are predictable since the beginning... Maybe someone would find it boring.",Shazam!
1960,ciroman-731-800649,Another review,9,21 April 2019,"The movie is funny. It have this scenes that you just laugh at it and it's no because is dirty or dumb for no reason; the jokes are funny 'cause are things that some people can relate even if the story is fictional.How they could bring the drama was extremely good too. The acting, how was written, is was good; more than the expected.I think that one of the downs is that the movie feels prolonged for show more of what we know, and don't get me wrong the fights were freaking awsome and the CGI was good too, but they felt more longer than probably most of the people would like, and again don't get me wrong the fights are extremely awsome and are very enjoyable and funny... never forget that, the movie is almost all funny and it feels new, because normally superheroe movies are all about a dramatic past ( Shazam! Is no strange) and is more serious and sometimes even feel that they have a lot of weight, Shazam! Is a superhero movie that feels light and heartwarming has well. It's a movie you can see in any mood and any day. Hope this review help you if you were unsure if you wanted to see it.I REALLY, REALLY RECOMMEND THE MOVIE.",Shazam!

From that point on the movie gets from bad to terrible, i even switched the movie off half way through.Too many useless scenes, terrible!!! speech lines, sometimes so dull a 8 year old kid could have written better dialogues. The acting is just lousy all combined.
How can this movie get 7.2 Score on imdb?? Waste of time all the way.",Shazam!
1963,jwilliams051197,Some fun for the whole family!,10,8 April 2019,"This movie is awesome! Has a lot of humor and heart. Zachery Levi is perfect as Shazam! He seriously seemed like a little kid inside a mans body. Asher Angel was phenomenal too and kid Billy Batson, getting some emotional moments in (not going into spoilers.) All of Billy's foster family was very likable (my favorite was Darla). Jack Dylan Grazer as Freddy Freeman was awesome, and actually seemed like a real life fanboy of superheroes without coming off as stereotypical. And this movie is not afraid to go dark with Mark Strong as Thaddeus Sivanna, actually killing some people, but not too dark to take away from the fun!",Shazam!
1964,nawaf-albusairi,New hero and full of action horror emotions but what new,8,8 April 2019,"The movie at all is great and cant miss any part of it

1971,almightykenshin,Best DCEU movie yet!,9,28 March 2019,"Shazam does a great job of being everything you want a superhero movie to be. It's fun, funny, has a ton of heart, and does a great job of exploring to personhood of the hero. Levi is incredibly convincing as a kid in an adult's body, and Asher Angel (who has a great superhero name in his own right) plays a streetwise kid, who's hardened himself because of injuries inflicted on him by the world like you wouldn't believe. The supporting cast is great, especially Darla, Freddie, and the foster parents. Mark Strong's villian left a little to be desired, but not one said this movie was perfect.

The director and writers obviously believe that 14 year olds are actually mentally retarded. The acting is wooden and wouldn't be acceptable in a local amateur dramatics society. The entire cast should never be allowed to work in film production again. Flipping burgers would be too much of a challenge.
Sadly I will never get the time back wasted on this embarrassment of a film.In case you didn't realise it I did like the film.",Shazam!
1981,lcashel59,Don't bother,2,6 April 2019,"How this got an 8 rating is beyond me. It's marketed as a superhero spoof and instead DC sits us through an excruciatingly boring movie full of missed opportunities. Shazam, a 14 year old boy in a superhero body, was poorly scripted, and it was here all the opportunity was missed. Maybe 12 year-olds will like it, but as far as producing a great spoof DC again didn't just served up a forgettable flick, they've dished up a movie to avoid at all costs.

1985,shedproductions961,This Film has restored my faith in the DCEU,9,1 April 2019,"Let's be honest. The DCEU hasn't got off to the best start. With only Wonder Woman being great and Aquaman being reasonable at best. However this film has restored my faith in DC. Everything from the writing, to the production design, to the cinematography through to the editing was perfect.The film does something great in its tone, as it is able to bounce from comedy that had me and the audience laughing and then going to points which made me genuinely feel for the characters. Films have tried and failed to make this tonal difference work. however this film manages to full it off.The films cast is perfect in this film with not one character feeling out of place. what is even better though is that all of the characters motivations feel right. Also something else that is good is that we have a developed villain for the first time in this era of DC films. With the film starting on their character not the hero which is a welcome change. As the one element of most superhero movies that lets them down is a weak antagonist (Both Marvel and DC suffer with this). This film also did something else unexpected which centres around who Billy Batson's family is, is it his biological family, or is it his foster family? Which leaves me wondering. Why is this the first superhero film to tackle this. As it was in my opinion when this film was at its strongest.If I have one complaint and it is very minor. It is that the final battle does get a little bit too long for me personally. But I am scraping the bottom of the barrel with this criticism.In conclusion this film is not only the best DC film that I have seen in a long time. But in my top 20 films of all time and I'm so glad I got to see it in an early screening and am hoping that the rest of the DCEU can keep making films as great as this one.Final Rating: 9.3/10",Shazam!
1986,abhishekguru,Kick ass comedy with some predictability,9,31 March 2020,"I really enjoyed this movie. It gave me a lot of laughs. The script was well paced and packed with a lot of very humorous surprises. Although the plot like many superhero films was quite predictable in the second half, I was quite happy with the initial development of the supervillain and the superhero and their connection. The other characters were quite powerful as well, especially Freddy the disabled friend and Darla the kid sister.",Shazam!
1987,colinsahern,Um ... this movie is terrible.,1,8 April 2019,"Remember subtly?
This film surely doesn't.
Another script that was simplified for overseas viewing, and had to explain every joke and every moral message.
In 'Big' Tom Hanks was a kid trying to be an adult, Zachary Levi chose to be an adult acting like a kid.
That choice took all the heart out of Shazam.
Watching this film was like watching Jimmy Fallon skits in which he attempts to be a superhero over and over again.
Also, Corey Haim's performance in Dream a Little Dream seems to have been ripped off and poorly copied.
Nothing original, just a film made to make money.
It's like Deadpool and Superman and Big all wrapped up into one.
Except, bad.
REALLY bad.",Shazam!

And my god the CGI!! The demons are ugly and badly designed.This is so far the worst experience I had in a theatre. Don't waste you're time on this, this movie should have make it direct-to-DVD.

The villan played by the amazing ""Mark Strong"" is stylish but as mentioned by another reviewer is forgettable, I wanted this movie to hit in all the right ways but it left me begging for it to end, the 2hr Run time feels more like 3. The chemistry of the cast felt unnatural and forced. I found myself more annoyed then excited ,the pacing of the film was horrendous and the last act made it seems as though Shazam is dumber then his ""siblings"" as they learned to utilize their powers in a shorter amount of time.

It's better to just say.... shazam???Felt like the movie was specifically filmed for the very young generation of kids. If I was going to watch a movie, say like ""Spy Kids"" intentionally, then I probably would have enjoyed Shazam much more.Some of the special effects were ok. Some of the plot was ok. Most of it was just two hours of mediocre jokes and running around pointlessly. Maybe two good scenes in the entire movie. So like, 10 good minutes out of 120.Not to mention, his suit looked like the director tried to squeeze him into a red and yellow Stay Puff marshmallow outfit.Bottom line, just another DC catastrophe.I should have stayed home and watched Green Lantern or Spy Kids again ( or Uncle Grandpa or Chowder reruns).3 out of 10 stars.At least DC got Aquaman and Wonder Woman right.The editor for Green Lantern didn't even watch it, and it was a better movie.",Shazam!

Contains too much flying here and there and figuring out the powers.

2007,thor-40646,Enjoyed the movie BUT beware the monsters,7,12 May 2019,I was blown away by how evil the villain was and how inappropriate it was for my 3 kids. Sooo disappointed at the venom level violence (yes a demon bites someone's head off) which made it to where I couldn't watch it with my kids. Even my oldest was cringing and I had to stop it. I was very much looking forward to watching with them bc my oldest hates bullies but the violence was just too harsh. It ruined what could've been an outstanding movie for them. As an adult I value a good villain and he was awesome. I know a villain is what truly makes a superhero movie. Would've given it much higher without the extreme violence.,Shazam!

But the thing is DC failed and on the other hand, Marvel succeeded.
You guys might think i am saying this because i am a Marvel fan. Well i trully am. But that doesn't mean that i am biased to Marvel movies. I am a big fan of DC's Batman character. I freaking love Batman animation series, movies and everything about. I also liked the Hellboy movies and Watchman movie.
Now lets talk about the Shazam movie. The comedy wasn't that funny. The villains were i don't know too weak and wasn't actually like trying to be serious or nothing. They were like watching and roaring and doing almost nothing.
The Shazam wasn't felt anywhere like any superhero. The story wasn't also bad. The villains were the worst.
DC should learn from a thing or two form ANIME superhero series like One punch man, My hero academia and many other ANIME superhero series. How to build a superhero character and at the same time being a funny and powerful superhero like One punch man or Saitama.",Shazam!
2017,myles_wwe,Great fun!,7,7 April 2019,"After exiting 2017's ""Wonderwoman"" moderately impressed and still yet to see 2018's ""Aquaman"" it's safe to say I've not been the most die hard of DC Comics' latest attempts at reinvigorating their cinematic universe. However upon my exit of ""Shazam!"" I left with the smug smirk of blooming teen as I had just sat through one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've had this year. The movie isn't flawless by any means but it never struck me that thats what it was aiming for. A fun romp for the whole family (some potentially scary scenes for the little ones), with a warm, family orientated theme throughout. Zach Levi was infectious and Mark Strong was convincing enough as a villain. The young cast however stole the show with heart that oozed from the screen.Just like the message and themes throughout the film, not all scenarios,families or lives are perfect. Its up to you to find the shimmers of hope and light in these aspects that's important.Looking forward to where they take this story!Good step forward for DC!",Shazam!

By the end of the movie, he still doesn't even have a name because it was sold to the Marvel franchise who ironically released their own equally stupid yet more boring Captain Marvel movie at the same time.

I cant believe it got 70 on metascore, its disgraceful for other movies with a similar score which compared to this movie are a masterpiece for example: ""the invitation"" (2015) or ""the sixth sense""(1999).

This one, however, I liked. A lot. It was the right amount of dark backstory for the evil supervillain and heart and humor and well-timed comedy. Our new favorite superhero!

Action scenes are amazingly crafted, but what carries this film is the heart it has. It is very emotional and shows the importance of family. Great film, very well directed. Great performances by everybody (Darla was the best).",Shazam!

Everything that I saw in this movie will remain with me for a long time ...and the movie is so much more than the trailers tell you & in now days that is a very good thing ... , That being said the lesson that is presented here alltough wrapped in fun Is perfect for both adult and younglings alike.

2076,mmr-93367,Generally good but unbalanced,7,24 September 2019,"2019's Shazam! is known as one of the best DCEU movies to date and although looking back at the previous projects from DCEU - which apparently aren't getting rebooted or reimagined - it isn't generally such a high bar, Shazam is a generally good but (as previously mentioned) unbalanced film that is overrated due to the good parts of the movie to an extent. As an example, Rotten Tomatoes has given it a percentage of 91%. Why do I call this an overrated flick? Allow me to demonstrate.The movie starts with a rather interesting and mysterious tone that does keep you interested in the movie by introducing Thaddeus Sivana who looks like a decent Harry Potter fan who could himself become a real hero but won't because of having his fantasies bashed by a wizard who had the ability to make him a superhero and by his very own brother and father and setting up the backstory of the antagonist before the backstory of the protagonist which usually (Mainly in good movies and stories) is done to set up a unique type of enemy for the hero in which actually could have been an amazing alternative plot to the movie to show that both Sivana and Billy Batson have been through a lot but because in a younger age Billy has a foster family that helps him through harsh times, Billy turns into a hero but doctor Sivana turns into a villain and a dark alternative version of Billy; this type of connection and rivalry between these two would've been interesting.But it appeared that the movie was going in the direction to show how from an irresponsible with superpowers who doesn't show feelings about his newly found foster family, Billy Batson would eventually let his foster family inside his circle of love and turn into a true hero (For instance, like the direction that Sam Raimi took with his version of Spider-Man) but after a while through the movie the plot got lost in its own purposes and instead of showing how family and heroism got important for Billy, the movie just pretty much threw it at the audiences' faces and jumped right in for the final fight scene that is as cheesy and unbalanced as it gets.Shazam (Billy Batson) and his foster brothers and sisters fight doctor Sivana and the seven deadly sins then chase each other and then stand there and have some jokes and again fight and then again chase each other and again stand there and have some jokes and repeat the same totally unbalanced method which is rather frustrating and mostly boring. The final fight scene also shows doctor Sivana whom we had previously known as a powerful and dangerous foe doesn't know much when it comes to fighting because in the middle of the fight he tells Billy that if he doesn't give him his Shazam powers, he will kill Billy's family and so Billy kneels before Sivana and Sivana holds the staff of the Shazam (wizard) in front of Billy but apparently because Sivana has closed his eyes and is busy waiting for the power to flow through him which is frankly ridiculous, Billy just takes the staff and throws him away as if it's no big deal.Then Shazam (Billy Batson) turns his foster family - who he had barely known and liked - into Shazams which could have been kept for the sequels after having the audience become more familiar with them and especially by showing that Billy's foster brothers and sisters are pure of heart too because the movie doesn't show or mention if Billy's foster family members are even good people and even Billy's heart being pure is vague because the wizard tested the previous contenders by observing their connection with the seven deadly sins to see if they'll be tempted by the sins or not but when Billy Batson is in the wizard's presence, the seven deadly sins were gone and the wizard only said that Billy is pure of heart and at first Billy denies at first but then accepts the offer and that does not mean that he is pure of heart because unlike others he hasn't been examined.
A short while after the final fight, Shazam (Billy Batson) pranks his Shazam family into thinking he's being possessed by the seven sins but it's just a joke and although it's not necessarily a bad joke, imagine how much more interesting it would've been to show that Shazam (Billy Batson) actually hears a voice calling and pretends he's heard nothing and that he isn't currently quite as heroic as the wizard wanted his champion to be. This could've led to an interesting arc to be explored in further sequels leading to Billy Batson becoming pure of heart through his actions rather than this being thrown around like a meaningless label.Overall, Shazam 2019 is an overrated unbalanced flick that could've been much better, bigger and much more satisfying and doesn't deserve the appreciation and the ratings it currently has but is still a rather good movie because of the decent acting, some good and funny jokes and amazing visual effects.",Shazam!
2077,benhamilton-19408,"Had good elements, but overall disappointing.",5,8 April 2019,"This movie looked fun, and got amazing reviews. I try to temper my expectations when seeing comic book films in particular. It helps me not to be disappointed, and almost always helps me enjoy the film by being pleasantly surprised. This movie, however, did disappoint me. mostly because it got such amazing reviews from critics and audiences.
I really liked some elements of it, but the villain was boring along with the third act, which was too long, and very unfocused. I was hoping to be entertained, but I ended up just leaving wishing I hadn't spent my money on that one. I think teenagers will probably like it quite a bit, but if you have more refined taste, I'd recommend saving this one for a casual night at home.",Shazam!

2079,w-85424,Very happy when I look at it,7,9 April 2019,"IIn Philadelphia, Billy Batson is an abandoned child who is proving a nuisance to Child Services and the authorities with his stubborn search for his lost mother. However, in his latest foster home, Billy makes a new friend, Freddy, and finds himself selected by the Wizard Shazam to be his new champion. Now endowed with the ability to instantly become an adult superhero by speaking the wizard's name, Billy gleefully explores his new powers with Freddy. However, Billy soon learns that he has a deadly enemy, Dr. Thaddeus Sivana, who was previously rejected by the wizard and has accepted the power of the Seven Deadly Sins instead. Now pursued by this mad scientist for his own power as well, Billy must face up to the responsibilities of his calling while learning the power of a special magic with his true family that Sivana can never understand.
hope it has a better box office.This movie makes me happy or can be said to be very happy, is the ""guest"" of Superman and Batman.Although they did not really show their faces, but the material of the uniform, the shape of the dart, all tell us that they belong to the DC expansion universe we are familiar with.In other words, despite a series of blows, so that the main single movie of the hero, but Warner did not stop the construction of the entire universe.This is the birth of Shazan, who is encouraging us, don't give up that expectation: One day, we can see the epic scene of the Justice League's heroic dark monarch.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is neither a familiar DC extended universe formula nor the familiar Shazan I like in comics and cartoons.is like a DC version of ""The Extraordinary Team"", let a group of teenagers and even children play a leading role, Dr. Shivana, who is very powerful in the animation, has become a headless sand sculpture, playing Play the role of evil Santa Claus and accompany the children to play a game that flies and changes.For superhero movies, it's not a bad idea to make the tone easy and lively, at least in Sea King, which makes us very useful. The real weakness of ""Thunder Shazan"" lies in the production cost of 80 million yuan in the district. It is really stretched as a big change.Estimated most of the budget is spent on the physicalization of the seven sin monsters. In the first fight, the crew could not destroy the expensive landmarks. They only smashed several shopping malls and finally collapsed a medium-sized Ferris wheel.
is very cleverly avoiding all the buildings, the momentum is far less than one percent of the battle between Superman and General Zod. Even the special effects of Shazan's broken roof have not been made, and the cement floor has been scratched.Don't forget, Shazan is able to compete with Superman for three hundred rounds of combat power. The ordinary building can't help him to hit it. Ok, I know this is an original piece, but it shouldn't be weakened to this extent!Of course, the superhero dry frame does not necessarily have to destroy the earth. The venom and the ant people next door are not small and clever. The number of roads is not good, but Shazan's cleverness is not coincidental. Flying a few laps, throwing a bus to throw a bad guy or something, really very discouraged.Here we have to talk about a split fact: Although I am not satisfied with the film itself, I sincerely hope that ""Thunder Shazan"" will be popular and the box office will burst.Since the ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Justice League"" that were highly anticipated two or three years ago, they have lost in succession, and the ""Batman"" movie has been difficult to produce. Warner is hard to rely on ""Wonder Woman"" and ""Sea King"" to save face. Need to be more energetic and then the next time."""" is a knot-eye project, it is not expensive, there is no big star, there is no such thing as a black-Adam, the enemy-level villain, I can see that Warner is very clear that this is a gamble, and the result of this gamble will Decided a lot.If Sazan can succeed, it will inject more confidence into Warner, let us look at the ""Steel Body 2"", ""Justice League 2"", the fateful ""Batman"", the very loud ""Constant"" Ding, and the ""Green Light Corps"" who knows shame and then brave... is closer to us.So, take a look at ""Thunder Shazan"", it is a key that takes us to open the door to more heroes (just ""open the door"" is given an important meaning in the film). What's more, after all, the movie is intriguing, and you might like it very much.",Shazam!

Although after seeing the several different trailers for Shazam it was like seeing a beacon of hope! Have DC finally decided to copy Marvels formula? Is this gonna be an incredible film!Well. The acting was questionable at times but overall decent, CGI was great same with almost every other film nowadays though, the plot was okay. The villain was meh, I like Mark Strong as an actor, but I felt let down by his performance, I mean his version of Sinestro in Green Lantern was better than this. Zachary Levi did a decent job, in my opinion. Although it was a different take on a superhero film, which I thought was awesome!BUT...the film didn't stick well together. I mean it flowed okay, and the first 2/3 was great but it kinda fell apart towards the end. I mean the final battle, went on and on and on and on. To the point where it felt like there was some money left over from the budget so they decided to just spend it on making more and more fight scenes!Unlike a Marvel Studios film where there is usually a cool twist or unexpected thing that happens, this lacked it, and if there was one possible slight cool twist they spoiled it in the merchandise!!!And this might be the first film EVER, where they put the end credit scene in the trailer for the film!!!!!!!So I'm gonna give it a 7.2/10 🌩I will leave you with this If you have the money and are bored on a Friday afternoon watch the film, if not save it for Avengers Endgame!Will I be seeing Shazam 2, probably 😉",Shazam!
2085,hollyweirdos,No offense to Zach Levy ...,1,22 September 2019,But I hated this movie. It was unnecessarily evil. It had a ton of unnecessary scenes. Story line made no sense. I hope kids don't watch this. It was cringy. It was triggering. I was expecting it to be funny after the stupid beginning.... it wasn't. I think it may have ruined everyone's careers who starred in this. Whoever wrote this should not work in Hollywood.,Shazam!
2086,alexandervera-78592,Shamz! and DC's rising.,9,6 April 2019,"DC's recent film delivers a promising superhero that's just about to be explored. It also brings a new freshness into the DCEU, proving that the writers can be serious and funny at the same time without feeling overworked. Zachary Levi and Jack Dylan Grazer are amazing in their characters and make de movie lighter and more relatable each.
I have to say that there were many disappointments, but also surprises showing that if you stick to the original story great things can happen.
More like 8.7.PS. DC keep it that way, I can't wait to see you triumph.",Shazam!
2087,vranchan,Shazam Non spoiler review,9,28 March 2019,"Shazam! NON SPOILER REVIEW
This was exactly what I wanted the Shazam movie to be, how someone my age will react to and use their superpowers.
I really enjoyed Zachary as the adult Shazam, he was totally believable as a kid in an adult's body. His Billy form played by Asher Angel was good too but I liked the Zachary parts more. The friendship and chemistry between Billy and his sidekick Freddy was definitely a highlight of the movie.
The child/ young actors did really well and some of them were hilarious too.
Another big plus was the comedy which had me laughing so much especially at jokes regarding the DC universe and the wider superhero genre. Definitely a more light hearted movie than I expected.
There was a huge focus on the importance of family which was a lot more relevant to the plot than I expected and I didn't mind that aspect.
Mark Strong was okay as the villain, we are given some reasons to feel sympathy for him...",Shazam!
2088,matyasfuka,"Overrated, but not bad",6,5 April 2019,"The first half of the movie was pretty good, I had a good time and I was enjoying it, the origin of Shazam was well explained and it was funny. Unfortunately, it focused too much on the hero which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the villain had too small screen time, which leads me to the second half which is just bad, the villain is bad and you don't understand why he's doing what he's doing. The soundtrack in the movie was classic action theme, nothing too exciting. The final fight was just bad, it was too long and there was a surprise which ruined the final fight I think. End scene before credits was pretty funny, then there are two post-credit scenes. The first was heavy plot scene, the other one was just funny. I think it's pretty good family movie but not action movie.",Shazam!
2089,nitheshm,Very bad,4,19 May 2019,Very bad super hero movie... DC please work on storyline... Add something more thrilling like Marvel... This movie look like childish,Shazam!
2090,shamraizmumtaz,A great superhero movie with a meaning!,10,5 April 2019,"Shazam is how a superhero movie should be. It not only keeps you interested in the story but there is also a deeper meaning about family and friendship. One of my favourite superhero movie, I highly recommended you watch it.",Shazam!
2091,Kirubaharan_Sakthivel,Just Say It.....SHAZAM!,8,10 April 2019,Really enjoyed the movie till the end. Movies like this will make the superhero genre very interesting.,Shazam!
2092,desislavag-39048,It was a lot of fun (for the most part),7,10 April 2019,"Overall it was enjoyable and fun to watch for the most part. When the good guy and the bad guy started their endless fight, that's when I lost interest (and yes, I know this is a superhero action movie and this is not something I should be complaining about, but what can I do? I was bored ¯\_('_' )_/¯ ).Anyways, here's what I liked:
As I said the movie really is funny, the jokes are well written and well acted, not dirty, not corny, but genuinely funny for everyone, regardless of how old one is, making it very family friendly movie, so that's awesome.
Jack Dylan Grazer is really, really good as Freddy. The whole time I was thinking how much he reminds me of Adam Brody, who I heard was in the movie, but totally blanked that out, so that was also awesome! Great casting!
It is a lighthearted feel-good movie for the entire family.Now here is what I did not like:
So you know how one moment Billy didn't like those guys and wanted to leave, and the next moment, they were family? Well, I don't buy that. I mean they knew each other for how long, a few days? Weeks? I can agree about Freddy, but he barely even talked to the other kids, or the parents. (That got me thinking, maybe It could have made a good tv show? I would have loved to see the whole family dynamic and Billy bonding with the rest of the kids)
I wish the sins were explored more, I don't read comics, maybe they are not explored in the comics too, or maybe they are, but I mean I was intrigued- why the seven deady sins? Why not the seven evil dwarfs? What's the point? What do they do? What's their story? (Again, tv shows have more screen time, just saying)
Adult Billy is nothing like kid Billy, honestly I didn't believe that they were the same person, kid Billy was moody and quiet most of the time, adult Billy- the exact opposite.
How was that little boy able to find Billy's mother just like that, when even Billy himself couldn't find her his whole life? I get that he is smart, but still, how?Also there's this shot of the scholl, with a bunch of kids in front, 3 of them hug- they used that shot a few times. Not something that bothered me, just noticed.So that is pretty much it. Is it an awesome movie? No. But it isn't bad either. And if you are looking for an entertaining, funny, and feel-good movie- go for it!",Shazam!
2093,ansharism,Great movie,10,2 April 2019,"Great movie, another perspective of superhero, superhero with magic",Shazam!
2094,alasteph,Stupid stupid stupid👎👎👎👎👎,1,3 August 2019,This movie can only be enjoyable to anyone who likes to watch immature stupidity. Wasted time making it to just half way through this pubescent train wreck.,Shazam!
2095,thisismyemailadnan,Fun and Awosome,10,7 April 2019,After I watched this movie I am just shaking in joy and all the exitement the movie has.The movie is great for all the people and far more better for all the comic fan.,Shazam!
2096,mac-wss,Is it super hero movie?,3,5 April 2019,"I think it's just a comedy movie.
Cg and visual effect are so different from the last movie(Aquaman).and the story is going very slow.",Shazam!
2097,jrathbone-38352,Amazing!,10,9 April 2019,I am a big fan of Shazam and have been for a long time! Zachary Levi was the perfect casting! The entire movie is filled with fun and gives a great origin for the character that everyone can enjoy!,Shazam!
2098,korinarose,Great movie! But...,7,10 December 2019,"So myself and my two boys rather enjoyed this, but is it a kid's movie like portrayed in previews? Too much cussing. Knock off about 2/3 and the Santa throwing bleep F-bombs and it totally would still be a super fun movie for kids and parents alike.",Shazam!
2099,alimakhmase,Disaster!,1,27 June 2019,"This movie is a disaster in Hollywood! I very much regret that I saw this movie. Actually, this is a cartoon!!! How DC decided to burn company with this junk? If you are an adult, i highly recommend you not to see this movie.",Shazam!
2100,leonorbranco-19065,Fun but with no sence,3,5 April 2019,"I hated it, it was kind of fun but really stupid, it makes no sence at all. Captain Marvel was way better and it as a worst rating. Don't watch it's really bad.",Shazam!
2101,giannisapo-50906,OMG...what a joke..an insult!,1,10 April 2019,"Are you guys serious???
I disliked this film from the trailer but i thought that maybe it has some kind of good parts if you watch the whole film..but NO!
Billy as a kid was legit..But as Shazam he was only what i can describe as a parody...
Billy is a serious 15 years old teenager and Shazam is a 7 years old moron..Also his suit is like they tried to make a Shazam cosplay not a real suit....I really don't get the good critics.
This movie is an insult to the comic book Shazam(Captain Marvel)....I really find it difficult to accept how BAD they portrayed this superhero!",Shazam!
2102,terandres-26076,I made an IMDB account just for this movie!,10,11 April 2019,"I hate reviewing movies but Shazam deserves every single positive review it can get. This movie does an excellent job at combining Action, Comedy and a heart warming feel all into one perfect package. Not only is the film great but it's a fun roller coaster from start to finish. Whether you're a hardcore DC fan or a casual viewer you will not be disappointed.
P.S
I'm not a hardcore DC fanboy but after watching this I'll probably become one LOL",Shazam!
2103,travitchi-70373,Epic DC movie,9,29 March 2019,Awesome movie and nice VFX that they made for the movie. This movie is going to let the DCCU raise and be more entertaneous,Shazam!
2104,retteroleila,Exceeded my expectations.,9,6 June 2019,"Fun, light and simple but very entertaining. have a good time with the family seeing this movie and that all about.",Shazam!
2105,qknight-31140,A Fun and Heartwarming Film,8,11 June 2019,"I can't believe I've watched this three times already. It never gets old. The jokes still land, the villain is worse then I remember him being the second and first time I saw it but he is still good, and Shazam? Yeah, that's still a complaint.Every single time Jack Dillon Grazer is on screen, man, the pure joy on my face! He is sooooo good in this. Definitely the MVP of the film. I am looking foreword to seeing him in more movies.Also, Asher Angel's performance is a little meh in the first act. It definitely gets better in the 3rd and 2nd act. But there's one scene towards the beginning of the 3rd act that proved he can be a great actor.And Darla basically steals the show here.I still have the same thoughts on Zachary Levi as Shazam. His performance is good, not great. I still have the complaints about Billy and Shazam acting like different people.But my thoughts on the film didn't change much. But I did like it a little less then before.VERDICT
Shazam is a joyride all the way through and you'll never get bored! I highly recommend it!RATING
8/10 - Great",Shazam!
2106,rrlcv,One of my DC favs!!,10,6 April 2019,"I couldn't take my eyes out of the screen to make sure I wouldn't miss a single bit of the action. It was extremely exciting an captivating from the first to the last second. My emotions were on fire. Amazing work, perfectly well done!!",Shazam!
2107,diarkourehpaz,Its decent,6,14 April 2019,Honestly just another cheesy storyline. Shazam is basically a worse superman that can transform himself.,Shazam!
2108,jockegerbennn,Totally unwatchable,2,3 June 2019,"To begin with the actors are extremly bad, very kliché. The movie has so much potential bud the bad jokes and actors just makes it such a bad watching experience, plus that you can figure out everything that is going to happen with no plot twist.",Shazam!
2109,luisamaolinas,"Very funny, while still having a serious story.",9,14 April 2019,"A solid blend of humour, fantasy and David Sandberg's typical horror, Shazam is great fun with a strong story. Highly recommend.",Shazam!
2110,cottlebrennan,Loved it!,10,16 April 2019,"Absolutely loved it! Great family movie. The entire theater clapped at the end. Great story, acting, action, etc!",Shazam!
2111,fabiorigaud,"At least, it was not completely boring",3,5 April 2019,"At least, it was not completely boring.
But if you seek more, nothing to find there.
It's a kid movie that is too graphic for kids.
After an Aquaman offering a new, original direction and memorable scene, a DC movie completely empty.As a superhero movie, nothing new, nothing impressive and nothing beautiful.
As a comedy, maybe a few laugh, although most jokes are simply references or unoriginal jokes. If you saw the trailers, don't expect anything more: all the jokes were there.The actor playing Billy Batson is quite good and sympathetic but he somehow becomes more stupid and childish when he transforms: let's call him Hazam already, he obviously didn't catch the wisdom of Solomon.The enemy doesn't improve the movie: nothing interesting and the movie contains random monsters that could be in movies from the year 2000.It was already in production when Aquaman was released so hopefully, the shift will come after. The new trailer for the Joker prequel at least gives hope for that.",Shazam!
2112,stevencharmain,Much better from D.C.,7,31 March 2019,Just watched was good funny and definitely worth the watch. But pg rating at the cinema was way to low took my 10 year old deadly sin characters are way too scary for smaller kids please beware. Not sure why but ster kinikor listed as pg 10 pg 13 is more like it,Shazam!
2113,dinomech,Fresh take very enjoyable! More please!,7,7 January 2020,"I watched this long after its release and after all the hype (positive and negative) and found it to be one of the best DC movies so far. It had comedy that actually made me laugh and wasn't trying too hard to be something more than it was. I personally can't wait for the sequel and hope that it is as enjoyable as the first.
The formula just worked.
The actors were great.
I was pleasantly surprised when I watched it and wished I hadn't waited so long before seeing it.
Loved the comedic moments that were timed perfectly with the dramatic moments in a totally fresh portrayal of home life that wasn't the typical fairytale crap that is so often spewed out from the movie industry.
Super fresh.",Shazam!
2114,ramona_maria_dinu,Unexpectedly good!,10,14 April 2019,"I find it in every category of movies! I laughed,i cried, i enjoyed it in every way very much! And it refers to some profound family union! I can't wait for the next movie from this series! Go watch it and learn some important things from within it!",Shazam!
