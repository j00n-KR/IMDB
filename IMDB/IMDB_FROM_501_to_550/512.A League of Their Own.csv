0,bkoganbing,A Home Run,9,23 May 2010,"The story of the women's professional baseball league after almost 40 years after the last game was played comes to the big screen with A League Of Their Own. Though the names are changed and the facts are jumbled, A League Of Their Own celebrates what was a milestone in the feminist movement. Woman's entry into team sports, previously reserved for the male of the species.The film centers around two sisters, Geena Davis and Lori Petty, but a whole lot of women get some great roles in this film. Those who particularly stand out are Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, and Bitty Schram, all members of the Rockford Peaches except for Petty who gets traded to the Racine team.The league was founded by Phil Wrigley played under an alias by Garry Marshall, brother of Penny Marshall. Mr. Wrigley was not the most public of baseball moguls and by all accounts did not have half the personality that Garry Marshall displays. He had some interesting ideas and this was probably the most enduring even though the league eventually folded long after the action in this film is concluded. Read Bill Veeck's book Veeck as in Wreck to get an insight into Mr. Wrigley or some of the various Chicago Cub histories.The character of Jimmie Dugan who Tom Hanks plays is based on Hall of Famer Jimmie Foxx. When I was growing up Foxx was number two on the all time home run list with 535 to Babe Ruth. He was in fact a hard drinking man as Hanks portrays. He was also a mighty man of muscle which Tom Hanks is not. Someone like Joe Piscopo would have looked a whole lot more like Jimmie Foxx. Nevertheless Hanks is brilliant in the role.In those years of Rosie the Riveteer on the World War II homefront, the Women's baseball league was a daring innovation and a radical step forward into women's athletics. Now we have a Women's Basketball League that is doing quite well.Could a woman's baseball league get started again?",A League of Their Own
1,SnoopyStyle,Satisfying and funny time after time,9,5 July 2014,"Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis) is a married milkmaid on the Oregon family farm. It's WWII and the men are all over seas fighting the war including Dottie's husband. Scout Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz) comes to find new talents. He's interested in Dottie but not her sister Kit Keller (Lori Petty). He only takes Kit after Dottie agrees to come. It's a slow start and the girls have the drunken ex-player Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) as their manager. Then Dottie becomes a star and the league begins to be successful. As Dottie gets bigger, Kit gets more jealous and angry at Dottie's shadow holding her back.Director Penny Marshall has created a very satisfying drama. It has some great moments and a few memorable lines. It can be a little bit corny at times but the top rate actors keeps it from going over the edge. Even the duo of Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell can't derail this. Tom Hanks and Geena Davis are simply wonderful providing a solid foundation. The baseball action is mostly just montages of action scenes except the big climatic finale. That's perfectly fine especially since it keeps the action moving. It's a great fun watch time after time.",A League of Their Own
2,Hitchcoc,A Nice Baseball Movie,8,21 October 2015,"This is a feel good movie about a period during the war where women's baseball became popular. It served the purpose of giving entertainment during a very hard time in our history. It also showed the wonderful relationships that developed. Tom Hanks plays the enigmatic coach who has always dealt with men. The subplot involves sisters, where the tall pretty one has seemingly always held sway in the family. This is about growing. This is an opportunity for a new start for one of them. Madonna plays a fun character, full of life and sass. Of course, we are in for a lead up to a significant game where things will get sorted out. It's also an education in a particular sports phenomenon that was short lived but quite interesting. The movie sparkles and Hanks does a great job of suffering through something he is totally unequipped for. Quite delightful.",A League of Their Own
3,classicsoncall,"""There's no crying in baseball!""",8,5 December 2016,"Yes, there really was an All-American Girls Professional Baseball League; it existed from 1943 through 1954, and the Rockford Peaches won four championships over the course of the twelve year run, though not until the third season. Their main opponents in this picture, the Racine Belles, actually beat them to the punch by winning the league title during the very first 1943 season. Kind of makes me wonder why the film makers didn't reverse the teams for the movie, but the Rockford Peaches does sound like a more colorful name.Though the film is a fictionalized version of the women's professional baseball league, it's still pretty entertaining with an interesting cast. Geena Davis probably deserved top billing except for Tom Hanks's star status when the film came out, but that's a small nit-pick. I didn't care much for Hanks's character in most of the early part of the picture, he was just too lewd and crude. What really got my attention though was the brief sidebar about how the formation of the league was responsible for the 'masculinization of women', a theme that might be addressed some day in reverse, with the very apparent 'feminization of men' in the culture today. Not to mention the idea of 'safe spaces' for those of both sexes who find it just a bit too hard to cope with reality when it rears it's ugly head.But I digress. This is an enjoyable little flick for sports and non-sports fans alike. I would like to have seen more of Jon Lovitz as the wise-guy baseball scout; he had the best lines in the story. And Madonna seemed to be appropriately cast as 'dirt in the skirt' Mae Mordabito, who's real talent showed up at Willie's Suds Bucket. One of the more memorable game scenes had Hanks and Davis going at it in that battle of the batting signals when Marla Hooch (Megan Cavanagh) came up to the plate. It preceded Coach Dugan's (Hanks) second best line in the story - ""Way to go, whatever your name is."" Finally, at the risk of offending half the audience here, I think Dottie Hinson (Davis) dropped the ball on purpose. And in keeping with the general tenor of the league's avowed determination to deliver an entertaining and properly respectful entertainment, I thought she did it gracefully and grandly.",A League of Their Own
4,gavin6942,Pretty Fun Little Movie,7,22 August 2015,"Two sisters join the first female professional baseball league and struggle to help it succeed amidst their own growing rivalry.This is Geena Davis in her prime. I mean, not to sell her short, but 1985-1995 was the golden age of Geena, with one hit after another. This is one of those, maybe second only to ""The Fly"". And alongside Lori Petty and Tom Hanks? Priceless.Some may ask, how factual is this? Well, strictly speaking, not very. These are made up characters. But the Rockford Peaches really existed, and there really was a women's baseball league for about a decade. If not for this film, they might be completely forgotten. So, thank you movie!",A League of Their Own
5,lee_eisenberg,"a ""league"" of all nations",7,29 April 2006,"No doubt everyone's heard about Rosie the Riveter, but the women's baseball team seems to not be as well remembered. ""A League of Their Own"" is the story of this team. Various women from all over come to participate, although the movie mostly focuses on Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis), Mae Mordabito (Madonna), and the manager Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks).I've never really been a baseball fan, so maybe I'm not the right person to be reviewing this movie, but I thought that it was pretty well done. There was one particular line that seems to have been thrown in for comic relief (I mean what Jimmy says after getting chewed out by the umpire). But overall, Penny Marshall has shown herself to be very adept as a director, with this and ""Awakenings"". Worth seeing. Also starring Lori Petty, Jon Lovitz, David Strathairn, Bill Pullman, Garry Marshall (the director's brother) and Rosie O'Donnell.",A League of Their Own
6,jboothmillard,A League of Their Own,6,21 July 2006,"I can't remember the entire story, but I do remember that it is based on a true story. Tom Hanks plays Jimmy Dugan, a great baseball player who wants more men on his team, what he actually gets is two women. Golden Globe nominated Geena Davis as Dottie Hinson and Madonna as Mae Mordabito are the two women that could play baseball just as good as any man can. Their personals lives did clash a couple of times (I think) but they did continue to play really well and get to a final championship game. Also starring Lori Petty as Kit Keller, Jon Lovitz as Ernie Capadino, Bill Pullman as Bob Hinson and Rosie O'Donnell as Doris Murphy - 3rd Base. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for Madonna and Shep Pettibone's ""This Used To Be My Playground"". It was number 54 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""There's no crying in baseball!""). Good!",A League of Their Own
7,ccthemovieman-1,Davis Makes It A Winning Picture,8,17 July 2006,"As a sports fan, it's fun to see a film of a little different nature, the case here being women's pro baseball - something that actually took place for a short time during World War II.The best thing going for the film, in my opinion, was a very likable lead character - someone you could really root for - in Geena Davis' character ""Dottie Hinson."" She made the movie, as far as I was concerned as the rest of the cast - although good - was not particularly likable.For instance, Tom Hanks plays a profane, drunken manager, and not a lot of laughs except for famous, ""There is no crying in baseball"" line which has become famous. Then there is the family-friendly Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell. Yikes! Actually, Madonna plays a nice, subdued character and she's okay to watch but, frankly, it's hard for me to warm up to O'Donnell in any role. Just hearing that voice is enough to call 'time out' and stop the game. Many of the men in here are generally pictured as sexist idiots, which is the way left-wing Hollywood likes to portray men.The sad thing is, this is another one of the these Penny Marshall films that ignorant national movie critics call a ""family film."" However, profanity - which includes four blasphemes (even one by Davis which ruined her good-person character image at that point), a two-minute scene of hearing Hanks taking a pee....and other things hardly add up to ""family fare.""However, it is an entertaining adult movie that has a lot of charm to it and is recommended, especially if you're a baseball fan.",A League of Their Own
8,Tweekums,A fun baseball film,8,15 December 2019,"This film is primarily set in 1943. America's men have gone off to war; that includes its baseball players. The leagues owners want to come up with something new to keep the crowds coming so come up with the idea of creating a women's league... although this being 1943 they are referred to as girls. A scout approaches Dottie Hinson, a proficient softball player in Oregon but she will only agree to try out if her younger, keener sister, Kit, can try out too. Together they head to the try-outs where they meet other potential players. They are both selected to play for the Rockford Peaches, a team that is to be managed by former baseball star Jimmy Dugan... who doesn't believe that girls can play baseball and is clearly an alcoholic. As they train and play more games the team coalesces but also faces various problems; not least getting the public to turn up for the games.I found this film to be funny and charming despite not being much of a sports fan. This is down to the characters and certain universal themes. The story moves at a decent pace with the introduction of key characters. Wisely in concentrates and a few main characters rather than trying to give the whole team equal time. The cast do a fine job, most notably Geena Davis, Lori Petty and Tom Hanks as Dottie, Kit and Jimmy. There are also fun performances from Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell amongst others. The scenes during the matches felt real, at least not to my non-expert eyes. There are plenty of laughs but for the most part these are unforced. The only detail of the film that I was unsure about was the way it was top and tailed by scenes set decades later but this is a minor quibble. Overall I'd certainly recommend this film, and not just to baseball fans.",A League of Their Own
9,moonspinner55,Plastic nostalgia...but Geena Davis and Lori Petty are perfectly cast,6,28 August 2007,"A present-day reunion of WWII-era women's league baseball players that brings back fond memories of America's Golden Era to the now-aged ladies who blazed the trail. Director Penny Marshall's nostalgic valentine to war-time tomboys puts the squeeze on us right from the start (with elderly actress Lynn Cartwright dubbed with Geena Davis' voice, to ill effect). Marshall wants to make sure we don't miss any of her hat-tricks, some of which (including a urination gag) that misfire completely. The cast of high-spirited gals (and Tom Hanks as their coach) are alternately lively, wonderful and excruciating. Rosie O'Donnell is a real chore stomping about on the field, but Geena Davis and Lori Petty (as competitive sisters) are genuinely charming, shrewdly cast and nearly flawless (a movie about them alone would be worth watching). The film isn't nearly as hearty as it wants to be (it has a mechanical engine driving it), but the put-on sentiment may hook some. Madonna's supporting performance is one of her least self-conscious, and she contributes a moving song, ""This Used to Be My Playground"". **1/2 from ****",A League of Their Own
10,sunwarrior13,A Great Sports Movie,10,17 October 2012,"A League of Their Own is a film that sheds light on a little-known chapter of American sports history with its story of a struggling team in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. The league was formed when the recruiting of soldiers during World War II resulted in a shortage of men's baseball teams. Directed by Penny Marshall, the film stars Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Tom Hanks, Madonna, and Rosie O'Donnell. The screenplay was written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel from a story by Kim Wilson and Kelly Candaele.The story begins as a candy-bar tycoon enlists agents to scour the country to find women who could play ball. In the backwoods of Oregon, two sisters namely:Dottie and Kit are discovered. Dottie can hit and catch, while Kit can throw a mean fastball. The girls come to Chicago to try out for the team with other prospects that include their soon-to-be- teammates Mae Mordabito, Doris Murphy, and Marla Hooch. The team's owner, Walter Harvey needs someone to coach his team and he picks one- time home-run champion Jimmy Dugan, who is now a broken-down alcoholic. After a few weeks of training, as Dugan sobers up, the team begins to show some promise. By the end of the season, the team has improved to the point where they are competing in the World Series. The movie is one of the year's most cheerful, most relaxed, most easily enjoyable comedies ever released on screen. It's a serious film that's lighter than air, a very funny movie that manages to score a few points for feminism in passing.In addition to that,it serves up good-natured entertainment, if you're in the mood, but be prepared to swallow a generous helping of sickly-sweet sentimentality along with the laughs. Finally,it's a conventional Hollywood sports story but the stellar cast is delightful, and the movie's filled with memorable moments, witty dialogue, and agreeable sentiment.",A League of Their Own

12,hitchcockthelegend,The Drunk and the Babes.,7,2 April 2009,"It's 1943 and Baseball in the states has been decimated by all the men being called up to join the services. Enter the ladies who themselves help to kick start a womens league to keep the Baseball fires burning.The first thing any prospective first time viewer of this piece should note, is that it's not actually a film about Baseball. It's about friendships, challenges and differing off shoots to the complications of war, it just so happens that it's the game of Baseball that brings it all together!Directed by Penny Marshall (Big), screenplay by Lowell Ganz & Babaloo Mandel (City Slickers/Parenthood) and featuring Tom Hanks (wonderful as drunken coach Dugan) as the leading male, it's no surprise that ""A League Of Their Own"" booms with sentiment and no little amount of comedy. It is to me a very rewarding picture, the sort that wants you to chuckle along with it whilst noting the need for human interaction during a troubled time.The lady actors do great impressions of bona fide athletes, asked to parade in short skirts and entertain the watching public, these gals, led by the always engaging Geena Davis, deliver a sparky picture that never veers into maudlin territory. There are of course some sombre moments, but they are placed nicely by Marshall in the context of the films' events, never trite, they serve more as tender vignettes to run alongside the frivolity on offer.Ultimately ""A League Of Their Own"" has achieved its aims come the final credits, its not taxing and its not purporting to be an intelligent look at a period in history. It's asking us the viewers to feel heartened by what we just watched, and just maybe to give those girls back in the 1940s a piece of our respect, job done. 7/10",A League of Their Own
13,grantss,Great movie,9,24 March 2018,"Great movie. More than a baseball movie and more than a girl-power movie, much much more. Very emotional and sentimental, yet often funny too. Great plot. Just when you think it is going to wander down a predictable and trite path, it goes somewhere very unexpected. The ending is superb, and very original. Solid direction by Penny Marshall. The movie doesn't drift for a moment, and there is no surplus footage in the movie. Every moment is used to the fullest.Good performances all round. Geena Davis is great in the lead role. For once, Tom Hanks plays someone who isn't perfect. Good to see him in a more dishevelled, anti-hero role. Good support from Lori Petty, Madonna (surprisingly), Rosie O'Donnell, Jon Lovitz and David Strathairn.A must-see.",A League of Their Own
14,view_and_review,"""All-American""",6,10 April 2020,"1943 World War 2 was going strong and lives all over the world were being affected. One of the many effects of the war was the absence of baseball in America. The All-American Girl Baseball Players League formed to fill the void. These weren't All-American Girl Dolls that my daughters are so fond of, these were actually women that played baseball. The term ""All-American"" is definitely a misnomer considering that they were all white. In fact, their victory song had a stanza in it:""We're the members of the all-American league,we come from cities near and far.We got Canadians, Irish ones, and Swedes.We're all for one, we're one for all, we're all American.""Well thank you for letting us know what All-American means. Besides throwing the good ol' 1940's racism in my face the movie was good. Hanks was great as the drunk manager, Jimmy Dugan. I think he even outdid Walter Matthau's character from ""Bad News Bears."" No other actors or characters compared to him. Dottie (Geena Davis), the co-star, was such the Mary Sue. She was tall, attractive, athletic, and could do everything on the diamond. She did everything but cook dinner while playing. Her sister, Kit (Lori Petty), was all too aware of Dottie's perfection and it rankled her. Their sibling rivalry would eventually come to a head.I don't know anything about the AAGBPL. I'm sure they were all fantastic women and it's cool they got recognized, even if the All-American team was all-exclusive.",A League of Their Own
15,AlsExGal,"Never waste time, never waste an opportunity",9,21 October 2015,"I watched this film for the nth time after many times as part of the ""Trailblazing Women"" series on Turner Classic Movies. After watching the Rosie the Riveter documentary, it really stands out how much women were ""used"" during World War II. They were told how important they were to the war effort. What wasn't emphasized was the transient nature of the situation, that it was ""until the men come back"", so they got used to doing something other than housework if they were married or pretty mind numbing low paying jobs if they were not. The women working in the factories during the war had good paying jobs and some independence for the first times in their lives, the same with the girls in this movie. They not only had good pay, but a place in the limelight, doing something they were good at doing - baseball - with crowds rooting for them, but like Dottie and Kit, they had just been playing as amateurs pre-War. Dottie doesn't want to join the league at first. What Kit says is true - Dotty is the prettier sister, the sister with more baseball talent, and she doesn't want to admit her own competitive spirit until she is given a chance to exercise it, and then that competitiveness somewhat scares her. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Jimmy Dugan, a washed up ball player who drank away the five best years of his career and is recruited to coach the Rockford Peaches. At first he doesn't take this job seriously, but time, a few verbal bouts with Dottie, and a growing attachment to the girls change that. Towards the end of the film he delivers one of the best monologues that I have ever heard about talent, opportunities lost, and the fact that certain moments never come again. I know somebody else wrote these lines, but he delivered them with heart. One line should be emblazoned on everybody's mind - ""If it wasn't hard everyone would do it. The hard is what makes it great."" Don't run away from anything because it is hard.Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell provide great comic relief - they actually had a pretty good off-screen friendship - so their back and forth comes across naturally. Even if you don't like these two individually, I think you'll like them here. It's funny how much women playing ball just offends American society's sensibilities about what is proper for a woman so much that a big part of the girls' training is basically a charm school, and that as players the women actually have curfews and places like bars that are off limits to them due to publicity, as though they were minors or gentle flowers that need protection.And now let me talk about Oregonian sisters Dottie and Kit, specifically Kit. Kit has talent. Kit has beauty. She just doesn't have as much as her sister. She definitely shows the audience how to be both a bad winner and a bad loser and just how much jealousy can make anybody ugly inside and out. And now the debate on the ending - that has been rehashed endlessly. I'll just say what I THINK happened makes me furious, because if I'm right then one person let an entire team down just to give another person who was green with envy a false victory in the hope that it would give them a lifetime of confidence. I know this is just a movie, but envy is a condition that is not cured by an external victory, earned or not. It can only be cured by a person changing their viewpoint, that THEY are responsible for their lives and actions. Give a jealous person one victory today and this time next year it will just be something else they feel is unfair and responsible for their misery.I highly recommend this one. It is almost perfect on every level, even the soundtrack!",A League of Their Own
16,Mr-Fusion,Out of the kitchen and into Cooperstown,8,3 May 2017,"Tom Hanks comes very (*very*) close to stealing ""A League of Their Own"" (he's flippin' hysterical in this) but this has one of those pitch- perfect casts in which everyone just feels like the ideal choice for his/her role; especially Geena Davis and Lori Petty, whose sibling conflict anchors the whole story. Even Madonna does a fantastic job (god knows how much crap I've given her over the years for ""Dick Tracy"", and this would be the spirited counterargument). it may be an unconventional baseball movie with its proud feminist streak, but the sentiment's warm and these are characters I very much enjoyed watching. Plus, the humor's spot-on. When all is said and done, this is thoroughly entertaining.8/10",A League of Their Own
17,SimonJack,Nice fictional film on women's pro baseball league,7,23 May 2015,"""A League of Their Own"" is an enjoyable film about the short stint that women's professional baseball had in the U.S. From 1943 to 1954, there was a professional league that was the brainchild of Chicago chewing gum magnate Philip Wrigley. He and other baseball owners started the league supposedly to keep baseball ""alive"" in the minds of the public during World War II. The thinking was that the sport might die out because so many men who played professional baseball went off to war. The women's league went through a few name changes. In 1943, the All- American Girls Softball League was changed to the All-American Girls Baseball League. The league ranged from four to 10 teams each year and had a total of 15 teams over its 12-year history. It started with four teams, two of which are portrayed playing the first girls baseball world series in 1943 – the Racine Belles and the Rockford Peaches. The movie is a highly fictionalized story of the founding and first year of the league. But it includes a reunion of many of the girls at the National Baseball Hall of Fame when its Women in Baseball exhibit opened on Nov. 5, 1988. Penny Marshal who produced and directed the movie, attended that opening and shot scenes there. The lead character, Dottie Hinson (played by Geena Davis) was said to be a composite of two of the real girl players – Dottie Kamenshek and Pepper Paire Davis. In the movie, Dottie is married and plays just one year until her wounded husband returns from the war. The real Kamenshek, however, began playing when she was 17 and never married. She was considered the best player of the league and led her team, the Rockford Peaches, to four of the 12 series titles. She led the league in many stats. All the rest of the characters in the film were fictional as well, as was the Peaches' manager, Jimmy Dugan, played by Tom Hanks. I suppose Hollywood thought a straight story based mostly on facts and real characters wouldn't be as glamorous or interesting. There's no doubt that Hanks' Jimmy Dugan added some color to the film. But the film does give an accurate portrayal of the training the girls were required to take – off the field. They studied etiquette and manners. And it is a good account of the uniforms and other aspects of the girls professional baseball. The girls teams played mostly at larger towns outside of the major league cities. That also makes the supposed purpose of the league – to keep baseball alive in the minds of the public – suspect. After all, the big leagues (National and American) continued to play ball all during the war. They did suspend play for a couple days after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. But the game went on and each year the World Series games were played at the end of the regular season. For the record, the St Louis Cardinals won the 1942 World Series over the NY Yankees. The Yankees turned the trick the next year against the Cards. Then, the Cards won the 1944 Series over cross-town rivals, the St. Louis Browns. Finally, in 1945 the Detroit Tigers took the Series over the Chicago Cubs. I mention this because a scene sticks in my mind from the 1943 movie, ""Guadalcanal Diary."" William Bendix is a corporal who's listening to a game on the radio and rooting for the Brooklyn Dodgers. There's some talk among the men about the possibility of the Dodgers winning the pennant to play the Yankees in the World Series. That probably was the year of the movie – 1943. The Dodgers finished third that year in the National League, behind Cincinnati and far behind the Cards. Still, one wonders if there might not have been one or more other reasons behind the women's pro baseball league. For starters, how about another venue of wholesome and interesting entertainment for folks back home during the war? Especially since the folks outside the cities didn't often get to see big league games. Remember – this is before television. Then there's always the profit motive. One scene in the film addresses this. The Walter Harvey character (of chewing gum fame – guess who) played by Garry Marshall tells Ira Lowenstein, the league manager, played by David Strathairn, that the league will have to shut down after the first year because it's losing money. Of course, Ira does some things to turn that around, with the help of some of the players. The movie completely dodges one aspect of the girls pro baseball league. That has to do with sizes and distances. The ball they used to start with was the same size as a softball – 12 inches in circumference (compared to the 9-inch baseball). And they pitched it underhanded. The infield was considerably smaller than that of pro baseball. The distance between bases was 65 feet, compared to 90 in baseball. The pitcher's mound was 40 feet from home plate, compared to 60 feet, six inches. As the years went on after the war, the field distances widened and got closer to those of baseball, and by 1948, the ball size was 10 3/8 inches and overhand pitching was allowed. This is an enjoyable film to watch and a nice tribute to women's baseball and sports in general. For more history and an accurate account of the girls pro baseball league, one might visit the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, NY.",A League of Their Own
18,JamesHitchcock,Entertaining look at an obscure piece of sporting history,7,16 May 2004,"Like most Englishmen, I know about as much about baseball as the average American knows about cricket. I am also not a great fan of sporting films in general, although there are a number of exceptions. Despite this, however, I generally love baseball films, of which there were a number of good examples in the late eighties and early nineties. ('Eight Men Out', 'Field of Dreams' and 'The Natural' all spring to mind). There is something about the sport that seems to lend itself to the cinema; perhaps British filmmakers should consider making a film about cricket, as the two sports have a lot in common. During the Second World War many of America's male baseball stars were drafted into the forces, and it appeared that the nation might be deprived of its favourite sport. An entrepreneur therefore had the idea of creating an all-female baseball league. 'A League of their Own' tells the story of some of the women who played in that league. At the centre of the drama is the rivalry between two sisters, Dottie and Kit, who sign for the same team, the Rockford Peaches. The sisters have contrasting characters. Dottie is the more talented player, but Kit is more aggressive and determined to succeed. Kit's aggression and the sibling rivalry between her and Dottie lead to dissension in the team's dressing room, and Kit is traded to a rival team, the Racine Belles. The climax of the film comes when Rockford and Racine meet in the finals of the league championship, with Kit and Dottie on opposite teams. The film has some interesting observations about the social values of the era in which it is set. During this period there was a conflict between traditional views of femininity and the need, caused by wartime conditions, for women to take on what had historically been masculine roles. Before the war, there had been only very limited opportunities for women in professional sport; most sports, such as tennis and athletics, in which women were permitted to compete were strictly amateur. During the war, they were allowed to take part, but were still expected to conform to the ideal of being 'ladylike'. In the film, players are selected as much for their sex appeal as for their talent (Ernie Capadino, the cynical, sexist talent scout, wants to leave one player out of the team because he considers her insufficiently glamorous) and they are required to attend a 'charm school' and to conform to a strict code of sexual morality. Dottie and Kit can be seen as representing the two sides of this conflict. For all her talent, Dottie's heart is not really in professional baseball, and her real wish is to return to her old life as a housewife as soon as her husband returns from the war. Kit, on the other hand, is single, and sees the game as a way of escaping from her previously dull existence. Although Geena Davis was quite good as Dottie, the two best performances came from two actors I had not previously heard of, Jon Lovitz in the cameo role of Ernie Capadino, and Lori Petty as Kit, who brought out the fierce determination and will to win of her character. I am surprised that she has not gone on to become a bigger star than she has. It was interesting to see Madonna (normally found in starring roles) in a supporting role as Mae, one of the Peaches who rebels against the strict moral code.Tom Hanks stars as Jimmy Dugan, the coach of the Rockford Peaches, in a role created largely because the filmmakers felt that they needed a big male star. Dugan was himself a famous baseball player in his time, but his career was wrecked by his heavy drinking. At the beginning of the film, Dugan is played as a figure of fun, making blunders such as urinating in front of the women, but being too drunk to notice or to care. Later on, Dugan sobers up and develops into a mixture of inspirational coach and dispenser of homespun philosophy along the lines of 'There's no crying in baseball'. At neither stage, however, does the film bring out the genuinely tragic aspects of Dugan's fall from grace as a great, or potentially great, athlete ruined by alcoholism. (One can think of modern parallels such as George Best or Diego Maradona). The actor may be at fault here; during the early part of his career Hanks always seemed a limited actor, convincing in 'Mr Nice Guy' roles but unable to portray more unsympathetic characters. ('Bonfire of the Vanities' being another example). There were one or two other things about the film that I did not like. I felt we should have seen more of Kit between her transfer to Racine and her reappearance in the finals. The opening and closing scenes, showing a reunion of the surviving players more than forty years later, did not add much to the story. (They did, however, correct the misleading impression given in the rest of the film that women's professional baseball came to an end with the war; in fact, it survived until 1954). Overall, however, this was an entertaining film, well worth watching. 7/10.",A League of Their Own
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""There's no crying in baseball!""",10,23 November 2003,"A League of their Own, another classic movie that I grew up with. I have to admit it, I'm a girl, I totally fell in love with this movie. But I'm one of the rare girls that loves baseball with a passion, I was raised in a very baseball oriented family, we live in Chicago, we kinda have to enjoy sports, lol. But growing up you wonder why baseball, football, basketball are more for the boys vs. the girls, girls can play but are not famous for it and if they are an athlete are accused of being manly. It's a tough world, but when I was 7 years old A League of their Own was released in theaters, my family saw this movie together and my life changed. Sounds silly, but this was the movie that reminded me to stay strong, at the time when women were expected to stay in the kitchen, as hard as they had to work for it, there was a women's baseball league during WWII. A League of their Own explores this hard but extremely fun time for the girls of the All American Baseball League.When World War II threatens to shut down Major League Baseball, candy manufacturing magnate Walter Harvey decides to create a women's league to make money. Ira Lowenstein is put in charge of public relations and scout Ernie Capadino is sent out to recruit players. Capadino likes what he sees in catcher Dottie Hinson. She's a terrific hitter and he offers her a tryout, but the married woman is content where she is, working in a dairy and on the family farm in Oregon while her husband is away at war. He's less impressed with her younger sister, pitcher Kit Keller, who loves the game passionately but appears to be less talented. He finally lets her come along when she persuades Dottie to give it a try for her sake. When the trio arrive at the tryouts in Chicago, they meet Doris and Mae. They make it onto the team, The Peaches who are managed by drunkard former baseball great Jimmy Dugan. Jimmy initially treats the whole thing as a joke, leaving the managerial duties to Dottie. However, he takes over when he sees how hard and well his team plays. The league attracts little interest at first. With a Life magazine photographer in attendance, he asks them to do something spectacular. When a ball is popped up behind home plate, she catches it while doing splits; the resulting photograph makes the cover of the magazine. More and more people show up and the league becomes a huge success.The acting is absolutely superb, we have actors on top of their game, Tom Hanks who delivers the memorable ""There's no crying in baseball!"" speech. Geena Davis who was a great heroine as the star of the league who just wants her husband home from the war but is hanging onto the league for her little sister's sake. Even Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell are great together and have awesome chemistry as best friends Mae and Doris. This is one of those chick flicks that everyone has to see because it worked on every level. Penny Marshall truly brought out the pain these girls had to go through to be taken seriously. The ending always gets me in tears I have to admit, just knowing that these girls hung in there and stayed strong when everyone told them that girls couldn't play ball, let's hope that one day they'll have the opportunity again.10/10",A League of Their Own
20,MovieAddict2016,An interesting and entertaining study of women's baseball,7,5 September 2005,"I've seen this numerous times on cable over the years. While it isn't a perfect film, it is a nice little enjoyable flick for a Sunday afternoon - you could do worse.When the men were shipped off to fight in World War II, there wasn't anyone left to play baseball. Fearing financial losses, women were hired to fill in for the men's absence - forming major and minor league teams and putting on games like the boys did.This is based on a true story and stars Geena Davis as the main character. Tom Hanks plays her alcoholic coach, who has trouble accepting his position as a women's coach - he kind of resents the idea of coaching females in general.Madonna has a co-star role as one of the baseball players, and it was her name on the credits that really helped make this a success back in '92 - without her it wouldn't have been quite as marketable.The cast is overall pretty good. There are some recognizable faces like Jon Lovitz to add humor to the mix. And the story is well told without coming across as smug.It's not a great movie but if you're in the mood for gentle entertainment, it's a good choice.",A League of Their Own
21,DKosty123,Effectively Simplistic,7,4 September 2007,"This film is very straight forward. It portrays the Women's Professional Baseball League started during World War 2 to fill a need because the men were away at war. It is very effective as entertainment.One thing the film illustrated is when it came out, Cooperstown , New York did not have any display about this history. This movie shamed them into doing one. What is a shame is that Cooperstown has become the moralistic Baseball shrine.In order to present a history of a sport, properly, you have to present all it's greatest players after they retire, regardless of what they did outside of playing. Cooperstown is too high-handed to do that because they have bought into political correctness, lock stock & barrel.A League of Their Own shows what happened & was roundly ignored by these shrews running Cooperstown. They are nice enough in the film to set up a place that didn't exist when the film was made.Geena Davis is great in this film, & attractive. Tom Hanks is perfect as her Manager. Rosie O'Donnell was never better than this film. Even Madonna is OK in this film though she is even better in EVITA. Without a doubt this is Lori Petty's best role as Kit, Geena's sister. As this film was able to change history in Cooperstown, & is very simplistic & watchable, it gets a solid rating.",A League of Their Own
22,Rainey-Dawn,A Film I Should Like But I Don't,5,25 June 2014,"This is another film I should like but I don't. I really can't explain why I have a distaste for the movie. Why don't I like it? It has positive aspects: It's an all-star cast, it has the incredible Tom Hanks in the film, it's about woman power, and it's has quite a few funny moments too. So why do I have a strong distaste for the movie? I like baseball, I like the cast, I like the woman-power idea, I like comedy, I like Tom Hanks and the story is good. What is wrong with me and this film?! I still cannot put my finger on the reason I do not enjoy this movie. I would rather have my teeth pulled than to re-watch this film.I cannot give this movie a bad review because I have nothing but good to say about it. I cannot give this movie a good review because I did not like the film. I guess I will have to say I'm in the middle with this movie.5/10",A League of Their Own
23,sddavis63,A Baseball Coming Of Age Story For Women - But Men Will Enjoy It Too,7,26 February 2002,"There's nothing particularly earth-shattering in this movie, which offers a heavily fictionalized account of the goings on in the ""All American Girls Professional Baseball League"" - a real baseball league formed during the Second World War as a means of keeping interest in the game alive while some of its biggest stars were fighting overseas.There are some good performances to be found here. Tom Hanks - reunited with Director Penny Marshall (they worked together previously on ""Big"") offered his usual high calibre performance as Jimmy Dugan - an alcoholic ex-baseball star who (against his will) is assigned to manage the Rockford Peaches. Geena Davis was great as Dottie Hinson, the Peaches catcher and - as Dugan describes her - ""the best player in the league."" I was also impressed by Lori Petty as Kit Keller, Dottie's little sister. In a relatively brief role through the first half hour or so of the movie, Jon Lovitz was entirely believable as the scout (Ernie Capadino) who discovered Dottie and got her to agree to play. Several other ""big"" names appear - most notably Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell as teammates on the Peaches.The movie is in many ways a coming of age story, with at least three subplots all revolving around the theme. First is Dugan's growth as the Peaches manager. Originally not interested in the team, showing up at games late and drunk, falling asleep in the dugout, he becomes almost fanatical in his desire to see the Peaches win the AAGPBL (now there's a mouthful!) World Series. The relationship between Dottie and Kit gets a lot of attention, as Kit's resentment of living in Dottie's shadow grows and grows throughout the movie. Then there's the story of Marla Hootch (played by Megan Cavanaugh), the homely, shy girl, raised by her widowed father as a tomboy, who - ironically enough - learns how to be a ""lady"" by the time she spends hanging out with ""girl baseball players.""All in all, this is a good story, very entertaining, with good acting and good directing from Penny Marshall, who manages to create a real ""game feel"" in the baseball scenes and keeps us interested in the human interest sidelines without letting them bog us down.7/10.",A League of Their Own
24,ElMaruecan82,A nostalgic trip into a nostalgia-driven movie...,9,29 August 2021,"Penny Marshall's ""A League Of Their Own"" is one of these 90s gems that didn't need 'greatness' to become classics. Those were the days where you could make a film about the pioneering Female Baseball League during WW2, basically a feminist story, and yet without the typical battle-of-sexes agenda that became our millennium's trend: the closest to male antagonists are a stupid heckler and a rich sponsor (played effectively by the director's brother Garry Marshall) who believes there would be no place for women on the big diamond once the boys return from the front.Penny Marshall who had made it 'big' with a film of the same name didn't care about lecturing the audience but rather providing the rather basic ingredients of popular entertainment: comedy with a heart, memorable one-liners, some action and a magnificent finale and by sticking to that simple formula, she made a baseball film even non Americans can appreciate, in fact, she made one of these movies you just can't help liking.The film is remarkably quotable and right now, you probably have in mind a certain scene where Tom Hanks as coach Paul Dugan yells at Evelyn (future Monk's assistant Bitty Schram) because she was crying, for all his manlier-than-thou ball-scratching attitude displayed in the first games, he's baffled that even a woman would cry, his ""There's no crying in baseball!"" resonates like a Gospel truth, baseball is a sport where you can skin your knees, insult the umpire's mother... but God forbid you ever cry! That quote made it in the AFI's Top 100 along with other nuggets such as ""If you build it, he will come"" and ""Who's on First"" but everyone remembers that line and the vocal disbelief of Tom Hanks who sounds strangely like Woody in that very iconic moment. And yet I didn't remember that scene until I saw it again on Youtube.I first saw the film some 24 years ago on a Sunday evening... and before watching it again, I asked myself what scenes did I remembered? There was Paul Dugan's introduction to the team with a urination sequence of epic length, I forgot that Doris (Rosie O'Donnell) asked Mae (Madonna) to stopwatch it. I remember the way Marla (Megan Cavanagh) was shot like five miles away by the newsreel so her lack of glamour wouldn't spoil the sight.. Then I remembered the heartbreaking moment when the postman brings a letter from the Department of War and the way Dugan walks toward his players as if he was the Grim Reaper himself until he laid eyes on poor Betty 'Spaghetti' (Tracy Reiner) who got ""the message"". That scene is so brilliantly directed, from its stressful buildup to its emotional conclusion, it's like a film into a film. Finally, there's that moment during the Hall of Fame celebration where the older Dottie (Lynn Cartwright) met Evelyn's son Stillwell (Mark Horton) and only recognizes him when he says with his childish voice ""you're gonna lose"", I remembered Dottie's shocked reaction, her hand on her mouth realizing what it meant that the little brat who kept annoying them during the trips became that respectable-looking middle-aged man.(And I never realized until now that it was another actress playing Geena Davis's older-self, that's how believable the makeup was)Basically, I remembered the comedy, the tears and the nostalgia, which is what the film is about. And it was a terrific delight to rediscover the rivalry between Dottie and her sister Kit (Lori Petty), Jon Lovitz as the scout who delivers almost 50% of the punchlines and is still believable as the kind of a guy who developed a natural talent for throwing wisecracking retorts like verbal uppercuts ""Sir, you're not nice"" ""Ohh that hurts"". The humor in this film takes mostly place in sarcasm and there are moments where you can feel it 'written' like almost every interaction between O'Donnell and Madonna, but as Ebert said about ""Steel Magnolias"", the film ""is willing to sacrifice its over-all impact for individual moments of humor »And there's Tom Hanks! These 25 years were so full of dramatic turns that I didn't realize how hilarious he was in his 'comedy' period, that moment where he contains his rage and tries so hard not to yell at Evelyn, that he can't stop shaking afterwards with a curious smile as if he was impressed by his own self-control. That moment can tell you why Hanks is the masterstroke of casting: he's both effortlessly funny and damn serious about baseball, he can throw a mitt a poor Stillwell and engages in a manic laugh but he can also tell Dottie that yes, baseball is hard, but ""it's the hard that makes the great"", being a good actor never feels hard when you watch him, and that says a lot in a movie occupied by great talents. Honorable mention to David Straitham who plays the founder of the Female League Ira Lowenstein.The film is far from perfection, the comedy flirts with corniness at times, the way Betty kept talking about her husband didn't make for the most subtle foreshadowing, the bits about Mae's sexual appetites get a little repetitive but it's like all these flaws being swept off by the magic of that finale and Hans Zimmer's music. We've seen all these women playing, laughing, crying, dancing, arguing and interacting when they were young, watching them after a leap of fifty years had me in tears because it felt so relatable, like when I meet old schoolmates only with a smaller time lapse. We never feel the passing of time until we see it from those who shared the earlier chapters of our lives.""A League Of Their Own"" drowned me in the same ocean of nostalgia as the first time I saw it and this is where I understood that like in the best baseball films, baseball is only the grammar with which a more profound message about life is written.",A League of Their Own

26,lesleyharris30,"A Well Acted and Compelling Baseball Drama,",8,30 May 2015,"A League of Their Own is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a very compelling drama with a lot of heart and very likable characters, I'm not sure how historically accurate it really is, but it feels very natural throughout. I felt like it needed more character development from characters outside of Dottie, of course she is the main character and we are going to learn the most about her, but some more development from Jimmy and several female characters would have helped the story progress. The film also has many funny parts, though it isn't purely a comedy, it has several bits that are there for a chuckle and I appreciated this, it dosen't take itself too seriously. A compelling movie with a strong cast, I would recommend A League of Their Own to anyone looking for a good drama or sports film. Two sisters become rivals when they join the first female professional baseball league during World War II. Best Performance: Geena Davis Worst Performance: Madonna",A League of Their Own
27,secondtake,"Some big talent, but a sickly sweet script and direction by Marshall",5,13 September 2015,"A League of Their Own (1992)It's funny, but I remember seeing this when it came out in a tiny theater with an oversized screen in upstate New York, and I really liked it. It seems big and fun, with some great characters, and I was just getting to know Tom Hanks. This time I still loved the fun parts, and with Madonna being silly and Rosie O'Donnell being a crack-up it was worth the look. But it's not an especially good movie. In fact, it's kind of a pastiche of ideas, even though there is a solid historical basis for the plot (the creation of a woman's professional baseball league to replace the men's league during WWII). At times it's trying to be a touching story of young women with real dreams of greatness. Other times it's making hay off the historical quirks, including the sexist madness of it all (without any actual comment on that sexism). Other aspects include a businessman's world mercenary intentions (with David Strathairn as the good guy in that mix). It's cobbled together without a lot of realism—in other words, it's all for entertainment.Which is fine. But then there is the Penny Marshall touch. This famous director/writer has a way of making things as simple and sugary as possible, as if we are all living in a Hallmark commercial. It undermines every single aspect listed above, including the touching part, which is her real goal. By the very end, with the inevitable look at the contemporary women (who are played by actresses, don't be fooled into thinking they are the real deal), it gets moving but in that pushy way that makes you kind of glad the film is finally ending.Too bad. There is more potential here than all that.There is a host of striving baseball movies that fall flat due to sentiment. I like baseball, but movies like ""42"" and ""The Natural"" (and even the recent Clint Eastwood ""Trouble with the Curve"") seem to acknowledge that the sport is something mired in a nostalgic past. Only in something like ""Moneyball"" does it morph into something bigger, and much better. So maybe it's me wanting baseball to be great but also realistic and vivid and intense. Not sticky with honey and amber glows.Yeah, an enjoyable movie on many little levels, including moments of nearly everyone's performances. But don't expect more.",A League of Their Own
28,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,9 April 2019,"A League of Their OwnConsidering all the bats they've swung at their cheating husbands, baseball seems the ideal sport for women.But that line of thinking isn't why the managers in this dramedy decided to add ladies to their roster.With players off fighting Hitler, MLB is put on life-support. It's not until it's suggested that they start a female league that fans return. With manager Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) in the dugout, catcher Dottie (Geena Davis) at home plate and her sister (Lori Petty) on the mound, the Rockford Peaches become darlings of the circuit.Thanks to its colorful characters and amiable script, this adaptation of the real life women's league offers viewers an inside look at this rare act of equality - however short-lived. And while it dips into sentimentality on occasion, it just makes these players more relatable.Furthermore, the only real difference between female and male baseball players is less ass slapping.

29,ironhorse_iv,A great movie to watch at October,7,21 October 2012,"There is no crying in baseball—unless you love baseball and love this movie. This movie based on the book ""Dirt in the Skirt"" tells the fictionalized story account of the real-life All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL) under the team of the Rockford Peaches. The team was created by Chicago Cubs owner Walter Harvey play by Gerry Marshall because World War 2 was slowly destroying the sport due to most of the sport's best male players are fighting in the war. The Rockford Peaches is lead into the season, by manager, alcoholic former baseball player Jimmy Dugan play by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks not only come out to be a likable mean-spirit drunk, but also a funny, sweet guy who just want to see the girls play their best out there. His acting is superb and his comedy side is just funny. He just steals the scenes, when he featured. Geena Davis plays Dottie Hitson, one of the Peaches best players who leads the team when Jimmy Dugan fails to do. The team is made up with kid sister pitcher Kit Keller (Lori Kerry) who has always be over looked due to Dottie's over success. ""All the Way"" Mae Mordabito played by Madonna (in her very best role, playing herself), a taxi dancer. Doris Murphy (Rosie O'Donnell) a tough- New Yorker type. There is soft-spoken right fielder Evelyn Gardner play by ""Bitty"" Schram. In one key scene, Jimmy Dugan and Evelyn Gardner just go at it, and you can't help yourself crying out laughing. The team must do their best, not only to win the games but will the hearts and minds of the fans. Until this movie cames along , I had no idea that there had been a professional women's baseball team . Kudos to director Penny Marshall for making this film and shining a lovely little light on this country's history in women' s sports. Though women's sports maybe overlooked, these women were trailblazers in establishing women's leagues that are still up and running in our present time. It's a truly tremendous film, a classic, timeless and nostalgic. The most poignant moments in this movie is when at the end, when the story comes back to the present, the winners and losers don't seem so important today. It was just playing the game and the life long bond it created between the players.",A League of Their Own
30,zkonedog,Slow Beginning Builds To A Great Conclusion,7,10 March 2017,"For a long time, ""A League of Their Own"" was one of those movies that I had never watched all the way through. Of course, I knew the iconic ""No crying in baseball!"" quote, but I had just never sat down and experienced the whole thing. What I found upon doing that is a movie that starts off quite slowly and seems a bit ""low-rent"", but then builds and builds to an emotional experience and ending.For a basic plot summary, ""League"" tells the story of of the Rockford Peaches, a team in the first ever Women's Professional Baseball League (organized during WWII with most of the men professionals overseas). It focuses primarily on the contentious relationship between sisters Dottie (Geena Davis) and Kit (Lori Petty), as well as featuring some great banter between characters played by Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna. Of course, overseeing it all is manager Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), a boozy former pro charged with ""leading"" the Peaches.For the first 20-30 minutes or so, it is very easy to get bored by this movie. If not outright bored, then surely a bit wary of what looks to be a rather low-rent experience. It seems like something one would find in a made-for-TV movie. As soon as Hanks' Dugan is introduced, however, everything starts to come together. By the end of the film, I can also guaranteed you'll be moved emotionally...a far cry from what it looks like in the early goings.It helps that the acting is generally quite solid throughout. Madona and O'Donnell play the perfect roles for their types, while Davis easily has the acting chops to carry the whole thing. Hanks, as usual, is brilliant throughout, providing the funniest lines of the film (including that one iconic one, of course).I wish the film would have taken itself a bit more seriously, but I can't really blame it for being a product of its times. In today's culture, I think a bit more care would have been taken in telling these women's stories (instead of so much tongue-in-cheek, almost goofy setups), but that wasn't the case in 1992.Overall, ""A League Of Their Own"" is a solid movie, if not grand enough to be spectacular. It might be a little tough to get into because of the slow start out of the gate, but it truly does a remarkable job of building up steam and ending on a very emotional high.

The movie is more about Geena Davis and Tom Hanks; Honestly i expected the movie to be enjoyable all the more that the 40s period is well done but however, it is not he case: the pace is terribly dull, Hanks is really not cool here and there is not much good scenes...

The film also stars Madonna,Geena Davis(from Stuart Little franchise),Bill Pullman(from While You Were Sleeping and teamed up with Tom Hanks a year after this film was made for Sleepless In Seattle),and Rosie O Donnell(also in Sleepless in Seattle as Meg Ryan's BFF).The movie is based on the fictional story of an All American Girls Professional Baseball Tournament and tells the tale of a group of women(one led by Genna Davis who is an excellent baseball player btw) who's husbands are out during World War II and they join a baseball tournament where Tom Hanks's character Jimmy Duggan trains them for baseball. They of course have to battle it out with other professional baseball players to see will they go further in their team and win the tournament, but can they win the tournament in 1943?The film is set in 1943 and its been told in flashbacks since the film is taken place in 1992 and 1943 where we see an old Dottie(now played by Lynn Cartwright,while the younger version of her is played by Genna Davis)who visits her old buddies since her husband passed away and she quit the tournament a long time ago and we see her at the grand opening of a museum about their lives and on the All American Girl's Professional Baseball Tournament near the end of the film which was pretty interesting.Bottom line I enjoyed this movie as it tells you that it doesn't matter what gender you are you can do anything and also you can play baseball at any gender. Also the supporting cast is great and Tom Hanks was great in this movie as I consider him a very good actor as any film he is in he delivers his performances very well in each role he does. The movie also has some very funny moments and some touching moments too.Overall its a 7/10Also keep an eye out for Garry Marshall who stars in this movie too.

The talent is there, with strong support from Tom Hanks, Jon Lovitz and Madonna, though their roles frequently edge near the cartoonish. Some are able to pull that off - Lovitz has been making bread with such exaggerated characters for years - but others, like Rosie O'Donnell's stereotypical feisty Jersey girl, aren't as adept.

Geena Davis, Madonna and Lori Petty give solid performances, whilst Tom Hanks is his comedic best and Rosie O'Donnell is a pleasant surprise.The story remains interesting for the most part and is potentially moving, but the good early comedy dies out too soon.

41,MrFilmAndTelevisionShow,A League of Their Own,9,4 May 2021,"This is a very great film, a classic Tom Hanks film too, amazing performances from all from Hanks to Madonna. Although the people who rate films do not agree with me, Tom Hanks has consistantly appeared in really good films from the beginning of his career in 1980. Some films were not great but they were all at the very least good, and worth far more than the IMDb score they recieved.",A League of Their Own
42,Boyo-2,'Can't we do both?',8,11 July 2002,"Above line is from a very funny scene in the movie where a youngster does Dottie Hinson a favor.  He wants her to 'make a man outta him' and she offers 'how about I just slap you around for awhile?' and that is his response.  Its also appropriate because director Penny Marshall seems to want to make a nostalgic womens baseball movie but also a comedy, a drama, a statement and a tribute.  She is mostly very successful.  Geena Davis gives her best performance as Dottie, the 'Queen of Diamonds', a catcher with natural baseball skills who does not take the game that seriously to begin with.  Her rivalry with her sister Kit (Lori Petty) is believable to start with but gets to be an annoyance after awhile. 
Both of them are much more successful than Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna, who are both pretty bad.  Its embarrassing to see Madonna try to have a dramatic moment and blow it.  Rosie gets a laugh or two but is mostly around because she looks like a girl who might have played baseball when it was unfashionable.  Tom Hanks is excellent as Jimmy Dugan, a former player who developed a drinking problem and had to leave the game before he was really ready to. His ex-boss, Walter Harvey (Garry Marshall) gives him the job coaching in the new girls league which he reluctantly accepts.  Movie has many memorable moments - the 'there's no crying in baseball' scene; Dottie's dry humor, especially in response to the most obnoxious child in movie history, who is named 'Stillwell Angel'; and Jimmy's drunken entrance in which he relieves himself in front of all the girls.
Director makes note of the fact that black women were omitted just as their male counterparts were, that some women were never educated properly or even taken seriously on many different levels.  It seems a little inappropriate that she did not explore any girl/girl themes, which of course existed as well.  Also the movie is grossly unfair to Marla, who hits like Ted Williams but does not have physical beauty on her side.  She is originally rejected by scout Jon Lovitz (he's a riot in the fifteen minutes you see him) and then is made fun of some more at a 'beauty' school the girls are inexplicably sent to.  She meets a nice guy and gets married so at least she gets a happy ending.  Nostalgic movie hits mostly homers.  8/10.",A League of Their Own
43,aidanratesmovies,"What could have been a great film, is nothing less than a decent one with some great moments",7,15 April 2020,"There are several great things about A League of Their Own, but what's so frustrating about the film is that it is not great itself. The film is mostly entertaining throughout its longer runtime, is home to many great performances, and fabulously directed by Penny Marshall. So you may wonder, what can be the issue? To start off, I will begin with the script. The film is messy on how it tells its own story, and even worse its formulaic while doing so, providing such an average plotline for such a unique film. The film can be frustrating to watch at times as it has trouble deciding which tone it wants to hold and which tone it is in. The film can also be rather predictable at times, and it makes the thrill of the game and the film die down far more than it could have. Several things I love about this film have to do with the atmosphere, which is beautifully handled from Penny Marshall throughout the films run. Tom Hanks and Geena Davis give some great performances, and also a notable performance from Lori Petty as Kit, but sadly her character seems criminally undermined, and her performance didn't have nearly as much a chance to shine as it could have. In the end, A League of Their Own has plenty of sloppy moments that hold it back from being a great film, but plenty of great qualities to make it worth a watch. It's potential may be undermined, but when it shines, it can be one thrilling time, and by its end, its ultimate sweet nostalgic nature will be sure to put a smile on your face.

44,a_chinn,Endearing baseball comedy still holds up,8,11 July 2021,"This was another film in my kids' pandemic Film Appreciation Course and they gave this one a thumbs up. You all know the story, loosely based on real female athletes who formed a women's baseball league after the majors shut down at the outset of World War II. The film tackles sexism, corporate greed, and also an appreciation for America's pastime, baseball. It does all this in a rather maudlin and at times corny fashion, but it's a pretty irresistible story and with a pretty stellar cast, which includes Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, Anne Ramsay, Janet Jones, Téa Leoni, Harry Shearer, David Strathairn, Garry Marshall, Jon Lovitz, Bill Pullman, Eddie Jone, Don S. Davis, Del Close, and Tom Hanks, who steals the show as the team manager, a washed up ball player who's simply paid to wave to the crowd at the start of each game. With that cast and being directed by Penny Marshall (""Big"" ""Awakenings"") and written by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (""City Slickers"" ""Splash"" ""Parenthood""), it's hard to see how this film wouldn't work. Although cloying at times, ""A League of Their Own"" is a must see comedy/drama.",A League of Their Own

It was great fun at certain points and a wonderful empowering film for people, particularly female athletes. My problem is I just couldn't get into this all that much. I am not a baseball fan and generally do not watch sports movies(although there ARE exceptions, mainly Field of Dreams.) But to me, this movie had no crossover appeal. It's focuses are baseball and slapstick. It's hard to love it if your not a baseball fan or a fan of this particular brand of humor(a lot of slapstick). While I think the acting was great and the the movie very well made as well and was a tearjerker, I simply did not become involved at all. Because I don't really get into slapstick humer I didn't laugh all that much. Likewise, I am not into baseball so I was a little bored at times. Although, I can understand the positives in this, it's simply not a movie that had any of the elements that for me, would make this unforgettable.",A League of Their Own
46,EdgarST,Rosie Goes to the Ball Game,6,3 August 2013,"As ""Hoosiers"" did with basketball, this sort of comic melodrama does the same with baseball, turning another personal story into a case of ""All-Americanism"", often incurring in cheap flag-waving and sometimes verging on chauvinism, but (as ""Hoosiers"") it was also crowned by the U.S. Congress as part of the National Film Registry. Sentimentality overrules everything else in this film that tells the story of two sisters who play professional baseball for the AAGPBL during World War II: Geena Davis is the natural sportswoman; while Lori Petty plays the sister who has to try harder to become a good player. You have seen this story many times before -there are no great innovations story wise, and it even includes the ""classic"" climatic game in which the two sisters/brothers/buddies, etcetera, play in opposite teams-, but real history saves the day, for if you frame the plot within the lives of the over 600 women who played baseball during that war, the film becomes something else, something bigger. Tom Hanks received top billing but he was only there to ""add spice"" (as the clichéd former sports star turned into an alcoholic), and Madonna had little else to do but play her alter ego version of the 1940s. Not in the league of the outstanding documentary ""The Life and Times of Rosie, the Riveter"" (also included in the Registry), but attractive enough to keep you (at least) amused, and make you shed a few little tears.",A League of Their Own
47,nycritic,When Women Took a Sports and Made it Theirs,9,16 June 2006,"Unless you're a history buff you may not know that there was a women's baseball league -- the All American Girls' Professional Baseball League, formed in 1943 -- and while the men were away fighting the war in Europe these women kept the spirit alive by playing an game that has become part of Americana. Itself a sports version of SWING SHIFT, A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is a sentimental journey back in time to when all this was taking place and it seemed that women would also claim this as their own sports in a male-dominated world. (They didn't, but it was good while it lasted.)The story of how these very different women came together from all areas of the country, played under the tutelage of Jimmy Dugan, a one-time baseball hero who was now going through his own bad patch as an alcoholic, is the basis for Penny Marshall's movie. Focusing mainly on Dottie Hinson and Kit Keller, sisters living in Oregon who become a part of this team but due to Kit's hotheaded temper, eventually become estranged and playing opposite teams, the movie in itself becomes an interesting view of how cutthroat woman can be in the sports arena, but also, how a sisterhood can thrive in the face of a horror that hovers over like an invisible cloud.With performances by Geena Davis (then at the top of her movie career, going from hit to hit to hit), Lori Petty, Tom Hanks (on the cusp of Oscar greatness and still in his boyish mode), Jon Lovitz, Rosie O'Donnell (playing herself, much the case in all of the movies she's appeared in), Madonna (actually able to act), David Strathairn, and Bill Pullman in a small but crucial part as Bob Hinson, A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN is the equivalent of sitting back and taking a good look at your high-school yearbook and reminiscing.

49,eric262003,Stands in a League of Of Its Own,9,28 April 2014,"Yes I know everybody continually uses that classic line from Tom Hanks, ""there's no crying in baseball."" Well after watching ""A League of Their Own"", I can't help but shedding tears of joy. It's surely one of those films that will leave you awestruck in how good it is while at the same time, it will also leave your heart fluttering with ecstatic and joy once the end credits roll.Set in the year 1943,the heart and soul of WWII where all the male athletes went off to war to take down Hitler and his band of Nazis. The baseball association trying to keep up with America's pastime, goes off on a scouting female ballplayers to fill the void. It looked very doubtful at first with tickets not selling and it looked as the though the MLB was going to go on strike. But after seeing just how talented these ladies are, marketing started to take notice. And as they say, the rest is history. The central focus on the story is on two sisters, Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis) and Kit Keller (Lori Petty) who join the team the Rockford Peaches and the trials and tribulations the team face and the sibling rivalry that comes with it.On the whole, the casting was phenomenal. The ensemble excels well in their respected roles and from the looks of things, the girls truly love and know their baseball. Tom Hanks shines in one of his last light-hearted films before he turned a new chapter in his career to play more serious Oscar winning film. He was hilarious as former slugger turned alcoholic wash-up who takes up the initiative to manage the girls to the World Series against the Racine. I can even tolerate the scene where he urinates for five minutes. Davis turns in her best performance as Dottie. She had the right attitude and even believable that she had her share of flaws. She had her squabbles with her sister, but what sibling hasn't fought with each other? Petty was equally poignant as the younger sibling Kit who never felt comfortable being perpetually usurped by her older sister. And that feeling has the same effects other younger siblings face in their lifetime. The only two performers that didn't sit well for me were from Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell as center-fielder Mae Mordabito and 3B Doris Murphy respectfully. Sure they were manageable as tough New Yorkers, but I think they casted because of their celebrity status rather than their ability to act.I'm kind of a fan of sports movies, especially if it's an underdog story. In this case it was the entire female baseball teams. They struggled to grab the medias attention and to be taken seriously. I was also fascinated by the stories that the ladies had about their husbands going off to war. These stories itself sales as the grief these ladies have will also have an impact on the audience. That being said, this movie goes beyond the parameters of an all-girls baseball team, in which a non-sports fan can indulge in.The sets, props and costumes were really apropos to the time period. The cars, the clothes and the colloquial period language are what I would expect from the war laden era of the 1940's. The score also sets the tone to the time period this movie is set in. It shows that the crew was doing their research when they made this movie. Hats off to the crew.This movie was everything you'd want it to be. It had drama, humor, nostalgia, sports and most of all inspiration. This is truly one movie that has hit a homer in our hearts.",A League of Their Own

Fictional tale with a ""true story"" backdrop, centering on pitcher-catcher sisters (Davis, Petty) and a drunken former major leaguer acting as manager (Hanks). Endearingly likable and often entertaining, with a solid lead performance by Davis, though its feminine celebration could've been sold better if the scene-stealing work wasn't done almost exclusively by the two funnymen (Hanks, plus Lovitz as a hysterically disparaging talent scout). The sibling rivalry stuff is overly familiar, but the interplay between all the players has a sweet and sentimental authenticity to it, and Hanks hitting a loudmouth brat in the face with a baseball glove will never not be great.

52,DeeNine-2,"Stylish, warm and fun to watch",9,20 July 2004,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This movie is about ten times better than it has any right to be considering how sappy director Penny Marshall could have been tempted to make it, and how phony is the actual baseball played by the young women. (More on this below.)What makes it work are fine performances by Geena Davis as catcher Dottie Hinson, ""the best player in the league,"" and Lori Petty as her younger sister, Kit Keller. Geena Davis absolutely looks the part with her cool confidence and stately figure while Lori Petty is scrappy and believable as the little sister whose puck and determination set the stage for a sister-rivalry climax at the end.Jon Lovitz as Ernie Capadino, the baseball talent scout, is a crackup as he delivers just about all the best one liners. (Example: he's watching Dottie and Kit milk the cows and asks, ""Doesn't that hurt them?"" Geena shrugs for the city slicker, ""They don't seem to mind."" Ernie thinks about it and then says, ""Well, it would bruise the heck out of me,"" which was doubly funny since he has his anatomy confused.) But the guy who really holds the whole thing together is Tom Hanks as one-time home run king Jimmy Dugan, who is now the Rockford Peaches' alcoholic manager. I have seen Tom Hanks in a number of films, but I don't think he was ever any better than he is here. His transformation from a crude, uncaring drunk to the team's hard-nosed but soft-hearted leader is very well and believably done. And Hanks was never more charming and seldom funnier.Just as good as the work of the fine cast is Marshall's clear, old-fashioned direction. In many ways this film is a throwback to an earlier time when films set out to warm the hearts of the audience and uplift their spirits. Sure, there is evil in the world and you can't win them all, but you can try, is what this film makes us feel, and if you do, something good will happen. There is of course a somewhat self-conscious retrospective look at the sorry political and social state of women sixty years ago, but Marshall does not wallow in the politics. Instead she emphasizes a fun-to-watch tale with real human characters. The unpredictable, but believable ending was very agreeable.Okay now to some of the problems with the ""baseball."" Notice that we first see Kit as a softball pitcher. How she made the transition from throwing underhanded to being one of the best overhand hardball throwers in the league in just a few months is...well, doubtful. And the outfits they wore!Ever try to slide into second trying to break up the double play without sliding pads or even jersey pants? I don't think so. The girls were bare-legged. To Marshall's credit she does show one girl with a huge strawberry bruise on her thigh. Furthermore for those viewers who have actually played baseball, the way many of the young women threw and caught the ball was again, shall we say, doubtful. Marshall employed as extras some young ladies who could actually play a little and we see some shots of their style and grace, but the only star who could even pretend to play at that level would be Rosie O'Donnell. Madonna has some athletic ability, but to imagine her patrolling center field and hauling down long drives strains credibility.Okay, so what? If we put Tom Hanks at bat against even the most mediocre of Class A pitchers, it would be obvious that he is no home run king. In fact, I think Penny Marshall did a great job of creating and maintaining the illusion of Big League skills for the players so that we were not distracted from the story itself. Skillful editing helped.By the way, if they gave Academy Awards for a performance in a role short of a supporting role but longer than a cameo (and maybe they should), Megan Cavanagh would have won it for her touching impersonation of Marla Hooch, a painfully shy and vulnerable, less than pretty girl from the farm who finds herself as a baseball player in the city as she steals some guy's heart with an unselfconscious, boozy, off-key torch song. I also loved the scene where she is rocketing line drives off the walls and through the windows of the high school gymnasium.Note the appearance of David L. Lander as the radio play-by-play guy. He's best known as the wacky/creepy ""Squiggy"" Squiggman from the old Laverne and Shirley TV sit-com. Here he plays it mostly straight but does get to wear his hat with the bill up as Leo Gorcey did in the East Side Kids (AKA The Bowery Boys) movies from the early forties.Bottom line here: Uplifting, fun, and even worth seeing again.",A League of Their Own
53,hnt_dnl,Tom Hanks steals the show!,8,26 June 2016,"Well-directed by the reliable Penny Marshall, A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN (1992) is an entertaining, fun baseball movie about WOMEN'S baseball! Based on a true story of a women's league formed to keep the sport going while Major League ball was suspended during WWII, this nifty period piece does a solid job of evoking a time and place. And, yes, even though the film is populated by and stars mostly female characters, it is really a MALE character that owns this movie! The great Tom Hanks plays alcoholic, down-on-his-luck, former baseball player Jimmy Dugan who is tasked to manage the film's central baseball team, the Rockford Peaches, led by the team's best player catcher Dottie Hinson (well played by Geena Davis) and her fiery younger sister pitcher Kit Keller (wonderfully played by Lori Petty). Dottie is a war wife as her husband (played by the reliable Bill Pullman) is off to war and living on her parents' farm with little sis Kit.The film's opening sequence shows the modern-day older Peaches reminiscing about their 1940s escapades. Then it flashes back to Dottie and Kit on the farm approached by a recruiter (played by a scene-stealing Jon Lovitz) to the newly formed women's league. Along the way, they pick up another recruit, the homely slugging phenom Marla Hooch (hilariously played by Megan Cavanagh). Upon arrival at the baseball camp in Chicago, the trio meet up with the future teammates third-baseman Doris (played with the typical comic bravado by Rosie O'Donnell) and her best friend center-fielder Mae (played by Madonna, who is just kind of there). Rounding out the engaging cast of Peaches are first baseman Helen Haley (played by the funny Anne Ramsay), outfielders Betty 'Spaghetti' (played by feisty Tracy Reiner), Shirley Baker (strongly played by Ann Cusack), and the hilarious Evelyn Gardner (played by another scene-stealer Bitty Schram), who has her precocious son Stilwell (scene-stealing lad Justin Scheller), who lives to aggravate Jimmy! LOL Other notable cast members are Garry Marshall (Penny's brother) playing the de facto commissioner of the women's league, and his right hand man, played earnestly by David Strathairn, who push to market the league and get it going.The over-arching storyline of the movie is a bit too predictable and sentimental for my taste. The Dottie-Kit rivalry is at the forefront, but really pales to all of the hilarious scene-stealing turns by most of the supporting cast. Other than Hanks' iconic performance as Jimmy Dugan with his famous 'no crying in baseball' speech, the best characters are really played by the unknown/lesser known actors: Marla, Evelyn, Stilwell, in particular, as well as the other no-name cast members. Davis, while professional, is a bit too mannered in her role, and gets upstaged by at least half the cast! Petty, while playing the more lively role, is a bit too abrasive at times. Their sibling rivalry kind of takes a backseat to the scene-stealing supporting cast. O'Donnell is actually pretty good, but ironically not the comic standout in this movie. And, as previously mentioned, I have no idea what Madonna is doing in this! Easily the most useless role.Even though Davis is the nominal star, it is really Hanks who owns this movie! I know everyone fawns over Hanks' first Oscar-winning role in 'Philadelphia', but in my opinion, Mr. Hanks first Oscar should have been for this movie! Ironically, Hanks has top billing over Davis, but I would think he would have been nominated Best Supporting Actor. He didn't even get nominated! Even though he has 2 Oscar wins on his resume and several other nods, I still think this was a great oversight by the Academy. So, remember folks, 'Philadelphia' didn't put Hanks in the big leagues in terms of acting, 'A League of Their Own' did! And it didn't take overly emotional crying scenes of sentimentality to be a great performance!",A League of Their Own
54,classicalsteve,Generally Enjoyable But Inconsistent Period-Comedy About A Fascinating Episode of American Life,7,18 March 2017,"Prior to 1940, the United States economy mostly thrived on the shoulders of the working male. Males were the bread-winners, as they say, and worked for a variety of different companies in many different positions. While we think of these jobs predominantly in factories or in offices, sports players were also employees. Prior to the 1970's, baseball players were similar to employees even though they did make wages several times the national average but not nearly what they make in the 21st century. So what happens when a huge percentage of the working population of males had to leave the United States and fight the Nazis in Europe or the Japanese in the Pacific? Other people had to take those jobs, leading to the rise of ""Rosy the Riveter"" and other jobs for females. And it also happened in baseball with the rise of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League.""A League of Their Own"" tells the quasi-fictionalized/quasi-historical tale of one of the teams of the league, the Rockford Peaches. While there was definitely a Rockford Peaches and their rivals, the Racine Belles, the characters are largely fictitious. The only character inspired by a real person is Dorothy ""Dottie"" Hinson played by Geena Davis, loosely based on real-life baseball player Dorothy ""Dottie"" Kamenshek. The other characters, particularly those played by Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell are entirely fictional but give relatively good examples of what some of the girls who actually played may have been like. Madonna in particular was a good casting choice, allowing her to do what she does best as a sexy baseball outfielder. How the film compares to the actual history we'll explore later.The film begins with Geena Davis and Lori Petty as Kit Keller playing in a softball game viewed by a scout, played with typical obnoxiousness by John Lovitz. He convinces them to tryout for the women's baseball league in Chicago. They go by train and there at Cubs field meet other aspiring recruits, including ""All the Way"" Mae Mordabito (Madonna) and Doris Murphy (Rosie O'Donnell). Their ""manager"" is down-on-his-luck former baseball home-run hitter Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks). They end up on the Rockford Peaches and become one of the best teams in the league. One aspect which was very true: the league didn't want ""butch""/Sadie Hawkins types on the teams. They desired women who still exuded femininity even when playing the rough and dirty game of baseball. While this attitude is certainly disapproved of in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it was very real in the 1940's. They were also told no booze and no men. There is a scene where they ""escape"" the confines of the dorms and party which probably did happen.The film is mostly enjoyable but seemed very uneven in the comedy versus drama department. A few bits seemed more like scraps from unused Saturday Night Live sketches, such as when Hanks enters the locker room and uses the ""facilities"" in front of the girls, and this is supposed to be 1943! Another was a kid of one of the girls who was so over-the-top in the misbehavior department, with chocolate all over his face, I wanted to spank the screenwriter! I thought there might be a scene where one of the women puts him in his place but it doesn't happen until about 9/10's through the film. This character should been axed as it served no purpose. Also, some of Hanks' drunken episodes were too over-the-top to be believable.The film suffers from two main problems. The first was it couldn't decide if it was going to be a straight slapstick comedy or a relatively honest look at one of the most interesting cultural phenomenons which was a piece in a larger puzzle which changed the role of women in American society and culture. Many of the daughters of these women would eventually fuel the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1970's. However the film's desperate need to be ""funny"" overshadowed some of the larger points about the social roles of women. The other is the lacking historical accuracy; Hollywood really missed out on a golden opportunity. Women who were part of the actual AAGPBL give the film about 30% accuracy. What was most disappointing was reading about the real ""Dottie"" Dorothy Kamenshek. Kamenshek was considered to be such an effective player, she was actually considered for recruitment for MLB. One of the managers of the MLB thought she was the best athlete he had ever seen among both men and women. Instead, the filmmakers decided to water-down Davis' attitude towards the game even though her character's accomplishments mirror that of the real Dottie. The real Dottie played for about 10 seasons and she won batting titles. Without giving anything away the destiny of Davis' character by the end of the film is completely different. This league and other institutions in which women participated in nearly identical roles as men changed the United States. However, the film emphasized more of the comedy and less of that aspect. Sort of a B or a B+ at best but could have been quite a compelling contribution to the world of sports films. Instead it's a decent movie with some interesting dramatic moments punctuated by silly comedy.",A League of Their Own
55,bankofmarquis,My favorite baseball film of all time,9,26 May 2020,"I am a big fan of movies. I am a big fan of baseball. So, inevitably, I get asked what my favorite baseball movie is - and my answer surprises many. Beyond a doubt, my favorite baseball movie is the 1992 comedy A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN, directed by Penny Marshall and starring Geena Davis and Tom Hanks.I just rewatched this film (for the umpteenth time) and it still works very, very well.Set during WWII, A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN tells the story of the All American Girls Professional Baseball League - set up by owners of Major League baseball as many, many of the male professional baseball players were overseas fighting in the war.Set up as a sibling rivalry story between star player Dottie Henson (Geena Davis) and her kid sister Kit (Lori Petty) who is always in Dottie's shadow, ALOTO shows the start-up of the league, the initial reluctance of the general public to embrace it and the eventual winning over of those that mocked it by actually playing good, hard-nosed ball.This indifference (turned to acceptance) of this league is shown through the eyes of alcoholic, former Major League star Jimmy Dugan (a pre-Oscars Tom Hanks). After a strong 1980's in film, the first part of the 1990's was not kind to Hanks (JOE vs. THE VOLCANO tanked and the less that can be said about BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES the better). This film was considered a bit of a ""comeback"" film for him and he came back very, very well. His Jimmy Dugan is irascible, vulgar and angry but has a good heart that shines through. It was this role that would catapult Hanks into SuperStardom later in this decade (with films like PHILADELPHIA, FOREST GUMP, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, APOLLO 13 and THE GREEN MILE). So, remember, without Jimmy Duggan, their probably would not be a Woody from TOY STORY (at least not a Woody voiced by Hanks).Geena Davis is strong in the lead role of Dottie. Davis is a natural athlete and a very intelligent individual (she was a semi-finalist for the U.S. Olympic Archery team and is a member of MENSA) and both attributes shine through in her portrayal of Dottie. She is strong, graceful and sure-headed in her approach to her goal - to be the best at what she is currently doing. The pairing of Davis and Hanks is interesting for you see great chemistry between these two characters - 2 characters that are compatriots and, perhaps, friends, but...which is unusual in a film such as this...NOT love interests for each other.Faring less well in this film is Lori Petty as kid sister Kit who just wants a chance to get out from under her sister's shadow. I don't blame Petty's performance - she does the best she can with the material she is given, but her character is ""whiny, pouty and shouty"" throughout the film and was just not someone I cared about.That cannot be said for the strong list of actresses that were cast as members of the Rockford Peaches - the team that Dottie and Kit play for (and that Jimmy Dugan manages). Director Penny Marshall insisted that all of the women cast actually be able to play baseball, so cut many, many good actresses that just couldn't be believed as baseball players. Madonna (of all people) shows a passable ability to play ball - as well as a winning personality as ""All the Way"" Mae, the team's centerfielder. In her first film role, Rosie O'Donnell almost steals the film as loud Long Island 3b Doris Murphy. Megan Cavanagh (2b Marla Hooch), Tracy Reiner (LF/P Betty ""Spaghetti"" Horn), Bitty Schram (RF Evelyn Gardner who was the cryer in the ""there's no crying in baseball"" scene), Ann Cusack (illiterate OF Shirley Baker), Anne Ramsey (1B Helen Haley) and Freddie Simpson (SS/P Ellen Sue Gotlander) all make a believably passable group of ballplayers that you want to spend time with.Special notice needs to be made to the always dependable David Strathairn (as Ira Lowenstein - the guiding light to this league) and Jon Lovitz (who is the star of the first 1/4 of this film as Scout Ernie Capadino). They both bring needed life to moments of the film when it need it the most.All of these elements are brought together wonderfully by the smart, thoughtful and emotionally rich direction of Penny Marshall. She was on a bit of a roll in this part of her career, having helmed BIG (1988) and AWAKENINGS (1990 - with Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro) previously. She went ""3 for 3"" as a Director with this one. She keeps the film moving along smartly, pausing just long enough at times to bring in some emotion and then follows it right up with some gut-busting laughs.While I am not thrilled by the events of the final game (I think it is a little contrived and one of the principal characters gets a reward they don't deserve) but that is a ""nit"" on this film, for it is the journey - with characters that are fun to spend some time with - that makes this film works.Oh...and Marshall also puts in some of the real players from the league in a finale that serves as a well-deserved salute to these women.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",A League of Their Own
56,SmileysWorld,"A fitting,funny tribute",8,24 March 2002,"Little did I know as a child that a professional women's baseball league even existed.That just goes to prove what little recognition these ladies have gotten over the years.This film finally pushes them over the top in terms of getting that recognition.Excellent perception and direction by Penny Marshall here in recreating this long ago time;a time of war when the nation needed the simple pleasures of life more than ever,to help them escape,at least temporarily,the horrors of the goings on overseas.With most of the male professional ball players overseas,our beloved women were called upon to fill the void,and boy did they ever fill it!It makes me wish, in some ways,that I could have been there to see it all.A fine comic performance here by Tom Hanks,as Jimmy Dugan, the somewhat reluctant and ignorant(at least,at first) manager of the Rockford Peaches. Outstanding performances as well from Madonna,Rosie O'Donnell,Geena Davis,and Lori Petty.A finer tribute could not have been made.Well done.",A League of Their Own
57,aesgaard41,Better Madonna Than Geena,8,10 May 2002,"First off let me say, I'm not a Geena Davis fan; I saw this movie for one reason and she really knocked me out with her ""Open Her Heart"" video. Madonna really does make the most of the scenes she is in as does Rosie O'Donnell, her best friend. I was rooting for Lori Petty over Geena; she looks better with hair. I'm not a baseball fan either, and the plot moves the story along well without getting stuck on the games. Tom Hanks is the other top-billed actor taking second place to Madonna in my mind. Of course, I don't have to tell you Hanks does great in everything he does.  The story of sister versus sister works great as the main story and Penny Marshall's direction is superb heightened only by the attention to the accuracy of the time as the world was at war. Good movie, top cast and good humor in the comedy. Pay attention to the kid: ""You're going to lose..."" ; he's a scream.",A League of Their Own

59,bellino-angelo2014,Almost great baseball movie,9,20 February 2021,"I am not a huge fan of American sports but most of the movies I have seen about them are very good and this is not an exception. In fact, this even surpasses most of them in a good sense.The film is based on a true story: during World War II the Major League Baseball was threatened to shut down as many men were on duty, so Chicago Cubs owner Walter Harvey persuades his colleagues to recruit an all-female baseball team. Harvey likes what he sees in Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis), the catcher for a local team. She refuses the offer as she prefers living her simple farm life waiting her husband (Bill Pullman), but her sister Kit (Lori Petty) wants to join the baseball team as she wants to go away and make something of herself. Dottie then agrees only for her sister. Once on Harvey Field in Chicago they meet New Yorkers Mae Mordabito (Madonna) and her best friend Doris Murphy (Rosie O'Donnell) and a few others. They are trained by the recovering alcoholic Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) who at first is very abrasive but he softens after a while. The Rockford Peaches have their ups and downs (and sometimes will even fight between each other) but they are always united. After a while Kit will be traded for the Racine Belles and she will win the final game. In the end there is the final reunion with the players all old.This baseball movie was very stylish, well made and also funny. Director Penny Marshall managed to blend the drama and comedy moments perfectly. The performances are all ''best-of'' of the stars: Geena Davis gives one of her most memorable performances and Tom Hanks, despite being a supporting player, is great as in all his movies. Lori Petty (who has returned doing movies) gives one of her best known performances, while Madonna (who has a reputation of having won lots of Razzie Awards) gives one of her greatest performances in her career. Rosie O'Donnell in her screen debut gives a great performance too. The soundtrack is also good, and the ending is quite touching when it's accompanied by Madonna's song THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND.Overall, I think that you just don't have to be a baseball fan for liking this movie. Mostly because it's one of those movies that has quite a reputation for being great and it has aged well. It has great direction, great acting and some very strong characters easy to love. So, a must see.",A League of Their Own

This film follows the stories about the team of females and their perspective on life and society (as women) during this time in history. I am not a fan of sports or sport-related films, but I did enjoy this one. I think that this film had enough elements for a wider audience to enjoy it. It also is able to combine comedy with drama and history, and it makes an exciting and engaging film with characters that are three-dimension and easy to care about. I think that this is an exciting film, and even if you dislike sports, the film has plenty more to offer for any viewer.",A League of Their Own
62,Son_of_Mansfield,"A Valentine to the All American Girls Baseball League, but Where have you gone Geena Davis?",8,25 March 2005,"A joyous gift to the women who graced the diamond. Here is slightly altered historic proof that women can be just as exciting and skilled as men in sports. The fact that a female baseball league survived twelve years during the 40's and 50's is a little surprising. I love the scene with the ""proper"" ladies on the radio, talking about the ""masculinization of women."" It is vintage American stupidity. Geena Davis, who needs to more movies, and Lori Petty, ditto, are great as the dueling Dotty and Kit. Tom Hanks and Jon Lovitz steal the movie with supporting roles slammed out of the park. Nearly every line they utter is classic. Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, and Megan Cavanagh as team mates are strong as well. The interplay between these five women is awesome as well, such as the scene where Dotty, Kit, Mae, and Doris meet. The direction of the baseball scenes is far more exciting than any real baseball I have ever seen. Aside from a script that could have used some streamlining and focus, this is a great movie that is funny, emotional, and entertaining.*Ernie: ""See the way this works is, the train leaves, not the station""***Jimmy: Did anyone ever tell you that you look like a little p*n*s with a hat on?""**",A League of Their Own

It's amazing that Penny Marshall was able to make one of the better movies about baseball. Really compelling characters by almost everyone on the team where they're all real characters and not just a handful of main characters and the rest being just glorified extras like how it normally goes.While the movie has a very ensemble feel to it, it still mostly focuses on Geena Davis and Lori Petty playing sisters. Tom Hanks is great as the washed up former MLB star who's now forced to manage the womens team. Even Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell do good in their supporting roles.",A League of Their Own
64,rossrobinson,excellent,10,16 June 2006,"Story of the formation of the first professional female baseball league, during World War II.Playing rounders for a living is a tough job - but someone's gotta do it. And, in 1943 America, with Joe DiMaggio and co off fighting Gerry, it was down to the womenfolk to keep the sport of baseball ticking over.As it happens, the All-American Girls' Professional Baseball League became popular enough that it survived for a further eight years after the War came to an end. But 'A League of Their Own' tells the story of those first pioneers to replace their oven gloves with catcher's mitts, as it were.Central to the tale are the sisters Dottie and Kit (Geena Davis and Lori 'Tank Girl' Petty), who are plucked from their jobs as milk maids to join the ranks of the newly-formed Rockford Peaches. Among their more prominent team-mates are Rosie O'Donnell as the burly no-messing Doris, Megan Cavanaugh as gorilla-faced hard-hitter Marla, and good ol' Madonna as the yo-yo-drawered Mae 'All-The-Way' Mordabito.But it's largely the presence and performance of Tom Hanks as washed-up Major League hero Jimmy Dugan that lifts this a cut above the average sport movie. Dugan's a boozer and a cynic, but he's also got a bit of heart, and gradually begins to take his job as Peaches manager more and more seriously - so much so, in fact, that by the end of the movie he even knows some of his players' names. Now that's dedication! Hanks also gets all of the funniest lines in this solid and, for the most part, entertaining feel-gooder. It's also an interesting story that's being told, although it inevitably contains practically every cliché we've come to expect from sports flicks, from the easily-categorized team ""characters"" to the big end-of-season-game climax. The film also gets bogged down in mushiness in the final stages, when we're reminded that the whole thing's being told in flashback and are returned to the modern day reunion of the girls, now all old biddies of course. Look out for the dodgy bit of dubbing involved in putting Geena Davis' voice over the lip-movements of old Lynn Cartwright in the role of ""Older Dottie"".",A League of Their Own
65,museumofdave,Highly Entertaining Baseball Movie WIth Some Curve Balls,7,20 April 2013,"There is little doubt that to the average viewer this is an entertaining, well-made film, and if you and your family are in a non-critical mode, in the mood for a baseball movie, some easy laughs and a tiny bit of history, this is a good choice.If there is a problem with the film its because its trying to do three things simultaneously: Is it a serious feminist document about women in baseball in the 1940s? Is it a predictable comedy with stereotyped characters (the grumpy manager who doesn't think women can play ball..guess what happens?) and all-too familiar plot lines? Is it a three-hankie tear jerker with lots of female bonding to ensure the waterworks will flow? Director Penny Marshall balances the elements effectively, but the honor she could have done to the real accomplishment of these sports- minded pioneers too frequently smacks of the sitcom; nevertheless, fine performances all round, especially from lead Geena Davis",A League of Their Own
66,Marc_Israel_365,A mixed bag of baseball fun and lazy direction,6,8 August 2014,"Let me start out by saying that A League Of Their Own is a fun movie. Geena Davis fulfills the role of ""baseball dolly"" and seems believable while Tom Hanks as washed up coach plays to the crown to everyones delight. Is there anyone out there who doesn't know that there's no crying in baseball? Even the Jon Lovitz scout was peppered with great one-liners and lovable schmaltz. Unfortunately the rest of the movie is unlovable schmaltz. The sports scenes seemed to be created for TV, as if it didn't matter if the positioning of balls, catches and players made no sense. The pushing of Madonna gave us one current pop culture moment from Rosie (I'm supposed to be an athlete, but maybe nobody noticed that I don't belong) O'Donnel stating, Mae, do you think there's any man left in America who hasn't seen your bosoms? Penny Marshall handled some scenes that worked and others that felt like Happy Days.

Right down to the ""big game"".The film touched briefly on the ""masculinization"" of women and I would like to have seen one of the struggle with this--especially in the 1940's.

It's a really fun and warm watch with fantastic performances; Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and Lori Petty all shine beautifully and there's great roles from Rosie O'Donnell and Madonna also who have great chemistry! What really caught me off guard was how many times I belly laughed during this; it's ridiculously funny while being very charming and also having a serious good message. A fantastic combination of all these elements makes it a bit of a classic",A League of Their Own
69,Med-Jasta,Perfect movie,10,15 June 2021,"Everything about this movie is executed perfectly. The comedy is funny and isn't forced. The drama is real but not heavy. It's about two serious subjects but the message is in the subtext and doesn't hit you over the head.The casting is spectacular. Davis plays the girl where everything comes naturally to her so perfectly. And she also has that distraction behind her eyes until her husband comes home. Not only does she act this perfectly but she also physically has the look. Her tall appearance is regal by nature. And in good contrast to her little sister. Lori Petty embodies the little sister. I don't know what it is but she does it perfectly. She looks so desperate and competitive with everything that happens. She's never relaxed and always has a chip on her shoulder. If you have siblings their relationship feels real. And not Hollywood real. They subtly convey the love/hate relationship. I guess it's more resentment than hate. But as you probably know, it's complicated.Everyone else is great. Rosie and Madonna are two great supporting characters. As they all are. Of course Hanks is great. I think my favorite part of his is when he's trying to be nice to Bitty Schram after she botches a play. He looks like he's about to explode. And I like that his character never really has a ""come to Jesus moment."" He just slowly warms up to the girls and his job.Even the casting of the old ladies was great. This way you could avoid all of the aged make up that didn't look so good in those days. And save the time and money. And give some older actors some work. I really had to question if I was looking at Geena Davis at the start. Using her voice was a great idea. It really bridged the gap. And when you saw all of them you knew exactly who it was. I don't know why but who was alive and wasn't made so much sense but it did.Penny Marshall does an amazing job. Of course because it's good and her movie. But even more than that. The small things. Like when Dotty shows up at the very end its kind of a surprise. It's not overly set up that way. No one says her name or anything. But it goes on for so long that you question where she is. And then when she shows up you are glad she's there. Then at the last game they're all banged up. Not only because they're not wearing much but because it's the last game. She also shoots nice and wide. This is great because you get to see those grand baseball fields and all of the players are always present. Davis dropping the ball at the climax is ambiguous. But if you were paying attention you know that Davis didn't drop it in the dugout or the last play at the plate.I really liked the scene when they get the mail from the army. Not only do you see how far Hanks has come but also you are quickly reminded that this was the reality for all of these girls. Because when that letter comes they all think it could be for them. Then they're all relieved it's not but sad for their friend. Must have been rough.I grew up watching this movie. I had it on VHS next to a handful of other movies. So on boring summer days this was in the regular rotation. And it was one of the few movies my mom would watch with me. It was great to watch as a grown up and not only understand the historical context but also the film making side. I don't call many movies perfect but this is one of them. Does everything it sets out to do. Nothing feels forced. Nothing misses. The mood is always right. And ""There's no crying in baseball,"" is one of those lines that never gets old.",A League of Their Own

And what's more fum then a really good story based on fact, with real people identified at the end of the film. This is story is designed to remind us of the women who filed in (and did so very well), for the men of major league baseball, during World War II. This womens league went on to prove women can do well in a mans arena. I enjoy this film more every time I see it.

I was very impressed with the film, since it had great performances from Genia Davis, Tom hanks, and Lori petty. The supporting cast including Rosie o Donnell and Madonna in one of her better performances was actually quite decent. I would say that this is a film test is a must see for baseball fans and casual viewership, since it is something gets has a heart, humor, and a touching story that will continue to be adored by fans.",A League of Their Own

A plan is devicve to start The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. An Oregon farm girl Dottie Hinson(Geena Davis)and her sister kit(Lori petty)joined along several others including rambunctious woman name Meg(Madonna) they learn to overcome the masses and sisterhood. The movie has an overall charm, it doesn't come off as preaching or demeaning but it still manages to get its message told. The team is all around likeable the majority of them are giving a considerable amout of screen time or acknowledgement. There's one girl who can't read she doesn't seem that important and later it cut back to meg teaching her. Meg friend Doris (Rosie O'Donnell) is also giving a fair amount screentime and has her moments. It feels like a team they aid one another but they argue and get on each other nerves. The one character that doesn't really have that likeable charm is Kit. The whole movie they just demean this girl for the sake of her to have hatered toward her sister. They dont really show scenes of her being show up by Dottie apart for the opening. The movie rather blunt about it. The team is funny but the Comedic highlight comes from Tom Hanks who play the teams Coach Jimmy Dugan. A former Cubs slugger he's cynical alcoholic who thinks the whole ideas a joke. At first he doesn't even try to motivate the women,he's just rude, vulgar and drunk most of the time. He's not Subtle whatsoever. You can't help but laugh at everything he does. It's not very often you have Tom playing the jerk. A League of their own is all around good film with a great cast and a good message.",A League of Their Own
73,higherall7,Woman Pioneers of Baseball,8,7 September 2020,"This film has everything; sibling rivalry between two milk maid sisters, romance, and a lighter version of the group protagonist ethic such as was evidenced in THE DIRTY DOZEN and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. It is also a coming of age story for a particular group of women and for the gender as a whole. Geena Davis heads a wonderful cast as Dottie Hinson, the reluctant heroine of the piece. She is a truly gifted baseball player, who leaves the farm to join the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. She would rather stay at home and wait for her husband Bob, as played by Bill Pullman, to return from World War II and the mess they are making in Europe. But she goes along anyway just to keep her Sister Kit, as played by Lori Petty, happy because Kit really does want to play professional ball. Later on, even though Kit was not the one Baseball Scout Ernie Capadino, as memorably played by Jon Lovitz, wanted, she proves to have the kind of heart that's needed to keep the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League going into the Hall of Fame.The characters are vividly realized and I can remember lines and emotional reactions and expressions from each and every one of the players with ease and a chuckle. Tom Hanks as Jimmy Dugan, the manager, gets to utter the line that's up there with Brando's ""I coulda been a contender"" and Nicholson's ""You can't handle handle the Truth!"" It's a hilarious magic movie moment that even now I see vividly in my mind's eye. The mournful teary eyed look on Kit's face when she mopes in and out of the dugout because her big sister has come back to stick it to her and put her in her place one more time. It's a poignant moment where anyone, but particularly those with brothers and sisters, can really relate.The Capraesque feel of the banter between Madonna as Mae Mordabito and Rosie O'Donnell as Doris Murphy are one of the special highlights. The expertly accelerated action sequences directed by Penny Marshall could be compared to Bill Paxton's work in THE GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED (2005), but are actually in a league of their own.What I really liked about this story is how it starts out honoring women who are headed to see their exhibit at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. These women are like any other women that then go on to be housewives and mothers. Many of them were quite the lookers in their youth. Now still beautiful, but growing more matronly as time passes. These veterans of the Home Front and the wars of domesticity, the fallen as well as the survivors, deserve their own monuments and places in the Hall of Fame. So let's all sing a song for the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, while we wonder how Jimmy Dugan ever got in here too.",A League of Their Own

Younger ""users"" admit they had no idea there were professional teams of female ball-players. Chicago DID have Wrigley Field, but other cities (large and small) all over this nation also had great stadiums......they had their own female teams. The African-American lady who lobbed the ball to catcher Geena Davis should inform you some areas in The South had integrated teams, even in the '40s, which were very popular to the local residents. I'm also sure many ladies who saw ""A League of Their Own"" felt left-out. I am also surprised that NONE of them have made comments here - maybe they don't know about IMDb.Let me assure ""user"" ""Ten Percent"" there were MANY ""butch"" players on these teams. You really didn't take a close look at the backgrounds of the film? - especially for the ""reunion"" scenes - because there several gay ladies in them. You didn't recognize your own kind? To make you feel better, I can attest the best players in these leagues were Lesbians - they were big girls who played - and fought - like men. I knew several of them in New Orleans, where I worked in a gay bar they visited. Ironically, I also worked in a drag show for 26 years in Los Angeles which was begun by a former, professional player (she died before I worked there). I did not really personally know her, but knew whom she was before I worked at the club - and MOST ironically - I now live in her home ! Yes, she was a Lesbian - and a great, all-around athlete and loved by everyone who knew her.I'm sure it was brought-out quite apparently during watching""League"" that women do not run like men - their pelvic-bones don't permit that. I will attest the Lesbians who played HARDBALL - not some tacky version of ""softball"" as ""geofbob"" says in his comment - and were as manly as the professional, male players. Not only do you get a history of baseball with females in my comment, also be informed Lesians have been around since ""dirt"", and the ones who had the guts to ""come-out"" before modern days almost ALL lived as men; you didn't mess with this gals.Penny Marshall made a wonderful movie, with all of the cast doing a fabulous performance. I'm sure many people were surprised to see Geena Davis play so well - but, ""trivia"" told us that all of the ladies were tested for their ability to play ball at the time they auditioned for their roles. Brava! Geena. Brava! Lori. Brava! Madonna, although I'm not one of your fans. Brava! Rosie - and I thought Hanks did a great job, but am wondering if he takes a leak in all of his film??? As so many ""users"" have written, this movie has some of everything in it, and is the better for it. It IS one of the movies that gives you an uplift - we certainly can use more of those! The script and directing were first-rate - the jokes were funny, the drama was saddening and realistic. It also showed how America ""played"" in nightclubs before they became places to be seen in, where everyone was welcomed and you didn't have to have a certain ""attitude"" to get in. Sad that ""clubbing""-enjoyment is also controlled, after paying to get in.NOW - here is an opportunity for ANOTHER film on this subject, which would show how masculine and skilled most of the players were, and not those sissy girls ""League"" depicts. When I was a kid, even the girls were just as rough-and-tumble as the guys, or else they weren't allowed to play baseball. If mom and dad would leave ""Little League""-rs alone, we would have integrated teams with girls beating the pants off a lot of the guys - everyone should see this movie - it rates a 20.......",A League of Their Own

A humorous look at a woman's professional baseball league during World War II, A League of Their Own follows the lives of Dottie (Geena Davis) and her kid sister Kit (Lori Petty) as they try out for and make the Rockford Peaches, one of the four teams in the league just for women. While some of the names have been changed to protect the innocent, the movie tells the mostly-true story of the league's first year. Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell play fellow Peaches, adding a sassy duo that helps bring smiles to the scenes that they are in. But it's Tom Hanks who steals the show. He plays Jimmy Dugan, a former home run king who cannot get a Major League managerial job because of his obsession with drinking. There was not really a baseball player named Jimmy Dugan, but most believe the character is based on former Philadelphia Athletic power hitter, Jimmy Foxx. Hanks plays his character over the top, over asleep drunk in the dugout. He utters the most famous line of the movie, ""There is no crying in baseball"" to one of his players who just committed an error. He also holds the record for longest on-camera urination in the history of cinema. But Tom Hanks comedic performance could have been overshadowed if Jon Lovitz had been in just one more scene. Lovitz plays a scout looking for talent across America, while playing a variation of ""The Liar"" he perfected on SNL at the same time. Penny Marshall, who directed this film, makes sure to keep the pace even, with both baseball scenes and scenes with just the girls. My favorite non-baseball scene involves the girls at charm school trying to sip tea the right way. The movie does follow the usual sports-movies clichés, but you know what? I had a good time anyway. The movie isn't about the team on the field, but rather the way the girls bonded as a team. There is one heartbreaking scene where one of the girls finds out here husband died in the war. But that scene is equaled with Tom Hanks driving the team bus after waking up to a rude surprise.",A League of Their Own

81,cashbacher,Hanks as a drunk doesn't work,8,22 August 2019,"Put bluntly, despite his impressive acting skills, Tom Hanks has difficulty playing a drunk. Furthermore, his character having that problem is an unnecessary and annoying component of the story. The premise is a look back at the inaugural All-American Girls Professional Baseball League season. The year was 1943 and most of the best major league players were off fighting World War II. President Roosevelt himself decreed that baseball would continue to be played during the war and in an attempt to keep interest in baseball alive, some of the owners of the major league teams decided to create a professional league of women players.
This movie is a mostly fictionalized look at the first year of the league, although they get the main principles correct. The women were carefully managed with a strict code of behavior regarding dress, appearance and overall conduct. For example, they were all required to attend charm school and smoking and drinking in public places could lead to fines and even suspensions.
Overall, the movie has a fairly predictable plot, it follows the Rockford Peaches through their first season of play. There is of course the big game at the end, won by one of the stars when she was down to her last strike. Tom Hanks plays the manager of the Peaches and when the season starts, he is a barely conscious drunk with no competitive fire, a role that Hanks does not play well. He sobers up over the course of the season and starts taking his job seriously. The movie would have been better if the Hanks character would have been serious from the beginning.
One positive aspect is the inclusion of the fact that there was a war on, and young American men were being injured and killed on the battlefield. In those years, nearly all young women had a husband, brother or other close male relative potentially in the path of a killer bullet.",A League of Their Own
82,clydestuff,"""One of the best films ever made about baseball""",10,17 April 2003,"A League of their own ranks up there as one of the very best films ever made about baseball.  It's humor does not come from  outlandish characters as in Major League, but a terrific script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel, who give us a plateful of well developed, distinct characters.  Add to this, a drunken has been manager, played by Tom Hanks in one of his best roles, and you have a movie you can watch and never tire of.  With so many characters, you would expect there to be at least one sour note, but Penny Marshall assembled a great cast and they each give us memorable and well thought out characters we can relate to.  Along with the humor, there are dramatic moments as well, and in one extremely memorable scene a telegram is delivered to the locker room to inform one of the girls their husband has died.  This scene is just one, but it says bookloads about the great work done by everybody in the making of A League Of Their Own.  They hit this one out of the park.",A League of Their Own

84,kols,A league of the best,10,15 July 2015,"Finally, after 20+ years, I recorded and watched what I thought was going to be a middling Tom Hanks comedy. Reason for that was the trailers I'd seen hundreds of times: ""Crying. There's no crying in baseball!""What I saw was a movie that should have been allowed to give Unforgiven serious competition for Best Picture and Geena Davis an Oscar for Best Actress in a leading role. Apparently I wasn't the only one fooled by those trailers.Penny Marshall's movie is a brilliant, beautifully crafted homage to a little remembered period when, just as Rosie became a riveter, numbers of talented women filled in for their men as ball players. Proving, like Rosie, they were every bit as capable as the absent males.More than that, of course, is the broader theme of the individual refusing to buckle under to social conventions. A very common American theme with Marshall's contribution ranking with the best of its expositions. Pretty good as a Baseball pic, too.It is a long movie, over 2 hours, but, despite the simplicity of the story, it doesn't play like two hours. From the first scene you (or at least I) fall in love with the screen and time becomes meaningless.Two people, supported by a strong supporting cast, are responsible: Peggy Marshall and Geena Davis. Marshall and her editor crafted a truly remarkable piece of cinematography that may be perfect; not a clang or misstep anywhere.Such movies need glue to make it all hang together and that's where Davis comes in: though brilliantly supported, without Davis the whole house would have failed. League is very much Geena Davis' movie, she's the one who puts flesh to the bones of Penny Marshall's vision.As Americans we love and should love movies like this, these celebrations of the best of our values, of how hundreds of women kept a league of their own alive for ten years.That achievement was quickly forgotten, buried in the reactionary conservatism of the '50s, which should anger us, but that anger can easily be tempered by Marshall's rediscovery and loving treatment of their story.For all of that seriousness, League is a successful comedy and fun to watch while, also successfully, demonstrating both how far we've come and how far yet to go.A large part of that 'yet to go' are those trailers that made me think that League was a Tom Hanks movie. It isn't; Hanks is almost a tertiary figure. Davis and the supporting cast, all women, are the Stars. Hanks character, Jimmy Dugan, is important and, especially at the last, honored but, as the movie unfolds, more comic relief than mover. Very much a second fiddle; to his credit, Hanks plays that fiddle masterfully.However, the fact that the distributors felt the need to exaggerate his presence to the point of ridiculousness speaks volumes about how, even in 1992, we weren't ready to embrace a movie by women about women. The Oscar's Nominating Committee's failure to recognize League as the masterpiece it is stamps paid to that point.As a movie, judged by objective cinematic standards, League should rank with the best of the best.",A League of Their Own
85,tles7,Thoroughly enjoyable.,8,11 January 2020,"Really good representation of the era although the photos of the real team didn't look quite as hot as the cast of the movie.

She feels for Evelyn crying about the coach yelling at her for missing her cutoff man, pointing him to the hall to the locker room when the ump tosses him, and then walks by the dugout and makes fun of Kit for not being able to finish the game. Not only that but Kit understandably retaliates by nailing her in the head with her glove, only for HER to take offense for some reason by firing her water in her face. She insists Kit ""not start with her"" when Kit pursues her. How in the world is Kit starting with her? Is Doris on drugs?

Hanks and Davis are great together.

90,charlessmith702210,I give the movie 3 and a half stars,8,30 May 2006,"This flick reminds me definitely of Billie Jean King and other similar women in sports who try to equalize the so-called problem of males dominating in virtually all sports. ""Major League"" was a little bit related to this flick because it involved a woman named Rene Russo, who was involved with the Cleveland Indians baseball team, but ""A League Of Their Own"" is a little more exciting than ""Major League""...because I was interested in what are women thinking about in a sport that has a lot of complications--almost as much complications as does chess.The characterizations between Geena Davis, Madonna, and Rosie O'Donnell build gently in this flick--from the farm scenes all the way to the scout baseball auditions at Wrigley Field...and finally, a glimpse of the unusual milieu of the All-American Girls' Professional Baseball League---also known as the AAGPBL.Then you run into Tom Hanks, who is selected to be the coach of the Rockford Peaches...he has a hard time dealing with both the male umpires and the lady players that have a little difficulty following his orders.You are also a witness to several of the AAGPBL promotions as you witness a typical season with the Rockford Peaches. For instance, there was a incentive for a woman to kiss a spectator who catches a foul ball.....In another instance, there was a night game that ended with a brief fireworks display.And the scene involving the world series between the Racine Belles and the Rockford Peaches was exciting enough...all the way to the collision at home plate that caused the Racine Belles to win the world series....Then, at the end of the movie, you see a glimpse of the AAGPBL reunion...seniors who were former members of the league in a little pick-up baseball game.....All of this comes to show that baseball is not just for good-old men.......",A League of Their Own
91,irish23,"Cute, could've been much better",6,4 December 2005,"Pros: Great story potential about lost history of women's baseball plus the social attitudes of the time. Potentially brilliant cast, including terrific supporting actors. Good range of character personalities to allow for humor, pathos, and conflict.Cons: Poor direction made all this potential go to waste. Wooden performances at times (especially at the beginning) by Geena Davis, who's a better actress than this. The painfully bad baseball playing made me wince at times, though I understand the difficulty directing non-athletes. More than anything, this film posed a number of dramatically compelling questions but left them unanswered. How did the women feel about being forced into the ""sex object"" role even while playing ball? What were the consequences after a player found out her husband had been killed in battle? What were the consequences for the Peaches after Kit was traded (in real life this would've posed major issues for everyone on the team)? Did Dottie ever regret leaving after one season (this issue was posed multiple times but never answered in the film)? What path did Kit take -- she seemed set at the end of the film for a more independent role than Dottie, but was she able to succeed in a culture which forced women back into the home after the war? What were the consequences for the sisters' relationship? Most importantly, whatever happened to the league?? And was that reunion at the end real? The players were kick-butt, putting the younger stars to shame.The list could be longer than this, but the fact that these major issues were left unresolved points to unsatisfactory writing and direction. Not that we needed a play-by-play rundown of every conflict, but good writers don't set up that many dramatic tension points without giving us a clue as to how at least some of them get resolved.With such a talented cast and great story potential, the film was strong enough to keep me interested (and crying at times!) but left me dissatisfied at the end.",A League of Their Own

93,robsellke,"Entertaining story, good baseball movie, but overdone in the drama",7,28 May 2000,"""A League of Their Own"" is an exciting baseball movie with interesting characters, but a too much drama.  It tries to milk out too much, when if it just backed off, it would've been fine.  Dottie Hinson and her kid sister, Kit, are both good baseball players.  This is the middle of WWII, though, and all of the male baseball players are away at war.  John Lovitz plays his classic, smart-aleck character, this time who's a baseball scout.  A candy-bar mogul decides to start up a women's baseball league during the war, to keep the sport going.  Lovitz travels around the country finding girls who can play.  The league comes together in Illinois with four teams. When they're placed on the same team, there is a lot of rivalry between Kit and Dottie, and eventually Kit is sent to the other team.  They end up playing against each other in the world series and drama ensues.  The movie is entertaining, however, and a good look at the American home front during the second world war.",A League of Their Own
94,Thornfield2,Girl Power,8,1 June 2001,"Back in a time when all a women were expected to do was  to stay in the kitchen and keep a household, a war broke out and everything changed. Men went off to war and women for the first time in history had a chance to enter into strange and exciting worlds that would have never been available to them otherwise. This film captures just this and the cast illustrated this fabulously. Geena Davis and Lori Petty (Kit and Dottie) were perfect as the sisters who were in constant competition with each other, more on Kit's end who had an apparent chip on her shoulder and Dottie's take charge(indirectly)attitude and ""I'm in this league for my sister"" was probably the greatest role in her career. She displayed her strength as woman remarkably well. Kit's jealousy was also played very well by Petty, who with one look made you feel for her. Tom Hanks talent was magnified in his role as the crude but charming lush, Jimmy Dugan who really gets a chance to redeem himself later in the film. He, in my opinion is one of the finest actors of our day. Doris (Rosie O'Donnel), May (Madonna) and all the other ladies played hard,  had fun and had a passion for baseball just as much or perhaps a little more than any man.",A League of Their Own

There were some great lines (""There's NO CRYING in baseball!"") and the cast was fabulous, even the minor characters (Garry Marshall is one of my all-time favorite character actors). Tom Hanks was brilliant, and one gets the feeling that if Madonna had stuck to comedy she'd be a huge box office draw by now. The only thing I didn't really care about was the ""rivalry"" going on between Dottie Hinson and her sister-Kip was one of the weakest characters in the film and too much attention was paid to her for her to be so underdeveloped.If you haven't seen it, rent it sometime during the baseball season.

97,consortpinguin,"Great Story, Great Acting -- Worth Seeing!",9,26 March 2001,"""A League of their Own"" is one of my favorite movies.  This is great ""historical fiction,"" a story based on real events. Penny Marshall directed an interesting movie about a long-forgotten women's baseball league.""A League of Their Own"" had a very strong plot, a great script, and excellent acting. Not only did it capture the flavor of the 1940s, but it featured believable, interesting characters.  Geena Davis, as star catcher and hitter Dottie Hinson, carried this movie.  I was very impressed with her acting ability.  I'm surprised that even though you read a lot of praise for actresses like Meryl Streep, no critics have ever given Geena Davis her propers.  Even though I am no fan of either Madonna or Rosie O'Donnell, their portrayals of the two most colorful players ""All the Way Mae"" and Doris Murphy lit up the screen.  I even liked Madonna's theme song ""This Used to Be My Playground."" The story line takes you from the formation of the League until their first ""World Series.""  A famous businessman (based on Mr. Wrigley?) decides to start a women's baseball league during World War II when many male baseball players were off fighting World War Two.  Recruiting young women baseball players all over the country, the scout first signs Dottie and her sister Kit in Oregon.  As the train heads east, they pick up other promising sluggers. When we first meet Marla, she hammers the ball out of the park on every pitch.  The scout is reluctant to sign her because she isn't pretty, but Dottie takes command, stating, ""If she doesn't play, I don't play."" 
The morals and manners of a bygone era dictate strict rules for the Rockford Peaches.  Mae is bummed when told she can't smoke cigarettes or drink liquor.  The ""girls"" are sent to a charm school to teach them ""ladylike"" behavior, and they are forced to wear uniforms with skirts, not always the most practical.  They have a strict ""housemother"" and curfews, but the Peaches manage to sneak out to a night club where they drink, smoke, cuss, and dance with servicemen. One of the funniest scenes occurs when Rosie O'Donnell, a strong swing dancer, flips her parter.  ""Look, I threw a guy over my head!""  While none of this behavior would seem out of place today, society in the 1940s stressed ""propriety,"" even for men, but much more so for women.Even though their games filled many stadiums all over the country, satisfying America's need for our favorite sport, there are strong hints that the League may not last more than another season.  Actually, the league survived until 1953, but it never caught on big and was long forgotten.  I have been around since 1950 and consider myself well-read, but until this movie, I never even heard of this league.  The film brings back an interesting segment of baseball history, when players enjoyed the game, had loyalty to their teammates and fans, and did not make seven figure salaries.The film builds to an exciting climax for the ""World Series.""  Traded in mid-season, Kit now pitches for the Peaches' rival team.  Seeing the two sisters face each other as pitcher and catcher builds tension and you really get into that game.Overall, I highly recommend seeing ""A League of Their Own.""",A League of Their Own

These ladies provided entertainment for people just like them who lost loved ones in the war or who had loved over seas and didn't know if they were okay.

It's a great comedic film.  One piece of advice: try to watch the widescreen version.

102,phantopp,A Peach of a Baseball Movie which Delivers a Full Count,6,21 April 2009,"As the boys went off to to fight in the second World War, ""Harvey Candy Bar"" owner ""Walter Harvey"" (Garry Marshall) decides to create an all-women baseball league.Two players recruited are two farm girls, sisters from Iowa who are in the middle of a sibling rivalry. You have ""Dottie Hinson"" (Geena Davis), who the movie centers around as the movie is shown as a flashback of her memories of the days playing in the league, and her younger sister, ""Kit Keller"" (Lori Petty), who is unmarried and is overshadowed by her sister in the local softball league.The two are signed to the Rockford Peaches, which is lead by a down-and-out former Major Leaguer (Tom Hanks), whose drinking problem not only destroyed his career, but his knee as well when he jumped from a hotel window to escape a fire he accidentally started in a drinking binge.Despite the problems with the manager, and the initial negative comments from the league's critics and fans who mocked the ladies, the Peaches and the three other teams quickly gained their supporters. They also became another family for each other, giving each other support not only on the field, but in their personal lives like when one of the Peaches got the word from the government that her husband was killed in action.However, that sibling rivalry comes back to haunt ""Dottie,"" who the media has flocked around. Especially when, thanks to a miscommunication between team owners and her sister, ""Kit"" is traded to the Racine Belles.This movie is a fictionalized story on the creation of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL), which was created in 1943 by Phil Wrigley, the man behind many popular gum brands and the Chicago Cubs baseball team. It uses the names of the original four teams of the league, but plays with the history of the league's first season.The movie begins by focusing on ""Dottie"", who is preparing for the league's induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. When the movie flashes back, it focuses on the Peaches from her point of view. And this is done pretty well.We get to meet some interesting cast of characters on the Peaches, including manager Jimmy Dugan (Hanks), former strip club bouncer (her father owned the club) ""Doris Murphy"" (Rosie O'Donnell) and ""All-the-Way"" Mae Mordabito"" (Madonna). Now, the only problem with having so many characters is that we never get them fully developed. You get to know a little background on these characters, and see their personalities. But, in my opinion, focusing on everybody was just a little too much. I could not connect with any of the girls, which was needed to feel for one when her life is changed by the war forever.What this movie does right is put together a really good cast. Davis and Petty really made you feel as if they were having a sibling competition with one being athletically superior to the other. Hanks was wonderful as the down-and-out manager who eventually realizes that these girls want what he couldn't have thanks to his drinking problem -- a championship. In fact, the entire fictional Peaches team were all good in their own way.There were three pairings of actors that I loved to watch when they were on screen together. Like I said earlier, Petty and Davis were great as sibling rivals. Davis was also great when paired up against Hanks, and have one of the best comedic scenes when the two have a battle of signals to the batter. Then there was O'Donnell and Madonna, who I wish who had more scenes together. If you ask me those two were the best comedic duo in the cast.Another thing that this film does great is the game action. From a production point of view, many of the plays were staged so they could get the shot. What else made these scenes wonderful was that the majority of the cast (one person had an on-field double) was actually playing. There is one scene where one of the Peaches is having her thigh iced. This particular scene was pretty much unscripted as that injury was legitimate (and one of the nastiest bruises I've seen).The wardrobes for everybody is done very well in this movie. In fact, they appear to be authentic right down to the tiniest stitch.Penny Marshall, who hired not only her brother as the founder of the league, but other cast members from her popular television series ""Laverne and Shirley"" (at least two regular cast members from the series appear in the movie), did a good job in the director's seat. She set up every shot nicely, especially the ones during games.One thing that I wasn't really into was the music. I usually don't pay direct attention to the music, although I subconsciously notice it when used to enhance the scene. In this movie, I couldn't tell you any scene where the music helped the mood. In fact, the only piece of music I clearly recall is the song sung by Madonna that was played as the closing credits began to roll.I can't say that this movie hit a Grand Slam home run, but it wasn't a balk or strikeout either. It's a good movie to add to your ""To Rent"" list if you ask me.",A League of Their Own

The way that Penny Marshall put this together is absolutely seamless. It's almost poetic.The story centers around the start and first season of the All American Girl's Baseball League, and, more specifically, the sibling rivalry that unfolds between Dottie (Geena Davis) and Kit (Lori Petty). It is quintessential Women's Lib incarnate.Kit doesn't want to live in Oregon forever, while Dottie, who's husband is off at war, is basically biding her time until her husband returns. So, when the scout shows up for a local game, they both have different motives.Not a situation is overlooked while piecing the plot together. We see that, like that horrible country song reminds us, war is hell on the home front, too. Women become widows, underdogs become heroes, and interesting supporting characters abound. You just can't help but be engaged.I saw this film in an actual theatre when it was released, and the theatre was not packed at all.

105,Roman11,It's home run of a film!!,10,7 April 2005,"All the gals did a magnificent job in this delightfully entertaining film. Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast also deserve cheers. Penny Marshall's direction was flawless especially when invoking tears in many parts of the film. The ladies like Lynn Cartwright et al were not only brilliantly cast as older look-a-likes but they simply WERE the younger actresses 40 years later.The film is paced well with excellent timing and begins in 1943 went the men went to war. As I understand the Ladies league lasted between 1943 and 1954. I, myself, enjoy women's baseball and soccer. A true spirit and comradery was displayed throughout this exciting and touching movie. Congratulations to all and I certainly want more films like this one.",A League of Their Own
106,kidwltm,Too Much Of A Soap Opera,5,4 August 2003,"The film is about the all American girls professional baseball league, and that is definitely the demographic this appeals to.  It's way too much of a melodrama to be an effective drama, the same problem most `dramadies' run into.  It's a combination of hackneyed writing, poor directing and less than average acting. It follows the `how to create drama' handbook to a T. Never once did I care whether these people succeeded or not.   It fails as a drama.  Thankfully, it was at least able to provide a few laughs.  Most of it is female driven physical humor, which can get old after a while, but there are two shining beacons in the movie, and tying into the sardonic ways of the world, they just happen to be men.  I'm of course speaking about Tom Hanks and Jon Lovitz.  Both turn in brief, but hilarious performances.  It's a real pleasure to watch Tom Hanks, who should have at least gotten a Golden Globe nomination (if not win) for his efforts.  It's a great character and Hanks pulls it off beautifully.  It's a mediocre comedy with two real great performances, sadly being too brief.  The drama aspect it was too sentimental and over the top.  I'm sure certain people love that, but it's not for me.  See it for Hanks if for anything.  4.5/10* */ * * * *",A League of Their Own
107,chaplins_charlie,GREAT!!,9,30 May 2003,"I love this movie.  I first watched it when I was 9 years old and I've loved it ever since.  The movie is about the first All American Girl's Baseball League in 1943.  It also deals with the relationship of two sisters who play on the same team but find that they are growing apart from each other.  When one of the sisters gets traded onto another team, fights and emotions break loose.  The ending was great and it just goes to show you that no matter who won the world series in that league, love is what holds family and friends together.  The acting was magnificent with Tom Hanks as the drunken and unsympathetic coach, Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell, Tracy Riener, Bitty Schram etc. were great as the team members and Geena Davis and Lori Petti as the sisters.  The movie was excellent and had me laughing but be sure to take out the kleenex box towards the end of the movie.  This movie gets 4 stars out of 5.  Watch it!!

Only Hanks could have pulled this character off with such an air of perfection.I think one reason for this film being such a wonderful, interesting, entertaining, and watchable movie, is the fact that Penny Marshall directed it. She couldn't have (in my opinion) done a better job.I've watched this movie, probably ten times, and expect I probably will watch it at least that many more. The movie it is in every respect one of the best I've seen. Ladies playing baseball, especially pretty ladies is a pleasurs to watch.Thanks for letting me express my opinion.",A League of Their Own

Watching the women fulfill their dreams and overcome obstacles creates and awesome feeling where anything is possible.

111,Crystal_Hansen,"""there's no crying in baseball!""",9,20 February 2019,"A League of Their Own is World War II era film that follows the lives of 64 women as they start an All American Baseball team when the men go to war. The men were at war. What do you expect the women to do sit and wait for the men to come back? They'd get bored. At this point in history women filled the jobs left behind when the men went to war. Baseball was one of those things that America really loved and they couldn't let it stop indefinitely. Baseball scouts are sent to various cities to recruit the best players that they see because the women played baseball in their free time. Kit really wants to play on the team but finds herself in the shadow of her older sister Dottie. The scout only agrees to let Kit be on the team if she can convince Dottie to come with her. Dottie agrees to join the team and whitnesses the cruel treatment of another girl who isn't ""pretty"". The Scout refuses to let Marla Hootch on the right after he watched her play and break three windows in the process. The women that want play baseball go through really rough ""auditions"" to make it on the team. Multiple women don't make the cut for the team and are shooed off the field by the coaches. Out of the 100+ women that try for the team only 64 make the cut. Four teams. 16 players on each team. Anyone that doesn't make the team is kicked off the playing field. The women go through the season and Dottie and Kit have some sibling rivalry along the way and end up getting split up towards the end of the season.I genuinely enjoyed the movie because there was a decent amount of action and humor. I'm not fluent in baseball jargon so I had no clue what all the hand signals were that Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks) was using or what they meant. But that didn't take away from the entertainment value of the film. The uniforms that they were required to use was the best part of the film. I loved Doris' reaction when they were shown what they had to wear for the games was priceless. ""How am I supposed to slide in that?!"" my favorite line in the whole film was ""there is no crying in baseball!!"" after Jimmy was a jerk to one of the players that was having a hard time pitching or catching or something. I don't remember what the problem was, but Jimmy was a jerk when he was chewing out the girl. I felt so bad for her. Then they all ended up being friends and they all lived happily ever after. The end. I give this movie a nine because it wasn't perfect.",A League of Their Own

117,kennarb-23010,A league of their own,10,4 January 2019,"I am watching this movie for my history through film class. This movie took place in the 1900's. The filmmaker is telling us that there were things that helped people get though hard times. This movie also told us that baseball is for boy and girls not just boys. They are also telling us not to give up when things get hard because the only way you get better is by pushing your self when things get hard. In this movie the girls wore dresses when they played baseball because of the time period. In this movie the girls are known as female baseball players not softball. You could also tell this movie was from an older time period because of the way the score board looked when they were playing in the world series. One thing that made me question the time period in this movie was when they brought one of the players a letter letting her know her husband had passed away. They cars that they ride in in this this more similar to ones that we have seen in other movies. I liked how they didn't bring the other team down when they won the world series. I also liked that they still gave it their all when they were loosing. I didn't like how rude their coach was to them, I didn't think that they were very supportive. I think this was a very good movie. I liked this movie. Yes I would want to see other movies by this director and by these actors.",A League of Their Own
118,spottedreptile,Classy feelgood story of women pioneers,7,12 June 2000,"Like many others, I didn't know anything about a wartime female baseball league so the story was fascinating to me. The film is beautifully told and is very touching and funny. The plot follows the women who made up a professional girls' baseball league during the second world war when the guys went fightin'. And then of course the war is over, and the guys come back - then what happens to the women with their glimpse of independence and a life outside the kitchen? There are lots of good character arcs, particularly the two sisters, Dottie (Geena Davis) and Kit (Lori Petty), and the washed up has-been, Jimmy Dugan, played by Tom Hanks with about 2 stone extra on him for the role.
The flashback structure works so well you can't imagine doing it any other way. All the actors do a great job, but for me, Lori Petty as Kit, Dottie's kid sister, steals the show. She is brilliant. Watch out for occasional glimpses of Tea Leoni as a Racine hitter.
Apparently all the injuries seen were sustained by the actors themselves. You can believe it too - they really look like ball players. First-rate editing makes it genuinely exciting sport. The film could have been a stinker - there are many cliches and it's pretty predictable, but it's handled with great sympathy and sentiment without treacle by Penny Marshall. Twists and subplots would have been out of place - this is a classic feelgood and entertains without dragging on.

A little bit too much oversensitive in my opinion. All this is joined together with genial Tom Hanks, where his huge talent is visible the most I have ever seen; they could just give him a little more space before camera.

122,garynorm-79022,Write a headline for your review here,6,8 January 2019,At the end of the movie it is good to see that all of them still like their teammates. The plot of this movie is to have a women's baseball league since some men from the MLB had to go war during WWII. The main character and her sister get into this league. The sister gets trade at the end of the season. Both of the sister's teams made it to the championship. The main characters team is up a couple of points and the sister is the last that is up to bat. She gets two strikes and them hits the last ball into the outfield. The sisters team ended up winning the championship. I know that WWII was happening in this time of this movie. I would rather watch WWII movies instead of this. Penny Marshall is the director of this movie. I don't know if I have seen other movies by him. I know that Forrest Gump is in this movie and he plays the coach for the team. I liked the movie it was pretty entertaining. I wouldn't have watched this movie if I wasn't in my History Through Film class. I would tell my friends that this movie is OK and that it would be worth watching.,A League of Their Own
123,serghei_romanu,Hugely underrated!,8,7 August 2010,"The idea of making a movie about women baseball league during World War II, is a truly great one. At that time, women didn't really had anything to say in sports, generally speaking, not to mention baseball, probably the most important American activity of the time. No! Women raised kids, women cooked dinners, women washed dishes, women swept the floors. They surely didn't played ball! Well, this title showed me, in an unique style, that anyone can achieve greatness despite gender, looks, or studies.Furthermore, I loved the character mix this title suggested. Maybe I'm biased when it comes to multiple character relations in a certain film, but I can't restrain from saying that ""A Lague of Their Own"" is a true masterpiece from this point of view. A little more substance would've been more appropriate, I won't disagree with that, but this film is terrific nonetheless! So far, there hasn't been a single perfect film. That's just a standard to reach for, an illusion, if you don't mind the adjective.The acting was superior. Tom Hanks was very convincing as Jimmy Dougan a former baseball star, now an ordinary low-life alcoholic, head coach of Rockford Peaches women baseball team, Geena Davis beautifully interpreted soon-to-be baseball superstar Dottie Hinson and Lori Petty did great as Kit, always envious on her sister's Dottie huge success. Even Madonna was above her mediocre standards in the role of sleazy Mae Mordabito.To conclude, ""A League of Their Own"" grows on you. It's funny, original, captivating from one end to the other and will always rest in my memory as a particular pleasant adaptation of such an interesting subject. Accordingly, it deserves no less than a ****/***** rating",A League of Their Own

This part in history was really important because it showed what women could really do and they can do anything men can do.

126,jackfull,Baseball!...with old people,7,4 January 2019,"A League of their Own is a film about the women's baseball league that was formed during the war to give the people at home something to watch and to boost overall American moral. Seems only fitting since I watched this in my U.S history through film class. With that being said, my thoughts.
It has a girl name Dotty, and her sister Kit, who are recruted by a recrutor from the All American Girls Baseball League. They go to try outs, make a team, and join all the other hilarious players in this film. Many events occur in the course of the season, but ultimately Dotty leaves to go settle down, and Kit stays in the league for the majority of it entirety.
Some things I really liked about this movie were that it had excellent emotional structure. The emotions felt of the characters on screen in the moment seem to jump out and are a physical atmosphere. The costumes, sets, etc. all seem period correct and fit the movie. It does have some good jokes and gags every few minutes that help when coming off a tense scene. With these all being said however, the movie isn't without its bad's.
Looking at this film cinematicly, the shot composition and color representation seem very dull. Shots are plain and level, scene transitions have nothing special to them. The colors seem dull and not as bright as they could be, but that might just be because it was made in 1992. Story wise, it seemed bland and dull when they switch the old current day women who played, and them playng back in the 40's. Something didn't just seem to click right and it felt like the old women weren't the joke cracking, New Jersey accented girls you saw play in the league.
Looking at the movie as a whole, I give it a 7. Its a good film, but I wouldn't choose to watch it again. I respect the amount of motion and thought that went into making it, but it just doesn't appeal to me enough. I felt they could have explained some holes that occurred in the story when transitioning to the present day. If anything I leave you with, you might want to watch this movie just because of the hilarious performance of Tom Hanks.",A League of Their Own

This movies shines for people like Tom Hanks, Geena Davis and even Rosie O'Donnell shows she had talent before she became the angry lesbian that she is now. This story and movie is so great, even two of the worst actresses ever-Madonna and Lori Petty- can't ruin it. Penny Marshall did such a wonderful job of putting this story together and letting it shine that she probably deserved an Oscar nomination (which is a stretch, but I think that's how good she did). Tom Hanks steals the show as Jimmy Duggan. His performance alone would make this film worth going to see. Geena Davis is also superb as this movie came out before her descent into obscurity (the Best Supporting Actress Oscar Curse).

I just kept saying her name over and over again then my mind had a Brain Blast she was in BeetleJuice and Thelma and Louise. I watched her in this film and I'm like WOW !!! Geena was perfect for the role of Dottie , so confident and caring and mature and sexy enough lol.I agree with a lot of other people on here saying Madonna was quite swell as Mae I loved the way she walked , her attitude , her voice and even she smoked brilliantly. Also Kit was interesting you could tell her jealousy and her high spirit. Her getting showered down was funny , Her older self look exactly like her !!! i was shocked when I looked in the credits and found out it was not the same actress.Jimmy Dugan ( Tom Hanks) played as a coach - it was strange I think because he was a supporting character and added some comical and seriousness moments to the film. To me it was weird not liking Tom Hanks character right away and he was not the main star , I just had to get use to that as I watched it. However he did a decent of enough job drunk and then cleaning up his act to help out the Womens baseball team ( but i thought they could have shown that a little better ! )Last comments - I liked the film Dottie and Kit had great sibling history going on there - they had each others backs / loved each other / laughed together / cried together / played baseball together / argued together and were a family. A womens team beating the odds - its no where near a chick flick in my opinion. Hanks did a decent job but keep in mind Geena Davis is the star who deserves 2 thumbs up.

Dotty, doesn't want to, but Kit begs her to, and Kit ends up going along too.  Lori Petty does a great job portraying Kits character, an upbeat, positive, but sometimes rowdy young woman.

A League of Their Own does not disappoint.As the team is put together, one both sees how silly some of the societal norms and rules were back then, yet just how talented these women were in playing the game of baseball. The film artfully shows how they were made fun of at first; yet through their hard work ethic, they gained the respect of the fans that came out to see them.With the weaving of story lines of the individual players throughout the film, one can identify with the struggles of the players and of the others in the movie, and in a sense  much like baseball itself  they become a part of us; after all, baseball is an American institution that has in large measure stayed constant through the years.A word of advice: GUYS: If you want to go to both a baseball movie and satisfy your sweetheart with a 'chick flick' THIS is the movie for both of you. It will leave a smile on both of your faces and the reinforce the belief that baseball  steroids aside  in many respects baseball really does reflect on all that is good and right with America.On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film an 8/10. ***",A League of Their Own

It was clear what Penny Marshall (director) wanted to convey through this film, and everything is very clearly accepted to the individual watching.This film is plentiful of entertainment to enjoy. The performances such as Geena Davis (as Dottie) and Tom Hanks (as Jimmy) kept me interested within the film within its entirety. The film has enough going on in each sequence to ensure a lack of boredom no matter what, and that is the exact element many films in the 90's lack.In general, Penny Marshall has delivered a timeless film that will be sure to amaze and inform people about the women's baseball league that once was, and makes sure to expand upon a story that rarely gets told.",A League of Their Own
137,spenhask,A League of Their Own Review,8,8 January 2019,"This movie is about the first girl baseball league opens up. The women there work very hard in order to win all the baseball games they participate in. They do so well they make it to the final rounds but they don't win in the final rounds but they came close. I like the plot, characters, and humor. I'm not a big fan of the dialogue though. Overall, it was a good movie and it would be great to see others like it.",A League of Their Own
138,donovanharris,Review,8,8 January 2019,"A league of their own was a very unique story that shows the beginning of the softball league. It was interesting to see how everything was put in order for them to play and after the success of it, the push to the continual play of female baseball players. Betty, one of the main characters played a big role in this movie portraying the power of feminism over the rest of the other female players. Overall this was a great movie that had a lot of ups and downs but still showed an accurate historical background that included the war, and men to women discrimination through academics and sports. The general message of the story was given clearly to the audience which is why this deserved a great rating.",A League of Their Own
139,harljens,Grand slam,5,8 January 2019,I had watched this movie when I was a child. It was kind of nostalgic to watch it a gain after not watching it for a while. The intense last inning was one of the best scenes. The plot of the story was that all of these women are playing baseball all of a sudden because there husbands and boyfriends are in the war. The major league was stopped because most of the good players were all in war. I knew that there was a war going on during that time but thats about it. A lot of a history is interesting to me. Im sure i have seen movies set in this time period before but i have not noticed. No all of it seemed legit. Penny Marshall is the director. I dont know if i have seen any movies by her. Tom hanks is main actor in this movie. I liked the actors that were in it. I wasn't a fan of the movie itself. yea i would have watched it on my own time. i dont know if i would recommend this to a friend. Overall it was alright movie.,A League of Their Own
140,hannbell,A great movie pitch.,9,10 January 2019,"""A League of Their Own"" is a movie I could rewatch multiple times. I love the story of the Woman's Baseball League because it's so unique and kind of heartwarming. Dottie finds herself bring recruited by a man attempting to get players for the Woman's Baseball League, Dottie refuses to go unless her kid sister can go along with her. They travel to the fields and tryout for teams, both girls make it onto the Racine Peaches. The movie follows theirs and their teams' story as they travel around playing games and earning more and more popularity with each state they hit and their league is bigger in media than anyone even imagined. My favorite part of this movie was the way they gave each girl their own backstory and how diverse each woman was. A lot of the girls had husbands and boyfriends in the war and I really like the way the incorporated the troops without making it a main focus of the story. The only part I didn't like in this movie was seeing them old and grown at the end after watching their whole story, although it was sad, it was still a really well executed storyline. The filming was pretty substantial and there were no weird soundtracks in this movie,
which I've come to start noticing after the previous movies we've watched in history through film.",A League of Their Own
141,prestonwatt,The Best Review,8,4 January 2019,"I like this movie because it reminds me of when I played baseball. I especially liked the scene where Jimmy Dugan, played by Tom Hanks, yells at a girl and didn't expect her to cry. This scene shows what athletes had to go through when playing. The whole movie is about what athletes had to go through, specifically women. A girl named Dottie, played by Geena Davis, and her sister get accepted into women's baseball and compete for the championship. Women competing for a championship was not common back then. The history of this movie is interesting because it shows us how women were treated and what men's expectations were of women. This movie can also be connected to women standing up for themselves today. One women in particular, Madonna, who plays Mae, was the type of character who was strong willed and stood up for herself. I think Madonna made this movie better because she is a known celebrity and is very influential. I like how the movie ended with the ball players all old and they reflect on the good times they had. I didn't like how Dottie and her sister got put on different teams at the end. But overall, this movie was really good and I would recommend it to any one.",A League of Their Own
142,anallars,"There was crying in baseball, and it was me.",10,8 January 2019,"This movie has probably become one of my favorites. When I was younger, I got really into baseball, so I was way excited to learn that there was an actual women's baseball league and a movie about it. This movie follows how the women's league came about and two sisters that came up together, but one feels that she lives in the shadow of the other. This is a really heartwarming film and empowering to women. During this time, women were expected to stay at home while the men were at work, but the men got called off to war and the women had to provide. At this point in history, baseball players were being sent to war, so there was no more baseball. Because owners still wanted money to be made, they decided to try out a women's baseball league. It was really cool to see all these characters do what they loved despite all the criticism they received from others. I really liked how they were able to actually film at Wrigley Field and it was cool that the actresses actually learned how to play for the scenes. It was also fun to see well-known actors and actresses when they were younger like Geena Davis, Lori Petty, and Madonna. There was lots of great humor and it was just overall a great film.",A League of Their Own
143,PAL-9,Well worth the rental,9,18 November 2000,"This is not just a great baseball story.  Penny Marshall has succeeded in representing life in the 40s and some of the obstacles that a group of women had to face in trying to improve their lives, have fun and play some ball. The acting is great and very believable.  Geena Davis should have been nominated for Best Actress, but I guess coming after Thelma and Louise, 2 years in a row would have been difficult. Based on the real women's league, the movie has restored some of my faith in athletes who once played for love of the game.  Now I have a reason to visit the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.  This is not a ""girls movie"" but one for the whole family. Enjoy!",A League of Their Own
144,mattbeac-11179,class movie review,7,8 January 2019,I personally really enjoyed the movie it had a nice humorous side and personally kept my attention. I didnt know about anything going on in this era but some of the major league players left to go to war so they had to cancel the season and women played instead creating a new trend. I liked the ending of the movie when all the ball players got back together at the memorial. I dont think that i would have ever watched this movie outside of school.,A League of Their Own
145,ashlyndroge,good.,9,8 January 2019,"I really liked this movie. I would watch it again just for fun. It was a really good way to portray what happened during the war. The men couldn't play baseball because they were fighting, so the women got their chance to play. I really liked Dotti and Kit. they were really good actors and did a very good job. all in all this was a really good movie. Sorry this is a really short review, it's the end of the quarter and my brain cells are struggling.",A League of Their Own
146,olanvill,Intriguing,6,8 January 2019,I liked this movie because it kept my attention and kept me interested. At the beginning of the movie it have a good attention grabber because you didn't know who those elderly people were. My favorite part is when the baseball recruiter came and talked to the girls in the barn. This is really a nice heartwarming movie.,A League of Their Own
147,laynknig,Review,10,8 January 2019,This movie is probably one of my favorites that we have watched in this class. I thought it was really entertaining and it was a really fun movie to watch. It's a good way to learn how the woman's hall of fame became to be. The story was just meant to become a movie with her sister switching teams and it all came down to the last play. I think the director did a really good job getting the story and the point across. I would really recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it.,A League of Their Own
148,heat9120,Lori Petty is just too whiny,7,17 June 2019,"I love almost everything about this film; the only problem is that the thing I most dislike is a BIG part of the story. Specifically, the Kit character played by Lori Petty. The character spends far too much time whining and complaining about how life constantly does her wrong.And it's very hard to shake the impression at the end that Geena Davis' character Dottie lets Kit have the win in the ""big game."" Perhaps that wasn't the film's intention (we do see Dottie telling the pitcher what kind of throws Kit isn't good at hitting), but when Dottie had earlier executed the same kind of play successfully, I just can't believe that she legitimately dropped the ball when Kit rammed into her at home plate.No, I think Dottie lost the game on purpose, and that's a betrayal of her teammates.The movie is still well worth watching though, especially for Tom Hanks' delightfully crude manager, Madonna's unrestrained energy (much better than Evita) and the great sight of sisters doin' it for themselves.",A League of Their Own
149,nickidom,Review,9,8 January 2019,This movie was good and i really liked it. The theres no crying in baseball part was definatly my favorite part though because the girl was crying more because tom hanks was yelling and it beautiful. the filmmaker is telling the story of a women softball league that traveled the country and did good things for the women movement. in all this movie was good. and there was alot of weird sexual tension between dotty and jimmy. that was so hot. ye,A League of Their Own
150,Blizzy,The best movie in the world!,8,13 January 2000,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!  I swear, I have seen it at least 25 times!  It was wonderfully made and all of the actors are EXCELLENT!  Penny Marshall (the director) did an awesome job on it.  It is a movie about the AAGPBL (All-American Girls Professional Baseball League) team named the Rockford Peaches.  There were only 3 other teams:  Racine, South Bend, and Kanosha (sp?).  Geena Davis stars as Dottie Hinson, also known as ""The Queen of Diamonds.""  She is the kind of person who won't admit that she plays baseball because she loves it.  Her little sister Kit Keller is played by Lori Petty, who acts as the Peaches pitcher.  Tom Hanks is their coach.  Also starring are Madonna (Mae) and Rosie O'Donnell (Doris).  It's an awesome movie, so go see it!!!!",A League of Their Own
151,BeccaLeo,one of my favorite movies of all time,10,24 April 2005,a league of their own is one of my favorite movies of all time. from start to finish it not only makes you laugh but gives you an inside view of women in baseball during the second world war. i had not known until this film came out that women even played baseball in the 1940's while the men were away fighting. history class obviously skipped some things. geena davis gives one of her best performances as dottie hinson a natural born ball player with a heart of gold. dottie watches out for her younger sister kit who is plagued with insecurities and self doubt. dottie and kit are given the chance to be apart of the first women's baseball league and with some insistence on kit's part they go for it. eventually they end up on the same team and the fun begins with laughs from rosie o'donnell and madonna. madonna is wonderful in this movie and i wish she would take a cue from it and do more supporting roles in good comedies/dramas. sibling rivalry consumes kit and dottie takes a loss to give kit the confidence she never had. penny marshall directs with a natural ease and integrity that is rare in Hollywood. why penny hasn't won an academy award for best director is not good by me. this is a movie worth owning! buy the special edition!,A League of Their Own
152,Lorifan,Lori Petty at her best!,10,3 November 2001,"A League of their Own is a top class film.  Touching, intelligent, often laugh out loud funny, its a film of great warmth and emotion.Tom Hanks gives the funniest performance of his career as the Peaches drunk, foul-tempered coach.  Simply superb.Lori Petty, as the feisty young pitcher, Kit Keller, is another highlight, investing her character with great passion and sympathy.Great performances from all concerned, a loving depiction of the period, and a superb Baseball game climax, make this film an absolute treat from start to finish.",A League of Their Own
153,johnraut-58334,A Great Tribute,8,4 January 2019,I am watching this movie for a history through film class. We are watching to see what it was like for women playing baseball in the 40s. For them it was a big deal to get into the hall of fame because at the time there were no women in the hall of fame. When they were chosen to be in the championship they were extremely excited because this was there one chance to get into the hall of fame. It was really cool when they came back to the fields when they were older and saw how much it had changed. It was kind of sad to see the head coach dead at the end because of how much he helped the team.,A League of Their Own
154,kercbark,A league of their own,8,10 January 2019,"I loved the story with this movie of the past history around the 1940's to understand the differnces from then and now. It was well teamwork with these ladies, and this film also adds like a twist of women struggling to prove themselves as athletes in the past. This movie is a part of history due to the time period. I believe women can be just as good as men in sports and if not even better! This movie comes off very powerful and a stand for us women and girls that we can do things just as well as boys and men. Us women had multiple different struggles in the past history with many things, but there was a few girls out there during the time who didn't want the struggle and ended up making many changes for us females living today. Now today, us girls can be and do guy sports and it's just a normal known thing for many. I didn't like the dislike and hatred in some parts of the movie though.",A League of Their Own
155,superjip2000,Tom Hanks's a riot!,8,14 January 2007,"This might strike you as your average sport movie, but it's wrong to assume so. First of all, the choice of a women's baseball league brings along a few other issues. A league of their own gives a nice image of the way men thought of women during World War II. The girls have to look pretty at all times, because that would be the only reason for a crowd to show up. Despite all this, the girls keep their head up and manage to create a strong team spirit. Tom Hanks' coach Jimmy Dugan takes a little credit in this, evolving from a sack-scratching liquor-gulping mad man (watch out for the scene in the bus), into a caring and lovable sport fanatic (still a little mad, though). Although the ending is a bit predictable, A league of their own is a great movie with a lot of fine actors (great performance by Geena Davis), a lot of laughs and a lot of heart. Kudos to Penny Marshall!",A League of Their Own

The reason why i say this is because i am so proud to rate it so high. This movie is really a moviegoers classic, you cant say your a true movie fan and be telling the truth about it if you haven't seenthis movie. This is a very feel good movie and i have loved this movie ever since i was a little girl. Whenever it would be on TV whether in the afternoon i would stay up as long as i needed too to watch this movie. In my opinion everything about this movie was great, The plot was awesome, the acting was perfect, just the right amount of happy tears, sad tears, laughter, and the fact that it is based on actual events, and baseball (baseball is my favorite sport) and that it is really about women proving to people that they can do everything men can do.

157,ahlstrom-31-880802,Unwatchable,3,28 May 2017,I was always surprised this film did so well at the box office. If you are a baseball fan it is almost unwatchable. I like Tom Hanks but he mostly snarls and growls in the film. Madonna is a complete anachronism and painful to watch. Most of the other women are simply irritating. Only Genna Davis is worth watching. Completely fails to capture the spirit of the wartime America. Don't waste your time with this turkey of a film.,A League of Their Own

Major League baseball stopped so to entertain the folks at home and raise spirits the League was formed.At home I have my own 'Hall of Fame' that only SPECIAL movies go into a rack for those unique DVD's that I can turn to for a laugh, a cry or just great family entertaintment. A true historical leap for Women as understandibly they got some 'stick' about the women's league in the beginning. However they became true 'ball players' and fought hard for recognition - which they got (in wagon loads) and this movie shows the popularity of this wonderful Women's League!One memorable quote I recall - ""It's supposed to be hard. If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. The hard ... is what makes it great.""
Sums it all up really - WELL DONE LADIES! Thank you for a classic.A true credit to the 'real' players and to the hard work of all involved which gives us a show well worth watching. 10/10 I'll watch it again!",A League of Their Own

162,tns1,A tribute to a fastly becoming lost generation,9,24 January 2015,"I'd like to vote 10, but I feel its doing the film an injustice. I wasn't a great Madonna fan, yet I love the theme song (and have gelled to her in later years) and being a Brit Baseball, I have played. Yet this film bring out an emotion of a time when a generation was hard done in a world war, the ups and downs of this film leave you with a feeling of I would watch it again. It's hard not to quote from the movie, but to think my mother was once living with all the emotions that every generation has to deal with. I love the whole idea of this type of film. We look back at great times and people who still have a passion. I think all too often we overlook things in the present and make films that are there as money cows, with special effects or some boring theme that all the studios copy until its died a death. My only regret is reading that the soundtrack hasn't got the Madonna song on it and that only a limited version was produced in a shorter time. Madonna should release it as a bonus track, even you-tube do not have the song listed now. But back to the film, I miss my parents and as I get older then I think that I should record things for my kids to read, maybe make a film script themselves. For every generation has a story to tell and I think todays generation will have the hardest yet. But if you want to look back on days of simple pleasure then watch this film.",A League of Their Own

The film had enough to keep my interest for the duration, but not enough to make me think ""Wow, I've just seen a great movie""  There is little in the way on conflict for the talented cast to act around.  Consider Hanks who plays a recovering alcoholic ex ballplayer.  His transformation is not mentioned in any way. One moment drunk and down on himself, the next moment fully recovered and socially functional.  There is no down point of this movie so there is no soaring to an up point.  The movie is even all the way through.  What really peaks your interest is the history behind the league.",A League of Their Own

In fact, it isn't the first time it is exhibited, but for one reason or other I've never had seen it. And I've to say that ""A League Of Their Own"" really touched me. In my country, unlike other Latinamerican like Venezuela, Puerto Rico and -- if I'm not wrong -- Cuba, baseball isn't a popular game, like soccer or tennis. It's played only in some clubs by American citizens or Chilean who lived in the U.S. and learned to play and love it. However, for me the ignorance of the baseball rules is not important, but the fact of that the subjects treated in this movie are universal: fight for a dream and achieve it, solidarity (how beautiful the scene when one of the players teaches to read the one who doesn't know, using a ""little hot"" short-novel), friendship, hope, dignity and the spirit of trying to be always better. From now on, this movie has become one of my favorites, with some other like ""Steel Magnolias"" and ""Fried Green Tomatoes"". Beautiful ones, inspiring, with no-violence and giving a positive message good for our spirits, no matter the zone of the world where you live because, like I've already said, its message is universal: the hope on reaching your dreams and be a better person. And I think that it's marvelous in a world like the present, that sometimes turns so hard to live in. I believe also that it isn't necessary to be American or have had friends or relatives involved in a terrible conflict like the 2nd W.W. to understand this movie. Finally, I'm sorry for my not good English and, if possible, I beg from someone who had had the patience to read this lines up to this point, some additional information about the female baseball league of the United States.

He does appear again as a really old guy at the Hall of Fame, but has no lines. Penny Marshall should have realized what a great job Jon Lovitz was doing and brought the character back from time to time, particularly with a story that tended to drag as often as this one.  Once Lovitz walks down that tunnel at Harvey Field, the only reason to keep watching is Tom Hanks.

The league was founded in 1943, when it briefly appeared that men's baseball would be a casualty of the war, and once the men came marching home it's a wonder the AAGPBL survived until 1954. Then it was consigned to oblivion; history is written by the victors. At the time, it seemed as if the AAGPBL might mean the financial survival of the major league baseball franchises and their owners. The movie gives us a Chicago candy-bar mogol in place of the Wrigleys, and shows his agents scouting the countryside for women who could play ball. In a rural area of Oregon, the scout finds two sisters, Dottie and Kit (Geena Davis and Lori Petty), one who can catch and hit, the other who can throw but is a sucker for high fast balls. He brings them back to Chicago for tryouts with a lot of other hopefuls, including would-be team members played by Madonna, Rosie O'Donnell and Megan Cavanaugh. A coach is needed for the team, which is based in Rockford. The owner (Garry Marshall) recruits Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), a onetime home-run king whose alcoholism has wrecked his career and left him without prospects. For the first few weeks of the season, Dugan can hardly focus on the field, but then he starts to take an interest in his girls, and excitement builds. By the end of the season, Rockford is in the World Series against Racine (no great achievement, since there are only four teams in the league), and the movie, like all sports movies, ends with a great play at the last moment. A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN follows many of the time-honored formulas of sports movies, and has a fair assortment of stock characters (the plain girl who gains confidence, the brash girl with the heart of gold, the jealous sisters), but it has another level that's a lot more interesting. What happened during World War II was that American society, after years of perpetuating the image of the docile little woman who sat at home caring for her lord and master, suddenly found that it needed women who were competent to do hard, skilled work. Rosie the Riveter became a national emblem, Hollywood threw out its romance formulas and started making movies about strong, independent females, and it was discovered that women could actually excel at professional sports. The movie remembers this period from the present; it begins with Dottie Hinson, the Geena Davis character, now older, taking a trip to Cooperstown for ceremonies honoring the AAGPBL. What we learn about Dottie is that she never took women's baseball all that seriously. She was the best player of her time, and yet, in her mind, her life was simply on hold until her husband came back from the war. Dugan, the coach, tells her she lights up when she plays baseballthat something comes over her. But she doesn't seem aware of it. This ambiguity about a woman's role is probably in the movie because it was directed by a woman, Penny Marshall. A man might have assumed that these women knew how all-important baseball was. Marshall shows her women characters in a tug-of-war between new images and old values, and so her movie is about transitionabout how it felt as a woman to suddenly have new roles and freedom. The movie has a real bittersweet charm. The baseball sequences, we've seen before. What's fresh are the personalities of the players, the gradual unfolding of their coach, and the way this early chapter of women's liberation fit into the hidebound traditions of professional baseball. By the end, when the women get together again for their reunion, it's touching, the way they have to admit that, whatdaya know, they really were pioneers.This ambiguity about a woman's role is probably in the movie because it was directed by a woman, Penny Marshall.

179,donnybrookus,This is a great movie,10,25 March 2008,"I'm always pleased to learn about something wonderful I knew nothing about. Combine it with baseball, and how can you lose? The variety of characters, their development, their interaction makes for a touching movie. Terrific performances from Geena Davis, Rosie O'Donnell, Madonna, Tom Hanks and so many others, all of whom know their place in the cast yet have their moments, build into a true team picture. Penny Marshall deserves full credit for bringing this all together. I would love to see a documentary of the history of the league, maybe done by Ken Burns. A moment commented on by others, the black woman who threw the ball back, is so poignant, yet allows the viewers to interpret it for themselves and I would truly enjoy seeing that explored. I fully enjoyed the comment from the woman who was a teammate on a softball team of the woman who played the part. If you haven't seen it - do so. If you have, I bet you've seen it more than once.",A League of Their Own

Tom Hanks as the coach of a womans baseball team, what more could you ask for? Besides that it had humor that was hilarious. This is one of those movies you can catch on tv and watch it every time it comes on and never get bored of it. It's memorable and the other the actresses such as Madonna, Rosie O Donell and Geena Davis did quite well in the roles they played.",A League of Their Own

I have seen League of Their Own no less than 50 times, and each time, I'm delighted and amazed at the comedic thought and timing that Penny Marshall put into this movie. This is the only movie that I can quote verbatim during the dialogue. Such gems as when Jimmy Dugan asks why the bus stopped, then ""Betty Spaghetti"" informs him that ""Lou quit."" Dugan screams, ""Who's Lou?!"" And on another Dugan rant, when Rosie O'Donnell's character mumbles, ""Is that English?"" The expression on the scout's face when he sees how, er, plain-looking Marla looks. His explanation that he has to go home after dropping his recruits off for tryouts, because he needs to shower, shave, and ""give the wife some pickle tickle."" Beyond the funny, fine performances, though, this film has a sweet sadness that makes it real. In the end, these former professional athletes who made it to their golden years come back to be honored in the Baseball Hall of Fame and play in a virtual homecoming game. They all look pretty much like the grandma who you love or who lives down the street from you, but you know that they're women who were brought together because they all had the guts, determination and talent to change the face of American sports.",A League of Their Own

I can't chose a favorite character, but I know everyone deserves some kind of award for this movie.  A display was set up at my work about this movie. There were original uniforms worn by the original Rockford Peaches, Ravine Rockets and so on.  It was awesome.  People kept coming up to me to ask about the movie, because I know everything about it.  :)  If you want to talk about it, email me.",A League of Their Own
185,mystic_bunny,I Loved It!,10,30 December 2000,"I saw this movie long time ago and I still watch this movie. ""A League of Their Own"" is absolutely hilarious and also has some drama. I think this movie owes a big one to the actors who brought so much fun. Geena Davis plays Dottie Hinson, a loving sister who has some troubles with her younger sister, Kit, and struggles on making decisions of wether she should stay in baseball team (Rockford Peaches) or go back to her home with her husband who just came back from World War II with broken arm(or was it a leg?). It surprised me when I found out that Geena was inches taller than most of the women in the movie. She showed off many fascinating stunts, such as catching a flying baseball with one hand and sliding like a ballerina when catching the foul ball. She was great.Tom Hanks was hilarious as Jimmy Dugan, an alcoholic hitter who became a baseball coach of Rockford Peaches. Jim hates that job, but as the time goes by, he realizes that the girls are very good and he gets pretty enthusiastic about the game and all. I love the part when he gets frustrated and shouts, ""There's no crying in baseball!"" and gets on a fight with the judge. Jimmy Dugan is probably one of Tom's best characters so far.Another great performance by Lori Petty, who played Geena Davis' sister, Kit. Kit is a very good player, but she gets jealous of Dottie and eventually joins another team called Racines. Somehow, I loved her performance.Then there are other great actings by Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell. They are somewhat nasty girls in the team who happen to be two close best friends. They bring so much joy to this movie and I loved the dancing scene at the bar. Madonna plays her part really well and Rosie is just great as always.Megan Cavannagh was funny also. She played Marla Hooch, who was obviously one of the best players in the team, but unfortunately her looks did matter when she was joining the team. Even though she might not be a best singer (scene at the bar was funny!), she met a great man and got married. Ann Cusack, who played Shirley Baker was pretty forgettable, but she played the sweetest role. Other roles like a player who is a mother of a naughty son (can't remember her name, though) was also sweet, and the player who lost her husband made me cry. A pretty blonde player who used to be Miss Georgia was good also. Jon Lovitz plays a scout and gives the hilarious lines and I wish he had played more. And don't miss Tea Leoni as the Racine player! She appears in some scenes, so keep your eyes open. And the older version of the characters looked so much like the younger versions. Especially the Old Dottie Hinson.So if you are depressed and want to watch a funny, witty movie and just have some fun - go and rent this movie. I would give 3 1/2 out of 5 (probably not a breath-taking film, but very entertaining).",A League of Their Own
186,christy8907,A Great Film,10,2 July 2006,"I can truly watch this movie over and over again and still be inspired by it. I think it shows just what women are capable of. If u haven't seen it i strongly recommend it. It remains at the top of my list and i've seen many award winning movies. It is filled with an amazing cast. It will make u cry and the best part is that there are some true facts. There was this league of women made after most male baseball players had gone to fight in the war. There's romance, fighting, comedy, and some dancing. I mean it has everything a movie needs to be enjoyable. Believe me it wont be a waste of time. You can watch this movie with family and friends.",A League of Their Own
187,Volkvolny-39537,Hit it Out of the Park!,10,18 June 2020,"A League of Their Own is a baseball film based on the true story of the professional women's baseball league, the AAGPBL. The film stars well-known actors Tom Hanks as Jimmy Dugan, Geena Davis as Dottie Hinson, and Madonna as Mae Mordabito. Taking place during World War II, men's baseball is shut down as most husbands and brothers are overseas fighting. Thus, in order to provide the people with entertainment, the professional women's baseball league is formed. After baseball tryouts and teams are created, the movie primarily centers around the story of the Rockford Peaches and their journey to the first ever Women's World Series.Being the first professional women's baseball league, there was a lot of displeasure expressed by the people. This was challenging the status quo that they had known for many years, and as thus, they did not want to see women anywhere but in the kitchen. This idea has been done in a couple other films such as the animated movie Mulan, where although women were expected to stay at home and cook and have a husband, Mulan challenged the norm and became a soldier in the Chinese army.The way that Dottie, her sister Kit, and the rest of the Peaches fought for the right to play ball demonstrates how strong this theme is for the film, and several scenes connect with this theme. One is when Dottie went out of her way to impress the media towards the beginning of the season. The league had not been able to get a large enough crowd interested in coming to games, and the lack of profits was beginning to cause second thoughts for the league's owner. Thus, a manager of the league told Dottie and the Peaches that they needed to put on a show for the media that came to the game so they could boost attendance. In response, Dottie went so far as to do the splits to catch a foul ball, earning her the front page of the paper. This caught the people's eye, and they began to come to more games, worrying less about the notion that it was women's baseball.Another scene is when the team is shown in the beauty and manner school. The owner of the baseball league had told the women that unless they took proper lessons on how to be a lady, they could not play ball. Hesitant at first, all the girls committed to the classes in the end, a sacrifice they were willing to make in order to play ball and show other young girls that loved the game that they could play too. They were dedicated to challenging the norm, and were thus ready to do what it took to play the game they love.One technique the film uses well is use of colour and black and white. Often, films had to decide if they would film in colour or black and white. But in some movies, they utilize both. A League of Their Own demonstrates this technique of using both when they showed all the television programs in the movie in black and white. It was representative of T.V. at that point in time where all shows were in black and white. One of the programs shown on T.V. also discussed the shock of women playing baseball, tying into the theme of challenging the social norm.
The other technique the film used was symbolism through association with character. In the beginning of the film, we see that Dottie's sister, Kit, is unable to hit high balls, and this haunts her throughout the film. Kit constantly feels overshadowed by her older sister, and her inability to hit high balls sticks with her as a result. At the end of the film in the World Series, Dottie tells the Peaches' pitcher to throw Kit high balls as she cannot hit them, symbolism of their game where Kit missed them earlier in the movie. Kit misses the first two, but swings and hits the third, winning her team the World Series. This symbolic moment of hitting the high ball represents Kit's growth as a player, and her independence from her sister's shadow. It's a great use of character symbolism to show growth and development.A League of Their Own is a timeless classic that demonstrates how important challenging the status quo is. In the film, it was challenging the idea that only boys play baseball that created an entire professional women's baseball league. To this day, it still takes challenging the norm to get a movement going or a change in motion.",A League of Their Own
188,hanhamrv,"""There's no crying in baseball""",9,18 June 2020,"The 1992 film A League of Their Own, filmed by Penny Marshall, stars Tom Hanks who plays Jimmy Dugan (the manager), Geena Davis who plays Dottie Hinson (catcher), Lori Petty who plays Kit Keller(kid sister to Dottie and pitcher), Doris Murphy played by Rosie O'Donnell(third baseman for the Rockford Peaches), and Madonna who plays Mae Mordabito (outfielder for the Rockford Peaches). The film is about how the two sisters, Dottie and Kit, are recruited to play in the first ever women's professional baseball league. They tryout and both make the Rockford Peaches. You follow Dottie's character as you see the struggle between sisters, the fear at the thought of her husband off at war, the struggle of keeping the league alive, and the bond that is created within the team throughout the season. Dottie and Jimmy become close after Dottie shows him that she can play ball. With the help of Dottie, Jimmy turns away from alcohol and becomes a nicer person to the girls. However, Kit and Dottie's relationship become tainted when Kit finds out that she has been traded because of her sister not wanting to be on the same team as her anymore. Dottie then leaves the league before the World Series game to go back home with her husband, who made it home safe from the war, only to turn back around and play in the last game of the world series. Dottie ends up costing the game by dropping the ball after her sister Kit rams into her at home plate. Dottie and Kit make up after the game, and then we are brought back to present day where Dottie joins her team once more for the opening a women's baseball section in the baseball hall of fame(Marshall, Abbott, and Greenhut, 1992).
The theme for this movie is your actions can impact those around you, which is also a theme that can be seen in the movie Hidden Figures. Throughout the movie you follow Dottie through this memory of hers, but the thing that you don't completely notice is how much her actions and presence impacts the people around her. Dottie is willing to put on a show, like doing the splits while catching a foul ball, in order to draw more attention to the women's baseball league. By doing this she is giving her teammates a chance to have their own independent thing that doesn't involve them being a housewife or being abused by their husbands. They are able to continue to find their own self worth through this league that Dottie helped keep alive. Another example is Dottie's relationship with Kit and Jimmy. Kit has always felt as though she lived in her sister's shadow her entire life. The only reason Kit got into the league in the first place was because Dottie refused to go without her. At the end of the movie Dottie drops the ball, letting her sister and her team win the World Series. This act alone helped her sister get out of her shadow and be happy by herself. While Dottie helps be a better influence in Jimmy's life. She shows him that her team can play baseball, that he doesn't need alcohol, and she shows him how to treat the women with more respect. You can see this change when he goes from yelling at Bitty (played by Evelyn Gardner) for over throwing the ball to the point she cries to at the end of the movie holding back his anger and telling her to do better. All of these examples just show how her presence and actions had an impact on the people around her.
Two techniques or elements that help get this theme through are dialogue and angle. The use of dialogue as a way of showing how the way people talk and interact together has developed throughout the movie. Once again, I refer to the development of Jimmy thanks to Dottie. He went from a yelling at everyone or even sometime not speaking to him at all to speaking more calmly and even to admit that these girls can play. You get to see a true character development thanks to the fact that Dottie was willing to stand up to him and guide him down a better path. The director uses angles to focus in on Dottie's faces when she is having to make tough choices throughout the film. Like when Dottie is told that they want to do a article on her in order to draw more attention to the league. The camera goes to her face as she is thinking about the choices she has to make and hears about how Mae doesn't want to go back to her old job. Then in the next scene right before she goes to catch a pop up, you can see that she is thinking about finding a way to catch the photographer's attention. This leads to her doing the splits while catching the ball in order to put on a show and get a good photo. Her actions spike the interest in the league and save it from going under. Using these angles shows the audience that Dottie is thinking through her actions because she knows that they impact those around her. These two techniques back up the theme and show how Dottie thought through her actions knowing that they impacted those around her.",A League of Their Own
189,dawseo,"""The hard is what makes it great.""",8,29 April 2021,"Who doesn't love America's favorite pastime? Baseball has been around for generations that has only become more popular over the years. But let's rewind to the WWII era where most of the country had the men to go off to war to fight for our freedom. When the men went off to work, massive amounts of the jobs were vacant with desperately needing workers, so the ladies stepped in to take those jobs. And that is where we pick up this movie where these courageous and strong ladies tried out and became the first players in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). The theme of this movie is where through passion, strength, and courage anything is possible, even when numerous people are counting you out. Well-known actors who played in the movie is Geena Davis as Dottie Hinson; Lori Petty as Kit Keller; Tom Hanks as Jimmy Dugan; Madonna, who played Mae Mordabito; and Rosie O'Donnell, who played Doris Murphy.Dottie Hinson is approached by an Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz), a scout for this upcoming baseball league and asks her to try out even though she is not interested. Hearing this Dottie's kid sister Kit Keller is adamant in wanting to try out. She then makes a deal that if Dottie try's out, then Kit can come along and try out herself. She does convince Dottie to try out, and then they were off. The try outs are all completed these two find out that they both made the Rockford Peaches team where Jimmy Dugan is a former MLB player that has been hired in as the manager of the Peaches. All the efforts that those players conveyed has cemented them into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown under the name of the ""Women of Baseball"" exhibit which was opened on November 5, 1988. It is to help tell the stories to current and future generations about the professional women's baseball league.I would loosely relate this movie to another sports movie in 42: The Jackie Robinson Story. This movie is also showcasing strength, passion, and courage that Jackie Robinson had to endure to be the first African American baseball player in an all-white league. He had to show amounts of courage that not many normal others would be able to take. He paved the way for what we know today in all major sports.The lighting used in the movie fits the idea of a sports movie where it is bright, sunny, and always energetic. Not many people think of sports as having a bad weather day, since no one wants to play or sit in one of those games. This helps relate to the theme because to showcase strong independence, you would need to be having the games feel like they have absolute power. So, they kept a good sunlight and never a dull, gray backdrop to help convey this feeling. The music in the movie is very upbeat and keeps you entertained. There isn't a real slow time in the movie because there is always something else about to happen. One major scene involving some bright lights and music is where the ladies decide to sneak away and go to a bar where they have a nice fun night of partying and dancing. The music played does have a real dance feel making you want to get out and dance yourself.I do feel that the theme for ""A League of Their Own"" has to show the intense and powerful times that were happening during the era of time and they all did their part to have a sort of ""break from reality"" with having some sort of entertainment. Through passion, strength, and courage, anything is possible.",A League of Their Own

It has all around great elements to it- a phenomenal cast, hilarious comedy, great history, just to name a few. However, being an athlete, my favorite part of this movie is how authentic the portrayal of the sport of baseball is. I cannot tell you how mad it makes me when I see a movie and a sport is so badly portrayed. Its like the casting directors were too lazy and decided to find actors that could pretend to play rather than take the time to find athletes that could pull off acting! I truly commend Penny Marshall for making actors pass a baseball playing test before even being allowed to read the script. It really ""made"" the film because viewers were not distracted by the flaws in the game playing, but could just sit back and enjoy it! I give it 10 stars!",A League of Their Own
193,mrserinmills,A movie about sister relationships,7,29 January 2011,"A league of their own is a story about women playing baseball while the men are away at war. The movie focuses on two players that are sisters, Dottie Hinson (Geena Davis/Anne Cartwright) and Kit Keller (Lori Petty/Kathleen Butler). These two sisters play for a local softball team and are scouted to play professional while the men are away at war. Dottie doesn't want to leave home and play baseball she is happy at home waiting for her husband to return from the war, Kit on the other hand is very excited and anxious to leave home.The entire movie is about the focus on these two sisters and their differences. Kit is forever finding herself in her sister, Dottie's shadow, but Dottie doesn't care as much about the game as Kit does. Kit and Dottie find themselves on different teams because of the competition and family disputes, and face off in the World Series. The winning play comes down to Kit running for home base while Dottie tries to get Kit out, because Kit's determination of the game is stronger Kit slams into her sister and wins the game.The movie focuses on these two characters and their complex sibling relationship. The movie portrays Dottie as a better player than Kit but she doesn't have the heart for it, Dottie's only care is her husband and mentions a few times throughout the film that she just wants to be home with him. Kit has a drive to get away from her home, and to not be compared to her sister anymore. Even though Kit and Dottie see things differently the movie shows that siblings can have a complex relationship.This movie reminded me of the Spitfire Grill, a movie about a girl joining a ""family"", she was perceived to be different and she was trying to earn their acceptance. Like the woman in the Spitfire Grill, Kit knew she was different than her sister and wasn't traditional like Dottie. Kit was forever trying to establish her own name, and be herself not a shadow. Percy in the Spitfire Grill was trying to be herself, even though she wasn't a traditionalist like the locals and was having a hard time trying to establish herself from this pre-conceived idea that the locals had about her.This movie starts out showing Dottie as an older woman preparing to go to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, where they will recognize the Women in Baseball, and then the movie begins a flashback as Dottie remembers how she joined with her sister and how the first league was played. The movie had great bright lighting, and soft colors on the uniform and throughout while in the 40's. Other references were made that made it realistic for the time, like the woman radio announcer speaking about the women being drug from their homes and children to play baseball and she told Mr. Harvey that ""like your candy you are nuts"". The rules that were enforced on the ladies that played baseball also represented the time that it was set in. The women were not allowed to smoke, have men around, and had to take classes on how to be more lady like. The movie did a good job of bringing in authentic time characteristics.This movie shows just one aspect of how the women in the 40's had to fill in for the men while they were away at war, but the plot of the movie really focused on the two sisters and their relationship.",A League of Their Own

The only thing I have a problem with is when Dottie & Kit meet at the Hall of Fame Ceremony near the end of the movie. Is it just me or is the woman who plays an older Kit going into convulsions when she hugs Dottie. Her eyes are blinking faster than the red lights on a railroad crossing gate and it looks like she is having a spasm. It also looks like she can't swallow and is about to pass out. Then when they line up for the official photo, Kit is waiving her arms like she has cerebral palsy and looks like a total retard. Maybe it is just me that sees the scene this way, but the next time you watch this great movie, please look closely at this meeting between Dottie & Kit and let me know if you see it my way or not.

196,inskee04-431-601895,Full Review of the film A League of Their Own,8,24 July 2012,"The film A League of Their Own follows two sisters, Dottie Henson (Geena Davis) and Kit Keller (Lori Petty), on their journey from rural Oregon to the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. They ran into characters that shaped their lives, Marla Hooch (Megan Cavanagh), Ernie Capadino (Jon Lovitz), Jimmy Dugan (Tom Hanks), and many more, along the way that allowed these two women grow from bickering sisters to in the end respected equals. The theme of this movie is sibling rivalry and how no matter where you are or what you have done in life at some point in time siblings must become equals. This theme reflects the type of theme you could find in such films as Lion King and Thor where that rivalry spurs a tumultuous relationship.Dottie Henson was always the toast of the small town that these two girls grew up in, and until a scout, Ernie Capadino, discovered Dottie for the new professional women's baseball league forming due to the war it looked like the two girls would forever live in the small town and Kit forever in Dottie's shadow. As they became Rockford Peaches and grew together through this league and the bonding found within the team there were still moments where Kit felt constantly outdone by the star of the league her big sister Dottie. Dottie was constantly favored by their coach and her friend Jimmy Dugan as well as the man running the league itself Ira Lowenstein (David Strathairn).This theme and conflict ultimately ends up with a fight between the sisters where Kit gets traded to Racine, but as you will find out after viewing the film Kit may end up getting the last laugh. Ultimately the women end up respecting one another and Kit feels vindicated and can truly consider Dottie a sister and a friend instead of something in her life holding her back.There are moments where the techniques used by the filmmakers allow the viewer to get a great glimpse into what the sisters are feeling towards one another. In the final game of their series to determine the champion of the league, in the heat of the game the director decides to constantly go to close-ups of both Dottie and Kit as they are facing off in this battle of wills. The viewer can see the confidence, yet sympathy of Dottie as she feels for her sister and all of her trials. The viewer also can see the fear of losing in Kit's face, but this fear is accompanied by a raw determination. The other element of film that brought this theme to life was the intense dialogue brought to us in a phenomenal script. In one scene where Kit has been traded the big argument takes place, and with the dialogue accompanied by tremendous performances by Geena Davis and Lori Petty the viewer is watching such an intense and raw moment that you can actually feel Kit's desperation and Dottie's anger and frustration.This film set in the backdrop of an upside-down era of World War II speaks to millions of children and young adults going through this very same theme in their lives. Sibling rivalry is something most families go through in our society and A League of Their Own portrays in a wonderfully made film how siblings can and should overcome these issues so they can become friends and respected peers. With love and respect the most strained relationship can be mended as long as the two individuals are willing to put their differences aside and embrace what makes them two great people and A League of Their Own illustrates that in an entertaining film for all.",A League of Their Own
197,morgan72,A must see,8,22 September 2012,"A woman's baseball league was being formed during the War World II to fill in for the men who were at war. Geena Davis who plays Dottie and Lori Pety who plays her little sister Kit were both picked to go try out for the league. Baseball was Kit's passion but the recruiter initially only wanted Dottie and she wasn't interested. With the recruiter giving Kit and ultimatum that she can try out only if Dottie does, the two were on their way to the big leagues. Both were recruited to the same team but because little sister Kit was always in her Dottie's shadow it created problems that would eventually make the two split. Coached by Tom hanks who plays Jimmy Dugan, a drunk belligerent former baseball player who believes his job is a joke eventually pushes the ladies to step up to the plate to get the crowd interested. Kit was eventually traded to the rival team which started the sister's fall out. Years later the women all reunited in the grand opening of The All American Women section of the hall of fame and there they all reminisced about the past.The two themes that best fit this movie would be the struggle for human dignity and the complexity of human relationships. In this film Dottie struggles with over shadowing her little sister all the time. She can't help that she good in whatever she does but can't stand that her little sister blames her for her short comings. Kit as well struggles with human dignity because she not better than her sister she resents her sister and always lashes out on her because she angry with herself. The complexity of human relationships were presented through the entire film whether it be Jimmies relationship with the entire team, Kitt and Dottie's relationship and Mae and Doris's relationship. Jimmie didn't care for the team at first until they start winning, Dottie and Kit had their sister issue but who doesn't and Mae and Doris had that best friend relationship that everyone longs for. This movie reminds me of the movie Love and Basketball because it establishes a relationship between two people and shows what the love of a sport can do to deter that friendship. It is a must see if you haven't seen it already.",A League of Their Own
198,MovieGrl83,A wonderful film,10,14 August 2006,"This movie always makes me feel good when I watch it. It's got a feel to it that a lot of people can relate to. I happen to be a baseball/softball fan, but even if your not, you will still enjoy this movie! I think that the time-line was captured very well. The acting in this movie was well done too. Many people said that a female director wouldn't do this film any good. I think that this movie needed a female director and it couldn't have been done any better! This is one of Tom Hanks best movies by far. If you are in the mood to watch a great movie that will leave you with a good, energizing feeling, than I recommend this movie!",A League of Their Own
199,foster58,"Women playing professional baseball leagues, a big turning point for our country.",10,23 March 2013,"A League of their own is a great movie. I have watched it several times over the years. This is one of them films that I could never get tired of watching. When I first seen this film for the first time I thought it was neat that women were playing baseball professionally. What appeared to me most was women were doing something something different then what they was expected to do. This movie just proves that women can be just as good at sports as men are.During World War two a lot of jobs became available to women, including baseball. Candy manufacturing magnate Walter Harvey comes up with a plan to start a professional women's baseball league, so he sends scout Ernie Capadino to recruit players. Capadino comes across Dottie Hinson in Oregon. He is very impressed and offers her a shot at tryouts but she is not interested. However her younger sister Kit Keller loves baseball and is really interested, but the scout is not interested in Kit. Eventually Capadino tells Kit she can come along if Dottie comes and try's out. So the two set off to Chicago for tryouts. Both of the them make the same team, The Peaches, which is coached by a drunkard former baseball player Jimmy Dugan. He thinks this whole thing is a joke and does nothing but stay drunk in the pit. Dottie guides and directs the team. Jimmy gets to see how good the team really is and then steps up to the plate of being coach. With Dottie doing something spectacular the team ends up in being successful.",A League of Their Own

First time watch, and I completely understand the cult standing.What I appreciated more than anything is the recognition the main character had that baseball was a part of her life, but not her life as it was her sisters.",A League of Their Own
201,firecat38s,During time of war females successfully fill the American need for baseball.,10,26 August 2005,"After reading the previous 'critique' of this film, I will state that I didn't view the film on individual performances. I do believe that the cast was able to work together, much like a well oiled baseball/softball team should. The performances were stellar all around..why?? Because for 2 hours you were able to loose yourself in the concept of the movie. For those of us that ARE ex-baseball/softball players this film was able to give us a nostalgic back flash. Oh, and by the way........for persons who love the game, and I am speaking for all of the players who have a love of the game......switching from a softball to a baseball poses NO problems.",A League of Their Own
202,POSTALJPV8,"four stars, Umpire Cooperstown 's uncredited with line. lacks in interest in a few stops.",8,26 December 2004,"The movie was great and the action for baseball was fine. It kept you in the movie till the end.I could not give this movie a five star rating. Behind the scenes: I tried to get into this movie too. Noticed the crews were a bit unfriendly.I heard Penny Marshall was a bit rude. Everyone else was polite, but all business. A fact that is not present is that CHET M. COLLINS plays the umpire and even says a line in the end credits. The line is posted in his garage at his home. He is a real or was an official umpire with union card. He umpired at Double Day Park often, and up to his retirement umpired at Cooperstown Dream Parks. He partied with the real team players and enjoyed their company in Indiania. The Documentary on the laser disc was very interesting and informative. You see him few times in the end credits and a slight appearance in the beginning. His wife Phyllis was an extra in the grandstands. They are retired Springfield Center lifelong farmers. I own the only copy at this time of a signed copy by Chester Collins in laser. Watch it to see his line. Hint: mentions balls and strikesHE SHOULD BE ADDED TO CREDITS JOHN VRIESEMA",A League of Their Own
203,tammyh99341,feel good movie,10,11 August 2005,"I absolutely love this movie! It makes me feel good to watch it. The choices they made for the cast was perfect. I am so glad it was Geena and not Debra Winger in the role of Dottie. I was also unaware that Betty ""Spaghetti"" was Penny Marshals daughter. I have seen this movie at least 40 times, my kids enjoy it as well and have looked up a lot of info on the A.A.G.P.B.L. It is fun to see the little goofs in the movie, Our favorite is Rosie falling when they take the field. I hope that you all enjoy this movie as much as we have. There are not very many good movies out there anymore! I would love to go the the baseball hall of fame and see the stuff they have there on these great gals.",A League of Their Own
204,KatyCarter,i love it,10,13 August 2005,"I'm only 17 but this is my favourite film ever , i live in UKand don't even like baseball but i love this film and watch it all the time , i think all the actors/ actresses are great!!!!!. Its so sad and makes me cry all the time ,i just made my friend watch it and he loved it as well. I've seen it over 50 times and have only just brought it on DVD over here. i think it should have won a lot more awards as it is great and by far my favourite film. I think the casting was great and Gena Davis did a great job and Rosie o Donnell was very fun and they are all really good at playing baseball as well. Tom hanks is great as usual i love every film he does hes the best and Madonna was cool as Mae. i love this film so much and saw it first when i was 6 now I'm nearly 18 and its been my favourite film ever since then, nothing beats it,",A League of Their Own
205,sheeda,Best Movie EVER,10,25 August 2005,"A League of Their Own is the greatest movie of ALL TIME. The cast is brilliant, solid acting, excellent cinematography...the whole package. This movie is long, but it draws you in to each character and follows three perfectly woven story lines that keep your attention throughout. The writing is hilarious, moving, intense, informative, touching, and inspiring. A League of Their Own is the most quotable movie ever made with such popular gems as ""there's no crying in baseball"" and ""the hard is what makes it great"". The characters will steal your heart and give you the sense that you're living their victories and defeats along with them. It is appropriate enough for the entire family and entertaining enough for any group. I would not classify it as a sports movie or a chick flick...just a really good film. You have no?[",A League of Their Own

207,drwingirlsinc,"These courageous women are truly in ""A League of Their Own"" ....",10,18 March 2018,"Warning this review has spoilers!A wonderful film that revisits the days of women in professional baseball at the onset of World War II. Reluctantly, Dottie Hinson played by (Geena Davis) along with, sister Kit Keller played by (Lori Petty) are recruited and make the cut to join an All-American Girls Baseball League, alongside Mae Mordabito played by Madonna and Doris Murphy played by Rosie O'Donnell. Their team the Rockford Peaches is managed by former baseball great Jimmy Dugan played by (Tom Hanks). Throughout the film there are struggles with the complexity of human relationships and each character makes the most of their newly found roles as women baseball players during the war.Dottie struggles with the idea of attending a reunion of former players and her sister Kit, whom she hasn't seen in many years, at the first induction of women players in the Baseball Hall of Fame. The motif that is represented in this film is a bus. Dottie returns to the Doubleday Field and reunion on a newer Greyhound Bus. After Dottie arrives she began to reminisce of the time that she spent as a Rockford Peach. The more modern music soundtrack that is playing transitions to the music of an old Columbia Movie-Scope clip that gives headway to what the baseball league is going through during the war efforts, Black and white film is also used to show how this portion of the film clip is a flashback. During their time as a Peach several of the women's husbands were away at war, including Dottie's, and women began playing professional baseball to keep the league going so it could help support the war. Although, Dottie did not want to leave her home in Oregon and her traditional role of a wife, she chose to leave home so that her sister Kit could have a chance to play in the league. With the use of invisible sound, the train whistle breaks the silent thoughts of Dottie when she decides to take Kit up on pleads to try out for the league. Kit had to work through the problem of low self-esteem, because the league did not want to recruit her without her sister. Kit was self-conflicted because Dottie was haled as the ""better"" sister, taller, faster, prettier, smarter, bossier and a better baseball player. Whereas, in the film Death at a Funeral brothers Aaron, the older brother, played by (Chris Rock) and Ryan, the younger brother, played by Martin Lawrence had a similar struggle with their relationship but the roles were reversed.During the era of the war, in the year of 1943 it was very nontraditional for women to be ball players. They were subjected to heavy scrutiny because they were taking on roles of men, by playing baseball and traveling from town to town on buses. Several of the players endured receiving telegrams telling the fate of their husbands in the war, Doris met a pair of new love interests and let her old relationship go, all the while of living in transition traveling from town to town on a bus. However, Dottie's husband returned from the war and she decided to leave the team to return to Oregon with her husband, because living the life of a professional ball player was too hard.Enduring the change of the times, relationships, love, marriage and losses being a woman playing professional baseball in 1943 was a very liberating but hard thing to do. ""It's supposed to be hard, if it wasn't hard everyone would do it, the hard is what makes it great!"" stated Jimmy Dugan as the team leaves for the first Women's World Series (Abbott, 1992).",A League of Their Own
208,patrick_higgs,"One of the Most Fun Movies, Watch it Again!",10,20 February 2006,"I was lucky enough to get to work on ""A League of Their Own"" as one of the main extras.Filmed mostly in Southern Indiana, Evansville's Bosse Field and Huntingburg's League Stadium are the sites for the majority of the films baseball scenes.And yes it was HOT! We began filming in Southern Indiana in a small town called St. Phillips (the softball scenes for Geena and Lori) A calf was born, and was named Penny in honor of the director. Filming moved on to the Huntingburg stadium and lasted several weeks. Although a few of the extras were paid, most of them were actually there for free. Through the heat, the retakes, the bad food, and did I mention the heat? It was an amazing scene to watch the filming and then see the final product become such a beloved hit.More trivia, the scene in which the shortstop throws the ball at the heckler was of course staged--but in the first rehearsal---SHE ACTUALLY DID IT- From the short stop position. They had to pad the guy and made her throw off so not to hit the guy again.During breaks in the filming, Penny would hit up local antique shops. She loved buying antiques. Yes she really does drink milk and Pepsi.Tom Hanks got a break as a director on this film, he was allowed to film pick up shots. I got to be in one, but it is on the cutting room floor somewhere. :( To the reviewer who thought the baseball the girls played was all faked, it wasn't. Most of the shots of the girls playing ball are real, and many of them were actually very good at it.The stunt double for Geena in the split catch scene was actually a guy. His name was Michael and he ran a local college radio station.There was a scene which was cut from the film in which Marla is injured during a play. Later to find out that Marla is expecting a child. This scene was completely cut out.Although she was not a major star, Rosie O'Donnell was very shy around most of the ""stars."" She spent a lot of time with the extras. I remember being the one who encouraged her to spend more time with Madonna, and as we all know that friendship became famous.It was a fun movie to film and even more fun to watch. I can honestly say I will never get tired of seeing this one and it was definitely one of happiest experiences in my life.",A League of Their Own
