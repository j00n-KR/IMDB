0,Leofwine_draca,Heartfelt and enthralling,9,19 April 2017,"THE PIANIST is a film that takes a dark and disturbing subject matter - the persecution of the Warsaw Jews by Nazis in the Second World War - and turns it into a spellbinding, enthralling journey of a movie. Roman Polanski could easily have made this maudlin and sentimental like Spielberg's SCHINDLER'S LIST, but he thankfully avoids that temptation and the result is the much better movie of the two.This film contains a documentary-style realism in its depiction of the various atrocities carried out by the uncaring Germans. It gets dark and darker as it goes on, and yet the viewer is unable to tear his eyes off the screen because it's all so well-realised and realistic. Adrien Brody plays the eyes and ears of the viewer in a subdued manner, yet delivers his greatest and most believable performance as a result. The story has a lot of darkness and violence, but Polanski's expert camera-work and endless style stops the subject matter ever becoming depressing; instead there's enough tension to keep you involved and wanting to find out what's next. Things build to a suitably touching and poignant climax that doesn't disappoint.",The Pianist
1,SnoopyStyle,non-heroism,7,19 September 2016,"It's 1939 Warsaw. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Jew and a pianist on the radio. He falls for Polish girl Dorota. The Germans invade and the Szpilman family expects to live through another war. However, their lives slowly deteriorate as government decrees force them into the Jewish ghetto. Itzak Heller tries to recruit Wlad and his brother Henryk into the Jewish police but they refuse. As his family is put on trains, Wlad is pulled out by Itzak. Wlad joins the resistance and smuggles in material. He sneaks out and finds friends who help to hide him. He witnesses the Germans battling their way into the ghetto from his hiding place. He finds help from Dorota who is now married and pregnant. From his hiding place, he witnesses the start of the Warsaw uprising.Roman Polanski delivers a depiction of a survivor of the Holocaust. He is more or less passive for too long until pushed. He survives due to kindness of others. He does not fight not due some moral stand but rather a lack of proactive heroism. It's a rather disengaging trait although I can see Polanski's point of view. The other annoying aspect is his surprise and constant reaction to the shocking inhumanity. None of this makes him less realistic. In many ways, he's a very human character and flawed not in any evil ways. It doesn't make him an easy, or appealing character. The world is well constructed. The most compelling scene is actually when the family is stuck waiting out in the sun for the train. The train has been done every time but to wait in a holding pen is more unusual. This is a great Holocaust movie but the leading character is unusually not so appealing.",The Pianist
2,Hitchcoc,Tour de Force,10,10 September 2009,"There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto. This is a film we should all see.",The Pianist
3,claudio_carvalho,"Another Movie About the Massacre of Jews in the Second World War, With an Outstanding Performance of Adrien Brody",7,18 January 2004,"Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Polish Jewish pianist very famous in Warsaw. When Germany invades Poland, his wealthy family and him are sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. Them they are sent to Treblinka, but Szpilman escapes in the train station. He struggles to survive, hidden in the most different places and depending on friend's sympathy to stay alive. He survives the war and died in the year 2000. This movie is a super production, very well directed by Roman Polanski and having an outstanding performance of Adrien Brody. However, this sad story does not present anything that was not showed before, like, for example, `Schindler`s List' did some years ago. There is a good movie (`Uprising' (2001), TV), showing better the events of the Warsow Ghetto uprising, but the intention of `The Pianist' is to show the true saga of Szpilman. I can perfectly understand that Jewish persons, who are majority in the cinema industry, have a great interest in keeping alive the atrocities of the Second World War. But these movies are very repetitive, showing horrible dramas of the most different survivors, or persons who died. However, there are so many other massacres of races to be explored through the human history and unfortunately they are not showed in movies like the murder of Jewish in the WWII. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): `O Pianista' (`The Pianist')",The Pianist
4,classicsoncall,"""You musicians don't make good conspirators.""",10,3 February 2013,"Fortunately, I'm able to keep my personal feelings about Roman Polanski compartmentalized enough to say that this was a remarkable film. I've read many comparisons between ""The Pianist"" and ""Schindler's List"" on this board, and even though the films are quite different, the overpowering portrayals of Man's inhumanity against Man will leave the viewer forever affected. Adrien Brody's Best Actor award was stunningly achieved here, as his character arcs through an incredible series of circumstances to barely survive life in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. What little I knew of director Polanski outside of his marriage to Sharon Tate, the grisly Manson murders, and his rape conviction in the late 1970's, was put into an entirely different perspective when I learned about his own life in the Polish Ghetto. Much of what we see in the film must emanate from his own unique experience as a child during the War and experiencing Nazi atrocity first hand. I don't envy anyone who survived that experience enduring the painful daily memories of those times.Given the film's title, I guess I was somewhat surprised by the paucity of musical sequences, though what was offered was artistically presented. Particularly poignant was the scene when Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) was left to hide in an apartment where a piano was available, and he mimed his way through a selection from memory by the need to maintain silence.Many years following the end of World War II, a single film cannister simply marked ""The Ghetto"" was discovered, revealing valuable insight into how the Nazi propaganda machine attempted to manipulate public opinion about 'rich' Jews who lived in luxury alongside fellow Jews in squalid conditions. Even more intimate details of life in the Warsaw Ghetto are presented in ""Shtikat Haarchion"" (A Film Unfinished), describing conditions that are even more horrific than those depicted in ""The Pianist"" or ""Schindler's List"", if that can even be imagined. These movies exist for a higher calling as a constant reminder that the term ""Never Again"" be one to constantly take seriously in an ever increasingly dangerous world.",The Pianist
5,gavin6942,"An Excellent Movie, Of Course",7,19 May 2010,"I don't have much to say on this movie, other than that it was very good. Adrien Brody is a fine actor and this is probably his finest role (though I'm partial to ""The Jacket"").My only real concern with this film ,and it shouldn't be seen as a slight against it, is that it seems that making a film about the Holocaust makes a film automatically better. I'm not sure if it's because it evokes emotions or what, but this film, ""Schindler's List"" and others quickly rise to the top of the list of good films... World War II in general seems to do this, but the Holocaust even more so. It's an odd phenomenon.",The Pianist
6,lee_eisenberg,"well done, even if it didn't quite equal ""Schindler's List""",9,23 May 2006,"In what I assume was Roman Polanski's most personal movie ever, he tells the story of Polish-Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) doing everything possible to survive the Nazi occupation. As is the case with all of Polanski's movies, there are some very harrowing scenes, namely when the Nazi planes first start bombing the city, and when Szpilman has to hide. As Szpilman, Brody really brings out the most in the character (no doubt his sad face helps with that).I will say that the movie doesn't quite equal the profundity achieved by ""Schindler's List"". But maybe that's not a fair comparison, since Polanski probably wasn't aiming for that. Either way, this is definitely a movie worth seeing, as a message of hope in the darkest of times.",The Pianist
7,jboothmillard,The Pianist,9,10 July 2006,"From Oscar BAFTA winning director Roman Polanski, and based on a true story, this is the great story of one man's struggle to survive, and also his passion of playing the piano. Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Adrien Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, an Oscar winning role, he has a passion for playing the piano. He and his family, including Father (Frank Finlay) and Mother (Maureen Lipman) are threatened and ordered about by the Nazi Germans to obey their commands, otherwise by shot. It is really disturbing to see the Germans killing Jewish people, and also the state of places after bombs and stuff. Also starring Thomas Kretschmann as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, Emilia Fox as Dorota, Ed Stoppard as Henryk, Julia Rayner as Regina, Jessica Kate Meyer as Halina and Michal Zebrowski. The best moments for me are while Wladyslaw has a beard, and is surviving amongst the wreckage of a town, and he plays the piano for a German commander. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing and Best Picture, it won the BAFTA for Best Film and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Wojciech Kilar, Best Cinematography, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. It was number 59 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, and it was number 32 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Very good!",The Pianist
8,rmax304823,Survivor,8,30 April 2008,"Film makers have to step carefully when dealing with issues like the Nazi extermination program. There have been equally brutal programs of ethnic cleansing in places like Southeast Asia and Rwanda, in which hundreds of millions died, but nothing like this in Europe since the Middle Ages. The victims here were not only Jews but Gypsies, the mentally ill, homosexuals, socialists, communists, and political undesirables. The Nazis eliminated not six million but some uncountable number between 12 and 15 million. An event like that can't be treated lightly and milked for easy tears, or the event itself is cheapened.Fortunately, the films that have explored the subject have been uniformly well done, as Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is well done. Polanski himself suffered in much the same way as the protagonist, Vlad Szpilman (Adrien Brody). Polanski has a habit of embellishing his tales but there's no question that in this instance he knows what he's talking about.Szpilman is a well-known young pianist on Warsaw radio but the German occupation puts the station out of business. He and his family are herded into the Warsaw ghetto where they are subject to constant abuse and occasional murder. Szpilman barely escapes being sent to Treblinka with the rest of his family. And for the last half of the film, with the help of some friends who endanger themselves by lending him aid, he scuttles rat-like from one hiding place to another, each more dismal and perilous than the last. He suffers jaundice, his hair and beard grow long, his clothes turn to tatters, his food disappears, he's half frozen, and he seems to shrink.He's reduced to living in the attic of a nearly demolished apartment building and is ecstatic to discover a gallon can of pickles overlooked on the top shelf of a kitchen cabinet. The can falls out of his hands while he tries to open it and rolls across the floor to come to rest at the boots of a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann). The only Germans we've seen so far have been brutes -- ridiculing the insane, executing Jews who ask simple questions, or simply shooting people chosen at random.We expect nothing from Hosenfeld except a quick shooting. But Hosenfeld is a human being and, having discovered that Szpilman ""is"" -- or rather ""was"" -- a pianist, he asks him to play a piano left in one of the flats. Szpliman has been unable to play for years and when he seats himself we worry that he might not bring it off and, indeed, his first chords are tentative, uncertain. Then his playing becomes automated, the old habits return, and he dashes off a dramatic and exquisitely executed piece of Chopin. Hosenfeld has been leaning back, enjoying the music, then leaves Szpilman quietly to his attic. He returns a few times later, before the Germans withdraw before the Russians, and unceremoniously hands him a few packages of food and, finally, his overcoat. The matter-of-fact compassion shown by Hosenfeld, and Szpilman's desperate need for contact with another human, are very moving.When the Russian troops finally arrive, Szpilman stumbles out of his hovel to greet them, but seeing his overcoat the Russians open fire on him. Szpilman finally convinces them that he is a Pole, not a German, and one of the befuddled soldiers asks, ""Then why the ****ing coat?"" Szpilman is trembling with fear but manages to gulp, ""I was cold."" An epilogue tells us that Szpilman went on with his career and Hosenfeld wound up in a Soviet prison camp where he died in 1952, despite Szpilman's attempt to find him. Under the end credits, a smiling Szpilman plays a lively, sparkling composition by Chopin.It's a remarkable film. Polanski is no longer the Wunderkind but a mature film maker. Nothing is excessive. We need only as much as we need to know to understand Szpilman's travails -- one tragedy following another. There are no sentimental speeches at the final parting of Szpilman and his family. Szpilman himself never breaks down. He simply does what needs to be done to survive. And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like. (From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein.) Kretschmann gets Hosenfeld down pat as well. In their scenes together we sense their respective positions -- one man with nothing left to lose, the other with nothing left to gain. The story, and the historical facts it's based on, raise many questions about human nature, of course. I'm not at all sure that if we could find the answers to those questions we would like what we found.One of the better films of the year.",The Pianist
9,ma-cortes,Intense biography about a Polish pianist named Szpilman during the Warsaw ghetto,8,18 November 2008,"This is an emotionally tale and very decent drama about a pianist named Szpilman from luxurious life until terrible ending in the Warsaw ghetto. Polanski correctly directs a spellbinding portrait about the holocaust with his personal knowledge and proper experience on his childhood . Adrien Brody is excellent in a complicate and suffering role. Besides splendid actors, Frank Finlay,Jessica Meyer, Emilia Fox and Thomas Kretschman as a good Nazi officer who helps him. Evocative cinematography by cameraman Pawel Edlman, Polanski's usual. Musical score by Wojciech Kilar with brilliant piano sounds. Academy Award for best director Roman Polanski, Actor, Adrien Brody and adapted script by Ronald Harwood based on Wladyslaw Szpilman memories.Adding more details over largely described on the movie referred 'the Warsaw ghetto uprising', the events happened on the following manner : In 1939, after the invasion of Poland, Reinhard Heydrich chief of Gestapo began to place all Polish Jews in ghettos, where they could slowly die of hunger and disease. The campaign was to be administered by the Waffen-SS the party's military formations that fought as integral units in the armed forces. The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of these segregated areas established by the Nazis in Poland. In 1940 Heydrich, using the excuse that the spread of typhus had to be contained, set up a special section 11 miles in circumference enclosed by a brick wall 10 feet high. The cost was paid by the Judenrat, the Jewish Council of twenty-four-members, which was in charge of Jewish affairs inside the ghetto. In 1940 more than 80.000 gentile Poles living in the infected area were ordered to leave, and the next month about 140,000 living elsewhere in the city were moved in which the 240,000 still live in the ghetto. Some 360.000 Jews, a third of Warsaw's population, were herded into a 3,5-square-mile area. Meanwhile, Gestapo agents removed all Jews from the economic and cultural life of the city, from factories,shops, theaters, and libraries. On November 15,1940, the ghetto was sealed and its twenty-two entrances closed. No one was allowed to leave or enter, there was to be contact with the outside world.The situation soon became critical,Jews fought for jobs in the ghetto, including work with the labor battalions organized by the Nazis. Those unable to find work tried to exist by selling jewels,clothing, or anything else to obtain food. From 300 to 400 died daily in the Warsaw trap. More than 43.000 starved to death during the first year. Children crazed by hunger crawled through the sewers to the non-Jewish sectors of the city to smuggle in a bit of food. People were no longer moved by the sight of men and women falling dead on the streets. The Nazi authorities began intensified measure on July 22, 1942. As a memorial to Heydrich, Heirich Himmler ordered all Jews except those already in concentration camps to be deported .The ghetto and all labor camps would then be destroyed. Mass deportations to the gas chambers of Treblinka began. In two months 300.000 Jews were eliminated. The Judenrat was ordered to deliver 6.000 Jews daily for deportation. Each day thousands were driven by guards through the gates.Young Zionists, pioneers training to go to Palestine, mobilized first to be followed by members of the Polish workers party . On July 28, 1942, the Jewish Combat organization consisting about 1.000 men and boys was formed. All resolved to kill as many of their tormentors as they could before they died.The Jews fighting from rooftops, cellars, and attics,Poles outside the ghetto now began to send in more revolvers, grenades, and dynamite. In 1943 the guerrillas divided into twenty-two groups built an intricate network underground cellars and tunnels ,linked with command posts . In April 19,1943 German troops moved in on the ghetto to send all who were left to Treblinka in a final action. First came the armed trucks, tanks, and armored cars. The ghetto fighters poured a hail of bullets, grenades and bombs, the fighting went on for twenty-eight days. The guerrillas fought to the last. Many committed suicide at the moment before capture. The Germans dragged survivors from the cellars and rubble. Fewer than 100 escaped, the last 60000 Jews had been exterminated or killed in the explosions and fires.Polish sources reported that the fighters had killed 300 Germans and wounded 1000. From Warsaw Jewish resistance moved to swamps and forests.",The Pianist
10,moonspinner55,"""Germans won't use Jewish toilets...the toilets are too clean for them.""",7,10 January 2016,"Devastating adaptation of Wladyslaw Szpilman's World War II memoirs as a Polish Jew and classically trained pianist in 1939 Warsaw who continually escaped the clutches of the invading Nazis over a five-year period. Saved from the concentration camps by the Jewish police, he relied on the Underground--as well as on one remarkable German soldier--to stay alive and eventually tell his story. Adrien Brody's sadly quizzical, sensitive face takes the screen like a beacon of light; he obviously put himself through hell to get this physically demanding role just right, and his emotional performance is incredibly rich. Not so some of the overacting supporting players, particularly those cast as Szpilman's close-knit family members (however, the scene where the father splits a piece of caramel five ways is a heartbreaker). Roman Polanski won the Oscar as Best Director; however, some of his bigger scenes (such as the Russian Liberation) don't pack the wallop expected. The filmmaker does catch the numbing brutality and violence of the time with an unerring eye, and his film is arguably a more lasting statement of Nazi-atrocity than Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". Lengthy, but hypnotic; an unsettling, intense dramatic achievement. Seven Oscar nominations in all, with three wins including Brody for Best Actor (well-deserved) and Ronald Harwood for Best Adapted Screenplay. *** from ****",The Pianist
11,dbdumonteil,Spilzman? What a beautiful name for a pianist...,10,29 December 2005,"In March 2003, Roman Polanski's ""the Pianist"" (2002) pocketed three Oscars including best actor (Adrien Brody) and best director (Roman Polanski). One month earlier, the ceremony of the French Oscars showered the movie with praise by attributing to it and his author similar prizes. Earlier in May 2002, the festival of Cannes crowned it of the most prestigious prize: the deservedly Golden Palm. Already in 2002 and chiefly throughout 2003, awards rained on Polanski's deeply moving piece of work and rightly so. It is a true return to form for him after an uneven career which started after the spooky ""the Tenant"" (1976) and wildly oscillated between duds (Pirates, 1986, Frantic, 1988) and palatable but not peerless works (Death and the Maiden, 1994, the Ninth Gate, 1999). ""The Pianist"" helped to rekindle the flame that made such treasures, hallmarks in their own domains (the wonderful ""Rosemary's Baby"", 1968 in the fantastic or the fabulous ""Chinatown"", 1974 in the film noir) and could be a stalwart success in the movie with the Second World War as the backdrop. It is perhaps Polanski's most personal film to date and the one he has always wanted to shot, surely to exorcise traumatic memories haunting him since his childhood. Like his main protagonist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, he experienced the horror of the ghetto of Warsaw.To get his demons out of his head, he preferred to adapt for the screen Spilzman's memories, a genius pianist and a man who bit by bit lost his family and friends on whom he could rely, a man who was deprived of his piano and thus of his ""raison d'être"". As Stefan Zweig says: ""to read is to live"", well for him ""to play is to live"". Even when he has the opportunity to play, he has to refrain himself. See the scene in which he has settled down to his flat. Before leaving him, the owner says to him: ""please, don't make noise"". Polanski makes us share his craving for playing by putting his main protagonist in front of the sacred instrument ans plays us the music in Spilzman's head without the latter touches the keys. He was also a man who saw sorrow, pain and the unthinkable (the sequences in which German officers and soldiers kill Jewish people give goose pimples because they're precisely unthinkable). Throughout his sufferings, chance didn't totally relinquish him: he was rescued at the last minute by a Polish policeman (and a fellow of his brother) who stopped him from going up in the train of death to Auschwitz. At this moment, he was saved from death but he lost his family. Then, he had to rely on his courage to survive and enjoyed the help of some fellows even if they absconded (the woman Spilzman made the acquaintance at the beginning of the film and her husband who found him a flat). At last, the German officer at the end of the film, was his ultimate glimmer of hope.Roman Polanski shot his film with a classic but startling directing for the sake of detail and realism. It has a linear but inevitable progression which has the look of a downward spiral: the tightening of the restrictions on Jewish people which become increasingly harsher (the armband to distinguish the Jewish from other peoples, then the delimitation and the encircling of the ghetto, the Jews chased away from their neighborhood and deported to the extermination camps) and the least sign of certainty is nearly automatically blighted: ""we have work certificates at last"" sighs Spilzman's father. Alas! Hopes blighted since just as he pronounces these words, a German officer asks them with other people to go outside. Some of them are killed while the others (including Spilzman's family) have to wait on a large square with thousands of others. Polanski also relates notable events with a minimum of means (the fight and shooting sequences are often perceived from a balcony or a window).The second part of the film strongly recalls Polanski's murkiest hours extracted from his masterworks. For example, in his flat, Spilzman tries to be as quiet as possible and while searching for food in his kitchen and drops crockery. The noise makes his neighbor intervene and by giving the alarm in the building obliges him to flee once again. At this moment, we find one of Polanski's trademarks: the eerie neighbor who has a harmful influence on the hero and contributes to his or her fall (the Castevet in ""Rosemary's Baby"", the offbeat inhabitants of the building in ""the Tenant"". In another extent, when Spilzman has to lurk in the destroyed ghetto (the distant shot where we can see him trudging in the ruins of this apocalyptic landscape deserves to rank among Polanski's most notable shots in all his filmography), Polanski really places us amid a ""in camera"" in spite of the sprawling scenery.The filmmaker should also be thanked for having chosen Adrien Brody in the main role. He works wonders in a part which seemed to be tailor-made for him, a far cry from his cardboard character in M Night Shyamalan's ""the Village"" (2004). He can act several persona in himself: a smart young man as well as a dirty and bearded tramp. His angular face, his acute and melancholic countenance stay with us for a long time. As for the German officers, they are often caricatured but ultimately Polanski eschews the trap of Manicheism which seemed to pervade the whole film thanks to the last sequences with the sympathetic German officer. Not all Nazis were beasts...Interspersed with either unbearable, either excruciating or either moving sequences and with striking shots, ""the Pianist"" has its place on the podium of Polanski's towering achievements. See it any costs! Unfortunately it would seem that the flame began to flicker again given the lukewarm critics ""Oliver Twist"" met this year. The slump again? Only time will tell...",The Pianist
12,Quinoa1984,"Stoic, haunting tale of survival",10,16 January 2003,"The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A+",The Pianist

(It was thought by the experts that Daniel Day Lewis would win the award for ""Gangs of New York."") Polanski's win was a surprise since the conventional wisdom had Martin Scorsese for ""Gangs"" winning the directing award as well.This tremendous holocaust film deals with the destruction of a family. The scene where a family had its wheelchair bound member tossed from a window and then shot as they ran was eerie and never to be forgotten.As a marvelous piano player, Brody captured the role with depth and a strong conviction. The scene where the family is placed on a train for their ultimate destiny can and must never be forgotten as well. From that point on, the focus of the picture becomes one of survival as Brody is able to elude the Nazi barbarians.A strong film in the tradition of ""Schindler's List.""

14,sunwarrior13,Polanski's Best Work In Years,10,25 February 2012,"The Pianist is a 2002 biographical war film directed by Roman Polanski, starring Adrien Brody. It is an adaptation of the autobiography of the same name by Jewish-Polish musician Władysław Szpilman. This downbeat drama based on the true story of a privileged musician who spent five years struggling against the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. Wladyslaw Szpilman is a gifted classical pianist born to a wealthy Jewish family in Poland. The Szpilmans have a large and comfortable flat in Warsaw which Wladyslaw shares with his mother and father, his sisters Halina and Regina, and his brother, Henryk. While Wladyslaw and his family are aware of the looming presence of German forces and Hitler's designs on Poland, they're convinced that the Nazis are a menace which will pass, and that England and France will step forward to aid Poland in the event of a real crisis. Wladyslaw's naïveté is shattered when a German bomb rips through a radio studio while he performs a recital for broadcast. During the early stages of the Nazi occupation, as a respected artist, he still imagines himself above the danger, using his pull to obtain employment papers for his father and landing a supposedly safe job playing piano in a restaurant. But as the German grip tightens upon Poland, Wladyslaw and his family are selected for deportation to a Nazi concentration camp. Refusing to face a certain death, Wladyslaw goes into hiding in a comfortable apartment provided by a friend. However, when his benefactor goes missing, Wladyslaw is left to fend for himself and he spends the next several years dashing from one abandoned home to another, desperate to avoid capture by German occupation troops. It's Roman Polanski's strongest and most personally felt movie.It is the director's finest achievement, and elevates Adrien Brody (Oscar win for Best Actor 2002) to eminence in his representation of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who survived the Nazi occupation of Warsaw.Well- acted and dramatically moving, The Pianist is Polanski's best work in years.",The Pianist

16,Theo Robertson,Despite The Over Familiarity A Good Film,8,20 September 2009,"The problem with making a holocaust film is that it's a subject that's been done before . Everyone from Steven Spielberg to ( Amazingly and somewhat hypocritically I say ) Vanessa Redgrave has made a film centering around the Nazi attempt to exterminate European Jewry . I have a problem with this because it denigrates history to an extent . If people have to make a film featuring man's inhumanity to man as a reminder what does this say for the rest of humanity ? Can't the rest of humanity watch a documentary like SHOA or the Genocide episode of THE WORLD AT WAR ( My first introduction to The Holocaust ) or read a book of the accounts of Nazi mass murder ? Would it be too cynical to point out how well rewarded Holocaust movies are ? It's also noticeable how formulaic these type of movies are . We start at the beginning of the war and follow the protagonist's survival until they're liberated by the allies in 1945 That said THE PIANIST does have merits of its own even though it doesn't really bring much to the table originality wise . Actually the food allegory is appropriate though slightly confusing . Early in the film we see the terrible conditions in the Warsaw ghetto as its Jewish population are effectively walled up from the rest of the city and left to die . Cut to a restaurant interior as Wladyslaw Szpilman entertains the guests by playing the piano as the patrons grow fat by gorging themselves on food , fine wine and cigarettes as their fellow Jews fall dead in the streets . With a little editing you might find yourself thinking this part was directed by David Irving instead of Roman Polanski ! One thing THE PIANIST does do well is include the apocryphal tale of the Jews discussing their fate at the hands of the Nazis with no one wanting to believe for a second that the lone voice stating the Nazis are deporting them to be murdered may in fact be talking the truth no matter how unbelievable and horrific the truth may be Like I AM LEGEND the story suffers from the fact that the protagonist has no one to speak to for large portions of the narrative but there's so much incident on screen such as the Warsaw uprising it's not a major problem . You could make the point that Szpliman then becomes a spectator to Polish history rather than a character in his own right and you'd possibly be correct but these scenes are very well choreographed and filmed that it shouldn't be made as a criticism . There's also the introduction of "" A good German "" that we've seen before in films such as MUTTER'S COURAGE but Hosenfeld is so well drawn and acted by Thomas Kretschmann it's very difficult not to feel sorry for his fate In truth THE PIANIST follows the usual structure of holocaust movies but unlike some movies of this particular genre certainly deserved much of the critical acclaim hoisted upon it . As can be expected it's not a feel good movie but is definitely a well made and acted story of human suffering and endurance",The Pianist
17,jotix100,To hell and back.,10,21 January 2003,"The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later. What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.  Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell.",The Pianist

Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him, but I never really connected to the story. I never really cared. I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that. Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play, in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal. I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter. Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care. Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him. I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable, which means this movie meant nothing to me. This film is a major disappointment",The Pianist

21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Breathtaking,10,4 November 2006,"It's rare to see a film of such quality. Polanski has been directing marvelous films for decades, with effective editing and his seemingly unique cinematography. When a brilliant director goes to work on a very personal project, it is almost invariably a certainty that their heart and soul will be put into making it. When a film is made about a major historic event, in particular when countless films have been made regarding it already(and one would be quite hard pressed to find an event that has had more films made about it than World War 2), it needs to make a point or to offer something that we have yet to see. A new perspective, an idea that hasn't been explored before. Benigni gave us Life Is Beautiful(La Vita é Bella), which had one such idea, a beautiful, sweetly naive one. Polanski offers another, one that is at least as heart-warming and life-affirming. He brings the history to life, and does so with such effective direction that the film holds you in an iron grip. You feel compelled to refrain from watching more, yet you cannot look away. Such pain, horror and despair is depicted without flinching, without holding back, without censoring the worst parts out. You see all the cruelty of the Nazis, the degeneration of the health, lives and dignity of the Jews, and the slow but inevitable destruction of Warsaw. All from Szpilman's point of view. That was part of what made this so strong and affecting; he was there. Every single one of these situations, countless of times that he could have been killed... he was there. And at the end of it all, when you hear this man's beautiful music being played, one can't help but think; if war, hate and the rest of the world's evils are a result of the flaws of human beings... then the fact that this man, this creative being, this artist, made it through seemingly impossible odds, and came out of so many potentially lethal situations alive, must surely be proof that in spite of aforementioned evils, in spite of how hopeless it all may seem at times... there is still hope and beauty. It may be beaten down, it may be injured, but it shall never truly perish. The plot is well-written, and develops nicely throughout. The pacing is perfect, there's not a boring or overly fast moment to be found. The effects and design are flawless, it's all extremely authentic and realistic, as are most of the scenes. The cinematography is amazing. As my father commented while we watched: ""You really feel like you are him(Wladyslaw)."" A beautiful film, that takes you through arguably the worst historic event of the latter half of the previous century. I recommend this very highly to anyone who believes that they are strong enough to sit through it. It's most definitely not pleasant. Not to be missed. 10/10",The Pianist
22,evanston_dad,Polanski's New Spin on an Old Classic,9,4 August 2010,"Before seeing ""The Pianist,"" I thought there couldn't possibly be a movie about the Holocaust that could tell me something I didn't already know, or make me feel an emotion I haven't already felt a hundred times before about the topic. But director Roman Polanski proved me wrong.There's a scene in ""The Pianist"" in which Nazis invade a Jewish apartment building and ""clean out"" its tenants. They pick up an elderly man confined to a wheelchair, carry the chair to the edge of the balcony, and casually tip him over the edge to fall to his death on the pavement below. The moment shocked me in a way that nothing in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" did, I think precisely because, unlike Spielberg, Polanski isn't interested in manipulating his audience into feeling something. The strength of his movies has always been that they unfold with a detached, objective point of view and let audiences draw their own conclusions. The scene described above is so shocking because Polanski does nothing to embellish it and therefore never draws attention to the fact that you're watching a movie.The rest of the film is like that -- it's harrowing and unpleasant at times, but it also rewards the viewer by saying something about a historical event when I didn't think there was anything left to say.Grade: A",The Pianist

In symbolic terms it regards our condition under huge duress as when Adrien Brody moves his fingers through the air and the audiences hears the beautiful sounds of the piano that are only evident in his tarnished mind. His family was separated from him and we can sense his loneliness as he walks a street littered with bodies and fallen structures. He is forced to help rebuild a separation wall as well as endure brutal treatment from the Nazis. Directed by Roman Polanski who himself is a survivor of such conditions, and his passion for the material is evident. His previous films contain such classics as Chinatown and Repulsion. He creates the nightmarish atmosphere of the period and succeeds with great results. Flawless acting by Brody whose grief is only subsided by the sounds of piano. Strong supporting work by Thomas Kretschmann as a German soldier who happens upon him and the interesting situation that transpires as a result. Frank Finley, Maureen Lipman as his parents are more or less obvious in terms of their fate.

24,Wuchakk,A Jewish musician trying to survive the German occupation of Warsaw,7,19 October 2015,"Released in 2002, ""The Pianist"" is Roman Polanski's account of the real-life Hebrew pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) whose family was banished to the Warsaw ghetto with thousands of other Jews after the German invasion. Szpilman is separated from his family members when they're carted off to be slaughtered and does whatever he must to survive until the Allies defeat Germany. He's dependent on others while hiding out and, like they say, sometimes help comes from the most unexpected sources.Like 1993's ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Pianist"" is a thoroughly realistic WWII drama that addresses the Holocaust with flashes of violence and atrocities, only marred by the stereotypical boorish depiction of practically every member of the Wehrmacht. Needless to say, you have to be in the right mode for a movie like this and you have to be willing to invest a solid hour before things get interesting; by the final hour you'll be hooked until the end; that is, unless you have ADHD and consume only cartoony ""blockbusters.""Some have complained that Szpilman's a lousy protagonist for this type of movie because he never does anything heroic and essentially waits it out. Answer: That's why it's called ""The Pianist"" and not ""The Warrior Jew"" or ""Rambo 5: Kraut Killer."" He was a simple musician who did what he could to survive, but that's not all he does; he also smuggles weapons into the ghetto, which are used later in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. When he eventually hides out in various apartments he doesn't have a weapon. What's he supposed to do, run into the streets and take on German soldiers by himself with a club or a kitchen knife? Even going out with a machine gun would've been foolish and suicidal. Szpilman's a survivor who does some minor heroic things. For those who demand a more standout hero, look no further than Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann); he's the hero of the story. The movie effectively shows the pianist's view of the war, which is the window through which the viewer observes the historical events. ""Schindler's List"" shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Gentile who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the top and views both Nazis and Jews from a position of safety. Oskar Schindler naturally had a more panoramic, birds-eye view of the Holocaust whereas ""The Pianist"" shows the Holocaust through the eyes of a Jew who observes the machinery of the Holocaust from the bottom and sees both Nazis and Jews from a position of danger. The former is a better film for understanding the machinery of the Holocaust while ""The Pianist"" is a better film to watch if you want to know what it was like to experience the Holocaust first hand as an ordinary Jew.The movie runs 2½ hours and was shot in Poland (including Warsaw where the events in the movie take place) and Germany.

25,zetes,"Good, but imdb voters are overrating it",8,6 July 2003,"The Pianist is far from Roman Polanski's best film or his `most personal work,' as the back of the DVD case says. In fact, it's easily the least personal film I've seen from him; any director who has enough clout to secure the funding for the production could have made this film and had it turn out just as well. As a director, it is a small achievement. Likewise, the screenplay writes itself; in fact, it did write itself, as it's based on a true story. I must admit I have a bias against films dealing with WWII and especially the Jewish experience in Europe. Affecting the audience is as simple as snapping one's fingers. Or, more specifically, executing a Jew. Whenever the audience starts to get a little comfortable, all the filmmaker has to do is have a Nazi shoot a Jew in the head. It's all too easy. Any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important in the minds of critics and audiences, which makes it difficult for anyone to propose any criticism against it. Truth be told, The Pianist is a very good film. It's well done, and, while I don't think it's Polanski's best work, he does a good job. But it's too easy, I think, to overpraise something like this. It was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at the Oscars, but, after seeing the film, it doesn't surprise me. This is the kind of movie that impresses the Academy most, because it's easy. The three awards it won were not deserved, at least in my opinion. If I weren't so familiar with the Academy and their thought processes, it would really shock me that Polanski beat Scorsese, who made an original picture with verve and passion, and that Brody (I haven't mentioned him, and he is good) beat Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as I've just said above, creates a character that will live forever. As for the screenplay, Ronald Harwood (and/or Polanski) could have made the film much more than just one of ten thousand tales of survival. There are a lot of moments when more substance could have been found. I like how Szpilman has to constantly watch the action while locked up in a room, yearning to be able to do something about it, but always relegated to the spectator's role. They do do well when they introduce the character of the Nazi soldier trying to make good by helping Szpilman, but they don't do very much. Of course, I think part of the point is that this man appeared and disappeared without much pomp or circumstance. In fact, it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that Szpilman discovered who this man was. Of course, that might have been disrespectful.I have now seen all five Best Picture nominees from last year, and I would rank them as follows: 1) The Hours; 2) Gangs of New York; 3) The Pianist; 4) Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers; 5) Chicago. That I rank the actual winner last shouldn't raise eyebrows, because, to tell you the truth, I don't rank The Pianist and The Two Towers that much higher. The first two were original, intelligent, and challenging. The last three were much simpler, and it's no big surprise that they are more beloved. 8/10.",The Pianist

29,JamesHitchcock,One of the most moving films about the war that I know,9,20 January 2017,"There have been innumerable films about World War II, but relatively few about the Holocaust, a subject which, at least for the first few decades after the war, seemed to daunt film-makers by its very enormity. Since the 1980s, however, there have been some fine attempts to come to terms with the most notorious crime of the twentieth century, including Pakula's ""Sophie's Choice"" and Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is another to add to this list.The film is based on the autobiography of Władysław Szpilman, a Jewish pianist, who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland. (As one character points out, Szpilman's surname is an appropriate one; it is a Polonised form of ""Spielmann"", the German for ""musician""). In September 1939 the Szpilman family are living in relative middle-class comfort in Warsaw when they learn that the country has been invaded by Germany. The film then traces the way in which the situation of Poland, and especially of its Jewish community, deteriorates throughout the course of the war- the passing of anti-Jewish laws, the creation of the Warsaw Ghetto in November 1940 and finally the deportations to the concentration camps beginning in 1942. By a stroke of chance Szpilman is separated from his family when they are deported to Treblinka extermination camp. For a time he becomes a slave labourer, but manages to escape and is sheltered by non-Jewish friends linked to the Polish resistance, surviving while thousands are dying around him and while his city is gradually turned into a wasteland of rubble.A key scene comes towards the end of the film. Much of the city, including the building in which Szpilman was sheltering, has been destroyed in the aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising of August 1944, and Szpilman is desperately trying to hide in a ruined building when he is discovered by a German officer named Wilm Hosenfeld. Hosenfeld guesses that Szpilman is Jewish, but takes pity on him and spares his life, even bringing him food and giving him a coat to help him survive.Szpilman's story had a deep personal significance for Polanski, himself a Polish Jew who managed to survive the war in hiding, although other members of his family, including his mother, died. It is therefore unsurprising that it has a greater emotional resonance than many of Polanski's earlier films, which can often be rather emotionally cool. Szpilman is a gifted musician, but his survival has very little to do with his talent and a great deal to do with the kindness of others and with sheer luck. It is a role which called for a superb actor, and Polanski was fortunate enough to find one in the shape of Adrien Brody, who won a well-deserved ""Best Actor"" Oscar. (Strangely enough, Brody was not the director's first choice for the role- that was Joseph Fiennes, who was unavailable). Brody's Szpilman becomes a sort of Everyman figure, a tragic version of Chaplin's Little Tramp, stumbling his way through a city which has been reduced to a vision of Hell on Earth. As Roger Ebert put it, he is not a fighter or a hero but a survivor.Polanski himself won the ""Best Director"" award. The film was nominated for Best Picture, but lost to ""Chicago"". ""The Pianist"" is a harrowing record of man's inhumanity to man, but it is also a film with a message of hope in that it shows how even unspeakable barbarity like that of the Nazis cannot altogether extinguish man's better instincts, shown by the kindness and bravery of Szpilman's friends and his defiant rendition of Chopin's Grande Polonaise Brillante at the end. It is one of the most moving films about the war that I know, comparable in this respect to either Pakula's or Spielberg's. 9/10",The Pianist

The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human. World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.10/10",The Pianist
31,=G=,Music was his passion. Survival was his instinct.,7,29 May 2003,"""The Pianist"" is doubtless well crafted and technically and artistically sound albeit naive and conventional. The film parses into one hour of a stereotypical and exploitive regurgitation of the horrors of the Nazi reign over the Warsaw ghetto, where every German soldier is more evil than Satan and every Jew a pathetic victim, and one hour of Brody living like a rat foraging for sustenance amid the Warsaw ruination. Only in the very end does the film introduce a bit of irony and a sympathetic Nazi after countless missed opportunities to breath something fresh into what is just another in a very long list of films about the infamous ghetto (Families torn apart, summary executions, etc.).  Brody delivers a fine performance as a pianist and the film's centerpiece but is not required to perform the range of emotion deserving of a little gold statuette. Overall, the film is worthwhile but shows us nothing new and exploits rather than honors the memory of those Polish Jews who died in the conflict. ""The Pianist"" will play best with those who have not yet had their fill of Warsaw ghetto films. (B)",The Pianist

Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.For all that - and all that was very good - there was something about the story that didn't really click with me. For some strange reason I found it difficult to follow and I did think that at almost two and a half hours it was a little bit too long. As much as was accomplished in that running time could have been accomplished in two hours flat. It's a good movie, but just failed to reach the level of greatness that some have assigned to it. 6/10",The Pianist
36,Robert_duder,"Beautiful, horrifying, haunting and brilliantly made. Truly a masterpiece.",10,25 June 2006,"The Pianist absolutely deserved all it's acclaim in 2002 including some Oscar Nominations. For every moment that it is so incredibly disturbing, and provocative there is a moment of heartfelt survival, a story of overcoming these disgusting, horrible moments in history. I thought even after the first half hour of the film that even though The Pianist was great, it was going to be stereotypical in it's story about the Holocaust and World War Two and I could not have been more wrong. This is not a film about the horror of those years but rather the story of one man's survival against unbelievable odds. It is truly an epic about one man. The first hour will literally bring you to tears, turn your stomach, it puts you right in the thick of this horrible historical war and the last part of the movie you struggle along with the main character in his own personal battle to survive. What an incredible journey!! I often wondered before seeing this film if Adrien Brody deserved his Oscar win. Yes, Yes, YES!! This is practically a one man show for Brody who plays famous Polish Pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Practically every scene Brody is in will bring tears to your eyes. He seems like such a shy, withdrawn man who won't survive any of the heavy moments of the war ahead but he does...against all odds. He loses literally everything, everyone, his entire existence and fights on and on. In the beginning he shies away from the conflict, does everything he can to not stick out but in the end he perseveres above everything. No other film about the Holocaust or World War 2 has captured the plight of a Jew more than this film. We see every angle of the horror they endured and the people that they were and the lives that they lost. Brody may go down in history as being known for his passionate, excitable kiss with Hale Berry when presented with his award but now that I've seen the film I will forever remember his powerful performance. Now when I said this was a one man show for Brody I don't mean to count out the supporting cast in this film because they were all very, very good. Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emilia Fox, and Ed Stoppard all do a terrific job as Brody's family. They are only a small part of the film, the first hour perhaps but they do a great job of making you feel for them before they are taken to really get an idea of how Brody's character feels. Everyone who helps Brody's character along the way all play a terrific role but they are all quite small roles especially in comparison to Brody. This is his absolutely his masterpiece!! The incredibly controversial director Roman Polanski captures gritty, dark, human abomination like no one else. Even his more recent Oliver Twist was dark and disturbing appropriately but I think this particular project was close to home for him. He so brilliantly captured Warsaw and the Ghetto and the concentration camp and the war from the perspective of the civilians, especially the Jews, rather than the front lines. The film very gray scaled, a constant feeling of foreboding throughout the entire thing. Not a single frame feels light or happy and it shouldn't. There is silence before the deafening sound of gunfire, the crack of someone being murdered, or the bombs that could kill anyone in it's path. He really works at setting the horror of the situation in the first hour and accomplishes that hands down. I could feel my stomach turning watching these men torture these human beings in despicable horrifying ways. He then allows the last half of the film to be about Brody's character and survival. There is actually a happy ending to a horrific story. How rare to see something like this. It will haunt you, leave you thinking, remembering, praying, it's quite simply brilliant. Initially I had scored this a 9/10 and I don't know why because it is deeply powerful. Perhaps a little long but nonetheless captivating. I change it to a 10/10 because of the important message of remembrance and a time where a people, human beings were treated like less than garbage. May something like this never happen again!! Please watch this movie if you're a fan of history, or just want something powerful, intelligent, and moving. 10/10",The Pianist
37,ElMaruecan82,"Less 'cinematic' yet more affecting than ""Schindler's List"" ...",10,1 June 2012,"To think that I avoided ""The Pianist"" for about 10 years because I expected a new ""Schindler's List""! And I don't even mean that negatively.I've watched Spielberg's film several times and know too well how painful Holocaust movies are, and while ""Life is Beautiful"" was a tragicomic fable and ""Sophie's Choice"" more of a character study relating a traumatic experience, I knew ""The Pianist"" would be on the same level of ambition and seriousness than Spielberg's film, if only because it was directed by Roman Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself. I knew the movie would feature shocking arbitrary executions and poignant separations, so in a way, ""The Pianist"" was already having an impact on me without watching it. But this is not the only reason why I didn't feel the urge to watch it.Part of the blame is to be put on the film itself although it was inevitably going to be compared with its 'glorious' predecessor. Speaking of my own experience, I was mislead by ""The Pianist"" and the movie trailers. I thought it was the story of a man who played music for the Nazis and his survival, and therefore found in the present's horror and gloominess a heaven of escapism in the inner, universal and timeless beauty of music. Wladislaw would have the state of mind of one of Schindler's factory workers with music as the same weapon as Guido's humor and optimism in ""Life is Beautiful"". Of course, I realize now how my preconceived ideas totally underestimated Roman Polanski and I hope this review redeems my 10 years of abstinence.First, one must give to Spielberg what is Spielberg's and to Polanski what is Polanski's. ""Schindler's List"" is a better directed film but ""The Pianist"" is a better told story. And while the directing of Spielberg betrays sometimes the harshness of its subject by too much 'mise en scene', Polanski's ability to hook our hearts to the fate of Wladislaw Spillman, magnificently portrayed by Adrien Brody, and his family is beyond words. Indeed, we feel like part of this family. While the epic scope of ""Schindler's List"" provided a sort of moral aura to the victims, making the film a martyrdom's remembrance, ""The Pianist"" is simply the chronicles of a banal horror. And Polanski keeps an intimate, almost unnoticeable directing, to better convey the feeling that we're watching normal people whose lives are dramatically affected by an absurd War, and it's their very normality that emphasizes the cruelty of the Nazi treatment.The film opens in Warsaw in September 1939 so those with a minimum of historical knowledge understand the implication. Wladislaw is playing Chopin in a studio when the first German bombings are heard, his family wants to leave but later, they learn in the radio that France and Britain entered the War. Relieved, they celebrate the news with a toast, and the relatively cheerful ambiance contrasts with the usual demonstrations of grief and pain. Of course, we know the worst is to come, but Polanski takes his time to get us immersed in the war's ambiance and letting us observe the progressive decline of the Spillmans, directly mirroring the atmosphere that probably prevailed within all the Jewish families.Through the Spillman's perspectives, we get a more accurate idea of the nightmare endured by Polish Jews. When they're all parked in the Warsaw ghetto, before the inevitable evacuation, we witness gut-wrenching, intolerable, and acts of brutality, so unbelievably gratuitous and horrific, we never doubt that they're based on true stories, and that war, definitely, inspires the worst from humanity. In war, there's no room for dignity, for charity, for understanding, for God I would even say. As for violence, there is no scale, soldiers throwing off a balcony an old grandfather on a wheelchair because he couldn't stand is a horrifying sight, but maybe I expected these kind of moments so much that I was more shocked by the part where the soldiers made people dance together. Sometimes, humiliations are more impacting than random and arbitrary killings.And again, the talent of Polanski is precisely not to have overplayed on the directing department: no 'Black and White', no special effects, no 'little girl in Red', just basic colors, as to sustain the feeling of a present, more real then more horrific. ""Schindler's List"" might be a better film for some, but it's still a film, while ""The Pianist"" is a survival story, raw and real. Not a hero, not a victim either, the main protagonist will sometimes count on his courage, sometimes on his good luck, sometimes on the help of good-hearted and understanding people, from any sides. There is a light of hope in the film, through music, at a time where humanity reached its lowest point, music was here to remind people, to remind Nazis what a waste the War was, a feeling incarnated by Adrien Brody's sad-looking eyes.Again, don't expect a hero à la Oskar Schindler in Wladislaw, ""The Pianist"" shows the boldness of a period where cowardice was sometimes guided by survival instinct, where the desire to live could be more necessary than the desire to fight, because surviving left more voices to speak about the atrocities. ""The Pianist"" reveals those hidden subtleties that couldn't be truly expressed in epic movies. Some Jews didn't fight back precisely because the horrors of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Buchenwald had to be known, and ironically, this was one of the reasons that accelerated the exterminations' process. And some like Wladislaw had to hide not to make the sacrifices of the others unnecessary, those were tough times and no one is allowed to put a judgment... not us, anyway.And this is why ""The Pianist"" is more affecting than ""Schindler's List"", and if one has any doubt, let's not forget, that Spielberg was born in 1946 while Roman Polanski is still a war survivor who lost his mother in a Death Camp.",The Pianist
38,paul2001sw-1,"Horrific, brilliant, almost uplifting",10,8 February 2006,"It's widely believed that Roman Polanski has been in decline as a film-maker for a long time; but in 'The Pianist', he has produced a movie both brilliant and important, and fully deserving of its Oscars. He takes on a big subject - the holocaust - and brings to it a mastery of cinematic procedure and a surprisingly sure touch to a subject highly sensitive and also, through its terrible enormity, innately prone to melodrama if represented on screen. Like most films of its type, it tries to avoid this danger by steering clear of Auschwitz, which is probably incapable of inclusion in any sort of story without completely overbalancing it and isolating it from any point of connection with normal, human themes. But the horrors of what happened are in no sense hidden in the story of a survivor of the Polish ghetto who witnessed the most dreadful events, depicted here in a straightforward chronology encompassing the entire war. What happened first was that a community was forced to co-operate in its own extermination, induced to do so by the basic human need for hope; the eventual uprising was heroic but as doomed as non-resistance. By the time this happens, the hero has already escaped, but Polanski focuses on the desperate reality of his ""fortunate"" situation: the lack of heating, food, water, and also intellectual nourishment; and the near-unbearable psychology of living when any moment might be your last. And in this remarkable film, everything seems both appalling and yet natural; the movie is littered with arresting images that in no way seem forced upon the viewer; and every performance is spot on, with Aiden Brody superb in the lead (Frank Findlay in particular is also excellent, but there are no weak points at all). While very detail that is needed to make the story convincing is covered - Brody's body double (who actually plays the piano for him) has long, pianist's fingers, we know this man to be a pianist as surely as the German officer who eventually pities him.And such is the skill with which the film is made that in the end, it leaves one not only reminded of the dreadful depths to which humanity can sink, but also of what is wonderful in our dubious species; and, after frequently implying the question, ""what is it that separates us from the animals?"", provides part of the answer in the redeeming power of music. This is simply the best movie on its subject I have seen; and the also best movie Polanski has ever made.",The Pianist
39,dromasca,One of the best Holocaust films ever,10,2 January 2004,"Holocaust movies are always tough to watch for me, and I confess my lack of capacity to be objective on this respect. Trying to re-tell the un-speakable in the format of popular entertainment is impossible, and I have a hard time avoiding the emotional aspects and mastering my personal feelings. 'The Pianist' is one of the best movies in the genre. The comparison with 'Schindler's List' is immediate, as both films look at the Holocaust from the angle of the tragedy of the Jewish people with personal or family connotations for the directors, as well as they bring the perspective of the True Human Beings who risked their own lives to save the lives of individuals threatened by the Nazi death machine. In my opinion both films are very good, some of the best cinema two great and different directors of our times have ever made.'The Pianist' is a good film by all criteria. Although some editing cuts would have helped in avoiding repetitions, it never ceases to be shocking and emotional. Adrien Brody gives a great performance, and the camera work is great, with a classical touch reminding us that Poland gave some of the greatest cinema artists of our times. 10/10 on my personal scale.",The Pianist
40,ThomasDrufke,Power of Music,8,4 August 2015,"I love films that glorify the power of music or even the power of movies, and what they can do for people because it's something that I have been directly impacted with. Movies and music have both gotten me through the hardest of times no matter the genre. A film has the ability to give the audience an escape route from their normal life. Now The Pianist shows this on a much different scale and exemplifies it in a different way, but I love the idea of the power of music or film so it's safe to say I really liked The Pianist.It tells the true story of a Jewish man from Warsaw Germany in the midst of World War II and the numerous life threatening struggles he went through along the countless amount of helpful and hurtful people he ran into. Adrien Brody stars as Wladyslaw Szpilman and plays him beautifully. I use that word because the film deals with the touchy subject of World War II, and in particular, the Holocaust. But there is a certain beauty to the way the film presents the subject. I especially like the way the Germans are represented, in that not all of them were as brutal as Hitler. In fact there are several generous Germans throughout that give Szpilman a hand. With that being said, it is devastating to see the hundreds of bodies you say laying in the streets of Warsaw, and without being paid really any attention. It still shocks me just how inhumane people can be to other people, and what the human race is capable of. A film like this can serve as a reminder to that, and is one of the better war films I have seen.It was also fascinating to watch the piano side of this character's story. For most of the film, he had to hold all of his emotions in while playing for people during this enduring time. The piano served as such a great juxtaposition for the terrible and beautiful side of the war. The film also looks fantastic in terms of the set pieces and the way Germany is represented. Polanski really nailed that aspect of it. It's also worth mentioning just how good Thomas Kretschmann is in his small but pivotal role. Overall, I thought The Pianist was a heartbreaking but beautiful film.+Piano juxtaposition +Set pieces +Germany is represented realistically8.5/10",The Pianist
41,g-bodyl,Grave Depiction of Jews In WW2!,9,25 May 2012,"The Pianist is really not a war movie per se, but it is a movie that shows the hardships and struggles of the Jewish people during the second world war. This is an emotional movie made by the right man himself, Holocaust survivor Roman Polanksi. Roman lived in a concentration camp and knew what a ghetto was like and he accurately depicted that in this film.This film is centered around Jewish musician Wladysaw Szpilman and his family. This movie goes from the time they are forced to move into the Warsaw ghetto to the time when help comes from the least expected.Adrien Brody is the only household name you'll find in this movie. He does an extremely good job as Szpilman. I pitied his character for the whole movie.Overall, this ranks up there with Schindler's List. It is not as good as that film but it comes pretty darn close. This movie is well-made and should be seen years to come. I rate this film 9/10.",The Pianist

43,ironhorse_iv,The Pianist plays the right keys. It's more A Minor than a B Flat. It's a cinematic masterpiece.,9,7 February 2019,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Those whom lived through it, are forever scarred by its horrors. Even today, few can muster the courage to bring themselves to discuss the subject. However, one person did, and his name was Wladyslaw Szpilman. Based off his memoirs of the same name, 'The Pianist' tells the story of how he was able to survive the war, while living in fear, under Nazi Control, Warsaw, Poland. Without spoiling this 2002 film, too much, I have to say director, Roman Polanski and screenwriter, Ronald Harwood tried to keep the motion picture as historically accurate as possible. Why? It's because Polanski's inspiration for the film, came from the fact that he himself, had been a prisoner of a polish ghetto during the war. He wanted to make sure, common folks see the harsh heart breaking realistic truths about the events similar to what Steven Spielberg did with his 1993 masterpiece's 'Schindler's List'; rather than viewing something that is semi-safe, sugar coated & crowd-pleasing like the fictional movies, 1997's 'Life is Beautiful' & 1999's film 'Jacob the Liar'. Plus, he wanted to make sure, that there was no stone left unturned for Holocaust deniers to say that the events, feature in the film, did not happen. While, the movie does have some scenes inserted just to express the horror of the Holocaust, they far from legends. They come from Polanski's own accounts. Nevertheless, there was a few minor inaccuracy, I found, that didn't happen at all. One such thing was the relationship between Wladyslaw (Adrian Brody) and Dorota (Emilia Fox). Not only, was Dorota appears to be a made up character for the movie, but there was no apparent love connection between Wladyslaw and any woman, during the war. While, I do understand, that this character was probably created, in order to give a look at Szpilman's life before the occupation and to evoke audience sympathy for all that he lost during the war, but it wasn't really needed. The chocolate dinner scene with his family was really strong. If that wasn't enough, just rewatch the part where the titular character walk, through the empty ghetto. You see the pain, through Adrian Brody's eyes & body language. No able of dialogue, can vivid depict, how haunting & powerful, the actor's facial reactions are, throughout this movie. It reach me on a deeper level. Much in the same way, how the actor lost weight, in order to look more exhausted & weary & Brody learning how to really play the piano, very well. It's no wonder, why Adrien Brody became the youngest person to date to win an Academy Award for Best Actor at the age of 29. He did a good job, here. He deserve winning that prize in 2003. Honestly, to tell you, the truth, Polanski & his crew has cast this movie nearly perfectly. However, due to the huge amount of supporting performers and the lack of screen time focus on them. They don't really stand out, much as I wish, even though, their acting was great. Despite that, nearly every performer look and felt authentic with the little amount of time, they had. However, some of the literary references calls outs like the works of William Shakespeare & Fyodor Dostoevsky from Wladyslaw's brother, Henryk (Ed Stoppard) felt a little bit jarring. I doubt, he quotes those works in real-life. Despite that, I did like how the film shows that there is good & bad people, within both sides of the fence through the actions of German Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) & Szalas (Andrew Tiernan). Nice to see national groups so complex, than lopsided 100% demonic & angelic. The only real nitpick, I had on the historical value of them, were the fact that some of the army uniforms of the German soldiers, were a bit off. Nevertheless, the rest of wardrobe seem fitting with what people wore during that era. Another inaccuracy that, I notice in the film, was the idea that there was running water in abandoned bomb out buildings. In truth, water within the city, run out, way before the Warsaw Uprising in 1944. As for action, the film focused on the terrible treatment and unjust punishment that the Jewish & Polish people really had to go through. The violence are really graphic and somewhat hard to watch, at times. According to the bonus features of the DVD, many such acts of cruelty in the film were recreated from actual photographs and archival film footage shot by the Nazis. Nevertheless, the way, the movie was shot, was also amazing. A good example is the opening sequence, where we see a statue with its arm pointing to the left, and people & the city in the background. Every so often throughout the movie, we see the same figure, only this time, the background is more & more ruin by war, until nothing is left, but rubble. That is highly great use of props and scenery. Despite, the loss of his wife and her friends at the hands of Manson's family, and his infamous involvement with an 13 year old girl which forced him to flee the United States. Polanski in the midst of this controversies, has always been a great director, which to be reckoned with. Through the help of real-life locations in Europe, cinematic CGI effects and camera techniques, Polanski & his crew was able to immerse the audience in the determination and will for survival that was displayed by Szpilman. It's no wonder, why he won Best Director at the Academy Award. It's one of his best works. This motion picture is able to offer a voice to the millions of Jews who lost their lives to the Holocaust. Overall: It's a film that needs to be seen, both a history lesson and morality tale. A must watch for sure.",The Pianist

It's just as emotionally impacting, with a different focus on a single person as he is thrust out of his family and trying to survive in the Warsaw area (both inside and outside the ghetto). Unlike the characters of other Holocaust films, he is an everyman who is just doing the best he can without fighting back. The sets, cinematography and acting really bring to life the historical environment of wartime Warsaw with its sheer cold, violence, destruction and inhumanity.

He sees a lot and he has to deal with many difficulties and surpass a lot of obstacles in order to survive.I liked this movie very much because it is based on true events and it presents very well the true face of World War II. The direction which was made by Roman Polanski, it was for one more time simply exceptional and he created another masterpiece. He succeeded on making us understand how his main character was feeling and made it easier for us to follow his story. The interpretation of Adrien Brody who played as Wladyslaw Szpilman was simply amazing and he deserved the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Emilia Fox's who played as Dorota and Thomas Kretschmann's who played as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Pianist"" is an amazing movie that shows the cruel face of war and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.",The Pianist
46,Dr_Coulardeau,Humanity manages to survive in apocalyptic horror,10,4 March 2008,"Polanski had to make a film about the tragic past of the country whose name he carries. He had to concentrate on the primal historical ""crime"" committed by cosmic time and the war in 1939-1945, the extermination of the Jews by the Germans with the vast complicity of the Poles. The film is brilliant in its dense darkness because Polanski does not concentrate his tale so much on the community but on one particular Jew and his family he will be the only survivor of (it is a true story). He does not choose a Jew that would represent money or work, but a pianist, an artist representing cultural, universal and human talent that has no ethnic color whatsoever. And yet he moves further. After showing the ghettoization of the Jews in Warsaw, then their enslavement and extermination, then the escape of this pianist and his clandestine survival in the hands of non-Jews, some honest resistant fighters who put themselves in danger because of their political action, some (at least one) making a personal profit out of their help, the pianist also sees the meaningful and significant upheaval of the Jews when the ghetto is nearly empty. Pathetic but too late. He sees the doomed upheaval of the liberal resistant fighters and this time too early so that the Germans can exterminate them. Note here the film never really concentrate on the SS as the evil doers and the others as submissive followers. All Germans are concerned. The sacrifice of these resistant fighters leads to nothing since it clears the way for the communists to be the only ones to profit from the arrival of the Russians. Polanski even pushes one step further and there the film becomes a gospel about the shiny side of humanity. That pianist will survive the last few weeks thanks to a Wehrmacht officer who will accept to hide his presence and to feed him through to the end , and even give him a coat  that could have been tragic when the Russians arrived  before leaving. The officer had been convinced to provide this help by some music played on a piano by the Jew in the middle of ruins and on the eve to the final defeat. Music as the universal humanistic language beyond barbarity. Beautiful. Inspiring. A real salvation and epiphany for us all. That is exactly where pathos is discarded and love comes into the picture. A love that can transcend hatred and reach cosmic time in the smallness of human historical if not purely existential time. And If the pianist survive up to 2000, the German officer died in captivity in the USSR in 1952.

47,eddie_baggins,An incredibly touching tale of survival,10,2 December 2014,"Divisive director Roman Polanski has had a polarizing career both behind camera and in a personnel sense yet whatever one may feel about the man or the filmmaker there is little doubt that his most effective and most profound movie is 2002's The Pianist. A true life war tale of incredible determination and bravery, Polanski's telling of accomplished Poland pianist and Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman ranks as one of cinemas greatest War set tales thanks to an incredibly realistic feel and a raft of award worthy acting turns.Justifiably winning Polanski a Best Director Oscar, The Pianist sees the veteran director at his highest creative peak, an artist moulding with his material perfectly to create a vividly alive look into the atrocities that faced Warsaw's Jewish community and all others of similar creeds during Hitler's reign of terror. Polanski's Warsaw is brimming with stark images, from bodies strewn in the streets of the Jewish ""ghettos"", snow covered buildings in the harsh reality of a European winter and the strange comforts of an upmarket café as people go hungry outside, it's unquestionable that the setting of The Pianist is a character unto itself and part of the reason the movie works to the extent it does. It's interesting also to note how many a time Polanski films some of the movies most confronting scenes (wheelchair bound elders thrown from windows etc.) from a wide shot perspective, giving us the viewers a feeling of witnessing these events from far, powerless to stop what is happening yet not to the extent of being unaffected by it, much like our protagonist Wladyslaw Szpilman.It would be remiss now with a decade hindsight of Adrien Brody to not remark on the power he displayed here as Szpilman. Brody inhabits Szpilman to an extent you quickly forget it is an actor you are watching, whether he is brave, scared or as time wears on dangerously gaunt, Brody delivers the Oscar winning turn that seemingly set him up for an illustrious career that so far has sadly failed to eventuate. It's impossible to say with full assurance that it's Brody's fault completely that he has failed to get close creatively to what he delivered here in Polanski's effort or if it is filmmakers that have failed him in their material. Whatever the case may be regarding Brody's disappointing post-Pianist career there is no taking away from his ageless performance here in an ensemble that all play their parts to perfection from Frank Finlay as Szpilman's aging father through to Thomas Kretschmann's small but pivotal role as German captain Wilm Hosenfeld.A heartening tale of survival, an indictment of the horrors of war and the evil within humanity, The Pianist is not always an easy watch but it's an important one. A truly stunning tale of the will to survive and a tension filled 2 and a half hours thanks to Polanski's no fuss professional turn behind camera, this is true life based storytelling at its finest and a worthy film to sit alongside other revered War based film classics.5 bits of caramel out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",The Pianist
48,johnnyboyz,Stupendous story told through an equally impressive film.,8,5 May 2008,"That first scene where Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) plays in the recording suite, in Warsaw, for the Polish radio station sums up not only the entire film but Szpilman's dedication and attitude towards his music and his ability to play music. He is sitting there, live on air, as bombs rain down on the city before one hits the building he is in. People are starting to panic behind a soundproof window but it is a suspenseful panic because whilst we in the studio can see the panic and stress the disc jockey is going through, we are tantalisingly put on hold in terms of the horror of the attack. Then a bomb hits the studio room we're in and we wake up to what's happening, as does Szpilman. He must stop playing after previously continuing.The next time Szpilman plays the piano in a war zone where his life is threatened will be the crescendo for not only the Second World Wartime journey of horror Szpilman must endure, but also for the last time danger is that close to him as is a piano. There are scenes in the film where he is so close to a piano and yet playing it would result in his quick demise; but he is strong enough and powerful enough to be able to remember the music and play on through his mind  that adds extra importance to that near-the-end wartime scene when he must play with 'danger' watching on.The film begins and ends in Poland, during the Second World War and we are taken through the various stages of horror imposed by the invading Nazi Germans during their assault on most of mainland Europe. The film's opening third acts not too much like a documentary that might shovel the message: ""The Germans were evil people"" down our throats and not too much like an over the top experimental art film. I read that the film is European produced which should come as no surprise because its aesthetic is very much that of realism, the dominant European aesthetic. So we learn of one family's struggle through the days of the Nazi rule and the film presents us with a hierarchy of Nazi invoked violence. There are the initial scenes of humiliation as a man must walk in the gutter for the crime of being Jewish but there is also the equally awkward to watch as I'm sure it was to shoot scene at a cross roads when Jewish strangers must dance together. From here, the levels are cranked up further and further and it's not long before stone cold violence is being presented to us.But The Pianist is much more than a realistic take on Polish struggles at this time with a few scenes inter-cut to show some atrocity. The film is a breath of fresh air and suggest to me that Roman Polanski has viewed previous Second World War film efforts and corrected them where he thinks corrections should be made. Not a fan of Saving Private Ryan for its lack of mentioning other Allies? Well, Polanski takes time out here for his characters to mention the British and the French over the radio they listen to. Squeamish enough to look away from heavy violence in Second World War films but maintain an interest in the subject anyway? Well here, Polanski shoots his action and his violence in such a way that just these scenes alone go a long way in helping label him an 'auteur'.These scenes and shots are littered throughout the film and contain a certain point of view thinking behind them. For instance, when later on in the film there is guerrilla fighting between Germans and ghetto inhabitants, we always see the action from Szpilman's perspective that is to say the camera never cuts to ground level to show the violence or to try and sell it as entertainment. All we know is that one side is over there, one is over here and they fight; another touch being that for most of the time we do not see the rebels or where they shoot from but we do hear the gunfire. Likewise, when a German soldier is hit the camera never cuts to that level to confirm us the kill  everything is done in point of view format from the window and is kept that way. This gives a scene when Szpilman is actually on the ground level and close to a corpse of a woman he saw get shot a few days ago an extra bite because now we are closer to the kill, it is our first proper look at the result of a gunfight that has been and gone  our conscience and awareness catches up with us.And this tactic is used by Polanski more than once. When a crippled Jew is thrown from his balcony, we see it from the Szpilman's window but when Jews are executed by way of the gun, we are helplessly trapped on that ground level and must witness the atrocity, partly because Szpilman is not there watching from afar in his home or from a window. The added disturbance for these kills is that the cripple cannot defend himself and the fact the officer must reload his gun  also notice how each Jew lying down has their own way of dealing with the inevitable: some keep their face down on the floor but others look ahead giving everything added tragedy. The Pianist works on many levels of storytelling and informs as well as shocks without relying on neatly plotted stories  it is a war fought between superpowers told from the point of view of someone who is not a superpower, and the result is brilliant.",The Pianist
49,Red-125,Outstanding film,10,18 February 2003,"This film is  truly a magnificent accomplishment. Adrien Brody, an American-born actor, is able to convince us that he is a sensitive Polish Jew caught up in the holocaust.  My compliments to him on an outstanding acting job.The point of the film for me was not pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's miraculous survival of the Nazi Holocaust, but rather the portrayal of an important--and horrific--aspect of the Holocaust itself.By concentrating on the history of the Holocaust in the Warsaw Ghetto, director Roman Polanski has reminded us of the inconceivably evil events that occurred there.  [Not commented upon was the betrayal of the Polish partisans in Warsaw by the Russian army.  This grim story will require another movie.]In any event, this movie must be seen. Luckily, it is as close as most of us will ever come to evil on this massive a scale.  (At least, that is my hope. Current events may prove me wrong.)If we are to prevent evil, we must understand it, and if we are to understand it, we must make an emotional attachment to the people involved.  ""The Pianist"" makes this attachment possible.",The Pianist
50,leonblackwood,Powerful Masterpiece! 8/10,8,30 August 2015,"Review: I know that I'm a bit late with this movie, 13 years to be exact but now that I've watched it, I must admit, it is a powerful masterpiece. The movie is about a talented, Jewish pianist who uses all of his resources to escape from German soldiers during World War II. After splitting up from his family, he is left to fend for himself in a Warsaw ghetto, whilst fighting for food and cover. The acting from Adrien Brody was superb, especially when times were extremely hard for his character and the storyline was put together very well by Roman Polanski. I was a bit skeptical about the length of the film before watching it but it really didn't seem that long because of the detailed content and amazing cinematography. The ironic ending was shocking and surprising, which added to his amazing journey were he really hit rock bottom. I still find it hard to believe that it was a true story and it was one of those films were it takes some time to get out of that mode after watching it. Anyway, I'm not going to praise it anymore because I think you can tell that I really enjoyed it. Its hard to find a fault with the film so it has to get the thumbs up from me. Brilliant!Round-Up: I don't think that Adrien Brody, 42, has put in such a perfect performance since making this movie. I liked him in the Grand Budapest Hotel, Detachment, the Darjeeling Limited and Cadillac Records but his performance in this movie was excellent and he deserved the Oscar for a leading role. Personally, I like his acting style and he can comfortably switch genres with ease but the lack of good scripts are holding him back. He as proved that he can take on any challenge that is put in front of him but he hasn't hit the peak that he reached in 2002. Anyway, the movie was made by the acclaimed director, Roman Polanski, 82, who has been surrounded by controversy after being convicted of statutory rape on a 13 year old girl. Polanski then fled the USA to avoid prison so his movie making career was put on hold for some time. He's famous for making Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, Frantic, Bitter Moon, the Ninth Gate and Oliver Twist but his real comeback movie had to be this one. He also won a best director Oscar for this movie but he lost out to Chicago for the best picture. Polanski had his own personal experience with Nazis during World War II were he sadly lost his mother and was separated from his father for some time so this movie came from the bottom of his heart and you really can see it on screen. Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $120millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their war/drama movies about a talented Jewish pianist who is on the run from German soldiers. 8/10",The Pianist
51,helpless_dancer,"This should have been called ""The Hiding Place 2""",7,17 March 2004,"This film was not what I expected, which was something along the lines of the first half of Leon Uris' novel ""Exodus""; a rousing bloodletter depicting the Jews as a down but not out band of rubble rousers kicking some major Kraut ass. Instead I got some weasely little musician skulking from hidey hole to hidey hole with the help of kindhearted, caring Poles. I never understood why this guy was the recipient of all this largesse nor why he was spared by a German officer who just happened along when it could just as easily have been Herr Jackboot and his lucky Luger. Also fortunate for me as I was convinced every human in a German uniform was a re-tread of Attilla the Hun. Not a bad picture but it was too long and full of holes, however that could be due to the rapid jumps through time. How this movie won so many oscars I don't know: seems that if a picture deals with the Holocaust it stands a better chance of being awarded. What about the other 7 million folks the Nazis' butchered, think we need a film about them?",The Pianist

Awesome acting by Brody.,10,9 September 2013,"This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one man whose family gets perished in the Holocaust and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror while in hiding during the Nazi occupation. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them.

55,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""The Pianist"" is a brilliant composition with Polanski as the virtuoso composer",9,27 February 2008,"""The Pianist"" is a film that is impossible to dislike. In fact, it may be impossible to love it as well. It's a traumatic and difficult biographical account of one of the many unbelievable Holocaust survival stories. What makes ""Pianist"" stand out, however is the traumatic realism, the way that the story evolves to strike an emotional chord in regards to the Nazi's crimes and the unique role of music in the film.""The Pianist"" is the Oscar-winning best adapted screenplay from the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), an accomplished Jewish pianist in Warsaw right as World War II strikes. The film plays out as several scenes following a timeline from the initial invasion to the Warsaw ghetto to Szpilman's many hideouts in the city throughout the war. While the true sense of time is skewed and thus the true agony of Szpilman's isolation unrealized, the timeline clearly shows how the Jews and everyone in Warsaw for that matter had their lives transformed.What makes this film so effective is the way Oscar winners Ronald Harwood (screenplay), but mostly director Roman Polanski, go right for your heartstrings. The Nazis are portrayed as cold-blooded killers. There is no emotional build-up or excessive suspense in the film's violent moments. It is sudden and mechanical, leaving you wondering how anyone could do such a thing, when the fact of the matter was that's exactly how it happened: many times arbitrary, heartless killing. The whole effect that Polanski has created with the violence being viewed by Szpilman and his family through windows, isolated from the mêlée, is very effective in the way that it connects with how the viewer is very much isolated from the true nature of the violence. Polanski conditions you to be afraid every time Szpilman looks out the window that violence might occur, which is exactly what Szpilman was: very curious about what was going on, but truly afraid. The effect is brilliant.The films third Oscar winner, Brody, doesn't give an emotionally moving performance per say, but his performance is award-worthy in its realism through exquisite use of non-verbal skills and his natural demeanor. You can tell how the war has transformed him as a person through each stage--from day one to the final moments of the film.If there's a weakness to the film, it's the fact that it doesn't spend enough time grasping Szpilman as a pianist. There is no sense as to how important his playing is or why he plays. Instead, the focus is more on the unfolding the events of WWII. While the idea the film presents of him being a pianist simply because that's what he knows to do is effective towards the end, a greater understanding of what playing the piano means to him would have been ideal in the beginning.""The Pianist"" is a tremendous achievement in terms of successfully telling a often repeated story in a way that is uniquely effective. It focuses on the aspect of the Holocaust that speaks to perseverance, basic survival in a life of fear that plays out outside your window. It is a tough film, but it's a good one.",The Pianist
56,Vartiainen,Harrowing tale,8,7 September 2015,"Roman Polanski's The Pianist has earned recognition as one of the best films about Holocaust ever made. And for a good reason. Based on the memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman, it tells the story of him and his family trying to survive through the World War while at first harassed and then outright hunted by the Nazi government. It is the tale of Holocaust seen through one human fate. And while Szpilman's experiences were not the worst ones imaginable – if such things should even be measured – they are among the more unbelievable, showcasing his resilience, will to survive, and at times sheer dumb luck.Szpilman is played by Adrien Brody, and this is by far the best performance he has ever given. The role fits him like a glove, or perhaps it would be better to say that he fits the role like a glove, it's hard to say. Nevertheless, it's him that pulls you into the movie, into the journey through years filled with naught else but hardship, destruction, smoke and sorrow, with only brief moments of elusive hope. One of the more well-earned Academy Awards, I must say.Polanki's Academy Award for Directing was also well-earned in my opinion. Polanski's films have always had certain flair to them, an unmistakable style, but in this he has left out all of his usual lightheartedness and channeled all of his talent into making you see what it was really like to live through it all. And he succeeded. The pacing is iron tight and professional, the whole film looks amazing, all the scenes are poignant and interesting, all the dialogues work magnificently, all the characters are identifiable and memorable. Easily the best film from him I've seen.All in all The Pianist is the only film I've encountered that can stand as an equal next to Schindler's List as a film about the Holocaust. A modern classic.",The Pianist
57,Captain_Couth,The Cinema of Roman Polanski; A survivor's tale.,10,30 July 2005,"The Pianist (2002) was Roman Polanski's most personal film to date and an acting tour de force for Adrian Brody. The movie takes place during World War II. A brilliant pianist is forced to live like an animal during the war. Since he's of Jewish heritage, his family and others that have been ""branded"" with the star of David are forced to life in concentration camps and ghettos. But this film is not about this topic, that has been beaten to death already. The PIanist is about surviving and keeping one's head together just so they could live another day. Adrian Brody was quite impressive as the Pianist. He conveyed emotion and acting on a level that I never thought he could have ever attained. Roman Polanski's direction was razor sharp and he creates an environment that felt so authentic and real.In many ways the Pianist also reflects upon the life of Roman Polanski. He has been in the same situations before and has experienced life in the ghettos and camps. Just like the title character, Roman Polanski is a survivor and he can still make films with the best of them.Highest recommendation possible.",The Pianist
58,BeneCumb,"Strong survival story, without black-and-white approaches",8,5 February 2014,"As stories about vast sufferings such as genocide, holocaust, ethnic cleansing etc. are mostly revealed by sufferers-survivors, then they tend to be subjective and individualistic, full of hatred and grief, without so-called big picture, ""we"" are always good/right and ""they"" are always bad/wrong. Both the author of the autobiographical book (Władysław Szpilman) and its screenwriter (Ronald Harwood) have avoided the above and created a warmhearted, yet realistic and reasoned story about a Jewish family's fate around the events related to Warsaw Ghetto. The narration runs smoothly, we see people with different attitudes and characters among the Jews also, and not all Nazis were humiliators or ruthless killers... True, intellectuals such as musicians perceive the world in a different manner, they have more compassion and eagerness to understand rather than condemn, but still... The atmosphere is realistic, provides additional historical knowledge, and great choice of music plus talented aggregate direction makes The Pianist enjoyable to watch even if you the Szpilman's story (as I did not, the twists were additional value to me).The cast consists mostly of European actors (apart from Adrien Brody, but his father is of Polish Jewish descent), and Nazis were played by Germans. Of course, Brody is the greatest of them, besides, he spends most time on screen. I think he fully deserved his multiple awards, including Academy Award for Best Actor. But also the rest of the cast fitted into the atmosphere well - both by looks-wise and performance-wise.Altogether, The Pianist is a masterful panoramic narration and I liked it even more than Schindler's List.",The Pianist
59,ianlouisiana,"""You can't change history by turning a few faces to the wall""",9,9 May 2007,"Pandit Nehru,India's first Prime Minister,used to display pictures of former Colonial Governors in his palace.When questioned about this practise he said ""You can't change history by turning a few faces to the wall"".Roman Polanski is clearly an adherent of this school of thought.If you want to know why Europe will never become the Super - State so beloved of liberal politicians you have only to watch ""The Pianist"". Too much blood has been spilled on the streets and plains of that benighted continent for the sovereign nations within its boundaries ever to live in anything but wary suspicion of one another. From the Balkans to the Mediterranean tribal hatreds have reigned supreme for a thousand years. To the Polish people it made little difference whether the Germans or the Russians occupied their country.In implementing the Final Solution to the Jewish Problem, the Germans ethnically cleansed Warsaw. Later,fearing a resurgence of Polish militarism,the Russians took 20,000 army officers,intellectuals and aristocrats and shot them dead in the infamous Katyn Forest massacre.Not content with perpetrating this appalling atrocity,the Russians then did their best to make sure the Germans were blamed for it. Later still,rather than offend his ""good friend"" Stalin,Churchill declined to interfere with the Russian dictator's plans for thousands of Polish prisoners of war,thus condemning them to a lingering death in the Gulags. It would hardly be surprising then if Poland were to look at its E.U. colleagues in a rather jaundiced fashion. As well as demolishing for ever the pipe dream of Europeans living together in brotherly love,""The Pianist"" also looks at the idea of the role of the artist in a disintegrating society. Here he observes rather than participates, and survives. Of course many musicians and entertainers collaborated with the Nazis and lived well under their patronage.But this option was not available to a Jew from the Warsaw ghetto. Spiellman survives by becoming the Invisible Jew right up until the end of the German Occupation when his last hiding place is discovered by a Wermacht officer who,recognising his artistry,helps him to survive. Unfortunately he is not able to return the favour as the officer dies in a Russian p.o.w. camp a full seven years after the war actually ended. Mr Polanski's vision is a bleak one indeed. The brutalisation of an intelligent and sensitive man who gradually becomes a zombie - like figure totally unresponsive to the horrors around him,desiring only one thing - his personal survival. The contempt for human life shown by ""ordinary"" German soldiers,shooting Jews at random for no better reason other than that they could. Images linger;a man in a wheelchair being tipped over a balcony,a young woman shot in the head at point blank range for asking what was happening,ghetto police beating their fellow Jews enthusiastically to gain the approval of their masters,the Wermacht officer listening poker - faced to the ""untermenschen"" Jew playing Chopin on a grand piano and,most disturbing of all - and demonstrating the utter futility of hope - the look on the face of the man on the end of the row of workers being summarily executed when the killer's pistol runs out of ammunition.Thinking he has been spared he dares to look up for a second or two before the magazine is replaced and he shares the fate of his colleagues. Spiellman,""The Pianist"",untermenschen,invisible Jew,zombie,died at the age of 88 in 2000.I don't know whether he ever forgave;he certainly never forgot.If Polanski's movie helps to ensure that what happened to him and millions like him is never forgotten then not a single frame of it has been wasted.",The Pianist

He was very pragmatic in displaying violent Holocaust sequences that were frightening, but yet, historically imperative to observe. Polanski himself is considered a fugitive for fleeting the United States 20 years ago after being convicted of performing underage sex with a minor. Roman, congratulations on the critical acclaim that ""The Pianist"" has received. I just hope that the next film installments of ""Child's Play"" & ""The Fugitive"" are not in your Director wish list. Subject: Acting Piano Key Grade: ""A minor"" ""A"" is for Adrien! Adrien's Brody tour-de-force performance as Polish piano legend Wladyslaw Szpilman proved that Brody is no ""peeonist"" in the movie business. His subtle facial gestures while witnessing holocaust events were astonishing to observe. Yo Adrien: You played a brilliant tune of acting. However, the rest of the cast of ""The Pianist"" was a bit off-key.
Subject: Sound Piano Key Grade: ""D minor"" The sound of ""The Pianist"" was muzzled and undeterminable. The sound editors should have tweaked their cinematic instruments more efficiently.
Subject: Screenplay Piano key grade: ""C minor"" ""The Pianist"" screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award. I think Academy voters should play that ""Pianist"" piece again, and notice that it is not deserving of a nomination. Its dialogue was stale and clumsy.

61,FilmCriticLalitRao,So this film was made as it had got to be made ! ! !,4,13 August 2007,"It is a rather strange Jewish tradition that willingly or unwillingly all Jewish film makers direct films about the holocaust experience. This may be an easy way to get close to Jewish heritage,legacy and repay the debt owned to the community but what is more important to know is that a Jewish person making a film about holocaust would guarantee immediate success.So whether it is Spielberg or Polanski, Jewish filmmakers have made films about the terrible Jewish experience during holocaust days.In the case of both these directors they have made their respective holocaust films after having found money and popularity with other films.So more than a matter of creative task,it was more of a communal obligation for them to make an holocaust film. It is only in this context that one must consider The Pianist.This film is just plain OK nothing great or spectacular as everything can be foretold beforehand such as atrocities,suffering and ultimately liberation.The choice of Adrien Brody as the pianist is a good one as he carries the film single handedly on his shoulders.There is no other good reason which can justify the goodness of this film.",The Pianist
62,Chris_Docker,A monument to the things that never die,9,30 January 2003,"What does a country have when it has nothing? When it has been decimated, razed, conquered, humiliated? I remember the question being asked and answered once when I was in Poland. The answer was, its art. The poverty of a nation has been transformed into a love and respect for their great artists  a sincerity that is apparent everywhere you go in Warsaw, from the Opera House to the Old Town. Figures like Chopin represent something that cannot be destroyed by bombs, by external powers, by materialism.What sets The Pianist apart from other holocaust' movies is this ennobling of art, the spirituality of music especially, which has the power to live on, even to cross barriers of race and hatred. In its final analysis, it represents a triumph of the spirit rather than another bleak and horrific account of the Nazi incarceration and obliteration of Jews.(contains some minor plot spoilers): The film's authenticity is movingly enlightened by Director Polanski's own experiences, which included escaping from a Nazi concentration camp as a child in WW2. Comparisons with Schindler's List (a film he turned down the offer of directing) are inevitable  yet in the Piano we see not only European cinema's attention for detail, of lovingly crafted scenes that sweep us away with poetic beauty and simplicity, and characterisation that has us truly believing in the individuals and feeling with them, but also a touching lack of bitterness: it is a German officer, moved by the purity of the Jewish pianist's music, that saves him  a scene that in other hands could have been rendered overly simplistic is given depth and grandeur by the skill of Polanski and a remarkable performance by Adrien Brody  as well as a fantastic story that has been based fairly closely on actual events.Szpilman (Brody) is a Jewish pianist who is ghetto-ised when the Nazis invade Poland. A frail and delicate man, he is ill-equipped to cope with the rigours imposed, or the political shenanigans his colleagues use to try and gain favour. His music is his continual companion. Interestingly, the music featured on the soundtrack during his incarceration is all (if I remember correctly) German  Bach and Beethoven. It is only when, as a feeble, starving and barely human derelict, the threat is finally lifted from him and he plays the music of Chopin from his beloved Poland. Gentle, fragile music that, in all its fragility, rises phoenix-like to win the respect of the oppressor.

This is full of tension brought about the German atrocities and as the family descends further and further into hell. In many ways this is the most harrowing part of the film in that there are so many vulnerable family members to worry about as they move from disbelief and outrage to fear and some form of resignation.The bulk of the film though is a slow but fairly tense passage following Brody hiding and surviving alone in the empty ghetto, his life without food and warmth punctuated by moments of terror.The film is tense and like Schindler's List you do have this dreadful sense throughout of disbelief that this could have happened by people to people.

It is a remarkable tale of human survival sensitively brought to life by Polanski... The film carries us to the horrible reign of terror, where condemned people wearing the emblem of humiliation and oppression, are deprived of their rights, their human values and dignity, before being shipped to 'labor camps.' In Polanski's movie all the conventional elements of the drama are at peaks of excellence: Family union: When a father has to bargain to buy a single piece of caramel and divide it in six pieces to share it with each member of his family...Starvation: When a ghetto inhabitant assaults a helpless woman for a bowl of soup... Confusion: When a distraught woman wails on a platform because she smothered the cries of her baby with her hand...Love: When a young musician turns to his younger sister and utters with sad regret, ""I wish I knew you better."" Survival: When one man observes the war through his hide-outs around the city...Cruelty: When an old man in a wheelchair is thrown off the balcony by the Nazis because he failed to stand upon their entrance...Fear: When a talented musician sits down at the old piano, and pretends to play his music, keeping his fingers flowing with control above the vertical ivories...Discrimination: When bored Nazi guards entertain themselves by forcing grotesquely mismatched old and sick couples to dance to a Jewish street band by the ghetto gate...Horror: When condemned Jewish workers lie face-down in the street, while one SS guard walks down the line, shooting without remorse each one in the back of the head... Isolation: When a fugitive emerges from his harrowing hiding place and walks through a field of deserted ruins exactly like the last man alive on Polish soil..Adrien Brody gives an absolutely moving performance (based on descriptive facial expressions) as the Polish composer and pianist who stays alive as a Jew, and remains true to his ideals... Brody captures the character's desperation, his anger and grief, his willpower and perseverance, his passion and love of music... Polanski gives us the chance to better know his shock and disbelief, his ordeal and tragedy, his hope for fairness and humanity...Nominated for seven Academy Awards, this captivating drama went on to win three Oscars, including Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay...

70,kairingler,the pianist,10,31 December 2009,"What a mesmerizing film,, watched this the other night on IFC , just simply amazing.. i think that Adrien Brody gave the performance of his entire career with that film. the atrocities that were captured on film are surreal,, these are some of the same things that my mother and grandmother and mom told me about when i was little that they went through,, like the SS coming right up to the door and asking if you were hiding any Jews... the air raids at school,, all that stuff,, the cabinet in the movie that is used to hide Adrien Brody,, i actually have one of those,, it's a one piece and weighs almost a ton.. it's monstrous.. anyway back to the movie,, the landscape was awesome on the other side of the wall,, all of the bombed out buildings,, i really liked the part where the German officer talks to our main character not like a German officer but like a real person would. the movie just fascinated me to the point that it is one of my favorites.. there are a few scenes that might tend to shy people away from this, like the old man getting thrown out the window,, wheelchair and all,, but this is a story of triumph and survival,, and should be seen by young and old alike,,,,",The Pianist
71,Enchorde,Heartfelt history,8,2 April 2011,"The Pianist is a very gripping and heartfelt movie. Based on the memoirs of the talented pianist Szpilman, a polish Jew who survived the German occupation of Warzaw. The story is about his experiences inside and outside the ghetto the Germans established, how close he came to death by the oppressing forces. But also how he found both cruelty and kindness were least expected. At the same time it is a good testament of how Jews in common around him were treated. How many were killed or deported, fates that Szpilman only narrowly escaped.Well acted with Adrien Brody in the lead, and directed by Roman Polanski, the story is handled delicately. Both grand schemes and details are told. Most notably Szpilman's musicality is used to enhance feelings and memories in a few scenes. It's told and acted in a fashion, mostly low key, that augments the important statement it is. It also makes the movie, and the characters, easy to connect with and feel for. It's hard not to get engaged in the movie. Just like it is supposed to be.8/10",The Pianist
72,Boyo-2,"Brody, Polanski Most Deserving",10,17 April 2003,"For maybe the second time in the past twenty years, I am thrilled with the Best Actor winner.  I found Adrien Brody's performance to be pitch-perfect. It reminded me a little of Gregory Peck in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", who also won.  They shared a quiet intensity, an understated dignity and do not chew on the scenery in an attempt for attention.  Brody's win might signify a maturity among voters, a willingness to honor an actual performance on the screen.  So many people had Jack or Daniel winning, and I congratulate the voters on seeing what Adrien Brody brought to the movie.  Let's face it, with Eminem, Pedro Almovodar and Polanski/Brody winning, it might have been just an atypical year, and next year they can get back to giving awards to non-actors like Julia Roberts and Helen Hunt..I can't honestly say that I've seen another movie like it, even though there have been a slew of movies on the subject.  Several scenes are very intense, but you have to know that going in.Congrats to Roman, too.  If it were up to me, he would have won Best Director for ""Rosemary's Baby"" in 1968.  Maybe his was a we-owe-you Oscar, but given his personal difficulties, I kinda doubt it.10/10.",The Pianist
73,Steffi_P,"""That's what we have to believe""",9,5 April 2012,"The Pianist is a movie that often gets bundled together with Schindler's List as being ""about"" the holocaust. But this is a misunderstanding, a simplification even, of this picture (and of Schindler's List). It relates to the holocaust, but it is not the story of the holocaust – it's the story of one man. Władisław Szpilman was an artist, with great talent in his hands and his mind, and in him is represented something very precious in humanity. He also appears, as many such people really are, someone to whom the music mattered far more than current affairs. As such, he provides a unusual view on atrocity, that of someone who, rather than actively fight against it, for the most part tried simply to exist in spite of it.This somewhat passive yet dignified stance is ably reflected in Roman Polanski's direction, which has always been characterised by an excruciating intimacy with his subjects and a certain detachment from the world in which they inhabit. Here we see Szpilman glimpsing the war through windows and doorways, yet often himself or his hands in close-up. But Polanski's boldest strokes of genius are in his creation and presentation of the ghetto and its inhabitants, especially as regards how he draws our attention. The soldiers giving a cigarette to an elderly Jewish man and the couple fighting over a can of stew are foregrounded. Seconds later, a corpse lies innocuously in the background. When Władek's father is accosted by two Germans, we see a couple of Polish women hastily get out of the way. When the shot changes to reveal the officer's back, the focus is suddenly on his gun holster – it draws our attention to things that give a little extra breadth and context to a scene.Central to The Pianist is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the title character. It's an incredibly sedate performance, with everything below the surface, utterly commanding of our attention despite its understatement. His emotions seem muted – when reunited with a friend the merest ghost of a smile plays across his lips, but by now we know the character and understand that this is a deep and sincere expression. Brody virtually carries the movie alone, and one of the unfortunate things about The Pianist is that not one other performance stands out at all, and the inadequacy of some of the supporting players does hurt the earlier scenes a little.But perhaps the greatest thing about The Pianist is in the fine construction of its story. Although most of it is based incredibly faithfully on Szpilman's own memoir, the adaptation by Ronald Harwood gives it a certain dramatic course. There is one intensely poignant scene, and one of the few entirely fictionalised episodes, in which Szpilman is being sheltered by Dorota, wakes to the sound of her cello-playing and, just for a moment, he can imagine what life would be like if she had been his wife. Finally, the scene where Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play for him seems to be the key to the whole thing. It's as if every moment, every narrative line, points towards that scene. We've seen Germans forcing Jews to dance for their entertainment, which makes us first question Hosenfeld's motives. We've seen Szpilman's desperation to be reunited with a piano, his fingers making keystrokes in the air. In retrospect, this all seems a set-up for that encounter. In effect, The Pianist becomes a tale of a harrowing time, filtered through the beauty of a musical performance.",The Pianist
74,adamjohns-42575,A well won Oscar for Brody!,8,27 May 2020,"Although I may have come away from the whole experience feeling quite nauseous and almost as if I'd been through it all with him, this was actually a very good film.
Harrowing, horrifying and enough to make anyone want to end all wars in my opinion. The unnecessary death and destruction that occurred should never be repeated again and I do wish for a future that learns from the past, instead of continually repeating the same mistakes.This film is the first WWII film I have seen from the Polish perspective and through The Pianists eyes we get a glimpse of just some of the atrocities done.I personally have knocked off points from my rating because I found it a bit bloody and grotesque in places which has turned my stomach, but even I can't help but see the brilliance with which this film was directed and performed.
I gasped at points and must admit I got a bit lost about which girl was which and what they were doing with guns in the potatoes, but it was fascinating to watch, despite the despicable conduct.
I'm glad that there was little focus on the concentration camps as that has been covered already in many other films and it was nice to see a cameo for Nigel from Eastenders.",The Pianist
75,valleyjohn,"Brody is great - The film , not so great",7,15 March 2011,"There have been may great films about the the terrible way the Jewish population were treated by the Germans during World War II . Some great , some not so great. The Pianist is a critically acclaimed movie from 2002 that i had been looking forward to seeing for a while but i couldn't help but be a little disappointed with it. The best thing about this film , without a doubt , is the performance of Adrien Brody . It is a film that lacks the fee of a feature film. It looks much more like a TV film and a long one at that. I'm not a big fan of Maureen Lipman and with actors like her that makes it look even more less like a big movie. There are other things that don't ring true in the film. In the Jewish Ghetto the people were just walking past dead children without even looking or moving them and i don't care how bad things are you wouldn't ignore a dead or dying child. Also there is a scene where Szpilman is shot at when he comes out of building in a German coat but it's blindingly obvious that he was a Jewish survivor and it wouldn't happen. The Piano may have touched a nerve with a lot of people but it didn't do a great deal for me - having said that, it's still a 7 out of 10 movie.",The Pianist
76,truemythmedia,Polanski's Most Personal Film,8,11 November 2019,"If I'm being honest, I think Polanski winning the best director Oscar for this film is sort of like Scorsese winning his Oscar for ""The Departed""; both awards feel a bit like consolation Oscars. What do I mean by that? Well, I don't believe that this is the best film Polanski has put out; in fact, I wouldn't even put it in his top three. It is a good film, however, and with all the amazing movies that Polanski produced during his career I'm glad that he found a bit of recognition, even if it is for a film that isn't as polished as some of his others.Polanski himself said that his was the most personal film he's ever made, and there's good reason for that. Polanski was in his preteens when WWII washed over Poland, and he, like Wladyslaw Szpilman, survived the ghettos while their families were less fortunate (Polanski's mother was killed in Auschwitz). ""The Pianist"" shows a side of the holocaust that we rarely see, for it's not from the perspective of the camps which we see most of the film, but from the perspective of one who has escaped the camps and is still forced to live in a prison of isolation and degradation.As a whole, I think the story told in this movie is wonderful, and since it is based on a true story, it's hard to criticize it too much for structure, but at the same time, I do feel that this movie starts to drag in the second act. Most of the truly disturbing stuff happens in the first half of this film. The parts where Szpilman is separated from his family, the purging of the ghetto, the moving to concentration camps... all of that stuff happens within the first hour and fifteen minutes, and the last hour of this movie is mostly focused on Szpilman trying to stay quiet in apartments, trying to figure out what's gong on outside, and struggling to get over sickness. By no means does the story ever get boring- it's still fascinating, but the horrors of the first half of this movie are far more memorable than those in the second half.",The Pianist

People have slow lives. People have to wait. Refugees hiding in an apt like he was are not exactly racing around to 77 different places in 4 days-they sit, they wait, they hide, they fear that the Nazis will come at any moment, and of course they wait some more. Wars take time. Being forced into a labor camp took time to get thru, slow agonizing months, weeks, days of it. Polanski knows this and shows it. If you want a Michael Bay style MTV jump and cut type editing kinda flick, go elsewheres. This subject matter and this era deserves, merits nothing less than what Polanski gives it.

79,rosscinema,Haunting story,8,5 March 2003,"First let me make myself clear and say Roman Polanski is a disgusting pervert and I would love nothing more than to bring him back here and throw him in jail. Now, the film................................... As I watched this powerful film I had to be honest with myself on two levels. One, I feel its a notch or two below ""Schindler's List"" and we have seen this type of story filmed before. Two, a week after seeing this film I was still haunted by several scenes in the film and by the whole story itself. Very strong images that I just cannot forget. I guess thats the ultimate compliment. I just can't forget it. Adrien Brody is very strong in this film and his performance shows not just a character who survived but was so strong willed while everything began to unfold in his country and the atrocities started to rear its head and part of his strength shows as he helps hold his family together for as long as he can. The shots of the burnt out neighborhoods in Warsaw are very striking to look at. Brody climbs a wall and heads into what looks like miles of a demolished city.***SPOILER ALERT*** Towards the end of the film its very ironic that his greatest talent will ultimately save his life. He was lucky that the Nazi officer he plays the piano for obviously appreciates a true artist and was clearly awe struck by such beautiful playing. This is a special film and its story never ceases to be powerful and haunting no matter how many times you see it. I'll finish my comments by saying that Roman Polanski is a disgusting creep who belongs in jail!",The Pianist
80,eric262003,The Odd Couple Featuring Beautiful Music Mixed With Extreme Hate,9,5 November 2012,"It doesn't come very often that we are bear to witness something incredible that doesn't happen very often that works so well like two peas in a pod. Not only are we engaged to the scintillating sounds of beautiful piano music, while view the misfortune horrors of the epicenter of World War II, Warsaw Poland.Based on a true story of iconic musician Wladyslaw Szpilman, (Adrien Brody) you get this feeling of pity for the poor man and the horrors he faces throughout the movie and in hopes that nobody has to go through what he had to do to survive in this horrible war. But at the same time, it gives you that sense of gratitude that we (at least I hope) should never take life for granted and that we should love the life we live and to be lucky that we don't live in fear like Mr. Szpilman encountered in war-torn Nazi Poland. To be very blunt, Poland in WWII was no vacation spot, especially if you were of Jewish faith. Picture yourself in that era, your home is in rubble, your family and your friends all perished all the while trying to survive in one impossible situation after another. Left alone and the only food to eat was garbage and picking money off corpses is definitely no way to live. Mr. Szpilman faced this terror and to that it makes him a true war hero. Sure he bared no arms or was a soldier by any means, but his contribution to fighting the enemy was to sooth the savage beast, by way of ear-candy music.Director Roman Polanski's direction was one of the very best as he captures all the details to near perfection as he recreates the graphic imagery as a ploy to keep it audience gasping in deep emotion.Even the colors depicted here are very dark and drab as it symbolizes an era where bright vibrant colours is nowhere in sight. The green grass will only be given to us if we can stay on towards the end without trying to reach out for tissue paper. We all have the dishonour to explore the cattle scenes, where thousands of Jewish people get carried away on freight trains where they are being put to death. The scene itself is detailed enough to just metaphorically rip your heart out in two, just the locking of the doors and screaming pleas from actual human inside will make even a grown man cry. We also have the displeasure of witnessing the brutal humiliation the Jewish people suffered during these painful times. It's the ultimate insult to injury that truly comes to life here. But the realism is what makes this film so captivating and for that alone I give all my respects to Roman Polanski.Another reason ""The Pianist"" is so extraordinary is the performance by Adrien Brody. He practically brings Szpilman to life in all his defenceless struggles to survive and that is by far no simple task. His changes through the film is quite sublime as he goes from a classy and honoured musician to a long-suffering misfit who still feels he has to move on and love music as his only escape through life. His survival instincts really wears you in places you've only dream of before. as the film progresses we see the man's physical torture show as his legs become shattered and his body in constant quivers and his mouth is manifested with scurvy and his eyes lighting up with every minute he survives every deadly predicament. But his magic fingers still manages to stay in tack as he still has the stamina to strike beautiful notes on a dusty and dirty piano.This movie is a movie no home should be without. The lingering effects will likely stay with you for days or even weeks. We can only hope that these terrible events don't come our way, but with the amount of hate that our world faces, let's not hold our breaths. So the next time you feel blue or manifested with lingering anger, keep this movie within you at all times. It may make us feel better of ourselves and that things can be a lot worse. And that in-spite of the awful events that occurred in this movie, beautiful music is around to sooth the wounds that come alive in ""The Pianist.""",The Pianist

After watching the whole thing, I can't believe how stupid I was. This film is an experience everyone should have, the horrors of the war and the holocaust are nothing easy to view and this film doesn't side step the subject matter either.The Pianist is no Schindler's List, but it never tries to. It's no second rate Schindler either, it's telling it's own story and the two are powerful on their own merits. Polanski even adds in his own personal experiences, thus making it more personal.Adrien Brody is astonishing. I was upset he won he the Oscar, even though I didn't see the film at that time. Now after viewing it, I am satisfied. He gives a heartbreaking performance and seeing his transformation from start to finish shows the dedication Brody took to this role.The film does not tread lightly on the subject matter either, there are numerous scenes that will shock the viewer. I gasped a couple times and could only imagine what some of the characters were thinking at the time, specifically the scene in which the German officer had to reload his gun just to shoot the man on the ground.My favourite shot is when Brody is walking down the isolated street, full of luggage and personal belongings, crying over the death of his family, as it rains down ash.

83,philip_vanderveken,What's not to like about this movie?,10,20 October 2004,"The marketing departments of the different production houses always know how to make a huge hype about a movie. That's why I always try not to see a movie immediately after it gets many international prizes. I don't want to be disappointed because my expectations were just too high.For 'The Pianist' I didn't make an exception and I'm glad I didn't. I just saw it for the first time on DVD and I can only say that this is a true masterpiece. No, not because it got so many awards, neither because Roman Polanski directed it and certainly not because this is a movie about the Jews. I think this is a modern classic and a true masterpiece simply because I was blown away by the story! It shows how the Jews had to live in the ghetto with so many people on so little space, how the Nazi's randomly shot people and humiliated them, but also that not all Germans were such horrible pigs.Roman Polanski made an authentic movie about what happened in the Jewish ghettos and he did an excellent job if you ask me. He didn't portray the war and the Jews the way Spielberg did with Schindler's list. He shows us what happened by following Wvadyslav Szpilman - a young and famous pianist - from the last days before the beginning of the war until the war is over. Don't expect any images from the concentration camps like you saw in Spielberg's movie. The complete story is situated in Warsaw - in the Jewish Ghetto and never leaves it. Roman Polanski did not only create a great visual experience with this movie, it's the music that gives this film an extra and subtle, even poetical touch. There are many scenes of war and destruction, the special effects are very realistic and were never intended to glamorize the movie. Every scene is frightening and realistic, but it is the beautiful classical music that makes all the depicted horrors a little less hard to chew...I can recommend this film to everybody and I'm convinced that every one should see this movie at least once. But I think that the people who are interested in the history of the Jews during the second world war will love this movie the most. I guess that everybody who saw Schindler's list and loved it will love this one as well and I just can't say which one of the two was the best. I rewarded this movie with a 10/10.

But there are also aspects here, that you don't find in average movies about the subject. The total loneliness of the main character is what this is about and that's not a loneliness only in WW2 Poland, but for all times. That is the main point here and it's obvious in the scene there the main character walks totally by himself in the ruins.The dialogue is still the weak part and the fact that Polish-Jewish victims speak English to each other is not acceptable. If the ""market"" demanded that, Polanski should have had the integrity to refuse. This is commercialism at its worst and takes the film down to a lower level.",The Pianist

90,valadas,Victim and witness,7,24 February 2003,The first part of the movie shows us a vivid image of the horror of Nazi domination in Poland particularly in Warsaw and especially over the Jewish people object of daily violence and humiliation. We are spared nothing of the sheer brutality of those butchers and the reproduction of several aspects of everyday life in the occupied city is shown in a very realistic and convincing way. In the second part the protagonist (a renowned Jewish pianist) without ceasing to be a victim manages by hiding himself until the end of the occupation and thus becomes also a terrified witness of all the events which took place in Warsaw between 1942 and 1945 namely the ghetto and the city uprisings and finally its liberation by the Red Army. He owes his survival after all not only to good luck but also to the help of friends and foes with human feelings namely a member of the Jewish police created by the Nazis and a German officer who listens to him playing piano for the first time after the beginning of his ordeal. This is a climax scene which will make you swallow a lump in your throat out of emotion while watching it. It's a scene which will remain in the History of Cinema. This is more a realistic movie than a pathetic one though it has got enough pathos to arouse your deepest emotion.,The Pianist
91,tomsview,Playing for your life,9,5 January 2015,"Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"", brings home the horror of the Holocaust through one man's struggle to survive the evil that relentlessly mounts around him.Based on a true story, Władysław Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a Jewish pianist who plays live music on the radio in Warsaw at the outbreak of WW2. A talented man he eventually discovers that his greatest talent may be for survival. He is not inordinately heroic, but he does take chances such as helping smuggle weapons into the Warsaw Ghetto. However, he is a witness to heroes. After being saved almost by accident from deportation to Treblinka as the Nazis clear the Warsaw Ghetto, he sees the uprising of the surviving Jews who refuse to go without a fight.Later while sick with Jaundice, he witnesses another uprising as the Poles of Warsaw battle the Nazis for the city. Polanski handles the action scenes in a masterful manner. It is as though we are viewing events out of the window over Szpilman's shoulder.Polanski has always been able to get feeling from his actors, but here he shows he can also handle a big canvas with epic scenes that can stand comparison with the work of David Lean or Steven Spielberg. It would be hard to find scenes more harrowing than the ones Polanski has recreated of the Warsaw Ghetto.It may have been tempting to have a narrator fill us in on the complex historical events as the story unfolds, but Polanski tells this story without resorting to narration; the film has more immediacy without it. Although a fair amount of exposition is delivered through the character's conversations, it is seamless and allows Polanski to incorporate touches of wit often tinged with irony into a story that is anything but light.Szpilman and his family soon discover that what at first appear to be ridiculous edicts about race segregation by the Nazis are in fact deadly serious with dire consequences for them all. Although much of this background has been covered in documentaries, movies and mini-series, it is presented here with fresh insight by Polanski.In an inspired performance, Adrien Brody's Szpilman is buffeted by fate and is almost helpless to change the course of events. However he receives help from two women who knew him from his days playing the piano on the radio: a singer, Janina, and a Cellist, Dorata, played by Ruth Platt and Emelia Fox, who confusingly look a lot like each other. In another encounter, he is helped by a German officer (Thomas Kretschmann), who admires his playing.""The Pianist"" rivals ""The Pawnbroker"" in telling the story of how a decent man's life is torn apart by the Holocaust, while at the same time giving a sense of the enormity of one of the most horrific episodes in human history.",The Pianist

We see how the protagonist evolves from a well respected artist to a nomad who fights for his own survival. The film also shows details on the life of Jews before being brutally murdered by the Nazis. It was a very sad and tragic film compared to Schindler's List because of some gruesome events of the Holocaust. Since the film was set up in Warsaw, Poland it helps the viewers to delve more on the life of Szpilman. The music and sound effects that were used on the movie was also natural and added more emotions to the story. However, There are lots of disturbing scenes in this film that will make your stomach roll. The movie is not gory but the events will let you question how evil a man can be. All in all, The Pianist because it was based on real events of the life of Wladyslaw Szpilman. While watching the movie you will realize that you are actually not watching a film about a hero but rather a survivor. Adrien Brody's method acting makes this movie one of a kind. He poured his passion and love into making this movie and it shows. Well-written, well-acted and well-directed.",The Pianist
95,DeeNine-2,Brilliant and ultimately redemptive,10,8 January 2004,"It's hard to watch this film and not think of the situation in the Middle East today. What is worse, being stuffed into cattle cars and sent to death camps or being blown up by suicide bombers (or bulldozed by machines of steel)? For me the answer to this strangely relevant question is the former. I know that the old Jewish Defense League that I recall from my college days, whose slogan was something like, ""Never Again,"" would agree and so would most of the population of Israel. I think the terrorist Islamic groups ought to be required to view this film and/or some others like it on what happened to the Jews in Europe during the time of the Nazis so that they might have a better appreciation of why they will never be able to overrun Israel and why the United States continues to support Israel even while questioning some of Sharon's policies.Director Roman Polanski tells the familiar horror tale, this time with a concentration on the Jews of Warsaw and in particular on the famed pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. (The screenplay by Ronald Hardwood is based on Szpilman's memoir). Polanski spares us none of the brutality or the sadomasochism that is an inevitable interpretation of the events. He has the Jews meekly acquiesce to the increasingly horrific Nazi demands, and then has them just lie down when told to and accept a bullet through the skull.(Actually the vast majority of the Jews were not shot, of course, since the bullets were too costly and needed elsewhere. Indeed, as long as I am doing an aside, the stupidity of the Nazis in wasting their resources in genocide contributed to their losing the war. Small irony. But of course that was a war they could not win anyway. If by some magic they could have gotten the Jews--especially Jewish physicists--to work for them, that would have been their only chance, which once again demonstrates the self-destructive nature of Hitler and his followers.)Polanski shows us the Jews who collaborated with the Nazis and he even has a Jewish boy in the compound as they await the cattle cars selling candy at inflated prices, and then later a Nazi who talks to his Jewish workers about trading goods and says, rubbing his fingers together, ""That's what you're good at, isn't it?""It is interesting to compare The Pianist with Vittoria De Sica's The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (1971), an entirely different sort of film, but one with a similar theme and some similar scenes as the Jews, this time Italian Jews, are loaded into the cattle cars. The experience in these films is always the same for me in at least one respect. I want so much to shout: ""Do something! Don't let it happen! Charge them with the sheer mass of your bodies, if nothing else. Better to die fighting than to die like cattle."" But of course I was not there. We think we know what we would do, but unless we are confronted with the actual situation, we don't know. And of course we have hindsight.At one point, Szpilman and his brother are talking as they eat their thin soup and their bread. The brother tells him that the cattle cars are going to Treblinka but they return empty and that there are no cars containing food that go that way. He concludes, ""They are exterminating us.""Polanski's point is that the Nazis were able to actually commit their ghastly mass murders (and the German populace to excuse them) because they had come to believe that Jews were not human and that they were only killing vermin. The Jews had been demonized, which is the first step toward genocide. We declare that our enemies are not human, and that allows us to kill them with moral impunity. I had a new thought while I watched this time, thinking: a respect for animals and a belief in animal rights might serve as a moral buffer so that when one group of people hate each other and begin to turn the other into animals, they will still have a step to go before they can begin the mass murders.It is in the second half when Szpilman goes into hiding that Polanski's film distinguishes itself. Here the focus is entirely on Szpilman and his need to survive. The cinematography of the Warsaw streets, the apartments he lives in, the snow, the gray buildings, the people below in the streets, the hunger, the music that he hears in his mind but cannot play, the burned-out buildings, and then the scene in which the German officer says, ""Play something"" and he does. It is here that the film becomes magical and a testament to the best that is in humans. Note that the pianist has become in his beard and his persecution a Christ-like figure who never raised a hand against anyone. He is the Christ who turned the other cheek. And note that it is his ethereal talent as a great musician that saves him. This is Polanski's message and the reason he made the film. The best that is in humans can rise above the brute that is in humans.See this for Adrien Brody, who gave it everything he had, and then some. His performance will haunt you. Polanski's clear, Hollywood-like, almost Spielbergian direction, tells the story a bit too brightly at times, and a bit too simplistically at others, but he has planned well so that in the end we see that he has told it brilliantly. See this because we need to be reminded of what can happen when we give way to hate and prejudice.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",The Pianist
96,sme_no_densetsu,A striking Holocaust story,8,30 August 2014,"Roman Polanski can lay claim to having helmed one of the greatest films of all time with 1974's densely layered ""Chinatown"" but a Best Director Oscar eluded him until 2002's ""The Pianist"". It is the true story of a Jewish Polish pianist struggling to survive under Nazi rule in WWII-era Warsaw. The story has personal meaning for Polanski, who is himself a Holocaust survivor.For those familiar with Polanski's work behind the camera it should come as no surprise that the film is impeccably directed. There is a real sense of 'living' this experience through covert glances out of windows and half-shut doors.The Oscar-winning script may be leisurely paced but it does inject some action into the proceedings at opportune moments. The horrors of Nazi occupation are unflinchingly shown, making the movie not exactly pleasant to watch at times. However, despite this, the film is ultimately distinguished by its portrayals of courage, hope & compassion.The acting is uniformly good with Adrian Brody warranting special attention for his performance, which deservedly won him a Best Actor Oscar. Notably, Brody also performed some of the piano pieces himself. I must add that whoever handled the more virtuosic material is also deserving of praise.In the end, ""The Pianist"" successfully blends all of its components into a compelling tale of survival. The film's three Oscars and four additional nominations were each richly deserved. As I see it, this is the best movie of 2002 and, furthermore, worthy of comparison with the pinnacle of Holocaust films, ""Schindler's List"".",The Pianist

When it was over I turned to my companions and said  ""Adrien Brody just has to get an Oscar for this"". His performance has to be one of the best ever captured on film. You are just there with him in his tortured existence hiding from the Nazis. This movie captures all of it -  the claustrophobia of the walled commune, the desolate, terrifying railway stations and the desperate rebellion of the Poles against the Nazis when they held out for so long. Nothing is banging you over the head, it is all laid out so beautifully - the elegant middle class existence before the Nazis, then the harrowing work (if you were lucky), the cruelties, the hell that was Warsaw then. Roman Polanski has made a masterpiece and Adrien Brody is truly gifted and one to be watched. Extraordinary. 9 out of 10.",The Pianist

Polanski did an uncanny job of bringing the book to the big screen. It is such a compelling story as are almost all of them on this subject. I'm sure that I'm not alone in my fascination with the horrors of WWII and the Nazi rise to power. I would have found it hard to live with myself had I escaped death in Eastern Europe without killing at least one Nazi bastard.This movie portrays the Nazi era more accurately than any film I have ever seen.

99,frankde-jong,The most personal Polanski possible,7,10 June 2019,"That the Second World War was cruel and barbaric is nothing new. A movie about this war with only battle scenes (how spectacular they might be) is therefore ""middle of the road"". To become a real classic war movie the film needs something special.This something special can be an ""extra"", for example an unusual story line. Think of ""The best years of our lives"" (1946, William Wyler) about reintegration of the soldiers in civil society, or ""Der Untergang"" (2004, Oliver Hirschbiegel) about the last few days of Hitler sinking into (ever deeper) madness in his shelter in Berlin.In ""The pianist"" the special element is the leaving out of all heroism. Pianist Szpilman (Adrien Brody) survives pure by accident. He is not a hero but a spectator. Polanski, who survived the Holocaust himself, knows what he is talking (filming) about. He refused to co-operate in ""Schindler's List"" (1993, Steven Spielberg), a film in which heroism is an essential element.In ""The pianist"" (piano)music is a powerfull antidote to barbarism. In his performance over the First World War the Dutch comedian Diederik van Vleuten tells the story of the French composer Maurice Ravel who writes a piece of pianomusic that can be played with the left arm only for the German pianist Paul Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in the First World War. In both wars pianomusic therefore softened the damages that the war has done.",The Pianist

This is one of those rare films that you can watch again and again and it will still have the same impact on you as the first time you saw it.

103,TheUnknown837-1,"a powerful, harrowing film depicting one of the darkest eras in history composed of the memories of two men who experienced it first-hand",9,27 September 2009,"""The Pianist"" is a movie of the most appropriate kind. It tells a dark, harrowing true story, coming from the minds and memories of two people who experienced it first-hand. The movie is based on the autobiography of Wladyslaw Spzilman and was directed by Roman Polanski, who both escaped from the Jewish ghettos in Poland and went into hiding until the Second World War had ended. ""The Pianist"" is a composition composed of their memories and experiences and what results is a truly terrific, highly-detailed depiction of one of the darkest moments in human history.The movie depicts the life of Wladyslaw Spzilman (Adrien Brody), a Polish pianist who like all other Jews in Nazi-controlled Europe was forced into a ghetto during World War Two. After being separated from his family, Spzilman climbed over the wall and went into hiding with and sometimes without help from German sympathizers.Director Polanski, who lost his mother to the Holocaust, obviously not only used his own memories of the ghetto and the war, but collected enormous research in preparation for filming, because ""The Pianist"" depicts some truly harrowing situations such as this moment where a German officer, out of boredom, orders about twenty Jewish prisoners to line up. At random, he selects about half of them, orders them to lie flat on their stomachs, and then one by one walks by, shooting them in the head along the way and then letting the others go on. Like in Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, ""Schindler's List"" (1933), ""The Pianist"" does a tremendously great job at depicting the evil of the Nazis and the joy of their murders and torture.But also like ""Schindler's List"", Polanski does not simply display all of Nazi-controlled Europe as evil and prejudiced and murderous. Because like in real life, there were a great many people who did not look upon the Jewish people as less than human and delved into danger, risking their own lives and security to help them. The basic message is that prejudice and hatred exists, but it must be controlled and not be allowed to take over.Adrien Brody, who is seldom off-camera won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Spzilman and that's an absolutely commendable reward. Brody maintains the illusion that he's the real Wladyslaw Spzilman, never succumbing to the tendencies to go over the top with his performance or underplay his hand. He does not become too heroic or too somber. Brody personifies the terrible feeling of loss, but also the dwindling flame of hope and the will to keep going.Now there are some flaws to the movie. Roman Polanski does sometime go a little over the edge with his directing. Sometimes his montages of the ghetto and the city go on for a little too long and there is one sequence in particular where Spzilman plays Frederic Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in its almost full form. And while the music is beautiful, we must remember, this is a film we're watching, not a concert. And the movie does run for about twenty minutes too long, but other than that, this is a more than recommendable Holocaust movie. And again, its true power comes from the fact that it composed of the memories of two men who went through similar experiences and were fortunate enough just to survive the war, although the real Spzilman had to live out the rest of his life without what he'd lost and Polanski continues to do so today. And that is true not just of them, but of millions.",The Pianist

The movie itself is not a tear jerker.  I doubt one tear dropped my eyes.The movie I don't think is set up to be a tear jerker.  But it is numbing. Being numb and shocked kinda screw a person up.The movie seems quite real.  Circling around the experiences of this pianist.  It's rather subtle in it's approach.  It slowly gets you hooked and when it does, the jewish world goes to hell in poland.There was one gap in the storyline I couldn't figure out and that was the lack of information as to what happened to his girlfriend.

106,blott2319-1,"Sadly, I've seen this same story many times before",4,20 March 2020,"I'm just going to bite the bullet and say something that is potentially quite ugly and offensive, so I'll apologize in advance for how this makes me sound. I've seen enough of the Holocaust. I know it was probably the ugliest and most horrendous moments in humanity's history. I know that Nazis did unspeakably awful things to Jews. I know that life for anyone Jewish was unbearable, for however long they could keep their lives. But over the years I've seen so many films on the subject, my emotional reserves have been used up. I couldn't muster a tear for Wladyslaw Szpilman's struggle, and almost feel like I've become desensitized to scenes of Jews being carted off to concentration camps or shot in the streets. My brain still sees the horror and hates that this was reality, but my heart has been drowned in similar shots in countless movies to the point where it can't continue to break every time I see it. In fact, I just watched a couple of similar films based on the true stories of Jews fleeing the Holocaust within the last month, so perhaps it was just bad timing.I think the other reason that The Pianist didn't connect with me as well as any number of similar stories is the passive role that Szpilman plays in his own story. In many ways he is merely an observer of what happens. His story is about fleeing, watching, and others helping him. Once his family is removed from the equation, we don't form much of a bond with anyone else we see suffering. I'm not suggesting he did anything wrong, in fact his story is quite impressive. However, when I've seen films about people inside the concentration camps, or forced to endure heinous acts of cruelty, it's hard to be as impacted by a guy who is hiding. I hope this doesn't make me sound too much like a monster, and I certainly didn't hate The Pianist. In fact, I was looking forward to hearing him play more, because the actual music was marvelous. It's impossible to be bored by a movie like this, because there's always some new horrible thing around the corner. I guess my standards for movies in this genre have just been raised too much, and it will take something truly original or outstanding to hit me with the power of Holocaust movies that came before.",The Pianist

It is NOT Polanski's life, not his story. Others might forget that Polanski is a convicted child molester wanted by Federal authorities for statutory rape of a 13 year old girl. Polanski fled America to avoid prison. Some men might call statutory rape Getting Lucky but generally not when the girl is 13, definitely not if the girl is drugged-up by the assailant in order to assure her co-operation. I say it's reprehensible and Mr. Polanksi needs to return to face his crime.THE PIANIST is the very personal story of Szpilmann and his ordeal in surviving the Warsaw Ghetto -- which 95% did not survive; the awful events of that time compellingly told in an on-the-level manner not seen before in any of the hundreds of films dealing with World War II with focus on the Jews.That's the trouble, the focus is too often on the Jews. Young people today think the whole war was about the Jews. It wasn't. In Warsaw, while the Germans were killing Jews in the Ghetto, they were killing non-Jews not in the Ghetto in greater numbers. About 90% of the victims of Germany's invasion of Poland were Catholic. Where are the movies about Catholics? In Warsaw, one of the historic Catholic churches had been converted into a hospital. When the Germans arrived they at once massacred everybody in the hospital including the medical staff and buried everyone alive or dead by exploding the building. Nope, it wasn't just Jews.Szpilman is certainly entitled to have his story told, but taken in the larger context of too many World War II films telling about the Jews (8 million dead) and ignoring the 80 million others, it plays like propaganda.",The Pianist

It's a movie about the greatest crime in history, The Holocaust, told by two individuals who lived through it. It's based on the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish musician living with his family in Warsaw at the time of the Nazi invasion of Poland. The Szpilmans are Jewish and suffer the Nazi's monstrous designs for European Jewry.  The story's told in almost a matter-of-fact way. First there are the required identification markings for Jews, followed by restrictions of movement, limits on the ownership of money...slowly, one step at a time, leading to mass murder. And Wladyslaw Szpilman is there through it all, extraordinarily lucky, and blessed with great friends, so that he lives through all six years of Nazi occupation. An amazing story of human survival.The filmmaker, Roman Polanski, survived the Krakow ghetto as a child. With ""The Pianist"", he has made his best movie, his masterpiece, surpassing even his previous greats, ""Chinatown"" and ""Repulsion"". This is a great labor of love.

111,KnightsofNi11,Beautiful,8,14 March 2011,"It takes a lot of guts to make a film about arguably the most tragic event in human history. The director must put the film together with care and respect towards those depicted in the film. The writer must pay attention to the details of the events and bring them across in the most respectful nature without exploiting the events for cinematic gain. The actors must have the utmost care for the characters they portray in order to properly tell such a tragic story. Roman Polanski's The Pianist hits all these marks. The film is adapted from the memoirs of a famed Polish Jewish pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman. It chronicles the events of the Jewish exile into the Polish ghettos and their eventual relocation to the concentration camps. Szpilman, however, was not taken to a concentration camp and had to spend months hiding out from the Germans as they destroyed Warsaw, Poland. It is a very difficult story to portray, as well as watch, making it a harrowing yet memorable piece of art.I would never have known you could make such a despicable event such as this into such a glorious work of art. But Roman Polanski does it. He directs this film with such gracious beauty that shocks and mystifies the viewer. It is a film you can't take your eyes off of, no matter how much you want to. It is strange to call this such a beautiful film, but it is. It isn't beautiful in the sense that we often associate beauty with. It is beautiful in its portrayal of such tragic events through such a subtle and meticulous lens. Polanski directs every bit of this film with the utmost respect towards the subject matter. He stays so far away from making this an exploitation film and instead makes into into a work of art where the tragedy we witness on screen is almost hypnotic in its depiction.And to add to the emotional brilliance of this film, Adrien Brody does a fantastic job as Szpilman. His portrayal earned him an Academy Award for best actor and it's not difficult to realize why. He goes through such an dramatic transformation throughout this film, both physical and mental. He begins as an esteemed Polish pianist who is very likable and very homely. He has a loving family and a great career. But as the destruction of Warsaw caves in around him, so does his whole life. When he is separated from his family he must look after nobody but himself. It is very difficult to watch his tragic physical and mental deterioration. You think he's lost it all until the end of the film when you realize just how much he retains. Szpilman is not a pianist just to add a different kind of aspect to the film. He is a pianist because this supports the entire idea of the film. He shows just how important music and art is to the world, even in such tragic times. His ability to play the piano so well saves his life, as well as renews it. It is a fascinating thing to think about, even though it is something very subtle in the film.All this being said, The Pianist didn't strike as many emotional chords with me as I thought it would. I'm not sure why, but I was more mystified with the quality of the film, rather than emotionally moved by the events. They are undoubtedly tragic and still difficult to watch, but I didn't feel a lot of emotion boiling up inside of me while watching this film. I only felt a sincere amazement by how well the film was put together and how great Adrien Brody was. I am in no way saying this isn't an emotional film, but it just wasn't as striking to me as it would be to other people. I feel like more could have been done with this film, but at the same time I feel like there was just enough in this film to give it its consistent subtle beauty. I wasn't quite as drawn in by this film as I thought I would be, but it is undoubtedly excellent.The Pianist is a beautiful film. I wasn't moved by it enough for it to earn a spot in one of my all time favorite films, but it is a film experience I will never forget.

Scott tried in 'Blade Runner', Cameron in 'Abyss', Spielberg in 'Empire of the Sun', and Kubrick in 'Barry Lyndon'.  Why? Maybe because the scripts aren't accepted...This is your only spoiler warning...Here Polanski is visual in a different sense than these.  Spielberg is an emotion-control freak determined to manipulate our every reaction in order to make us accept his vision.  'Schindler' especially relied on this tactic; weaving images, emotions, and especially music together.Polanski survived the Holocaust, so most detail stems from his memory and not imagination.  So, while Spielberg is a Hollywood Jew reminiscing on the Holocaust, Polanski is the real deal.  His impersonal method is intentional since reality doesn't have background musical cues to warn us about upcoming suspense.  Polanski's focus is also different from his Western brethren. Compare his visualization of the ghetto wall to what Spielberg did with the 'Jurassic Park' fence.  The emphasis is not on people, it's circumstance. Brody is keen to surviving in these circumstances after 'Thin Red Line'. The last time Spielberg tried this was 'Raiders'.Here Polanski is darker than Spielberg.  Optimism is beat to death despite the loops the script takes into ""made-for-TV"" Land.  Compare the ""girl in the red dress"" in 'Schindler' to the ghetto-runner boy.  It's about comparing imagination to memory.'Training Day' had the same problems, but less insight into getting around them.Film is music though the two art forms are different creatures.  Both rely on pacing, measure, and beat, but film has three dimensions to sort through. This is distant and impersonal, yet understanding.  Thus, Polanski shows he is more human than his Hollywood counterparts that want to amaze. On that note, this sorely deserved an Oscar for Best Sound.  Even if the music is ersatz, the sound design isn't.Spielberg tried this movie earlier to lesser effect: it was called ""Empire of the Sun"".Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",The Pianist

However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, ""What will happen to us?"" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" and Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.--Shelly",The Pianist
117,Maziun,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,2,11 August 2013,"*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERSWhy this movie was made ? What's so interesting in Szpilman's story ? Nothing . I really mean nothing . They could make this movie with original character and it wouldn't change a thing . What's the point of the movie ? What's this movie is all about ? This is a story of one guy who survived war . That's it. The main hero is hardly a hero in any sense of that world . He's hardly a character. He's more like an object . Instrument that goes from one hands to another hands . This must be the most inactive hero in the history of the cinema . There isn't a single moment when he did something for others ( his family doesn't count). He's got no personality at all . The Oscar for Adrien Brody is a scandal . FOR WHAT ?! For one sad face through whole movie ?! He did convince me that he's a pianist . There's one good scene here when Szpilman ""plays"" on piano. It doesn't change the fact that ANYONE could play what Brody plays here . Even a guy from street like me. One of the most undeserved Oscars ever. The nomination for Oscar would be too much for his ""performance"".""The Pianist"" wastes time to show us scenes of Nazi's killing Jews and destroying Warsaw . I'm sorry , but it takes much more to touch my heart than showing simply bad people doing bad things to good people . Also , since our hero is an empty character , then why should I care if he's struggling to survive ? I didn't care for him for a moment. In the end the entire movie seems pointless and empty.There is a great Russian movie "" Sudba cheloveka"" from 1959 . It tells a story about a guy that lost everything during a war. Yet , he never give up . He kept helping other people when he could , even if it could cost him his life . It's a hunting movie about man that survived psychically and emotionally a nightmare of war . It's touching and strangely uplifting . Watch it and then watch Polanski's ""masterpiece"" and you should notice how empty and lacking heart ""The Pianist"" really is. One more thing . Some people in Warsaw were against Szpilman , some were neutral , some helped him . It's sad that in the end the movie seems to tell us that a German officer was the person responsible for Szpilman's survival. Really ?! Another ""Good Nazi "" cliché in Hollywood movie ?! In the ending credits there is only note about what happened to that German officer after the war. There is no information about the Polish people who helped Szpilman . Why ? If there is no information about their post war life , the movie should inform us about it. In the end it seems that Szpilman didn't give a f*** about people who saved him . Talk about disrespect. The German officer didn't risk anything at all . The war was already over . The Polish people who helped Szpilman risked their lives and lives of their families. They should be mentioned here.We shouldn't make movies about people like Szpilman . It's not a bad thing that he wanted to survive. Everybody wants to life . Still , there is no lesson for us – the audience from Szpilman's story. We should make movies about Irena Sendlerowa – true humans , true heroes.I give ""The Pianist"" 2/10 , because of beautiful music (Chopin).",The Pianist
118,Atreyu_II,A powerful film,7,9 December 2007,"""The Pianist"" is among the most regarded and praised movies about the Holocaust. It's a powerful, realistic and shocking movie, like ""Schindler's List"". However, it is shot in colors and it isn't 3 hours long, unlike that one. Besides, it was directed by Roman Polanski.Although this is a war movie (a type of film which I don't appreciate), there are two things that I liked very much about this: the soft, relaxing and beautiful sound of piano and Adrien Brody's performance (which is incredible and absolutely amazing) as the Jewish polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.It's not wrong to say that this is just another Holocaust film. That is one way to see things. But we can see things in a different way instead. Each war movie deals with the same basic subject, but each one has its own characteristics. For example, ""La Vitta è Bella"" focus on a character with great humor and colorful imagination. ""Empire of the Sun"" is about a boy fascinated by planes and the war in China and Japan (Pearl Harbor). ""Schindler's List"" is about a German who saves thousands of lives. ""The Pianist"" is about a genial musician. ""Edges of the Lord"" is about a Jewish little boy who is a fugitive to escape from a fatal destiny. And I could go on forever...Overall, a reasonable film, but not very recommendable for those who are not into this subject.",The Pianist
119,gelman@attglobal.net,Different than what I expected: Spoilers,9,29 January 2007,"Reviews of ""The Pianist"" had led me to expect that Adrien Brody's real life character, Wladyslav Szpilman, had survived the Holocaust because the Nazis valued him as an entertainer. Strictly speaking, that is true in the sense that one particular high-ranking Nazi hears him play near the very end of the film and does not betray him. However, the film is mainly about the Szpilman's survival within the Warsaw ghetto, his escape from the ghetto while the dispatch of Jews to the death camps is underway, his existence in hiding with the help of a Polish couple, the destruction of much of Warsaw by the Nazis during the uprising and, penultimately, his retreat back to the ghetto to hide until the Russians arrive. In short, 99 percent of the film has absolutely nothing to do with Nazi patronage and the 1 percent is the mercy extended to him because of his talent by a single Nazi commander. It is nonetheless a brilliant film, and Adrien Brody certainly deserves all the praise he received for his role as Szpilman. However, because of his unsavory reputation in the U.S., Roman Polanski received insufficient attention as the director of this film. Polanski's achievement is at least equal to Brody's and I believe that he would have received an Oscar if he weren't persona non grata in the U.S. and in Hollywood.",The Pianist
120,Pedro_H,Important and fascinating piece of work that I was made for all the right reasons.,8,1 February 2005,"Roman Polanski is something of a genius for being in the middle of world history. Even if he had never made a film in his life his autobiography would still have been fascinating and history packed. I won't try and summate it in detail, but it involves an escape not unlike the one presented here on film! Having turned down Schindler's List (for reasons much noted elsewhere) he decides to make this as his tribute to the anti-Jewish horrors of WWII. Interesting.Despite the awards (all deserved) this is not what you might call a ""fat"" film. It has one main theme: ""self preservation"" in a world gone mad and that limits my sympathy and involvement. Indeed the protagonist (Adrian Brody) has something that people can envy even in his darkest hour - a great musical talent.The question I ask myself is how much of this lifesaver influences his decisions? While many gave up or joined in the resistance movement, Brody watches from the window: very much a curious and non Hollywood approach. Brave but not to everyone's taste.The real Warsaw Ghetto was featured in the great Granada documentary series ""The World at War"" (quite frankly the most amazing piece of historical television ever created - if you can rent it do so) and nothing can be as shocking as the real pictures. However this is a close second.The early scenes of family life are like the scenes from the Titanic, we know what those on screen don't and we feel like calling out and warning them! In many ways the information is soft peddled and tokenised. We do not see the actual horrors of the death camps and even post war the survivors look too healthy to be believable. The only bum note in the entire movie.Although I had nothing to do with the making of this film I am proud of it. I am proud that millions of people have been educated and will continue to be educated about the horrors of war and what man does to man. But I didn't really enjoy it very much and I have no desire to see it again despite having some wonderful pieces of cinematography.",The Pianist
121,Ben_Cheshire,"Incredible survival story, and incredible demonstration of the power of cinema.",8,2 April 2004,"No other medium in the world has the power to illustrate for us what life would have been like in certain periods of the past but the cinema. One of the most important periods to not let go forgotton is the massacre and repression of Jews in Germany and occupied europe. If war and racism led to people to be killed like dogs and worse, simply for belonging to a certain group, then everyone should know about it, in my opinion, to keep history from repeating itself, and to make sure they didn't die for nothing. Don't turn your back on it - stare this movie in the face and look at what racism and intolerance can lead humans to do to other humans.Scene after scene of such penetrating truth and honesty encapsulate in cinematic episodes the horrors committed by the Nazis, the state of desperation of the Jews and many other aspects of this horrible ordeal, based on the personal memoirs of the main character, famed Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.It was based on the memoirs of Szpilman, which means we know he survives the war, and it was marketed with this in mind, as a survival story. And this, of course, is the main attraction to this movie: not to put oneself through experiencing the horrors of war, which i nevertheless believe is important, but of finding out how in heck a Jew living in Nazi occupied Poland could have survived, and as such it is a remarkable story of hope and courage against unbelievable odds. And not one calculated by a Hollywood studio to manipulate you - this stuff really happened, and to the character portrayed in this movie by Adrian Brody. Some of it also happened to Roman Polanski himself, which made this a very personal project for him.As i mentioned at the beginning, this movie demonstrates the power of cinema, and one of its central themes is the power of the arts, particularly music, to affect people, to make them feel.",The Pianist
122,tonypeacock-1,Polanski delivers a personal film. A triumph out of tragedy.,8,9 November 2020,"The Pianist is a 2002 film from director Roman Polanski based on the autobiographical experiences of Polish pianist Wladyslav Szpilman, a Jewish musician who died in 2000. His wartime experiences of German occupied Warsaw, Poland are the subject. Actor Adrien Brody portrays Szpilman.The film is not only based on the source material but on the personal experiences of the Jewish Polanski family.The film starts in 1939 and shows Wladyslav's experience of beginning as a pianist on a Warsaw radio station to the harrowing experience of Warsaw's sizeable Jewish population as the Second World War develops.
We see poverty engulf the Szpilman family, and the Jews being herded into a ghetto area of Warsaw, literally bricked in with a wall surrounding the ghetto.Millions of Jews including many thousands from Warsaw are sent to their deaths at Nazi concentration camps but somehow Wladyslav survives in the second half of the film, sheltering in sympathizers flats and attics.All the while we see on screen his physical health deteriorating through lack of food, water, light and exercise.
Warsaw is almost all destroyed as the war comes to an end and the Germans flee from allied attack to the West and Russian to the east.The film has excellent technical attributes including the production design that show the damage to Warsaw and the ghetto.Make up effects, lighting and Brody himself show his physical deterioration as the film goes on. The photography cleverly shows the colour being drained away to show Warsaw being destroyed.Polanski's personal pain inspires him to deliver his greatest film in several years rightfully gaining critical and award acclaim.",The Pianist
123,petarmatic,No words to describe...,9,22 January 2014,"how fantastic is this film.For a long time I wanted to write a review about this film. The warmth and suffering which comes out from the screen is unspeakable. It can be just compared with suffering of Roman Polanski in his life. What a tragic life, still it ended with a happy ending. Roman did not go to the USA for an unimportant thing he did in 1970s. He had a sex with a wet and willing minor. Who would not? Worse of all they wanted to lock him up for five years, he would serve sentence in the same jail where sentence is serving murderer of his pregnant wife, Manson. USA, helooooooo? What is it with you? Your legal system did not perform well in this case. For more details please look at an excellent documentary made about the case.Roman thank you for existing! I am your soul mate! I never met you although I spent some time in Paris looking for you but did not have chance and honor to meet you.In this film there are a lot of autobiographical elements of Polanski, you can feel it. Prosecuted men during whole of his life, a true Le Miserable, prosecuted and persecuted by many Jan Valganes. But with this film he resurfaces as a true hero of humanity. A winner! A true one!

124,esteban1747,The Story of a Jewish pianist during the II World War,9,3 November 2002,"Tough, real and excellent film of the director Roman Polanski. The scenes of the film are very cruel and shows to what extent Nazis hated Jewish people and the suffering of those living in Warsaw, who were first restricted to ghetto completely fenced around, and later deported to other areas. The pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) was able to escape to this deportation owing to various Jewish persons who helped him. Finally he escaped from the workshop, where selected Jewish people were working under control of Nazis, and decided to hide himself. In this later part he got even the help from a Nazi officer who had the opportunity to appreciate the art of Szpilman playing the piano. The content is really good and historically precise. My personal appreciation to Polanski for a such film and to Brody for his excellent acting.",The Pianist
125,jdkraus,A movie that should not be forgotten nor overlooked by audiences everywhere.,10,15 August 2008,"I was reluctant to see this movie at first because I thought it was going to be a copycat off of Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". Since he was among the first to depict the inhumanity and horrors of the Holocaust, I thought ""The Pianist"" would be weak in comparison. After more than five years of its release, I finally decided to sit down and watch ""The Pianist"".Since seeing Polanski's ""Chinatown"" (earlier this summer), never have I been so captivated by a movie. There is no comparison between this and ""Schindler's List"". Both are two totally different movies. After saying that, ""The Pianist"" is about the life of musician Wladyslaw Szpilman, who works at a radio station during WWII.Adrian Brody is subtle and marvelous as Szpilman. I've only seen him in a couple of movies, and this is his best work. The uniqueness of his character is that he's an ordinary man thrown into hellish circumstances. He gets separated from his family; he survives the termination of the Warsaw Ghetto, and the many battles that erupt in Poland. Everything is shown from his viewpoint. It is very disturbing and shocking, reminding me and audiences everywhere what had happened only sixty years ago.Roman Polanski captures these scenes unusually. He doesn't just throw them in your face, but keeps them in Szpilman's point of view. For instance, in the Warsaw Ghetto, there's a scene where a family is massacred because they're awake during curfew. Rather than showing it up-close, it keeps it is at a distance in the apartment of where Szpilman is hiding. This adds to the fear you feel for his character and safety. The works of the score and cinematography adds to the film's mood and plot. Of all the scenes in this film, the one that moved me the most is when Szpilman is forced to play the piano by Captain Hosenfeld. As he plays the piano, the expressions Brody reveals are tear-jerking. He's sad for what he has witnessed and the losses he had suffered, yet also he is happy because he's playing the piano, his one true love. As those emotions collide, they reflect not only how passionately he plays the piano, but also on his character's demons and struggles that he shows through indescribable facial expressions. I personally feel this is why he got his Oscar, which is very fair.""The Pianist"" is a movie that should not be forgotten nor overlooked by audiences everywhere. The only disappointment I have toward this movie is that it did not get Best Picture for the year 2002. 10/10",The Pianist

127,Movi3DO,Just Brutal,9,9 April 2021,"A Polish pianist tried to survive and hide during the gruesome years of WWII. Another film that I've wanted to watch.Right of the bat this movie was incredibly brutal and realistic in showing the horror and abuse that happened Poland. There were a lot of bodies, from old to young, and people getting shot at gun point. Also, poverty and struggle was also on full display. I went from shock to disbelief at the inhumanity I was witnessing.Most of the violence was shown in the first half, and the second half became more of a survival trip. The pianist barely held on to his life, and I felt pain for the character, being from one of the best pianist to rag.There were little background music to the movie. The only background music were piano songs during the transition of scenes. No music at all when the horror was on the screen.By not being shy from showing the violence, the movie emphasized the injustice and inhumanity that the Nazi brought to the Jewish people. However, even more surprising was that there were still some heart during this gruesome time.My issue was that since this is a survival story, audiences didn't get to learn too much about the main character, other than the fact that he was a pianist. It made sense for this type of movie, but I wished there were more to feel with the character even more.Overall, a brutal and powerful movie. 8.5/10.",The Pianist
128,Christian_Dimartino,"Everyone, its okay to enjoy a Roman Polanski film.",10,20 July 2011,"The infamous director Roman Polanski's best film came out in 2002, and it won him an Oscar. That film was The Pianist, and it won Polanski an Oscar and Adrian Brody an Oscar for his gripping role, but it was snubbed best picture. In my opinion, it deserved the Oscar and was the best film of 2002.The film tells the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist who's career was unfortunately put to a halt do to WWII. After he is saved and is separated from his family, he must make a new life for himself in hiding. There is also a German officer(Thomas Kretschmann) who is very sympathetic towards him.The journey that he goes on is rather intense. Polanski has created Nazi Germany in a way i've never seen before. Though Steven Sielberg's Schindler's list was an excellent film and was gritty, Polanski's Nazi Germany is a living hell. And I know it was, and so should you.I think that this is best Holocaust film ever made. Its a sad and moving film and at times rather disturbing. And I can't forget Brody's performance. This is the best performance of his career. Watching him struggle, you feel like you're in the movie yourself.Overall, The Pianist is a thrilling, moving, and engaging film that has to be seen, even though it feels a little longer than it actually is. But hey, Schindler's list was 3 hours, this is shorter. I loved that film, but I have to say that I preferred Polanski's film more. A masterpiece.A",The Pianist
129,bopdog,Scary parallels to present Iraqi war. Adrien Brody is jaw-droppingly amazing!,10,22 March 2003,"I just saw ""The Pianist"" at my local theater. It is Saturday, and the British and American armies and air forces are in day four of their invasion of Iraq. I couldn't help but notice the parallels between the German invasion of Poland in the movie, and events just now unfolding. In 1939 the Germans had their own ""documented"" grievances against the ""aggressive"" Poles. Later it was revealed that the dead German bodies produced for the German newsreel footage justifying their invasion of Poland were just some corpses the Nazis rounded up, and dressed in German and Polish uniforms. Point to make is that 69% of the Germans--- otherwise law abiding, Christian, decent people, probably felt the same grim determination modern day American and British peoples feel toward Iraq. No one is cheering the deaths, but they are nonetheless sanctioning them, in the name of some political agenda. Saddam as Hitler? Yes--- but Bush and Blair as Hitlers, too? Sadly, it seems so. ""The Pianist"" gives a human face to the real victims--- and I am fearful that many innocent Iraqis may get a double dose of what this movie points out--- first from their own government, and now again from ours.""The Pianist"" portrays the fate of Polish Jews during world war two. The movie is a true masterpiece, surpassing most other movies that have undertaken the story. I attended the movie reluctantly--- I did not feel like sitting through another retread of the same old theme, and the same old victims and villains. Great reviews tempted me, however, and I am glad I went. Adrien Brody, the star of the movie, is amazing. His performance was breathtaking. Really. I hope he wins his Oscar Sunday night. By the end of the movie I was in absolute admiration and awe. He is jaw-droppingly good.",The Pianist
130,lawprof,The Moral Neutrality of Music-Survival Through Music,10,28 December 2002,"Roman Polanski has created an extraordinary pastiche of one of the darkest chapters of Western history and the nadir of Polish communal life.  ""The Pianist"" follows, achingly and closely, the struggle to live of Warsaw piano virtuoso Wladislaw Szpilman.  The pianist is played by Adrien Brody who seems to have inhabited his character's body and soul. An incredible, indelible performance.Before Germany sent its legions into Poland on 1 September 1939 Szpilman and his family lived a comfortable bourgeois life in a Warsaw in which an endemic, genteel anti-Semitism rarely intruded into the safe world of the Jewish intelligentsia.  Szpilman enjoyed success both as a concert hall and radio performer.  Indeed the very bombs of a Luftwaffe raid forced him to flee the studio as Warsaw was reduced to submission.Rampant anti-Semitism emerged with the occupying German forces finding little need to whip Poles into paroxysms of previously barely sublimated hatred.  Decrees forbade Szpilman and all Jews from even the simple pleasure of sitting on a park bench.  Of course such restrictions were as nothing when all the Jews were ordered into a newly created ghetto, an area of Warsaw that could not possible accommodate the influx of uprooted families with any degree of acceptable sanitation or simple decency. 
Even worse was to come as Polanski unflinchingly shows both planned and random acts of German homicidal depravity, aided and abetted by Jewish police armed only with truncheons and the ephemeral and decidedly temporary power allowed by the Germans. The violence depicted is sickening, realistic and necessary to the story.Szpilman is saved from transport to a death camp right at the Umschlagplatz (the rail departure point) by a supervising Jewish police accomplice of the Germans.  His family, shoved into a cattle car, departs, never to be seen by him again.  All were murdered - father, mother, brother, two sisters.Szpilman's solo odyssey begins when he knows that he must escape the ghetto where plans for an uprising are slowly jelling.  To Polanski's credit Szpilman's desire to escape and live rather than fight the enemy to the death is presented non-judgmentally.  Szpilman in the film and in his book upon which it is closely based waxes with occasional fits of ambiguous feelings but, overall, his will to live, perhaps fueled by his single-minded desire to play the piano again, controls.  Who has the right to judge him?One desperate situation after another leaves an emaciated and fever-racked Szpilman, kept alive by Poles who detest not only Hitler's brutes but the obscenity of murderous anti-Semitism.Nearly at the end of his rope he is discovered by a German Wehrmacht (Army) captain who asks his occupation.  The officer motions him to a beat up and out-of-tune piano to prove his skill.  Upon doing so, Hauptmann Hossenfeld, somewhat blandly played by Thomas Kretschmann, succors the weak pianist with food and clothing. Hosenfeld purportedly aided other Jews but in the film it seems that if Szpilman didn't turn out to be a pianist, the officer at the least would not have helped him.Szpilman survives for the liberation of Warsaw by the Red Army and he resumes a brilliant career as a pianist, composer (of pop songs too) and member of a chamber music ensemble that tours Europe and the U.S. He died at age 88 two years ago.There is no false sentimentality in this film.  The violence of the Germans is in the viewers face and gasps from the audience were heard today more than once.  Szpilman as a fine artist had no greater right to survive than any other Jew.  But his success, visibility, ability to write and commitment to tell his story made his escape from the death-dealers of the Third Reich well-known.  Supposedly, over a million Poles have seen this movie to date. That is good for while the Polish nation was marked down as inferior by Hitler and while much death and privation was visited on Poland the sad reality is that very many more Poles accommodated the occupiers than hid and fed the desperate Jews.  And too many in Poland  today deny the extent of both the Holocaust and the willing assistance of Poles in its execution.Some have suggested that the music of Chopin, Bach and Beethoven which is part of the film is really simply a leitmotif to the story of an individual's will to live.  I don't agree.  For Szpilman, music was a counterpoint to Nazi brutality, a living heritage that he could not allow to be silenced by the conquerors.Music is, of course, morally neutral by itself.  Szpilman's deep love of music is easily matched by the knowledge and devotion to Bach and Beethoven by one of the greatest monsters of the Nazi regime, Heydrich.  What is important, as Polanski proudly and powerfully shows, is that those who are decent and who love music must win out if culture is to have meaning and relevance.I was bothered by one aspect of the film and I'm curious if any others were too.  A roiling debate over the past four or so years in Germany and to a lesser degree amongst American historians is the issue of the role played by the Wehrmacht, the Army, in actually committing crimes against humanity. For decades many Germans have argued that the soldiers more or less were at worst bystanders rather than initiators and principal perpetrators.  That role was assigned to the black-uniformed SS.In this film, virtually every murderer and abuser wears the ""feldgrau"" army uniform BUT in the end credits all are identified as SS personnel, save one: Hauptmann Hosenfeld.  This is curious.The mounting evidence is that the army committed very many atrocities in Eastern Europe against Jews and subjugated peoples.Roman Polanski's stunning vision of his native Warsaw is a haunting classic that will inform future generations of sober and stunned viewers. Polanski has performed a deed of epic moral hygiene in bringing Szpilman's saga to the screen.10/10.",The Pianist
131,movieguy1021,The Pianist: 8/10,8,14 April 2003,"Nominated for seven Academy Awards and winner of three, Roman Polanski's The Pianist is deserving in two of those three. Polanski's directing is superb, clearly the work of a master, and Ronald Harwood's screenplay is deeply moving and shocking. However, Adrien Brody should not have won, considering he was against Jack Nicholson in one of his greatest acting showcases, About Schmidt. I'll get into that later.Brody is Wladyslaw Szpilman. He's a pianist for Polish radio and he's Jewish. Being Jewish isn't exactly the greatest thing to be in Warsaw in the height of World War II, so him and his family has to move to a ghetto. However, his family is taken away, and the ghetto is destroyed, so Szpilman has to survive in the world with the help of others.The Pianist is touching and well thought out, with powerful moments throughout. It really makes us look at what we take for granted, and realize how lucky we are. Szpilman had to struggle just to get water to survive, yet we complain on when we have water out of the tap instead of `purified' spring water. Anyone in a luxury life should really check this movie out.It basically was a one-man show, and Brody could have been a lot better, since he basically was the movie. Although I see how he was nominated, because this role was a taxing one, I don't really see how anyone could consider this role the best acting job of the year. Clearly, Jack should have won.The cinematography was also superb. One shot I particularly liked is when Szpilman was walking through the completely destroyed city and a giant pan shot moving backwards. It was totally effective and I felt drawn in. It made me feel even more sorry for everything that happened there.

132,khatcher-2,Perhaps Polanski's masterpiece,8,10 December 2003,"Every time I listen to Chopin or Paderewski, every time I read Gunther Grass or Grazyna Borkowska, or I see a film like `Schindler's List' (qv) or this one - `The Pianist' - I catch myself saying `poor Poland'.A country that has been squashed uncomfortably between two erstwhile powerful nations, Germany and the then U.S.S.R., and that has even managed to disappear as a nation from the map, but has managed to maintain its national sense and feeling and identity, obviously imposes one's  respect. There can be, I feel, no denying that Poland was probably the nation which most suffered in the Second World War. And including the more than two million Jews who then lived there. All attempts at genocide are deplorable, whether it be the massacres of ex-Jugoslavija in Bosnia and Kersovo; whether it be the annihilations in Timur; whether it be the endless conflicts in Sierra Leone, Liberia or the Congo. It should be fairly easy then to understand why I rate `Schindler's List' as one of the best U.S. films - though almost entirely made in Europe - very high on my list, and why Roman Polanski's film runs nicely alongside. The fact that there is but just one decimal point between these two films on IMDb's `Top 250' listing does not surprise me in the least, and in fact I might - I repeat - might - even reverse the two on my own list. Yes, both are great films; both scoring around 8,7 on my own personal rating.Roman Polanski has, for me, always been a rather up-and-down director, such that `Rosemary's Baby' is a fine horror film; but his adaptation of Arturo Pérez-Reverte's novel for his film called `The Ninth Gate' (qv) was rather poor, not to say unacceptable. However, with `The Pianist' he has put together what must be his own personal masterpiece. Resorting to British, French, German, Russian and of course Polish commitment in the making of the film, and is thus a pan-European production, he managed to assemble some of the best possible means for making a tremendous film. And it is tremendous: from the scene setting to the interpretations of the the actors. It was all so terribly real; the Warsaw ghetto seizes your heart; the summary executions freeze your blood.
Adrien Brody as Wladyslaw Szpilman, on whose autobiography the film is built, is most certainly excellent, not just for his acting of the character, but also for his piano playing: Brody himself descends from a Hungarian mother. Szpilman not only composed for the piano, but also composed numerous songs. He died only a few years ago, nearly 90 years of age. Maybe he was not the greatest perfectionist in interpretation - that kind of thing is for people like Dinu Lipatti, Vladimir Horowitz, the Russian Sviatoslav Richter, or even the great master Wilhelm Kempff. But he was another real person in the midst of the carnage of Warszawa (Warsaw). Brody's feeling for this part was really extraordinary; a highly commendable performance.Fortunately the rest of the film's making was up to his standard, such that, without any doubt, Polanski's `The Pianist' is one of the great cinematographical classics of the last couple of decades.Wojciech Kilar's music combines nicely with Nocturnes and Waltzes from Frydryk Chopin, the Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven, and I think I caught a piece by Franz Liszt, though I am not sure.Brilliant photography and scene-setting rounds off a well-produced film.",The Pianist
133,rajdoctor,The Pianist,8,24 March 2008,"It was since the time the movie was released and won Oscar I wanted to see this movie. At last I got the time and occasion to see it.The story is about a famous young Polist Jew pianist in Warsaw, Germany during World war II (1939-1944) Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody). The Jews  including his family and he are subjected to atrocities by German army and subjected to move from their palatial upper class living to smaller quarters, and the journey continues till they are boarded to a train leading to gas chamber. Wladyslaw manages to escape the train journey and finds refuge at different places in most trying circumstances. Many a times nearing occasions of death and being caught; Wladysalw survives the War in the end, when he is rescued by the invading Polish army.Director Roman Polaski, who himself is a Polish Jew, had suffered and experienced similar circumstances during WW II. This is one of the most grandeur scale movie the Roman has directed till date. The set are magninomious, and the details of War and its impact on Warsaw city is depicted with utmost reality. The ghetto of Jew neighborhood with a segregating wall in between is chilling, so are numerous scenes when innocent Jews are shown being killed without any reason.Though this is a movie of a pianist, its main theme is to show the world (one more time) the atrocities Jews faced in Germany during WWII. This time  the master is at work. It just happens that the protagonist is a pianist, it could have had been anyone. It does not matter  because the purpose seems evidently clear  to show how Jews suffered during WWII.Adrien Brody does a great job in bringing a real character and his fears, desires to life. He lives the role in body and skin. He acting is a treat to watch.The cinematography is superb. It is obvious the movie must be very well funded.One question that intrigued me throughout the movie was  Why were Jews segregrated and killed by Germans? I tried to google it, and most of the blame goes to Hitler, who wanted to eliminate a few races. I also read that Jews are most arrogant, clever, intelligent and shrewd blood sucking money making machines, who are very mean in their business. I may need to read some what more on this before I can make my own conclusion.There is nothing new or great about the theme, but a good movie by a master Roman Polaski. It surely had to won accolades in US, as Jews rule the business world  especially Hollywood.(Stars 7.5 out of 10)",The Pianist
134,WriterDave,"Haunting, Timeless, Unforgettable, Uplifting...One for the Ages",10,23 February 2003,"Although not nearly as epic and emotionally devastating as ""Schindler's List"", Roman Polanski's deeply personal ""Pianist"" is by many measures a greater film and a work of true cinematic art. Haunting, cold, and austere where other films are sentimental and clichéd; true to the horrors of human existence where other films play for shock and gore; poignantly quiet where other films are overwhelmed by a swelling music score; darkly comic where other films don't even dare speak a word; and universally compelling where other films are specific and preachy (though a fact based Holocaust tale, this could have been anyone's tale of triumph over the horrors of man's brutality towards each other and could speak to a tribal warrior in Somalia or Palestinian separatist just as much as it does to a Jew from Poland). This is a film deeply rooted in the ethereal realm of the timeless artistic representation of man's struggle against adversity and our innate will to survive.I can't remember the last time I watched a film and was so transported into the world the director created (I think only ""Mulholland Drive"" has done this for me in recent years) and yet was so aware of the artistic nature of it all. I don't think I've ever sat through a film before and thought during so many scenes ""this is one for the ages."" My personal favorite scenes are the shot of the snow covered street running through a bombed out post-apocalyptic Warsaw and the eerily poetic shot of the German officer standing by the car on that very street at night underneath the full moon while the sounds of the piano playing from a bombed out building break the serene silence. The seamless editing and style of direction are purely European old school, and work wonderfully to keep the viewer entranced and spellbound by the state of Poland during WWII and the state of man's soul during times of tribulation. Polanski, working possibly from his own memories of his childhood in Poland during the Holocaust as well as by the actual accounts of his protagonist, gives this powerful tale its heart through the details (i.e. the family sharing the caramel while waiting to be taken away to the death camps). I can imagine sitting through this film a dozen times and still not catching everything. Half of the time I wasn't even sure what some of the details meant (like when he was playing piano at the ghetto club and one of the patrons asked him to stop playing so he could hear the sounds some coins made when he flipped them on the tabletop). Polanski clearly respects his audience as well as his characters and story. Sometimes we have to figure it out for ourselves what was the purpose of a certain scene or certain piece of dialogue (like when the German officer remarks that Szpilman, which only people with knowledge of foreign languages would know means ""player,"" is a very appropriate name for a pianist). It's this kind of attention to detail and respect for characters, setting, and audience alike that separate the good films from the great ones, and the movies from the works of art. This is a great work of art, and one of the greatest films of all time.",The Pianist
135,Eumenides_0,An Ode to the Triumph of the Human Spirit,9,14 February 2010,"The Pianist is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. It describes the life of Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a meek, ordinary man living in Warsaw when World War II starts. His life up until then is a bed of roses: he's a young, attractive man, and he plays piano over the radio. People know him and admire him.The war changes everything and all of a sudden Szpilman, a Jew, becomes one of the many victims of Nazi Germany. What the movie depicts is the complete breakdown of his ordinary life and his struggle to survive in the Warsaw Ghetto, hidden from the authorities.Directed by Roman Polanski, the movie is evidently brutal in its depiction of cruelty, or rather the banality of cruelty. Polanski shows horrible acts in the most, non-dramatic fashion: wheelchair-bound people being thrown off windows; children being beaten to death; people being shot for asking questions. He shows Szpilman and his family breaking apart: they go to the camps, with the certainty of death; Szpilman manages to run and becomes a wanderer in the empty Ghetto, surviving thanks to the good will of people, and to his own resourcefulness. Hidden in an apartment, he witnesses the world from a window, waiting for the end. From here he witnesses the Uprising, a heroic but failed attempt by the Jews to fight back the Nazis.Bleak as the movie is, The Pianist also has a lot of humor, even some comic relief, as well as an emphasis on the brighter side of human existence. It's quite easy to create misery and draw pity from a viewer. But Only great art knows that life is never simple or reducible to one view. Darkness and light, ugliness and beauty, despair and humor always exist hand-in-hand. No scene shows that more accurately than the ending, in which Szpilman is saved by the most unlikely of people.Adrien Brody is magnificent in this movie. Although he's not an actor I like, because he seems to take a personal glee in choosing horrible movies to star in, he nevertheless gives life-defining performance here, as the embodiment of the human will to survive against all adversities. Thomas Kretschmann, in his short role, was unforgettable too.After decades making masterworks, Roman Polanski was finally rewarded with an Oscar. Not only that but he was rewarded for one of his best movies. Ronald Harwood, who adapted Szpilman's autobiography, also deserved his Oscar, as well as Brody himself. On a final note, Pawel Edelman, the director of cinematography, contributed to making this movie the wonder it is, in his composition of every shot. His work in this movie should put him alongside great DPs like Roger Deakins and Robert Richardson. Great movies are a synthesis of many aspects, and few movies bring them together so seamlessly and perfectly as The Pianist.",The Pianist

Monday was Valentine's Day and I hadn't of gotten to see it until today. When I got done watching the film, I liked the movie very much. Adrien Brody played his role perfect as a musician who tries to survive the Warsaw ghetto during WWII. I guess that is why Brody won an Oscar for this film. The score for this film was also very fine, mainly because of Adrien Brody's piano playing. The directing, script, dialouge, acting, and original score was very good. The negatives to this movie is that there were a lot of slow scenes and boring parts to the movie. There were also some scenes in the movie, that actually shouldn't of been in there. Overall, a good film inside of a finely musicians soul and the horrific sights of the Holocaust.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B",The Pianist
137,ronakkotian,A depressing and soul-stirring experience.,10,11 September 2020,"There have been some great Holocaust films made in the past such as Schindler's List but what Roman Polanski, Ronald Harwood and Adrien Brody brought to The Pianist make it one of the best Holocaust films ever made.The Pianist follows Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish piano player, who tries to survive in the Polish ghetto during the Holocaust.There are very few films that leave me speechless by the end of it and The Pianist is no different. I remember just sitting as the credits rolled and thinking how lucky I was avoid such a brutal and inhumane period of time. The way Roman Polanksi directed this film is absolutely excellent. This is a very emotional experience that will bring you on the verge of tears because of how sad it is. Polanksi shows Nazi occupied Poland in such a brilliant way. I loved the ugly colour palette this film had as it reinforced how dark and depressing it was during that time. The way innocent people were shot for the smallest of things also showed the ruthless nature of the Germans and how difficult it was to survive. There is an absolutely fantastic shot at the end showing a whole row of destroyed buildings where I couldn't believe how cruel humanity was.I remember seeing Adrien Brody in films and TV shows like King Kong and Peaky Blinders but his performance in The Pianist is truly mesmerising. It's no surprise that he won an Oscar for it. I don't think I've ever felt this sympathetic towards a character in a film for a long time. Brody captures the helplessness and vulnerability of Szpilman perfectly. I cared for him all the way and really wanted him to survive and it's mainly because of the range of emotion Adrien Brody is able to bring in his performance that I was able to do that.The Pianist is one of the greatest Holocaust films I've seen. It shows Nazi occupied Poland in a very honest and realistic way without sugarcoating any of it and conveys the struggle a Jewish man goes through as heartbreaking as possible.

140,ruby_fff,"Hope against hope - a persistent, undiminishable light capable within (us)",8,19 January 2003,"The Pianist is a beautiful film in spite of the obvious bleak subject: the survival of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew during WWII in Warsaw. The film has much warmth - human spirit a-kindled behind it all. Adrien Brody is simply superb (almost surreal) in his true to life portrayal of Szpilman - tenacity and courage personified beyond reproach. We get to see a quieter side of Brody (Eric the war photo-journalist in Elie Chouraqui's ""Harrison's Flowers"" 2000, Sam the union organizer in Ken Loach's ""Bread and Roses"" 2000, Ritchie in Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" 1999) - an impressive, subdued performance all the way. Of course, director Roman Polanski is the sustaining unrelenting force throughout the entire 2 hrs. 28 mins. filmic journey. (In his interview with Charlie Rose on PBS, Brody mentioned that he was expected to lose 30 lbs. in weight to inhabit the lead role's emaciating period, besides prompted to diligently play Chopin on the piano for 6 months, 6 days a week.)This is much more than just another Holocaust movie (neither ""Schindler's List"" or ""Sophie's Choice""). It's Polanski's own: he gave the film quite an emotionally restrained treatment, almost felt like a documentary with doses of stark photography, not without hints of poetry at times. Have patience, there is action, suspense, and you shall be rewarded towards last part of the film, with teardrops for sure. Actually, occasional smiles and a chuckle were afforded. It is taut human drama complete - even though we know of the outcome, we still worry and startle, relieve and sigh along with Brody's character at his brush with danger throughout the film. The audience is very much in the first person alone and lonely with Szpilman on the screen. And when joy arrives, it's truly touching.The story is based on Szpilman's book (written 4 years after the war) with screenplay by Ronald Harwood (Cry the Beloved Country 1995, Mandela - TV 1987, The Dresser 1983.) The soundtrack included many Frédéric Chopin (1810-1849) piano pieces: Nocturne, Ballade, Prelude, Waltz, Polonaise and Mazurka. Wojciech Kilar provided additional music, and Hervé de Luze on film editing - both have collaborated on Polanski's ""Ninth Gate, The"" 1999, and ""Death and the Maiden"" 1994. Cinematography by Pawel Edelman, who was in many film projects by Polish writer-director Andrzej Wajda. Production designer Allan Starski and costume designer Anna Sheppard were involved in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" 1993. It's worthwhile to visit the official Web site:  Kudos to everyone involved on this project - such integrity and strength, and to R.P. Productions, Focus Features (also distributed Todd Hayne's ""Far From Heaven"" 2002), and Studio Canal.Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" truly deserved the Cannes Film Festival 2002 Palme d'Or award for the Best Feature film.",The Pianist
141,departed07,Adrian Brody's brilliant performance and Roman Polanski's direction help makes this a masterpiece,10,8 July 2003,"The year was 2003 when I fell in love with the Academy Award movies in which instead of watching mindless movies from XXX with Vin Diseal or The Scorpion King with The Rock, I started watching movies that were nominated for Academy Awards no matter what the award was. 2002 was a year of memorable movies from Chicago and it's razzle dazzle to Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York showing how violent America was during the early years of the mafia. But no movie has touched me more deeply and profound than Roman Polanski's look at the holocaust in ""The Pianist"" in which the director himself was a victim of the tragic event before escaping into hiding.Adrian Brody plays real life pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman who is force to move out of the apartment complexes with his family and into a small community after Hitler announces that certain parts of the country will be divided for those who are Jewish and those who are not. Wladyslaw and his family see the horrors that go on from soldiers forcing people to dance in the streets, homeless Jews fighting people for food; even at night when Nazi soldiers break into people's houses to execute Jews for no apparent reason. The scenes are so real that I gasped at first sight.After Wladyslaw and his family are moved into concentration camps to work in enslavement, he leaves where he's like a mouse hiding from building to building in avoiding the cats to get him. Years go by for the famous pianist in which the horrors are continuing in the streets for which there are a few people not afraid to die trying in the fight.The film is mainly a survival for the pianist, but the film's portrayal of what went on outside the concentration camps during the holocaust is a masterpiece that only Roman Polanski never thought he could show. Adrian Brody's performance is so wonderful that you'll be shaken by his performance; Thomas Kratchsmann as a sympathetic German Nazi soldier to Wladyslaw is another good portrayal in the film that shows how good acting can be when putting a survivalist and a soldier meeting face to face.",The Pianist
142,shark-43,Harrowing,8,28 December 2002,"This film is very powerful, very harrowing and hard to watch at times - the evil that humans can afflict on one another is chilling. A true story - it is effective and dramatic and even uplifting. I thought the lead actor, Brody did afine job (I've been a fan of his since his sterling work in Steven Soderburgh's underrated gem, King Of The Hill). But the film is flawed - Polanski has never been very subtle as a director lately and there are times when he could have pulled back (the little girl with the empty bird cage, the freakish looking jews being forced to dance with each other, etc.) - and the script in the long run (maybe because of the scope of the whole thing) is a bit thin in places - I never felt like I knew that much about Brody's character so while I was certainly invested in his survival - I didnt really feel much dimension to him. Afterawhile the film takes on a one, two, three feeling: this happened, then this happened, then this happened, etc. But the music is amazing, some strong performances and the art direction is Oscar caliber.

While the film doesn't break any new ground on fairly familiar subject matter, it benefits strongly from Adrien Brody's excellent work in the title role, making you identify and root for his character as he hides from the Nazi's and tries to survive till the war ends.

146,diane-34,I feel dumb that I did not watch this brilliant film earlier.,10,12 March 2005,"Fortunately my wife convinced me to see this film on TV several nights ago; initially I was reluctant because I thought that it would end up being too tough for a overly sensitive softy like myself-how wrong I was! Polanski's film was not what I had expected; in all the publicity surrounding his return to films, I had failed to grasp the substance of the film. In hindsight this surprises me because for many years I have been curious as to why film makers had not focused on the extraordinary events of the Warsaw Ghetto and its eventual destruction by the Nazis. I have always thought that this event was one of the most powerful of a string of events that have been overlooked by film makers for years. The enormity of all that happened from '38 to '45 seem to have prevented people from mining the history of those years. It is conceivable that producers feel there is a fatigue clause at work here, meaning that there is possibly a feeling by producers that the public might be tired of non-military war films. Another possibility concerns the Jewish people themselves-a concern that they do not want this terribly painful history to be mined simply to provide fodder for film makers. Whatever the reason, there is to my mind a noticeable absence of films about these monumental but painful events of the mid twentieth century.Even given the drawbacks associated with watching a film on the small screen, this movie immediately gave the impression that it had the touch of genius about it. Polanski's superb direction; Brody's superb acting and Edelman's brilliant cinematography impart the stamp of excellence on the film. I am a film viewer who watches films as collections of images so Edelman's work knocked me out! The beauty of the clarity and darkness of the camera work was wonderful to watch. POlanski's shot selection of course allowed Edelman ample canvas upon which to paint in those wonderful grays and muted colours that were eventually seen on the screen. Diane and I have the tape of the film and it will definitely be watched many times in the future. In short, the film is as good as the awards that it justifiably received.",The Pianist

149,TaylorYee94,Sometimes sole description of real-life events can be more dramatic than fiction,8,25 February 2021,"Szpilman's life is just hard to watch. Nazis make him not only hungry and sick but also humiliated and wretched, taking away his family, talents, personality, and even humanity. Military officers force Jews to dance on the street with strangers, whip workers 'to celebrate New Year', and mount & burn dead bodies and leave that heap of ashes as it is. Hopelessness and fear in Jews' eyes leave audience with deeper sorrow and anger against Nazis because these scenes display how Nazis view Jews, not human .. with inferiority. However, against all the difficulties and unfair & unjust treatment, Szpilman always strives to live and go on. His struggles though sad and inhumane because he has to walk away from his family tells that the life as hell is still more worth than the death, the end. After realizing this, his life looks even beautiful.I want to give more credits to screenwriting than directing. With phenomenal life real-figure Szpilman had to live and barbarian historical background, WWII, the director does not need to do much. The scriptwriter does a great job summarizing Szpilman's whole experience during World War II into 150 minutes, no embellishment, very straightforward but still captivating. It is not easy to take a few key events and concentrate on those. Many films adapted from the books often make mistakes of trying to put everything in one basket, a very small one with time limit. The narrative is also very well balanced between simplicity and complexity, many dynamic turn of events but still not distracted from the main story line.The director appropriately combines first-person pov with third-person pov. He follows protagonist's journey, and we can see his growth, realization, and feelings on the way. At the same time, through media such as window, people talking, and turn of the camera, we can also realize what happens in surrounding society and world, holding Nazi accountable for war crime. Cinematography emphasizes human's empty effort for power and greed. Among bombed-down buildings full of debris, Szpilman stands alone, so small like a speck in a distance. In reverse, he stands alone after everything is destroyed, showing his strength, perseverance, and resilience.My favorite scenes are two both when Szpilman plays piano in the air but in different places. The first one is at hiding place, trying to remain quiet not to get caught. The second one is at the wrecked hospital at the abyss of misery. Those two scenes symbolize the whole movie. Szpilman torn between reality and ideal has lost pleasure of playing piano which makes him who he is and his hope. Ironically, playing piano even in the air raises his hope amidst disasters and desolation.",The Pianist

152,roghache,Wrenching but poetic portrait of one Polish musician's Holocaust,10,21 May 2006,"This is for me the most poignant and powerful of all the movies depicting the Holocaust...the true life story of talented Polish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman. Normally I would scoff at descriptions of a film as poetic or artistic, but this one truly is both. The beautiful classical music adds passion to a tale that is already heart wrenching beyond words. The movie features magnificent cinematography, especially the winter street scenes and devastated, shell shocked buildings of Warsaw.As the film begins, Szpilman is playing a polonaise for a Warsaw radio station when a bomb impacts his studio. After this, the story continues on with the despicable discriminatory laws against Polish Jews, their forced resettlement into the Warsaw Ghetto, and the herding of ghetto residents (including all of Szpilman's family) off to concentration camps. Although he personally is spared the camps, Szpilman is conscripted into a German labour compound. He then escapes into hiding as a Jewish refugee, forced to take whatever assistance he can from others, usually complete strangers. During this period he helplessly witnesses, from the window of his hide out, the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 and Warsaw City Revolt of 1944.Adrien Brody is absolutely brilliant in his Oscar winning role as the pianist. Although many events are depicted pertaining to both family and strangers surrounding him, the movie focuses on one particular Jew's personal story, thus making it particularly compelling. We see all the unfolding horrors through Szpilman's eyes, and Brody conveys such emotion with them. This is a gifted musician but otherwise, quite an ordinary person who feels constant anguish at the atrocities around him. Yet he is unable to help, instead forced to struggle for his own survival. He engages in no futile heroics but does everything possible to stay alive, ferret out food sources, and avoid detection by the Nazis as he moves from one hiding place to another. There are so many riveting, horrendous scenes. Szpilman puts a human face on the initial loathsome laws when he is unable to go to the cafe or park with his new cellist friend, Jews being strictly forbidden. Later German soldiers force absurd dancing among ill matched ghetto couples in order to amuse themselves. Then much worse...A man in a wheelchair is dropped off a high building for refusing to stand up when Nazi soldiers enter his apartment. Later an entire line of Jewish men are forced to lay down and then systematically shot in the head one by one. When the Jews are being rounded up from the ghetto, one mother inadvertently smothers her baby to stifle its cries that would betray the family's hiding place.The Szpilman family drama is itself heartbreaking. As they are standing in line awaiting transport to the concentration camp, Szpilman tells his sister that he wished he knew her better, implying fears that they may be separated forever. Perhaps the most poignant scene is again while they are awaiting deportation, when the father divides a tiny caramel in enough pieces for each family member to have a minute bit. While the cruelty toward the Jews is well captured, the Jewish people in this story are portrayed not as saints but as real three dimensional individuals, which actually makes the story even more believable and compelling. Szpilman comes from a typical imperfect family, for example the members bickering over where they are going to hide the family's money. Polanski is unafraid to portray some of the Jews as assisting the Nazis by becoming Jewish police within the ghetto, in order to protect their own interests. Eventually we see a German officer with compassion, not all are evil monsters.The film pays tribute to the music of the Polish composer, Chopin. Szpilman is himself a gifted pianist, whose talents must lay dormant during these horrific years, like all the other talents of countless other Jews...those that were fortunate enough to survive at all. The film wrenchingly depicts how much Szpilman misses classical music and his piano playing. In one scene, his fingers hover in rapid movement over the keys as he imagines the beautiful music of that particular piece, sound being forbidden lest it lead to his detection. Later when asked to play for the German officer, he conveys such intense passion. Perhaps a wee bit rusty at first, his fingers soon dance dramatically across the keyboard pouring forth the haunting Chopin Ballade, as Szpilman is overwhelmed with emotion. Some claim that he believes he is playing for his life or fears this will be his last performance ever, but I think he is simply lost in the pure joy of being able to play his exquisite music again, at least this once.For me, The Pianist far surpasses even Schindler's List. This gripping story of one man's will to survive is definitely the best Holocaust film ever made.",The Pianist

154,Mike_Devine,Music is stronger than any weapon,8,18 November 2018,"Traditional World War II-era films focus on the battlefields, whether in Europe or the Pacific. In 2002's 'The Pianist,' we instead see what it's like to live as a civilian under German occupation, focusing specifically on the story of a Polish Jew who must do everything he can to survive over the course of the later years during the war.'Pianist' is really made what it is by Adrien Brody, whose Oscar-winning performance earned much praise from critics and audiences alike. Brody portrays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a pianist who plays on Poland's national radio broadcast. Close with his family, Szpilman eventually must learn to survive in the ghettos of Warsaw and beyond as he fights for his life against the Nazi forces. The story is a real one, which makes it that much more remarkable, but as powerful as it is on paper, it's a tough task to bring it to life onscreen. Fortunately, Brody is able to breathe life into the role, bringing the emotion and rawness needed to make it a respectful telling of the story.As a film itself, 'Pianist' doesn't feel lofty or overproduced. Instead, it accurately depicts the grittiness and horror of war, but still feels somewhat simple. The use of ambient sound over dialogue in long stretches of the film heightens the emotion and forces audiences to really pay attention to what they're seeing unfold on the screen. This is likely what helped Roman Polanski take home the Oscar for best director, despite his high profile personal issues. But the most powerful scene comes near the film's climax - a moment when Szpilman almost literally play for his life. This scene is by far the defining one in the film and will be remembered for years to come.'The Pianist' is a serious account of a dark part of history, but it tells a story that showcases how music can transcend parties, nationalities and allegiances.",The Pianist

I regret not seeing it sooner and if you haven't seen it, I recommend doing so.Painting a ultra-realistic portrait of one man's life during the darkest period in the 20th century, Polanski masterfully and easily shows what he can do with the right kind of brush I have always enjoyed his films; ""Rosemary's Baby"" being one of my all time favorite movies. But ""The Pianist"" is very different. It is quite serious and disturbing while not being gratuitous. The violence shown here is very sickening but it is never overly graphic. It is not exploitative, as it well shouldn't be. It is heart wrenching to say the least. Adrien Brody confidently commands the respect of the viewer in what has to be the role of his career. He definitely deserved the Oscar he got for this one.In short, every human being alive should see this film. It is unbiased, extremely effective and completely genuine.

159,smakawhat,"Great start, slow pacing middle, triumphant end",7,15 February 2003,"One of the best picture nominees this year about the true life of a Jewish Polish concert pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, who somehow in the madness of W.W.II managed to elude the death camps.  Yes it is a holocaust film, albeit it does not take place there, but in the ghettos of Warsaw where over 300,000 jews were rounded up and confined to live in a small segregated area of the city in absolute squalor.  I've always said that good films are never depressing, but this one does get there.  And how can it not sometimes. Towards the middle of the film when the audience is aware of the impending doom, the characters still cling on to hope of radio contacts that the allies are coming to save them (not knowing of course they will fail), and the idea that all the moving is temporary..  This is the only slow part of the film, and we're stuck in some powerful yet obligatory scenes,  soldiers whipping and torturing jews, starvation, plagues, death marches, random on the spot executions,  jews turning on each other in the ghetto just to survive, some pretty hellish stuff.  But Polanski manages to bring together a great cast (nazis and jews alike both good and bad) that bring the film to its peak as Szpilman at one point manages to escape and live with the resistance who will protect him.  But life is not easy, and a crushingly good scene involves Szpliman hiding out in an apartment by himself, running out of food and then we watch helplessly as he breaks several dishes accidentally while rummaging through the cupboards and gives himself away to his German neighbors.Thinking of how it must have been to live in that era and not be found out, must have been just pure hell.  And it is when these moments when we know that just the slightest exposure of Szpilman's talents and presence will get him killed in an instant, that the film exceeds tremendously.  While the middle slows down, the last 1/2 hour is a cinematic triumph and for the most part turns the murderous German forces on its head (I won't give the scenes away).  Throw in a cinematographic great look at bombed out Warsaw, and you have some more to entertain you.Remember... War is madness..Pretty good filmRating 7 out of 10",The Pianist
160,bix171,An Underrated Genius,10,23 February 2003,"Perhaps because he generally works in a direct, naturalistic style and in a variety of genres, Roman Polanski could quite possibly be the most underrated filmmaker working today--which makes a film like `The Pianist' all the more startling. It's unexpected filmmaking, a complex yet measured account of Jewish life in wartime Warsaw, both in the ghetto and outside of it, filmed, as always, in Polanski's clean, simple style with beautiful camerawork (by Pawel Edelman) and evocative lighting. Though it may appear cold and methodical, Polanski's passion is subversively striking. Based on pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's memoir (unread) and adapted in an admirably economical fashion by Ronald Harwood, his story probably serves as a counterpoint to Polanski's own: the end titles reveal Szpilman remained in Poland until his death in 2000 whereas Polanski has essentially exiled himself from his native land and there's a sense of wistfulness in his recreation of the time; Warsaw is displayed as a peaceful urban center disrupted only by the advent of Nazism and, with one notable exception, the Poles are depicted as concerned citizens given to either helping or at least ignoring the Jews. Although it's as brutal to watch as `Schindler's List' (there are some short images that are truly troubling) the comparisons are not quite apt: whereas `Schindler's List' concerned itself with the Holocaust as a topic in and of itself, `The Pianist' seems intrigued not only with that subject but also with art's critical importance in a crisis society: not only is it a savior in troubled times but it's the bridge that bonds victim and barbarian; Polanski seems intent on providing a no-fuss definition of art that can have meaning to any audience. Adrien Brody plays the title role, subtly moving from cocksure artist to emaciated blank canvas for the director to project his fears and wonders. Absolutely outstanding, the work of a true cinematic genius.",The Pianist
161,Dockelektro,Touching and striking,8,20 January 2004,"Polanski is back, it seems, and manages to make a holocaust movie without being connected to ""Schindler's List"" and grabbing at the same time an Oscar for Best Director of the year. And it is indeed a return to form: Polanski recollects a true story, and depicts the horrors and the human paradox present in the darkest time for humanity. Adrien Brody looks like he was born for the role - his face alone provides everything we need to understand what he feels. The result is altogether touching and striking, even if the story doesn't benefit from some real life facts: if you think about it, the hero is never responsible for his own survival, always helped by friends. But even if this will make the experience a little more bitter for screenwriters and story-obsessed people, the movie is still chilling, and every time you see it and remember that it all happened once, you'll be hair-raised.",The Pianist
162,brenttraft,A Film Everyone Should See,10,30 January 2003,"I almost did not see `The Pianist' because I am squeamish and I was afraid I would not be able to sit through the Nazi atrocities on the screen. 
I am very glad I saw this film.  While it does have it's share of horrible violence, that is not the emphasis.  Instead it is a movie about survival during adversity.Another reason I almost did not see this film is because Roman Polanski has not make a good film in over 20 years.  `The Pianist' is his masterpiece, overshadowing his successful films from over 20 years ago.I am very disappointed at the Motion Picture Guild giving this film an `R' rating.  With all the gratuitous violence in PG-13 movies and on television these days I do not think this film deserved an `R' rating.
Not only do I think this film is suitable for persons under 17; I think they should show this film to high school students as part of their education.This is a film that everyone should see.  It is one of the best films of the year and will be considered a classic in the years to come.",The Pianist
163,Eternality,The Pianist is a realistic account of one of the darkest periods of humanity through the melancholic eyes of Adrien Brody's Szpilman,9,22 May 2011,"Winning three Oscars including Best Director and the top prize at Cannes, The Pianist is Roman Polanski's lifelong dream come true. Polanski shot to international stardom with Knife In The Water in 1962, a film about sexual rivalry. He would revisit the theme of sex in his next few films such as Repulsion and Cul-De-Sac. His best known work remains to be the incomparable Chinatown, one of the few truly defining films of 70s American cinema. The Pianist somehow feels like an anomaly in Polanski's body of work. It is a historical drama about Nazi persecution in WWII Poland. Yet it is undoubtedly his most personal film to date. A Jew himself, Polanski is born of Polish parents who were sent to concentration camp. His maturity in handling a tough subject matter like the Holocaust can be observed by the manner in which he directed the film. Unlike Spielberg's Schindler's List, Polanski has shot The Pianist in full color. The Oscar-nominated cinematography by Pawel Edelman (Ray, Oliver Twist) is stunning. The elegant architecture of Warsaw radiates in many scenes, and the texture of every frame is so smooth that the film seems like a seamless storyboard of expertly-directed and edited sequences one after another, though there are some pacing problems that mar the viewing experience. There is one hauntingly exquisite scene towards the end of the film showing Adrien Brody's character, Szpilman, climbing over a wall. As he makes it to the other side, the camera elevates slowly from behind the wall to reveal a desolate piece of snow-covered land with rows of wrecked houses either side of a wide, gaping path. This scene represents the culmination of the impressive cinematographic vision of both Polanski and Edelman for The Pianist. Adrien Brody who wins the Oscar cuts a display of sympathy. One of the most apt casting decisions in recent years, Brody embodies not so much the physicality of the Jews, but rather a figure of restrained calmness that typifies Jews of that time. Knowing the fate of his race under the brutal stranglehold of Hitler, Szpilman somewhat escapes certain death, riding on luck most of the time, and the support of close 'underground' allies. Unlike Schindler's List, The Pianist only elicits muted emotional responses from the audience. While harrowing at times, Polanski's film lacks the power and emotional depth that made Spielberg's black-and- white masterpiece one of the greatest films of all-time. Another flaw of The Pianist lies in the second half during scenes of Szpilman hiding out alone in one apartment after another in a German-occupied region. During this time, the film moves the slowest, appearing lackluster and flat, somewhat bereft of hope that the remainder of the film might return to its compelling first half. Nevertheless, The Pianist is a realistic account of one of the darkest periods of humanity through the melancholic eyes of Adrien Brody's Szpilman, one of Poland's most well-known musicians. The film signifies a return to form for Polanski whom faded away in the late 80s. He is past his prime, but once in a while, he is still capable of jolting fans of cinema awake with beautiful motion pictures like this. Recommended!

And with the WWII as the backdrop, it's even more heart-wrenching. It really made me so angry at how sometimes, there are those who have a prejudice against the Jews. Living in the modern times where we always talk about equality, maybe this is something I just cannot accept.It's really amazing to see how Adrian Brody who plays the famous Polish Jew pianist to really portray the emotions of how a Jew survive the horrors of WWII. War stories and events through the papers and my past History classes are what I only know of WWII so far and so this is something which almost blew my mind away. I may have watched those few documentaries my former History teacher had picked in relating to my History lessons before, watching the accounts of the war through the eyes of ordinary people is even more humane.And this is one of those movies. It's always very sad that in the end that a war only leaves nothing behind but innocent people who suffered or died from it.

168,Thrashman88,Superb Drama,9,17 November 2003,"Last night I finally rented ""The Pianist"" on DVD. It was a superb film and a crude drama on the realities of world war two. Although it has a good pace for a non-action movie, it does tend to get sluggish in parts and you can't help but wonder what actually happens to the rest of the pianist's family (probably killed in Treblinka, but the film never addresses their fate). Also, I wish some more insight could have been given to the Nazi Officer who ultimately became the pianist's savior, as it was truly rare to see such human kindness during a war like this. At parts, it reminded me a bit of ""Schindler's List"", although this is a more personal story and one of survival. Polanski did a terrific job capturing the atmosphere of Warsaw in Ruins and it's good to see that the Academy finally lifted their ""ban"" on him. If you want to see a good world war 2 drama, don't hesitate to rent this movie.",The Pianist
169,mhasheider,Roman Polanski is back in true form.,10,29 March 2003,"If there was one person who survived the Holocaust and several years later, he/she was willing enough to bring their tale of survival to the big screen. Director Roman Polanski (""Chinatown"", ""Rosemary's Baby"", ""Tess"") may be one of those brave individuals who might fit the billing and in his latest film - ""The Pianist"" couldn't have come out in dangerous times like now.The story is based on the life (and memoir) of the late Wladyslaw Spzilman, who lived with his parents and siblings in Warsaw, Poland in 1939, the year that Nazi Germany started to make their horrifying invasion of their unsuspecting European neighbors. Wladyslaw makes his living as a pianist and is performing for a Polish radio when he's interrupted by bomb blasts. For that point, Spzilman and the other Jews who lived in Europe at the time that German onslaught began, their lives would never be the same again. By telling Spzilman's story here, Polanski finally gets the chance to tell his own story as well.Adrien Brody, who recently won the Best Actor Oscar for his mesmerizing and unforgettable portrayal of the musician is flat out incredible. Brody plays his character like you wouldn't expect in any Polanski movie yet you're left wondering how does Wladyslaw manage to avoid being caught by the SS or death itself? If I were like the main character here, trying to survive in an occupied city and stay out of sight isn't only impossible, but a true testament of the human heart.The best scene in ""The Pianist"" are saved for the second half of the movie. Since Spzilman has been separated from his family and has been living on the lam with some help from unlikely sources. One of them is a sympatheic German captain, Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretchmann), who is kind enough to let Wladyslaw play the piano and Hosenfeld returns the favor by giving what appeared to be German chocolate and a loaf of bread. While Spzilman isn't only performing in front of the captain, he's also entertaining the other German soldiers to think about besides being chased by the Red Army.Once I left the theater in Madison where I saw the film, it made me think twice before even looking at a piano again. Plus, ""The Pianist"" is one of those rare movies that wants the viewer to feel satisfied and look at life itself instead taking it for granted. I can't finish this review by applauding the Academy's decision not only to give Brody an Oscar, but to Polanski (Best Director) and screenwriter Ronald Harwood (Best Screenplay from another material) yet it didn't earn the Best Picture award sad to say.

170,nicolechan916,An incredible true story with amazing acting.,8,30 November 2014,"There were some transitions throughout the film that were a bit too sudden and could probably have been fixed easily to provide a better flow. Regardless, this film was stellar. The story itself is very detailed and had lots of moments that make you jump or tense up from the suspense. But I think what really made this film fantastic, was how minimalist it was. Simplicity is best.The acting was superb. I think this was the first film where I noticed Brody, and his performance is top-notch. I heard he had to lose a lot of weight for the movie, and it really showed on screen. The surrounding cast also did well in showing the emotions of their characters.However it does seem to drag along at some parts. Though it was still engaging, they could have probably shortened it just a bit to make it more rounded. Or maybe it felt a bit draggy because he was hiding and so to that effect, the audience had to wait in hiding with him. In that sense, then the 'pauses' in the movie was a good addition.Also a good addition, though I have no liking for, were the gruesome scenes of violence. They were really vivid and was made even more prominent with the plain view of bodies everywhere.

""The Pianist"" isn't as bloody or deathly as ""Schindler's List"" but it definitely shows that survivors came out of it due to pure luck, and that life is very fragile. Adrien Brody as the pianist, Szpilman, lives in the Warsaw Ghetto and after his family is taken to concentration camps, he must survive on luck and his own willpower. He works manual labor and hides at every opportunity. The film is very tense, because his fate is often uncertain, and his allies are often thwarted for their immeasurable help in hiding him. Brody gives an impeccable and heart wrenching performance, starting out with his family and trying to remain light about the situation, but eventually he becomes frail and hollow inside.

SURVIVAL WAS HIS MASTERPIECE.Roman Polanski, a great director (Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby) whose parents survived the Polish ghetto, gathers the emotional strength to tell us a tale about the horrific, brutal persecution of Jews during the second war. This is no small achievement. What we see on the screen is not pleasant and Polanski delivers it with ruthless efficiency, holding back on any sentimental tools that Hollywood so often uses. This is a powerful masterpiece.This is the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew, a gifted pianist, whose family is taken to a concentration camp and he is left to scatter along the empty, lifeless streets of a destroyed Warsaw. Szpilman is played by Adrien Brody, a relatively unknown actor at the time, who consumes the role and delivers an extremely powerful, haunting performance throughout the whole film.Polanski's direction also deserves praise. Technically superior, Polanski's camera-work is strategic in the way it translates imagery on the screen.

175,fimimix,..the tagline says it all...,10,9 May 2006,"""The Pianist"" is a movie which plays upon all of your emotions, as it should. Unless you had seen rushes at the theater or on TV (I hadn't), one would expect it to be primarily about classical music. It did get my attention because of its director, Roman Polanski; I've always enjoyed his films. Of course, that he can't come to this country to collect awards he wins also heightened expectations for the film. I was not familiar with a single member of the movie's cast. That bothered only because I didn't know who was doing what - I recognized Adrien Brody (Szpilman)from the ads in THE LOS ANGELES TIMES. He was in every scene; after all, it was his story. Not being familiar with the other actors-actresses certainly didn't effect my total enjoyment of it.The first view of Adrien Brody at the piano kinda bothered me. I have never seen such emotionless piano-playing; I was a piano-student, concert-grade pianist. Even in those days - when it was REALLY difficult to break-into the classical music-field because there was no competitive programs to give you a boost - I don't buy all those stone-faced guys, great ones all, who played without the tiniest smile or pained expression. Were they robots? Neither do I think the overly-impassioned banging of today's pianists is natural, arms flailing and hair flying. Of course, unless a pianist doesn't do some of that, it's difficult for the audience in the last row of the balcony to determine if the pianist is just earning his breakfast, or really enjoying his music. It's kinda ludicrous for a pianist to get all worked-up over most Polish music, even Chopin's. BUT, I defy a pianist to play the really difficult music of Rachmaninov and not show one emotion over the energy it takes to keep pain-racked arms and hands working together or independently of one another - plus, the absolute fear you are not going to remember what comes next.""The Pianist"" was Roman Polansky's very best directing. Every scene was perfect and every actor/actress gave wonderful performances. The development of characters, to show the repressive torture all endured, even BEFORE the death-camps, looked absolutely real. The degradation they suffered just to survive was graphically clear. Also graphic were the roles of indifference - perhaps out of fear for themselves ? - most of the ""Polish"" citizens projected. No different from ""The Diary of Anne Frank."" Also in this movie, the compassion of the few whom this movie depicted to put themselves in harm's way to help others, was a powerful message.Let's face it - today's people, especially Americans - would not have made it through the years of hiding and deprivation the citizens of all European countries were forced to endure. Every descent from one degradation to the next was heart-wrenching, and we were only following the misery of one family. We could watch, just across the street, helpless people thrown into them, shot-dead and then run-over by trucks?....set on fire?...shot for no reason at all? We could be locked-up in a couple of rooms for months-on-end without going stir-crazy? Not on your life - After all of his misfortune, the pianist gave his greatest performance for the Nazi officer; it was brilliant - not only for the pianist, but for the untold truth (read guilt) and ecstasy on the officer's face. In that scene, Mr. Brody was a pianist; it saved his life - in his concert, post-war, to show him at the piano, then watching a totally different pair of hands blithely doing the work, was simply contrived. The artist may have been a prominent Polish pianist, but I don't think Szpilman would have approved.You want drama - this movie gives it. We end-up where we began, in the radio-station. You should own it to be reminded that being extraordinary does not necessarily mean you will be treated that way - Bravo to all !10/20/06 - Came back to this great movie tonight. I noticed two ""goofs"": when the family is selling the piano, the brother slams the lid to the keyboard shut. Two seconds later when the buyer is looking at it, it's open.

And it serves both purposes well - did I say well? I meant... brilliantly. Whereas Schindler's List's settings were very authentic yet always very organised, The Pianist's settings are more run-down and actually look like they've been through something terrible. The acting is top-notch - Adrien Brody delivers the feelings and emotions of a Polish Jew in WWII separated from everything and everyone he loves in all aspects. And the harrowing heights of this film do reach Schindler's List's heights - perhaps even exceeding that when Polish Jews lay down on their faces and were shot in the head.. The piano tunes were beautiful and Adrien Brody really did make a good on-screen musician - even if his fake playing wasn't exactly brilliant in quality. The ending was emotional and nearly brought a tear to my eye (MAJOR SPOILERS COMING UP!) - I can't imagine how it would have felt if Szpilman had been killed after surviving and going through so much. But that is the true unfairness and unpredictability of war, and though The Pianist isn't quite as famous as Schindler's List, it sure is as good. I would have given this film a well-deserved 10 if the fake piano playing had been done a bit better. But it's so emotionally brilliant and harrowing in parts, I think I'll give it the 10 anyway. Spiffing. 10/10",The Pianist
179,brianberta,Fulfilled all of my expectations,8,7 November 2015,"A very engaging and fantastically shot WW2 film which is one of Polanski's best films in years.This movie retells the events of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous Polish pianist as he attempts to survive during WW2 and narrowly escapes death multiple times.This movie may not be as brutal as ""Schindler's List"" was but it still contains several dark scenes which can be hard to watch. It showed to us that surviving the Holocaust was based on luck and it was easy to get killed. If you were weaker and unable to work, you'd be in danger of getting shot. ""The Pianist"" captures this element very well and that was what I really liked about it.This movie is pretty tense because his fate is uncertain throughout the movie. He often hides in Nazi infested areas and his allies have to try their hardest to hide him. Often when his cover is blown, he only narrowly escapes death. Also, one scene in the film (which I won't give away because of spoilers) is so tense that it is guaranteed to make everyone who is not familiar with the true story tense up unlike anything else.Also, I really love the cinematography. It really captures the sense of barrenness very well. Some of its scenes are so jaw-dropping, it's surprising that any movie could be able to film them. This movie is definitely a visual treat unlike anything else.Adrien Body gave a great performance. In the beginning, he seems somewhat calm. As the movie continues on, however, his performance gets better as the tension gets higher. In my opinion, he gave the best performance in the movie. He stole the whole show. He is the actor we see most in this movie and he carries the movie expertly by himself.In conclusion, this movie is by far a masterpiece. It contains everything I think is necessary is Holocaust films. It captures the brutality of the Holocaust very well, it has incredible cinematography, a consistent level of suspense, and it has a great lead acting performance. It fulfilled and went far beyond all of my expectations and it is a must-see film for these reasons.",The Pianist
180,j-lacerra,The Hollow-caust,6,3 August 2010,"As a lifelong fan of movies and of Roman Polanski, I approached this movie with high expectations. I have seen a number of Holocaust movies, of varying quality: the great Schindler's List, the very good Triumph of the Spirit, and the absolutely despicable Life is Beautiful to name a few. I would have to place The Pianist in the middle somewhere.This beautifully shot and produced film unfortunately has no plot or story. The main character is a bland person in every way, with the exception of his musical abilities. And it is clearly due to these musical abilities that others are constantly helping him in the movie. Certainly not due to his personality or character, of which he has none. Adrien Brody stumbles through this picture like some carrot-beaked scarecrow, evoking no compassion from the audience for his fate, a fate that is considerably more fortunate than millions of other Jews in the period.Polanski created a wonderfully visual and accurate portrait of the time and place, but Brody created a mere shadow of a human being as its central character.",The Pianist
181,saytosandeep,MY REVIEW: Music of Pain!!,8,9 November 2014,"The Pianist. Much like any other movie on time of Hitler and his hatred towards Jews, The Pianist is a painful watch of torture and inhumanity. Unlike Schindler's List which was a movie on the German Saviour, The Pianist is a movie of the Jew victim, a piano player played perfectly by Adrien Brody who survives the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto of World War II. The Pianist's strength is authentic portrayal of the war time, the plight of the Jews in Poland and how our pianist keeps surviving the odds of the highly difficult times. Apart from that, the whole destruction scenes in second half are perfectly haunting and leave you with pain and sorrow. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Pianist. It is no Schindler's List but in its own world, it is the haunting tale of war times.",The Pianist
182,erwan_ticheler,Polanski's personal horror story,8,17 August 2003,"""The Pianist"" tells the story not only of Szpilmann,but also of Polanski himself.A lot of the scenes are directly from his youth in the ghetto of Warsaw.This makes this movie even more impressive.Although the entire movie is very good,I personally was the most impressed by the first hour or so(until Szpilmann's family is put on the train to the concentration camp).this part is truly about the absolute horror of the holocaust and it shows the terrible circumstances in which the Jewish people had to live.Adrien Brody plays brilliant and deserves the Oscar he received,he is almost in every scene the main character!Still,there are a few things that annoyed me in this movie.First of all the fact that the Nazi's speak German but the Polish people speak English(!?),this is really a shame since it takes away a lot of the realism of the movie.Roman Polanski should have said:Up yours! to the producers and big bosses of the studio's and should have let everybody speak in their native language.It is not consistent,or how we would say in Holland:He who says A,must also say B. Another thing is the,what I call,""overkill""-scene.This is the scene in which a couple of Jews are to lie down on the ground while a Nazi shoots them in the back of the face.The last Jew is a friend of Szpilmann and what I feared for happened.The gun of the Nazi is out of bullets when he wants to shoot him,so he has to replace the cartridge.This to me is too Hollywoodish and was not needed in this movie,it is too much sensation and gore! The last bad thing happens at the end.Szpilmann sees the Russians come into the Ghetto in which he hides.He comes out to celebrate,but he's wearing a Nazi coat that he got from a moderate,""human"", Nazi(if there are any).The Russians of course think he is the enemy,so they start shooting,I figured that they would kill him so that Polanski shows that this is the true horror and unnecessary factor that is war.But no,Szpilmann runs through the Ghetto like Arnold Schwarzenegger and he is not hit by one of the many bullets.This is again too much Hollywood,it is not realistic.Although there are a few flaws in the movie that are a shame,(especially the English speaking Polish people)it still remains as one of the best and most impressive Holocaust movies ever made(to me Schindler's List is better,probably because it was made first,so that any other holocaust movie doesn't look like a real add-on).This movie is a definitely not unnecessary and it is very important as a historic piece of art.   9/10",The Pianist
183,mr_popcorn,The Pianist,9,20 October 2008,"""Music was his passion. Survival was his masterpiece.""Filmmaker Roman Polanski, who as a boy growing up in Poland watched while the Nazis devastated his country during World War II, directed this downbeat drama based on the true story of a privileged musician who spent five years struggling against the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is a gifted classical pianist born to a wealthy Jewish family in Poland. The Szpilmans have a large and comfortable flat in Warsaw which Wladyslaw shares with his mother and father (Maureen Lipman and Frank Finlay), his sisters Halina and Regina (Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Rayner), and his brother, Henryk (Ed Stoppard). While Wladyslaw and his family are aware of the looming presence of German forces and Hitler's designs on Poland, they're convinced that the Nazis are a menace which will pass, and that England and France will step forward to aid Poland in the event of a real crisis. Wladyslaw's naïveté is shattered when a German bomb rips through a radio studio while he performs a recital for broadcast. During the early stages of the Nazi occupation, as a respected artist, he still imagines himself above the danger, using his pull to obtain employment papers for his father and landing a supposedly safe job playing piano in a restaurant. But as the German grip tightens upon Poland, Wladyslaw and his family are selected for deportation to a Nazi concentration camp. Refusing to face a certain death, Wladyslaw goes into hiding in a comfortable apartment provided by a friend. However, when his benefactor goes missing, Wladyslaw is left to fend for himself and he spends the next several years dashing from one abandoned home to another, desperate to avoid capture by German occupation troops. The Pianist was based on the memoir of the same name by the real-life Wladyslaw Szpilman; the book was first published in 1946 as Death of a City, but was banned by Polish Communist officials and went out of print until 1998, when a new edition was issued as The Pianist. Review The Pianist is a stunning masterpiece directed by Roman Polanski and starring Adrien Brody in quite possibly the best role he's ever done. He basically carried the film whole throughout and I'm glad to say he carried it real good. Some scenes required no dialogue, only the body movement and the raw emotion of Adrien Brody, it was just a spectacle. I can see why he won the Oscars, he really deserved it. He gave his all in this masterpiece of a film and he reaped the golden fruits of his labor. Roman Polanski on the other hand, excellently handled the camera, he showed exactly what needs to be shown, no BS. The film tackles very sensitive topics and Polanski didn't even flinch, he wants us to see the grimness of those dark days. Example, there's this one scene where this lady asked an SS Officer where they're taking them and the SS Officer without remorse, shot the lady point blank in the head. Just so dark and grim and he wanted us to see it all.A tip of the hat to the cast and crew of The Pianist for making such a masterpiece. This is a fine film that you wouldn't want to miss.",The Pianist

186,ilovedolby,Polanski has poured his heart and soul into this picture!,10,17 March 2003,"Acclaimed director Roman Polanski (`Rosemary's Baby,' `Chinatown') brings us one of the most stirring Holocaust pictures ever seen, `The Pianist,' based on the book by Wladyslaw Szpilman, who is a Jew that survived a Nazi ghetto in Warsaw, Poland. Szpilman is the central character of the film, portrayed by actor Adrian Brody (`Summer Of Sam') who provides such greatness in his performance that it's hard to find a better actor in any film of 2002. Undoubtedly, part of `The Pianist's' magnificence can be attributed to the real life conditions that Polanski faced while growing up. He himself lived in a Nazi ghetto as a child, until he escaped. Both of his parents spent time in concentrations camps, where his mother eventually died. However, Polanski was reacquainted with his father in 1945. 	While watching the film, I couldn't help but feel absolute humility for the real-life characters. Even though most people are aware of the revolting things that Nazis did to Jewish prisoners, it's still quite heart wrenching to watch. For example, from the simple embarrassment that Jews endured in the ghetto of having to dance in the streets for the Nazi soldiers to another scene that depicted Nazis throwing an elderly man out of his wheelchair from an apartment building into the street, only to run over his body later. 	One scene in particular that showed the devastation of the war was one in which Szpilman walks down a deserted city street in the later part of the film. The landscape sent chills down my spine as the street stretched for miles and there was nothing but charred remains of buildings blown out by the onslaught of the war. All that could be heard was artillery fire in the far distance. On this street is where Szpilman spent the last weeks of the Nazi occupation, living in the attic of war-torn house.	`The Pianist' is being nominated for Best Picture, although I don't feel it was the best film of 2002; my pick for Best Picture is `The Hours.' However, this film is absolutely remarkable. Polanski has poured his heart and soul into this picture, and he certainly deserves an Oscar for Best Director. But it's unlikely he will get it due to the fact that he fled the U.S. in the late 70s for Europe after his conviction for statutory rape. Among other Oscar nods that `The Pianist' has going for it are Best Actor (Brody), Best Cinematography (Pawel Edelman), and Best Screenplay (Ronald Harwood, Wladyslaw Szpilman). ****",The Pianist

189,MF210,"Great Film, Ok it is better than Chicago",10,24 May 2003,"I will say it The Pianist should have won Best Picture. But I am not putting down Chicago, I think both movies are great films. The Pianist is a holocaust movie, which is different from the 1993 masterpiece about the Holocaust, noneother than Schindlers List. The Pianist differs from Schindlers List because it spends all of its time in the Warsaw Ghetto, while Schindlers List spent time in the Ghetto and Labor Camps. We get a different point of view what it was like for the Jews. The Jews that stayed behind were forced to do some labor work for Nazis but their were Jews who were hiding in the Ghetto that fought back against them, though they didnt succeed. You dont see any fighting back in Schindlers List at all.
Adrien Brody delivers a great performance as a jewish pianist named Szpillman (not sure about spelling). Not Sure if its an award winning prformance but still a great performance. It maybe but I wanna watch the movie again. One thing I am sure about was that Roman Polanski (Director of the brilliant Chinatown) deserved his Oscar for Best Director, it was brilliant direction by a man who is close to 70 years old. The Pianist is a very well written movie but the screenplay is not award winning, I thought Adaptation should have won.This is my overall paragraph and I have alot of overalls to say. Overall, As much as i loved Chicago, The Pianist should have won for its powerful message and portrayal of what one man went through in the Ghetto during World War II.

191,sandnair87,Roman Polanski Renders 'The Pianist' Like A Melancholy Poetry!,9,24 August 2015,"Truth can be and often is stranger than fiction and so it is with the true story of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who through sheer nerve and luck managed to escape the clutches of the uber-efficient Nazi death machine. Szpilman before the war was a nationally renowned musician. At the start of the film, he's playing Chopin on Polish radio just as World War II begins and bombs drop all around the radio studio, knocking it off the air, and knocking Szpilman's life into a downward spiral. Little by little, Szpilman and his family are subjected to the Nazi process of separating the Jewish population of Warsaw from the rest of the inhabitants. Starting with restaurants and parks being closed to them, they are forced from upper middle-class security into life in the arm-banded ghetto to their final journey on the train where they herded as less compromising compatriots into the rolling pens of death. Just when the audience is on the verge of becoming numbed by the grim life in the ghetto, the pianist, through quirks of fate, is spared the death camps, only to go into hiding in abandoned apartments, trusting sympathetic Poles to protect him in a world where an act of kindness can be a death sentence. Szpilman becomes a voyeur to the horror he witnesses through windows and half-closed doors that lead to a world that has become a death trap. Battles rage, Nazis march, and civilians are mowed down as he watches helplessly. Just when the Nazi brutality against the Jews seems unbearable, a music-loving German soldier treats the pianist kindly while Jewish victims prey on each other.The Pianist is rendered with a melancholy poetry by Roman Polanski. His depiction of life in the Warsaw Ghetto is a series of disturbing images framed with a sense of urgency. However, these images don't need any melodramatic embellishment. And in this way, Polanski ensures he is not cheapening the story by appealing to our pity. What he has this film ask of us is to bear witness that such things happened in a civilized place, to never forget that they can and do happen still. And yet amid the usual roster of sadism, there are notes of unexpected poignancy that tug at your heart strings. The scene where Szpilman climbs over the wall and is walking through a veritable waste land of destroyed buildings is a powerfully quiet, cold image of death.The muted heroism of Szpilman's survival flashes as a fragile and determined pulse in Adrien Brody's magnificently understated performance. As Szpilman, he brilliantly echoes the film's tone of stunned disbelief, as a series of events transforms him from an elegantly dressed, highly cultured musician to a scavenging, debased shell of a human being. His performance is a marvel of wary tenacity and unquenchable humanity.The Pianist is an emotionally devastating film that will linger in the minds of all who experience it; the notion that war is the absence of art in our dealings with one another will remain as timeless as a well-written phrase.",The Pianist
192,senortuffy,One man's struggle to survive.,7,25 July 2003,"This film wasn't nearly as good as I expected.  It tells the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, Poland's most accomplished pianist, who escaped the Nazi occupation of Warsaw.  This is not the assault on your emotions that ""Schindler's List"" was.  Rather, it's pretty much a tale of survival, how one man plumbs the depths of humanity and survives to play his beloved music again.Adrien Brody plays Szpilman, and he does it well.  He has to because one of my complaints is that there's little character development other than Szpilman.  We're introduced to his family in Warsaw and get to know them, but they're carted off to the death camps before the halfway point of the movie.  One of the best lines in the film occurs here.  Szpilman tells his sister as she's about to be loaded into a freight car, ""I know this is an awkward time to say this, but I wish I knew you better.""  She smiles back warmly at him. Very real and very touching.But after Szpilman is pulled out of the line by a friend and spared, it's basically just him for the second half of the movie.  We meet people on his work crew where he's found refuge and the people in the underground who help him hide from the Nazis, but they're only on screen briefly and are never really developed as characters in the film.  The closest we get to seeing into the soul of another person is when a Nazi officer finds him hiding in the attic of a bombed-out building and gives him food and a coat to wear.  But even here, the Nazi captain, played by Thomas Kletschmann, is only in the film for a few minutes and then reappears briefly in the end where he's about to be shipped off to his death in a Russian prison camp.Adrien Brody plays his part well, but he's not an expressive actor, at least not in this role.  He looks dignified and a bit aloof at first, then develops the mournful gaze of someone who's seen too many bad things, but it's all in the eyes.  There isn't a whole lot of dialogue other than what's needed to advance the story.Not a bad film, but not a classic.

194,RickHarvey,Daunting film.,7,5 April 2011,"The pianist is like no other Holocaust film. Polanski doesn't hold back on the horrific accounts that the Jewish Poles were put through. The setting and the cinematography is breath taking. The scenes in which the main character strolls through the empty ruins of homes is nothing less that chilling.the first half of the movie is what you would expect from a film that's telling tales from the holocaust era. Beginning with us watching and listening to the pianist, the Germans soon move in and the expected visual atrocities will be executed with defining accuracy. Some scenes are based solely on true events that Polanski was apart off as a child. Inevitably, The Pianist is going to be compared to Schindler's list and on terms off grittiness and nuance, The pianist wins by a faint margin.One thing that bugged me were the false caricatures of the Nazi's. Yes there were some who were sadists but to label them all with that term is wrong. I say this because every Nazi you see either shoots someone cold blooded or obeys orders showing no sort of remorse. A little winch or a blinker of eye would be enough for me to rule out that this film is not trying to portray all Germans evil. Of course you have the one German towards the end but before that, the film fixated on a biased track.Everything is told through the eyes of the Pianist and while will watch him struggle for survival through the Years, we never gather much personal characteristics of the man. All we know is that he loves the Piano and music is what keeps him going. So might argue that there a barley no story is focus on and there right. We watch him fight for his life and that enough fuel to keep this film rolling.Brody put huge amount of effort and personal sacrifices to make sure he meticulously fulfils this role in a nobly manner. there's fewer lines than the average film but His appearance and his subtle expressions is enough to draw you in and feel for the guy.This films ticks most of the right boxes to be rightly considered as a classic.

Few dared say an unkind word about Philadelphia (AIDS!) when it first came out, regardless of the fact that it was dreadful.

I felt uninvolved. It was also a brave move to omit subtitles from the German dialogue, but getting the gist of what is being said is not the same as understanding and once more I felt left out.Further, many of the events leading to changes in Szpilman's situation remain unclear. On other occasions, Polanski labours his point and I just wanted him to move on to the next episode. He's a very good director, but he won the Oscar amidst a very weak field (and I include Scorsese's work on Gangs Of New York) - remember that this is the same body of people that anointed Ron Howard 'best director' a year previously.Impressive at times, but uneven and occasionally sluggish and frustrating.",The Pianist

197,schroederagustavo,"Powerful Story, Could Have Been Longer",9,1 June 2019,"I thoroughly enjoyed every second of the film, in a sad, depressing kind of way. It's one of the best movies about the holocaust and although different than for example Schindler's List, The Pianist shifts the focus entirely to the lives of the Jews during WW2, instead of a say, the more broader scope that Schindler's List encompasses. Specifically, we follow Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous Jewish pianist played wonderfully by Adrien Brody. I think this movie does two things best: 1. Presenting the common stages of the holocaust victim: Denial, acceptance, survival. And 2. I think this movie did a great job in making the rhythm of the story feel natural, even though the time jumps are sometimes pretty large. Like, for example, there will be a scene of Wlad and his family being notified that they must all move to this area where all of the Jews in Krakow are going to live from now on, and how they must now wear a star of david (that they have to make themselves) to be branded. We are shown the family interactions and the emotions, then we move on to the next situation, perhaps a few weeks, months, or maybe even years later. It worked great in this film.This movie also does a fantastic job at presenting the absurdity of the Holocaust and how the people that were closely involved, were often baffled by what has happening and it's an important reminder to always have, so this never happens again in the modern world.Finally, I guess it's a weird complaint in a two and a half hour movie, but I really do think this movie could have benefited from another 30 minutes or so. Here's my case: One of my favorite books of all time (and arguably one of the most important books ever written) is Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl, who was a Jewish psychiatrist who survived a couple of concentration camps. The book is divided into three main parts: Shock (before the camp), The Camp Experience and then Life After the Camps. For me, the book would not have as much impact if the third part of the story was missing. So, although in The Pianist, the initial shock before the camp and the Holocaust experience were brilliant, sad, shocking, depressing, disgusting all at the same time, throughout the film I found myself contemplating: ""Man, I wonder how Wlad's life will be after these experiences? I wonder how his personality will have been affected by this event."" Unfortunately, we only get a shot of him playing the piano and yes, you can tell by Brody's terrific acting, that we're not looking at the same individual that we saw at the start of the film. It is kind of poetic, I guess, but I really wanted to see more, like his interactions with other people that he met before the war, after the war, his personality and I wish there was more time for that. Personally, felt much shorter than two and a half hours long to me, which I guess is another indicator that maybe it would have benefited from a little extra time.Overall, the Pianist is not my favorite Roman Polanski film (Rosemary's Baby, then Chinatown probably), but it's a really good movie, with some good performances, a good message that doesn't feel like forced or muddled. I really enjoyed it.",The Pianist

199,dtb,Adrien Brody's Minimalist Acting Packs Maximum Emotional Punch,10,9 January 2004,"This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won!

200,au_law2001,"A great blend of emotions, depicting the horrors and nature of the Holocaust",10,21 July 2005,"An excellent film about a musician making his way through the holocaust, and great and convincing acting by Adrien Brody, an excellent blend of emotions depicting the harshness that the Jews went through those times. I must admit Roman Polanski did a very good job showing us the misery and suffering of Poland during the days of Hitler, the holocaust and the horrible inhumane things they did to them, which could shock you and make you sympathize the people in it. Adrien plays a pianist who is very successful in Poland but during the outbreak of the Second World War, however, he becomes subject to the anti-Jewish laws imposed by the Nazis. By the start of the 1940s, he goes from piano concert halls to the Jewish Ghetto of Warsaw and then must suffer the tragedy of his family deported to a death camp, then into a forced German Labor Compound. Overall, a true work of art, and a compelling movie which would make you cry and sympathize the people, seeing how they were killed, and you would enjoy it too, great work of Polanski despite his past, which I will not discuss. Recommended to those who like dramatic movies about WWII and others.",The Pianist
201,sudhakaranakhilan,The Slender music,8,3 May 2020,"Szpilman is not sure about what to do. He only knows about his life is how much precious to him. He is in that slot of hiding for survival. We witnessed a lot of movies deal with the dark side of World War 2 and The Pianist shows that clearly and brutally. Szpilman's journey for survival is the basic element we can see in the film. The cruel side of the German army, their decline, etc were are similar to us through history books and the front runner films. The shot was Szpilman walks through that dilapidated or the collapsed buildings make us cry at some point because Polanski created that situation unto the most. Fantasized about the production design department, the buildings and the destruction seems to be so real and also the photography section also gains huge respect. A brilliant film to watch.",The Pianist
202,poikkeus,Large-scale epic on an intimate scale,8,3 January 2003,"Roman Polanski's THE PIANIST has all the hallmarks of serious, conservative storytelling that wins public support (and Oscars), and it's clearly a labor of love. Based on the true-life story of a Polish Jew who survived in Germany during  WWII, it's alternatingly harrowing and complex,The early scenes will seem familiar to anyone informed about the Holocaust -- perhaps too much so. It's very much a part of Wladislaw Szpilman's story, but countless other dramas and documentaries have covered this material so thoroughly that its impact may be lost on some moviegoers. This certainly happened with me.Szpilman's real story begins after his family has been packed onto a one-way train to Treblinka. Without resources in a half- abandoned city, he must depend on the decency of several good- hearted Germans who put their lives behind their conscience to save his life and many others'. The story is presented in a series of nearly unforgettable scenes -- some intimate, others covering breathtaking landscapes of increasing desolation and destruction. Polanski excels in showing the drama from Szpilman's point-of- view, drawing the audience into a journey that brings him in contact with Jewish collaborators, one or two sympathetic soldiers, a throng of doomed Poles (which includes his own family), and some monstrously cruel men whose summary judgment can mean life or death.Like Schindler's List, THE PIANIST has English dialog (with British accents) for the Jews and German dialog for the army -- a choice which occasionally undercuts the film's spell of realism. Also lost is the musical nature of the Jewish tongue, which would have enriched the film enormously. But perhaps this small critique won't be meaningful to many audiences. This dramatization of Szpilman's memoir becomes increasingly arresting and original as it progresses, and its attention to detail (even including occasional piano-playing mistakes to underline this survivor's human frailty) helps boost THE PIANIST far, far above the standard. it's that rare Holocaust drama that's not about the Holocaust at all.",The Pianist
203,Morejambo54,Horrifically Real,7,20 August 2021,"First off...what an amazing start this movie has. The beginning is so absolutely terrifying and saddening to watch. It is incredibly tense with an awful atmosphere perfectly built for this kind of movie. It also doesn't refrain from showing violence which makes you want to look away from how brutal it is. All this, with the amazing acting and amazing soundtrack, create for a very depressing film. Also the cinematography is excellent. I do find that the middle Chunk of the movie, wasn't all that great...and I find it really hard to say anything negative on a movie about such a touching subject, but as solely a film stand point. The middle section is extremely repetitive and slow which ends up making it quite boring. The climax does turn it around but only very last minute, still a great ending though. I do think movies like this are extremely important, especially for the younger generations (including myself). There is a lot in this movie that can teach people which is brilliant.",The Pianist

I was wrong, but then, I was lucky. It turned out to be a real adaption for Wladyslaw Szpilman's miserable attempt to survive the dense era of the World War 2, and oh boy was it intense ! I felt like I am in Szpilman's shoes ! The movie is long, and detailed, it depicts everything, it makes you feel everything. And man, the ending, I had goosebumps, it was wonderful, I love how they cut the ""Chopin's Ballade No.1"" piece, they removed the happy parts, and kept only the relieving-then-intense parts.

205,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Extraordinary,10,21 January 2014,"The Pianist edges Schindler's List by a very fine whisker as my 'favourite' holocaust themed film. Spielberg's rendition, although excellent, is slightly over-dramatic.The Pianist revolves around the life of a humble man who doesn't stand up and fight, nor sacrifice his life for the cause, but uses his good nature and contacts to survive as best he can throughout the German occupation of Poland. His brother is the complete opposite of this frail character - a reckless, rebellious man who is having none of it and isn't prepared to compromise an inch, bucking against unjust oppression and paying the consequences. In contrast, our protagonist socially fits into every nook and cranny he can find, helped by his easy-going and placid nature, pausing while playing the piano so that customers can conduct menial tasks, resuming again at their leisure, just trying to be as nondescript as possible in order to survive.In the latter part of the film we view life in the ghetto from afar while living outside of its walls, hidden away from German eyes, but witnessing a person gradually getting weaker, lonelier and less confident in finding a solution to life's complicated dilemmas.One of my friends pointed out that his enjoyment of the film was reduced because of the lack of fight shown by our hero. Fair enough, it's not a very macho attitude, but how many Jews actually survived the war? It's our ability to understand and sympathise with Vladek Spiegelman's plight in trying to merely survive that's the key to appreciating this amazing film.Needless to say, the acting throughout is wonderful. Adrien Brody depicts a man in turmoil, on the edge of lunacy and death. A flawless performance and a flawless film by Roman Polanski.",The Pianist
206,jasminn_tan,Incredible Acting,8,12 July 2019,"This was probably Brody's best work. I am not a fan of war movies that were directed by Americans because I find that they tend to glorify themselves or romanticise war, or even both. It makes me sick because there are no winners in war, only survivors, the wounded and the dead. The Pianist was difficult to watch at times because there was no embellishment to the drama or violence that unfolded; it was shown as true to life as possible. You could see how bleak the situation seemed and how desperate the people were to just live another day.",The Pianist

Music – a form of freedom, playing music – of liberation, composing music – special case of the creationist providence.Away from the fact that I saw this movie long time ago I probably will never forget it. A chased piano player in the contrast of the war and the ruined buildings is an image of contradiction which dives in the mind and lay there for a a very long time. The only one ability of man to succeed in expressing and protecting him is something very special. And what if the circumstances are force marjorie? Is it creativity the only one string deep in us that love is pulling to sing its humble messages? Really wonderful movie but not for everyone. It shows human survival which is threatened by man an believing in only one thing when everything around is falling apart. It shows how when we walk in the right direction there is always a new way.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",The Pianist
209,marxsarx,Don't miss this important and enjoyable film! WoW!,10,17 February 2003,"""The Pianist"" is one of only two movies which I have rated as a 10/10 so far.  This movie is not only a work of art, it is an important movie. This movie is far superior to Schindler's list and has deeper insights into the experience of human beings whose freedoms and dignity have been taken away. Whereas ""Schindler's List"" was a cold, impersonal film without a glimmer of humanity or clue as to what morality is, ""The Pianist"" is a film that real and genuine people can relate to and will treasure for the lessons that may be drawn from it.  This is a movie whose time has come!  Without being political or preachy, this film tells the story of a pianist in Poland and what happens to him and his family during the German occupation of Poland. This movie is seamless and you won't want to miss a moment of this masterpiece.  It has something to say about what is wrong in our world today.  When good people do nothing, evil triumphs.  This movie without a doubt should be seen by peace protesters and liberals everywhere who are indifferent to the suffering of people whose lives are tyrannized by a mad man like Hitler.  It's inhuman to ignore what's going on every day in the lives of oppressed peoples the world over.  The movie so subtly and yet powerfully drives home the truth that there is no peace except when good men stand up and fight the evil of dictatorships.  The actors are uniformly superb.  The story is riveting.  The cinematograpghy, the period sets, the directing and the editing are unbelievable!  Don't miss this important and enjoyable film!  I give this film a 10 out of 10!",The Pianist

7 Oscars nominations; 3 Oscars wins (bee actor, director, adapted screenplay).This movie is excellent from start to finish.

I have not read Wtadystaw Szpilman's memoir, but I got the feeling that the movie stuck to the source faithfully. They stuck with the pianist's perspective from start to finish and only once deviated from it, as in, every single scene in the entire movie with the exception of one, is shown directly from Szpilman's perspective. The only exception is the scene where Szpilman's fellow musician sees a ""certain someone"" and later tells him about it. It was still a great scene.Adrien Brody - excellent work from start to finish. Oscar-worthy. The supporting cast did fine too.Conclusion: a must-watch. Well-made from start to finish.

211,Rawal_Afzal,A compelling story of a fortunate man,10,24 October 2015,"I thought this was a brilliant film. A fantastic adaption of the real life events of a pianist who survived. His survival itself is an interesting story. He is no clever or sharp-minded person who escaped situation, he is shown as just a common guy who feared death and suffered from hunger. He is just shown to have been fortunate on occasions. This itself makes it a compelling drama worthy of admiration.This was my first film on the atrocities on Jews by Nazis. Some of the scenes were very depressing, the most one of them being where the Nazi Army throws a physically disabled old man from the balcony together with his wheelchair. This stunned and silenced my younger sister, whom I had to help moving on from that scene to watch the rest of the film.The most heartening and poetic scene for me was the scene where Captain Hosenfeld asks for Szpilman for his own rescue, and even better to see Szpilman being himself willing to help the former.

216,Derek237,Shock appeal?,10,30 March 2003,"The Pianist is not a movie made for entertainment. It's either more or less than that and only the viewer can decide. You have to ask yourself sometimes if the main reason films about the holocaust are so popular is because of shock appeal. If a movie depicts these terrifying events well, does that make it a good movie? The Pianist has many scenes showing the Nazi's brutality that feel almost voyeuristic. Some scenes show Adrien Brody's character looking out the window at these terrible things and you feel as if you're looking out a window, too.I hope shock appeal isn't the reason this film is liked so much, though. Because this is an amazing story about the will to survive. Music is the character's passion,and throughout his struggles he can only fantasize about playing piano. There is one scene near the end in which he finally gets the opportunity. What follows is a touching moment that transitions from rusty skills warming up to an intense and passionate display of artistic talent. In this moment there is no longer a war going on, no longer the agony of hunger or memories of lost loved ones, just beautiful music. His reputation as a musician and his desire to go on to play again is essentially what keeps him alive. And who says art isn't important?Adrien Brody is very good in this. Well obviously he is, he just won the Best Actor Oscar. I think he can be compared to Tom Hanks in Cast Away- even in scenes of silence there's just something about the actor's movements and expressions that keeps you engaged.There's another scene near the end that defines the entire performance, the entire movie for me: After all the trouble Brody went through trying to survive, he is almost killed by the people who would save him. He is wearing a coat that a German officer had given him earlier, and when Russian troops spotted Brody they thought he was German. They shot at him and almost killed him, but they finally found out he was Polish. An officer asks him, ""Why the f-cking coat?"" Brody, with his hands still in the air, a terrified look on his face, almost crying, replies: ""I'm cold."" That did it for me.The Pianist is certainly a shocking and even depressing film, but like most movies that aspire to provoke thoughts and emotions, the audience takes out of it what they bring in to it. Surely Szpiellman wasn't just a lucky bastard who survived in times of inhumane brutality. It was through the kindness and compassion of others who helped him, if only because they found themselves inexplicably moved by his music.My rating: 10/10",The Pianist
217,Mnemosyne15,A sad movie,10,17 March 2020,"The final scene is perhaps the most shocking scene for all the viewers. Valle was discovered by a German officer.

After a few short clips passed, the piano sound gradually eased, the harmony gradually revealed, and a ray of sunlight passed through. The heavy curtains were sprinkled on him sitting in front of the piano, and he was plated with a glorious holiness. The sound of the piano sounds from the depths of people's hearts, gradually warming from slow, sometimes heavy and sometimes gentle, as if it will take him so many years The suffering was pouring out, but there was some kind of forbearance, whether it was unspeakable torment, or resentment to war. In the end, the firm fingertips left a few strong sounds, and came to an abrupt end. Leave a silence.

218,CurtMan@LVCM.com,"Powerful, Heartwrenching Tragic Drama",9,5 September 2004,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""The Pianist"" succeeds frighteningly in examining the horror, tragedy, and despair of the Holocaust, as experienced by a personal witness. A story brilliantly told from the eyes of an aspiring musician torn apart from the events of the Holocaust is extremely effective in depicting what actually happened to ordinary, and in this case, successful people, many of whom went from riches to rags in a matter of months. Sad, honest, brutal, and timelessly compassionate, the story follows Wladyslaw Szpilman, in his quest for survival from the cruel horrors which have plunged him into despair. Brody is brilliant in this performance of a man once at the brink of fame, who is now tarnished into mere survival, who begins to see the horrors of the Nazis between his escapes and who soon becomes the subject of their potential extermination. One can feel the passionate, personal story of Roman Polanski, who apparently experienced much of the horrors in this story, and who puts his heart and soul into translating those experiences into a sad, potent, and important film which takes us into a world of despair as we earnestly hope for Szpilman's survival.

224,Soysoy,Speechless,10,23 May 2003,"This movie left me speechless, but I'll try to write some words down though. ;-)I'm quite a picky person when it comes to cinema, and I -almost- always find something to criticize, except for a very little group of movies (this far, 8 movies out of 600+ that I've seen..) that I found flawless. ""The Pianist"" is among them. You don't say.I knew that Polanski is a great filmmaker, for sure, but I'd never expected him to take the whole thing so seriously, putting SO MUCH dedication into creating such a fine piece of art.Polanski has avoided all of the traps common to movies in its genre (the first one coming to one's mind being ""Schindler's list, though to me those are very different movies), and chose to make no compromise at all. No heroism, no cheap emotionally manipulative scenes, no off ""dramatic"" music, nothing to try to grasp the attention of the immature modern film viewer. He decided to make ART, and more than that, he decided to do that with such a heart, and such dignity, that even without the truly mind-blowing filming savoir-faire he used in ""The Pianist"", the movie would have been excellent. But he obviously wanted more, doing his best to serve the story told. I guess he's been preparing this movie with great care, and for a long time.Polanski has set, with ""The Pianist"", a new standard in cinematic excellence. The use of the camera eye is the best I've seen so far since ""2001"" and ""Barry Lyndon"", and goes even further than these movies in its ability to create a sense of ""being there"". Kubrick left this path for further movies, exploring different (and most of the time very interesting) possibilities. Cronenberg shows the same kind of ability sometimes, but he's focused on a very different aspect of the human's mind (that's the least to say).The focus here is more timeless, it's difficult to put into words, I mean it's not possible to actually EXPLAIN what Polanski has achieved with ""The Pianist"" unless, maybe, someone very talented writes a whole book about it *LOL*. No, this is art, pure art, and relies on the honesty, humanity and total dedication of a *human being*, who just happens to be one of the best filmmakers around. What the film does, that ""2001"" did not, is telling a straight story. It had to, considering the humanist goal. But it also creates this beautiful cinematic poetry, powerfully evocative, that was the signature of ""2001"" and ""Barry Lyndon"", and more recently of Lynch's -more ""arty""- ""Mullholland drive"". I'd say that ""The Pianist"" reconciles humanist storytelling with cinematic audiovisual poetry, in a way that will be very difficult to outmatch.Maybe that the problem of the movie, which I don't consider as a flaw, is that in the context of modern cinema, ""The Pianist"" may seem weak and flat to the fast movies young addicts created by the movie industry. Those will find in ""Schindler's list"" a more familiar tone, where heroism and human values are portrayed in the Hollywood manipulative fashion that Spielberg masters oh so well. It's a pity, as ""The Pianist"" is a far more authentic and honest work than anything Spielberg will ever be able to achieve. Polanski doesn't want to manipulate us in any way in ""The Pianist"" (though he showed in the past that he's very good with cinematic manipulative tools, think about ""Rosemary's baby""!!), he wants - IMO - to offer us an opportunity to make our own journey through the events shown, leaving just the right amount of space needed for some meditation. He doesn't try to teach us a lesson, he wants us to consider what is being told and make our own opinion about it. This absence of manicheism (no good VS evil here) is one of the most beautiful demonstrations of moral integrity in the history of arts.Oh, well, if your favorite movies ever are Aliens, The Matrix or Gladiator, don't even try ""The Pianist"", you'll be bored to death. Wait for some more years, until your taste adjusts, before meeting this masterpiece.My personal award: on par with any masterpiece of the 7th art, including the very best of Kubrick, Kurosawa, Lynch or the Coen brothers (only to mention a few).",The Pianist
225,Marx_Bros_Fan86,A Harrowing Journey,9,17 December 2010,"Roman Polanski's The Pianist demonstrates that there are many ways to film a Holocaust movie as the victims had so many different experiences. Wladyslaw Szpilman is a famous Jewish pianist in Warsaw, Poland, whose performances are frequently broadcast on the radio, but when the Nazis invade, he is reduced to playing in a restaurant. When his family is forced onto a train headed for a concentration camp, someone pulls Szpilman away from the line, and although he attempts to rejoin his family, the same man pulls him away again and says something to the effect: ""I just saved your life, now go."" These words convince Szpilman to save his own skin and he hides in the Warsaw Ghetto for the rest of the war. We never see Szpilman's family again.I appreciated this film for depicting the various reactions to the Holocaust. Jews were not just helpless puppies who waited to be killed, they actively found ways to survive. There are the fighters who rise against the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto, an aspect of the Holocaust that is not portrayed in movies very often. They thought it was better to be killed while fighting rather than be shot randomly in the street.Szpilman represents the survivor. He is not a great action hero, nor does he make any grand attempt to rescue his family or friends. Through his connections, he is able to find shelter, and he relies on the charity of others. His experience is truly harrowing. He faces starvation, illness, and some minor injuries. If he can't find food he steals it. A friend of mine told me he hated this film because he thought Szpilman was selfish for only helping himself, but I don't know what is selfish about saving one's life. Is this not what his family would have wanted for him? Can any of us say we would not have done the same thing in his situation? I don't think any of us are in the place to judge him.The Pianist also depicts the non Jew's reaction to the Holocaust. There are the typical brutal Nazis who shoot Jews in the street, this is nothing new. But there is an active underground movement willing to help Szpilman, and in the end, a sympathetic German soldier gives him food. I liked this part of the film because Nazis are often depicted as one dimensional psychopaths, and at least this film made them a little more human.Polanski was the right man to make this film as he had so much in common with Szpilman. Polanski escaped the Krakow ghetto after his mother was murdered. His own experience tells us something about why this story, based on Wladyslaw Szpilman's autobiography, appeals to him so much. As other critics have noted, I am sure Polanski and Szpilman asked themselves the same question every day: why me? The Pianist is about the various experiences of the Holocaust, and it reminds us that only a few were lucky. Rating: 4/5.",The Pianist
226,vovazhd,A touching film about one man's extraordinary experiences,9,16 August 2009,"The Pianist is a dramatic Holocaust film about Wladyslaw Szpilman's experiences during World War II. A brilliant Jewish pianist played by Adrien Brody, he quickly gains the audience's sympathy after being a victim of the horrific, methodic actions of the Third Reich. It appears that the film never strays far from the truth, which in turn makes the it all the more emotional.There are some very chilling moments, but I think the most powerful parts of the film are where kindness is shown by people who you don't expect it from. Szpilman's life is saved several times by strangers that provide shelter and food, and even by a couple individuals employed by the Nazis. I felt that those things give the film an optimistic tone.Brody's acting is great and he deserved his Oscar. Since the entire film revolves around his performance, this was an important aspect for its success. Other performances are effective as well. The directing by Roman Polansky is solid and shows no considerable error.I would not find The Pianist to be an overly disturbing film at all, despite the fact that several characters close to Szpilman are killed.

229,fred-houpt,"Relentless, harrowing tale of survival",10,27 June 2007,"There is a certain hallmark in a Polanski film and I have used the words ""relentless"" and ""harrowing"" out of respect and observation. Polanski often wields his art in challenging, aggressive and disturbing ways. Some have complained that his predilection to violence and blood are sometimes a bit much. However, though this film has all of that and then some, the sum of the parts is equal to the incredible story of Wladyslaw Szpilman. Having not heard of him before, the first time I saw this film I was shocked on many levels. As a Jew, of course, I had a hard time keeping my eyes on the screen as the details of Nazi brutality were presented like a hard slap on the face. As a pianist myself, I was stunned at how I had missed this mans story and amazed at how good he was as an artist.There will always be comparisons made by critics when a so-called holocaust movie is made. People draw lines, in this case, to Schindler's List and other fine films. It is odd, isn't it, that Schindler's story took place in Crackow and this film in Warsaw and in each case we feel that humanity had reached the nadir point of misery. Of course that is not true: the death camps, where so many ended up, were the bottom of the pit. ""The Pianist"" shows us the story of the great Warsaw Jewish population and how it was rounded up, put to work, then obliterated or shipped to death camps. The Warsaw Ghetto uprising was one of the few occasions during the war when Jews rose up against the Nazi war machine. But let me return to the movie as such.I have no doubts in my mind that the hand of fate came to protect Szpilman. The obvious philosophical question then becomes: why him and not his whole family? It's an impossible question when we ask it but the whole film begs the question. It is an imponderable conundrum but for me the hand of fate was as plain to see as anything. His survival comes in many flavors. He is aided by the hated ""capos"", the Jewish police in the ghetto. He is helped by artists in the Christian community who knew of his own fame and took enormous risks to help him as best they could. He was assisted by the Polish underground. Finally, in the most moving part of the film, he is aided in the most unexpected manner, by a high ranking German officer, who, upon discovering him hiding in a totally bombed out quarter of the city (we never know why the officer was there, seeing that the blocks and blocks of city were reduced to total rubble)....asks him to play the piano for him; incredibly he plays and to break your heart. The officer inexplicably has sympathy for him and provides him with food and in the end his own winter coat. Our emotions by this time are so overwrought with seeing what Szpilman had suffered that to see him saved yet again by a German soldier.....leaves us raw.This film has the look and feel of what it must have been like, Polanski having taken pains to hold little back in terms of the brutality, random murder and deprivation of such huge numbers of people. Adrien Brody, what can you say of this performance? He is one of those rare number of actors who can say everything with their eyes. Giancarlo Gianini always does that. Brody often reduces his thoughts and feelings into wordless cries that pour out of his eyes; if you cannot feel moved to tears when he says nothing then you just don't have the receptors to pick it up. To say that his evocation of Szpilman was sensational is too weak a summary. Would that more actors could reach into their souls to pull together such depth, cinema would be graced with more masterpieces. This film is so powerful I doubt we have the ability to drink it all in in one go. So richly deserving of the 3 Oscars. Brodie's performance is so staggering, he will probably not eclipse it again. A monumental story of survival amidst mountains of death, destruction and heart break. A rare cinema event indeed.",The Pianist

For one thing, no cruelty is left out in the first hour of the film, executed by caricatures of horror, not by people. And why do Nazis always have to speak in the same tone, in every film? Why is the dilemma they themselves were in not shown? Okay, you can give Polanski credit for showing only one perspective here, and that is not really to show compassion and understanding for the German soldiers. Adrian Brody's Wladyslaw Szpilman is an introverted person who lives for art and cannot understand what is happening around him. When his family is deported, he shows little emotion, he is more concerned with survival. All of this could have been shown better, instead of always focusing on firing squads. We quickly understood what the Warsaw Ghetto was all about, so why the confrontation with horror again and again? What Polanski does not offer is a study of the character of Szpilman and Brody's game, which I always appreciate, remains rather vague here. Does he deserve the Oscar? I do not know.

234,charlessmith702210,A movie about a pianist who overcomes extremely difficult odds in the middle of his career,10,17 August 2013,"Basically, this movie features a pianist who survives the Nazi holocaust in Poland and somehow survives that long ordeal to become a great pianist again.It starts off at a radio station in Warsaw, where the vintage concert pianist, Wladislaw Szpilman, was playing the Nocturne in C-sharp minor (opus posthumous) by Chopin, in a professional radio recording session. Suddenly, the first bomb in the Nazi blitzkrieg against Warsaw makes a near miss at the studio in the middle of the piece. Wladislaw decides to hang tough and continue playing until a second bomb shortly afterwards makes a direct hit at the recording studio, knocking out their session for good.Wladislaw survives and runs back to his family and realizes that extremely drastic changes are coming for them. The first part is that Poland lets the Nazis take over Warsaw unchallenged after the first bombs fell. Then, immediate restrictions on Warsaw's Jewish families by the Nazis in Warsaw affect Wladislaw's family as well, forcing them to do things like wear the star of David on their wrists.Then, the ultimate restriction takes place as the Nazis' close off Warsaw, build a new wall and make what is called The Warsaw Ghetto, forcing Wladislaw and his family to move inside the ghetto. Their family tries to survive that but after a Nazi raid on an apartment across the street from their flat that led to every family member being executed, they know that the continued Nazi crackdowns are not over. Then, most of Wladislaw's family is forced into a new flat, and eventually, hoarded off to the Treblinka death camp, but Wladislaw is spared from going to Treblinka with a help of a Jewish ghetto police officer who was his friend. The surviving Wladislaw families then become slave laborers, including Wladislaw himself, but then, a few of Wladislaw's friends make plans to fight back against the Nazis. Wladislaw then finally makes a ruse to get out of the ghetto undetected, which he does. His helpers then let him move to a new flat by one of his friends...outside the ghetto. Suddenly, Wladislaw witnesses the first uprising and he realizes now that the Polish can fight against tyranny. The first uprising fails, but this leads to other stronger anti-Nazi uprisings later on. When Wladislaw had to flee his temporary flat to a flat just near the temporary German police headquarters, everything went well until new Polish uprising skirmishes cause the Nazis to fight back and eventually destroy part of the flat by a Panzer tank, forcing Wladislaw out again and end up in hiding. He does find a abandoned house that he squatters, but then confronts a German officer who would have killed Wladislaw but he said to him that he was a pianist. That officer then allows Wladislaw to stay in the attic as the house turns into a temporary SS logistics post as the Russian Red Army advances towards Poland with distant artillery fire that Wladislaw hears. The firing eventually stops, and the Germans in that post then have to pull out, as well the officer, and he gives to Wladislaw his raincoat and leaves. As Warsaw is liberated on V-E day, Wladislaw makes the mistake of wearing that Nazi coat as he goes out, and almost gets shot dead by a Polish army platoon but he counters that he is Polish, getting his life spared.We then see the Treblinka death camp being liberated, and the German officer who helped him now is detained with hundreds of Wehrmacht soldiers at a temporary area just near the camp. One of the Wladislaw family members who survived the camp then rails at that officer.Finally, the movie ends with him performing the ""Grande Polonaise"" over an orchestra, an example of his resilience.",The Pianist
235,FilmFan777,Very well done however...,7,21 January 2003,"Ya know...what I liked most about that film was the piano playing. Truly some excellent playing. It was a good film, kept me there, taught me something. Yet it didn't grab me by the balls and yank me in. There was one main thing amongst a couple that prevented that. The lead actor. If not for him, I believe that film could have been so much more gripping.    He seemed so...'relaxed' with everything that was going on. Oblivious, non effected as he struts around town, in his manicured suit while enemy forces steal foot after foot of it. Everyone was effected in one way or another yet I felt and saw none from him.     While on the lamb, with each person that stuck their necks out on the line for him, he thanked only 'once' that I remember. The German officer pianist. Other then that, I didn't see despair, true fear, anxiety let alone horror. Where was his humility? Thankness in his eyes or even a gesture due these people risking life and limb for his safety.     The only time I saw some sort of connection to what was going on around him was toward the end when he was dirty, bearded, hungry and walking as if an old man. This is when I saw 'some' union with the character that should have been there progressively growing all along. And the sad thing about that was it was the time he hand the least bit of lines.
    Roman Polanski did a good job with this film other then casting and directing the lead. Showed some detail of things we've seldom touched in other films of its subject. The progression to loss of rights not only as citizens yet human beings. Comes to mind is when the Father, walking in the street, was degraded by a slap to the face then forced to walk only in the gutter by that hate monger of a soldier.     Without showing the people dying in the gas chambers or starved to death, he showed the step by step process from the identifying arm bands, to the segregation into a small section only to be walled in. To the scene of herding them to a waiting point for the train to ultimately show the baggage left behind, leaving our memories to paint the gruesome picture of what became them.     I liked the film, I was glad I experienced it yet, of all characters, the lead kept me on the outside preventing me to fall within.",The Pianist

Universal did a great job of packaging this quality film; I have seen many memorable films about the WW II Jewish Holocaust but this ranks among the absolute top tier. The details about Szpilman's music and the corroboration about his eyewitness memoir written in the 1950's helps build the authenticity of this project.  The use of locations that were totally wrecked also helps the director's and screenwriter's visions to shine through.  I am impressed by this young actor's commitment and his implicit diligence at conveying the talent and intelligence of the Polish musician.  Brody illustrates how ""pretty faces"" are not the only men worth building cinematic casting lists around; I can't imagine Brad Pitt or Ben Affleck in such a role that requires intellect and solitary mundane discipline (his piano technique and artistry).  Kudos to Mr. Brody - - your Academy Award is a worthy one to a hard worker !  For those who with little awareness of the situation of the Polish people during the NAZI regime, this is a great ""intro"" and will display the many-sided nature of people during war time: the good and humane, the bad/sadistic/wickedly selfish, and the victimized people who were vulnerable and too trusting in a compromised ""modern civilization"" like Europe in the 1930's.

The Pianist does not cut any corners in depicting the brutality of the Nazis and the pathetic living conditions of the Jews who were subjected to a very low standard of living. The performances are completely natural and no one goes overboard in portraying a particular role. Adrien Brody gives a subdued performance as a man whose only purpose is to survive against massive odds. His hope of playing the piano for the radio station is the sole motivation that keeps him alive.

238,RachelLone,One man's struggle for survival; one people's tragic history; one story about war and humanity- an all-time masterpiece,10,28 March 2004,"Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) was a renowned Jewish pianist in Poland. As the Second World War broke out, Jews were forced to move to the Jewish ghetto. Later, Szpilman's family were sent to a concentration camp but he managed to escape, and his hiding began. He went through fear of being found, starvation, thirst and any horror you can imagine. He survived. He once again worked for Polish Radio and became a soloist, and regained his human dignity.The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman is intense and poignant, the film itself is outstandingly directed by the brilliant Roman Polanski (Chinatown) and he realised Adrien Brody's amazing potential. Brody's performance is simply stunning, just perfect. Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann) as the surprisingly sympathetic Nazi officer who, not only did not arrest Szpilman, but was so overwhelmed when listening to him play the piano, as though Captain Hosenfeld at long last heard the most wonderful sound, not the sound of bombs and gunfire, and gave Szpilman food and his coat. This other side of one Nazi soldier was just astounding. It's all about humanity.
Being a survivor of the Holocaust, Roman Polanski vividly depicted the era of mass destruction and genocide in the motion picture, the scenes are truly graphic and yet downright realistic, therefore shocking in every way. Adrien Brody also has Polish ancestry and he made Szpilman once again come to life. The movie itself is splendidly made, and words simply cannot describe the impact it has made upon me. Polanski and Brody are absolutely triumphant. This is even better than 'Schindler's List', in some people's opinions. I give this film 10/10. Do not miss it.P.S.

Set again the old ages of the 20th century this film made me recall Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" ringing in my head. It was as heartrending, fearful, expressive and disastrous as the characters of Spielberg's film experienced, though in a different view of course. This film again showed us the misery of innocent people experienced in the hands of vile Germany. But then it left me a room to think in my head that not everything of Germany is as vile as the mainstream thinks. It's the same lesson I picked when watching Schindler's List. And the suffering of the protagonist opened once more parts of life you never thought would happen to anyone. And there are so many things you would never thought of letting go or letting it happen before your eyes and conscience. Such burden and misfortune one has to carry just to survive, Adrien's character lived up to that. We saw it, the struggle and transformation. It was the beauty this film carried, no wonder that for me an Oscar is not ample enough to appreciate the brilliance of human experience excellently told to the mass.Funny it is when my brother's girlfriend recommended me this film and after watching it, I can't get over it. I was even impressed to myself when I shared it to my officemate that she told me how vivid my recollections where. I can't explain it, but probably because of my craving for a beautiful story made me grasp the film in just one go. Just like ""Joyeux Noel"" an opposite of this film, though with same worldly issues and situations, strengthened my attachment to them.There so much to tell about this film and I'm really looking forward for the book the film is based.

246,varundelpiero,"Through the suffering and the anguish, the hope and the music live on...",9,10 November 2008,"THE PIANIST is arguably Roman Polanski's best movie to date, perhaps even better than the excellent CHINATOWN. This account of the suffering of the Jews at the hands of the Nazis in Warsaw is as emotionally hard-hitting as any you will ever see. Polanski doesn't hold any punches or try to sugar-coat the story as the scenes of execution, violence, and torture are overwhelmingly strong, and may upset many weak-stomached viewers. What's more is that Polanski does not even focus on Auschwitz, as he chooses to document the suffering that took place in Warsaw, through our protagonist Wladislaw Szpilman (who is the only character to get significant screen-time).Adrien Brody's performance as Szpilman is powerful and compelling and his transformation from a well-off, cultured, and respected musician to a weak and starving refugee fighting for survival is almost unwatchable; such is its realism. Brody deservedly picked up the Best Actor Oscar in the performance of a lifetime.The screenplay is exceptional, adapted from the book written by the real Wladislaw Szpilman documenting his real-life experiences. The Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar was well-warranted. Viewers will not soon forget THE PIANIST, as some of the scenes are so powerful and moving that they stay with the viewer long after the end credits roll.Polanski effectively hits the nail squarely on its head in this bleak and unflinching Motion Picture, not bothering to infuse his account with melodrama or pretentiousness, or insult the intelligence of the viewers by watering-down some of the more shocking scenes. In fact, the detached style is more similar to a documentary than a conventional Motion Picture.This is simply a solid and sobering drama, the likes of which are rarely seen these days. The ending fits in well, and serves to offer a message of hope, while implying that the events of the past cannot, and must never be forgotten, as these events often shape and influence the present and the future.4 stars (out of 4). 9/10.

Its a powerful story of determination, hope, freedom and pride.He loses his family, has his religion disgraced, but he survives This continuous film is a superb study in how the holocaust developed and how much it devastated the Jewish community of Poland in world war 2.Although people may say that schindlers list is undoubtedly superior, they are very different films. One is a study a jew in the holocaust and the other is a study of a German in the holocaust. Schindlers List is stylistically superior but The Pianist manages to form a vision of how the holocaust developed and increasingly devastated an innocent Jewish family.It also presents other elements of the holocaust such as the extermination of disabled people in which a group of Nazis is shown raiding a Jewish home, a person in a wheelchair is tipped over a balcony, the rest of the family are then murdered. This is one of the most depressing and dark scenes of cinema i have ever seen, the fact that Szpilman's family is watching the whole thing with horror, makes you be able to empathise with the situation they are in and therefore maximises mental devastation to the watcher.Although i didn't cry in the film, it is still a harrowing masterpiece and any faint hearted person would be extremely moved by the film.9/10",The Pianist

Another thing I noticed, and liked, in the film is that some Nazis (specially Captain Hosenfeld) were presented in a positive way that I have not seen in any movie about the WW2 before, it just proves that some of them contained humanity. Also, needless to say but I will say it anyway, the acting game was at a spectacular level.

This film is heart-wrenching, a real weepy about the true story of some polish pianist whose name I cannot spell nor pronounce, who was left all alone in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2. Adrien Brody is sublime as the pianist. A man inspired by music to survive, a man who hid and tried to live even though his family had been taken cruelly by the Nazis. The film is slow and some scene of the Nazi brutality is shocking and sad. One man, a disabled inferiority who tries to protest about what the Germans are doing as they storm his house is shocking, and the pianist sees it all. The poor man is lifted in his wheelchair and is thrown over the balcony of the high rise house he lived in. that is one of the more brutal scenes, and the film is well made as all the brutality is shown from the pianist's point of view, and to know that this guy witnessed all this is very disturbing. Roman Polanski shows flair in his fantastic directing and the overall film is well worth watching. The only problem is that the ending is rather ridiculous, whether it happened or not. The part where he emerges from the derelict house which one friendly German has helped him hide in in a German coat and is then promptly shot at (not hit) by a Russian liberation troop is made farcical when they say ""Why are you wearing that coat?"" and he replies ""I'm cold"" - that is quite ridiculous and this rather silly emphasis on the liberation isn't powerful enough. I think they should have left this out and had the scene fade to the scene where the pianist's German helper is being held in a POW camp thing.

255,canadude,the best film about the Holocaust,10,4 February 2004,"*contains some spoilers* Roman Polanski's The Pianist is an experience in taut restraint, both in acting and direction. It is also Polanski's most personal film and the only one based on a true story. The title refers to Wladyslaw Szpilman (upon whose memoirs the film is based), a young Polish Jew living in Warsaw at the time of the Nazi invasion in 1939. He is a pianist by profession and nature, which the film and book make abundantly clear. Polanski's film, primarily due to its cautious and intelligent restraint, achieves a haunting resonance and brutal realism, but most importantly, through the story of Szpilman, it captures the horrors of the Jewish experience during WWII. Indeed, Polanski tells Szpilman's story true to its source, without moralizing, histrionics, and glorifying certain characters while vilifying others.The Pianist opens with images of Warsaw just months before the war, yet within a minute Szpilman is playing the piano on the Polish Radio, bombs exploding in the distant outside. However, a few seconds later the distant outside becomes the terrifying close inside and debris starts falling on Szpilman's piano. Soon, despite the hopes and self-assurances of his family the war does not stop with British or French support - the Nazis march inside the city and Warsaw Jews find themselves wearing distinguishing armbands with the Star of David on them. Szpilman and his family, with the notable exception of his brother, watch the institution of new rules and regulations unfold with curious hope and acceptance. In that sense, The Pianist resembles many of Polanski's other films. Like in Rosemary's Baby, The Tenant, or Chinatown the main characters suddenly experience a change of reality within which they exist. They plunge into it since they are unable to counter it, or even understand it. Consequently, when Szpilman's family is sent to a concentration camp and he manages to escape, his experiences inside and outside the Warsaw ghetto are marked by a certain stoicism. However, Polanski cannot be faulted for the emotional restraint of his main character, perfectly performed by Adrien Brody. Brody's bare performance sheds light on Szpilman's focus on the most basic survival, revealing to us the true horrors of the Holocaust. Szpilman's lack of sentiment, for which Polanski has been criticized, reflects the dehumanization under Nazi occupation. Human beings are reduced to simple hunter-gatherers, they are concerned with making it through the day without dying. Furthermore, whatever rationality, discussion and outrage exist in the movie, they occur in the beginning before the Nazi horrors actually begin. When violence, random shootings, and executions become part of the reality of Warsaw ghetto residents, no emotion seems strong enough a reaction.  There is a scene in the movie where a German commander stops a group of Jews going to work, Szpilman among them, and asks several at random to lie down. He shots them all in the head except for the last one - his magazine is empty. The scene is reminiscent of a scene in Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, in which a German soldier attempts the same, but his gun locks on him. After several tries he gives up and lets the victim live. Polanski's soldier reloads the gun and shoots the man. The camera observes these terrifying events unflinchingly, detached from them. Yet this detachment is a virtue - it adds to the horrifying, merciless realism of Polanski's film. I admire this detachment precisely because it would have been very easy to introduce notions of vengeance into the movie, to stereotype, or surrender to sentimental and false heroism. Yet that would have undermined the portrayal of the Holocaust experience, where not all Germans were evil, not all Jews were good, and the moral rules by which we live were shattered. The film's most crucial scene occurs when Szpilman encounters a Nazi officer who eventually saves him from death. Devoid of sentimentality, beautifully directed, it is simply a montage of shots of Szpilman playing Chopin on the piano and the officer watching. Yet it also a scene that makes explicit what is so attractive to Polanski about Szpilman's story. The German officer is not an enemy here, an amoral brute, but a human being, who, by circumstance, is in the position to save or kill Szpilman, who, by circumstance, is completely helpless. This element of fate is crucial to The Pianist - Polanski's Holocaust is an irrational, fated event. Polanski underlines that Szpilman survives by mere accident, just like others die by chance. In that accident lies the horror of the Holocaust - in fate's indiscriminate brutality.Some critics have stated that Polanski's film tells a story atypical to the Jewish experience, precisely because Szpilman survives, whereas most Jews were exterminated. Though it may be atypical of him to survive, the randomness with which he does speaks of the arbitrariness (and consequently meaninglessness) of those who perished. The restraint with which Polanski approaches the adaptation of Szpilman's The Pianist pervades the entire film, resulting in a mercilessly terrifying, real and unsentimental picture of the Nazi horrors. The film is unflinching, honest and it does not settle for easy answers - rather, it shows us a true story without judging any of the characters or the situation within which they coexist. It simply unfolds and in its simplicity lies its impact.",The Pianist
256,peapulation,The dramatic power of Polanski meets the dramatic power of the Piano,8,28 January 2009,"There is something about the piano instrument that is deeply dramatic itself. Something rooted within its very nature of high and low keys, and the way they sound when the pianist strikes its keys soft or hard. The sound that it creates reaches down your throat and in your heart. All in all, its delicate and hardcore sound makes it the perfect instrument to describe and represent all sorts of dramatic stories, including Polanski's the Pianist.Many might not find its slow pacing too attractive. Indeed, the bit in between when he find himself living in the outside world in complete secrecy loses much of its suspance on repeated viewing. But the feeling of claustrophobia is the haunting one that Polanski wanted us to feel. This is not Schindler's List, a film about the hope to be helped. This is a film about the hopelessness of being helped, and the surprise and somewhat guilt of the times that help he is received. It is the story of Jewish Polish pianist Szpielman, played by a brilliant Adrian Brody, who captures all the desperation, all the fraility with his dramatic technique as much as with his physical outlook; his casting is perfect. And Polanski's ways of telling such a disturbing dark story is something he can do well, and since Chinatown, we know that he has the guts to end it badly. The whole ending sequence is almost shocking, when we see the Polish soldiers charge at him, we can almost believe that Polanski will end it in such a depressingly ironic way.The cinematography is beautiful, as are a lot of things in this film, which is one that will haunt you the most based on the holocaust. And that is mostly thanks to Polanski because he is a filmmakers with balls. He is dangerously unpredictable, he knows what pain and sorrow is, and knows how to transfer it on screen. And it helps if you have an interpretive piece of piano that symbolises everything, and has such an energy to symbolise it.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When the Polish soldiers charge Brody. What an ironic way to go...",The Pianist
257,Roger_Sterling,3 things that crossed my mind while I watched this movie.,10,13 July 2006,"1. To think this didn't win best picture makes me laugh and scream at the same time. Chicago beat this and The Two Towers? You have got to be kidding me.2. Like Schindler's List, to think this is a true story makes me sick. The fact that Wladyslaw Szpilman survived is nothing short of a miracle. Something - ANYTHING - like the Holocaust must never happen again. 3. In my comment for King Kong, I wrote Adrien Brody CLEARLY wasn't leading man material. After watching this, I realize I couldn't have been more wrong.

258,johnharapa,Harrowing Performance by Adrian Brody,10,23 October 2021,"Some reviews I've read here, have found this movie too detached, lacking urgency. I believe, that impassive quality reflects exactly what Polanski wants to say this extraordinary jewel.By showing Wladyslaw Szpilman as a survivor but not a fighter or a hero--as a man who does all he can to save himself, but would have died without enormous good luck and some kindness from a few non-Jews--Polanski is reflecting, I believe, his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never properly healed.Adrian Brody's performance was utterly mesmerising. I doubt that we'll see him act like that - EVER.Little wonder he was awarded Best Male Actor at the Oscars.Polanski too was awarded Best Director - ironic Brody was the youngest recipient of an Oscar and Polanski was the oldest until Clint Eastwood won it several years later.",The Pianist

262,LaurieMann,Polanski's Best,8,30 March 2003,"It was a fine movie that could have benefited from some tighter editing. Brody was brilliant in the lead role, and Polanski has easily made the most harrowing movie of his career.I haven't read the book, but one thing that fascinated me about the first 1/3rd or so of the movie was that life in the ghetto was almost being told from a child's perspective. Certain things had an emphasis that I wonder if they came from the book or from Polanski's memories of being a child in the middle of the Holocaust. For example:Szpilman keeps running into a somewhat deranged woman who wanders the ghetto in a fur coat, looking for her husband.There's an old man entertaining a group of children.The way the adults dove for food that hit the ground.Many shots of the ghetto seem to be taken from close to the ground looking up, not so much at Szpilman's eye level.There was also good use of sound throughout the movie, but I note that it was not nominated for a Best Sound Oscar.The movie is interesting in that, here and there, there's an attempt to humanize a Nazi, something pretty much unseen in Holocaust movies since the late '70s miniseries The Holocaust (the Michael Moriarty character, while he invents ways to more rapidly exterminate Jews, feels very guilty about it). The music-loving commander near the end of the movie, who sees the end and would rather not go out of his way to kill every Jew he stumbles over.The main flaws in the movie were a tendency to let scenes drag a little (particularly towards the middle) and not really indicating what a celebrity Szpilman was pre-war (if that was the case). According to the movie, he seemed to be the last person to perform on Polish radio before the Germans took over. For nearly half of the movie, he's no where near a piano (for obvious reasons), but, when he is, he seems like he's a talented but fairly pedestrian classical pianist. Is surviving the war what made him great?",The Pianist
263,E Canuck,Making it real,10,24 January 2003,"The Pianist is a masterpiece film--not only because it brilliantly depicts the stark reality of war--a particular war--and the persecution, specifically, of Jews in Warsaw. For me, this film attains the universal by way of the particular. It continually pulled me into its present moment and the challenges confronting the characters, making me question myself--who would I be in these circumstances--the brave one? the broken one? Would I steal food from my neighbours, ask another to her risk her life for me, fight back, give up?  The Pianist reminded me of my essential sadness about the kind of world we've made. It torqued up the tension I, and perhaps most people, possess but effectively evade, much of the time. That tension comes from hoping for something better, wishing that the best of who we are will pull through the worst circumstances--just as we hope for Szpilman to survive. I don't particularly like being made to bleed a little, but I am grateful to Polanski for rendering me a little more real and awake.",The Pianist

Polanski and Brody made everything seem so intimate, crystal clear, simple yet gut-wrenchingly emotional and I have rarely seen a movie so well-paced.It just flows naturally, like a beautiful piece of music.

266,maxmik,One for the Ages,10,22 March 2003,Clearly a masterpiece of world cinema. Polanski has made good movies before most notably Chinatown but nothing he has done previously quite prepares you for this brilliant work. What could be a bleak unwatchable horror show instead becomes a universal story of survival thanks to the central performance of Adrien Brody who is in almost every scene. Everything comes together under Polanski's direction to produce a great motion picture that speaks directly to our present time of good versus evil. Yes there is evil in the world and this story from only a generation ago informs us that evil is still very much in the world. Evil takes its form in our fellow man.,The Pianist
267,Toph-22,"You feel the fear, you feel the despair, you feel everything",8,6 January 2021,"The pianist shows very impressively how people lived respectively suffered at that time. Unimaginable suffering and injustice is done to the people. Life is restricted for no reason. Access to cafes, a visit to the park or sitting on a bench, supposedly self-evident things are forbidden.In retrospect, these restrictions seem almost trivial. The movie shows how the lives of Jewish people gradually become worse and worse. Of course you know where it's going, but that's what gives it even more intensity. Always in the middle, Wladyslaw Szpilman, who tries as far as possible not to attract attention. What other choice do you have if you want to survive. Those who resist or breathe too loudly in the wrong place die. With all his strength and willpower, he lets everything wash over him.Bombing of the immediate neighborhood, up-close shootings and starving people represent everyday life. People are arbitrarily humiliated and harassed. People are grasping at any straw for a bit of hope to get out of this hell alive.The movie does not spare cruelty and shows it consistently. Downplaying would also be the wrong thing to do here. People live in constant fear and you can feel that at all times. The movie primarily follows the lives of the people up close and gives rather little insights into the regime itself. In the ghetto itself, you see how people deal with the events in different ways. Desperation, fear, pure hatred and those who just try not to stand out.Overall, the movie addresses a part of history that must never be forgotten. Of course, you cannot image how bad it really was for the people, but the movie impressively conveys a feeling for it. But through movies of this kind, you always recall these chapters of history in your mind and they make you think about it.Definitely watch it.",The Pianist
268,michaelf,Polanski's Best?,10,5 January 2003,"This is debatable, but The Pianist may be the best work Roman Polanski has ever done -- although this may be one of his most un-Polanski-like films. Unlike Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby and The Ninth Gate, here evil eventually has to give way in the face of good.The film is also timely.  There has been in recent years an upswing in anti-Semitism.  Jewish studients in US and Canadian colleges report verbal and physical abuse by faculty and other students.  European nations ignore the rise of anti-Jewish violence in their own countries.  Arab press and websites praise Hitler, deny the Holocaust and call for a war of genocide against Jews. (How can one both praise Hitler and deny the Holocaust is beyond me, but I have read the articles!)The Pianist is based on Wladyslaw Szpilman's autobiography.  But in watching this film,I do wonder if Polanski took any artistic license and added any autobiographical material of his own.  Szpilman's and Polanski's wartime experiences are similar.  This may well be the most personal film Polanski has ever made.",The Pianist
269,scorfield-51711,Hitting the Right Note,9,30 August 2016,"""Thank God not me. He wants us to survive. Well, that's what we have to believe."" The challenge of bringing Wladyslaw Szpilman's story to the screen could find no better conduit than Roman Polanski, whose own wartime experiences bear such tragic similarity. Aged just nine years old, Polanski was thrown by his doomed mother from a transport bound for Auschwitz concentration camp. He then had to learn how to survive the harsh realities of the Krakow ghetto, by any means available, before being rescued by the courageousness of a Polish family preventing him sharing the fate of others when the ghetto was liquidated. Polanski thus brings all his undoubted directorial talent to provide artistic expression to this barbaric period of human history, much in the same vein as the literary brilliance of another Holocaust survivor, Primo Levi. As such, he can lay bare not just the evils perpetrated, but also the stark reality that when faced with such inhumane treatment, as Levi expressed it: 'man is bound to pursue his own ends by all possible means'. In the Oscar- winning adapted screenplay by successful playwright Ronald Harwood, Szpilman is portrayed in no heroic terms, but rather as an individual with the desperation, guile, and simple fortune to survive. Harwood has stated in no uncertain terms how aspects of the screenplay were made easier to transfer to the big screen by Polanski's own contributions. In interview, Polanski has himself explained: 'I could use my own experiences in the script without making it an autobiography'. Adrian Brody, a master of the understated performance, is able to capture this individual's gradual descent into a simple mechanical pursuit of survival at any cost, and general torpor in the face of the horrors which Szpilman witnessed. Thus, the lead character, who earlier displays a sense of finely- tuned compassion for others, is transformed into the dispassionate observer of the bloody reprisals outside the windows of his refuge. Deserving of his Oscar for best performance in a leading role, and losing a fifth of his body-weight in preparation for the part, Brody became the youngest recipient ever to receive this award at the age of 29. Brody is ably supported by a largely British cast, more familiar for their work within television drama, and thus, relatively unknown to wider cinema audiences. Special mention should be made of the performances by Ed Stoppard as Szpilman's feisty brother, Henryk, and Frank Finlay as his browbeaten father. In addition, Roy Smiles is memorable as the turncoat recruit to the Jewish police, Itzak Heller, who plucks Szpilman from the line waiting to board the transport to Auschwitz, thereby saving him from sharing his family's fate. Polanski expertly explores the psychological and emotional impact upon Szpilman's family as they attempt to come to terms with increasing persecution at the hands of their oppressors. The film contains many haunting scenes depicting the Nazi regime's barbarity, but two which resonate with this reviewer are the cursory execution of a young woman for merely asking 'where are you taking us?', and the desperate wailing of a woman who had suffocated her baby in a futile attempt to avoid detection. Although this film obviously has an emotive impact on the audience, at times it can appear more removed from its subject than other feature films covering the genocide. There is obvious contrast in this treatment to Spielberg's more obvious attempts to tug at his audience's emotional heart- strings. Though Polanski deserves credit for such gritty realism, this film suffers slightly as a cinematic experience due to the fact that Szpilman's cool detachment can distance the character from the audience. However, Szpilman's amazing story allows for the introduction of ill-fated Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, whose compassion and love of music not only saves the eponymous musician from starvation or capture and execution, but also enables a re-emergence of common humanity into this bleak narrative. Sensitively portrayed by regularly cast as Nazi officer, Thomas Kretschmann, the former Nazi devotee, Hosenfeld, appalled at the brutality shown to Poles and Jews during his military service in the East, would risk reprisal to harbour several individuals from Nazi repression, Szpilman among them. So unjust that upon being captured by Red Army forces, he would be imprisoned for seven long years and tortured to death in a Soviet concentration camp in 1952, despite all efforts of Szpikman to track him down and have him released. This unforgettable encounter between Szpilman and his saviour raises this to a movie worthy of receiving the Palm D'Or. Moreover, this work marked Polanski's return to critical recognition, winning his first Academy award for direction at the fourth attempt, and his first award in the States since winning the Golden Globe for 'Chinatown' in 1975.",The Pianist
270,suvopyne49,Brillian portrayal of the brutality of the Nazis,10,25 June 2011,"Roman Polanski's take on the infamous Nazi Torture on the Jews is fascinating and enthralling. It is based on the autobiography of the same name by Wladyslaw Szpilman. The movie is based on the survival journey of a Jew Pianist, Szpilman, during the horrible times of World War-II.Credit has to be given to the director for portraying the brutality of the Nazi Germans with impeccable perfection. If anyone requires any justification of the Basterds' cruel works against Nazis in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglourious Basterds' , then this is the movie which provides it. Basically this movie is shown from the eyes of a common Jew whose life drastically changed due to the Germans' invasion in Poland.Though there are many side-characters, but there is only main character; and that is Szpilman. Adrien Brody does full justification to my expectation from him in this movie. I expected him to be better than Daniel-Day-Lewis in 'Gangs of New-York' and Jack Nicholson in 'About Schmidt' as he have beaten both of them to win the Oscar of best actor.

For most of the screen time alone in front of the camera he delivers a stunning performance which is worth every single inch of the Oscar statuette.Thankfully this film is showing things from different angles than other films do about the same time. This makes it unique and shows how fabulous a director Roman Polanski is. You sink so deeply into Wladislaw's life that you almost forget to breathe while watching. Being German I also have to congratulate Mr Brody on his language skills. His German sounds almost flawless, it was a joy to listen to him!Regardless of who you are, where you live, or what is your country's history, watch this film.

272,baba44713,"terrific movie, if relentlessly gritty and realistic",9,7 April 2005,"I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.Enter ""The Pianist"". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that ""Schindler's List"" was supposed to be.

274,DesbUK,"Good, but not Great.",7,6 February 2006,"'The Pianist' is a very much a European film of the Holocaust: shot on location in Poland by a Polish director, French producers from a screenplay by an English writer, the film uses American (Adrian Brody), German (Thomas Kretchsmann) and English (Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emelia Fox)actors in the principal roles. These polyglot productions productions rarely work, yet 'The Pianist' is a rare exception. However, it never achieve the levels of cinematic tour de force that 'Schindler's List'did. Polanski's direction is restrained and often rather plain.'The Pianist' of the title is Szpilsman (Brody), a middle class Polish Jew who plays concert music on Polish radio before the German invasion. The film is told through Szpilsman's eyes as his family are moved from their home into the Warsaw ghetto, then are deported to certain death at a concentration camp. Through the last minute actions of a friend - one of the Jewish police - Szpilsman is yanked from the row of people being herded onto the train and flees back into the Ghetto.Later, he escapes the ghetto and lives, variously, in empty flats and an abandoned hospital, becoming a bearded, rather bizarre and solitary figure - like the last man alive in a post-holocaust world.The budget restraints are evident in the film. The uprising in the Warswaw ghetto is seen entirely through the window of Szpilsman's flat and is represented by a handful of Germans firing at buildings and what looks like a few CGI shots of the burning ghetto. This is perhaps one of the flaws of Polanski's direction - it has no moment equally to the stunning clearing of the Cracow ghetto scene in 'Schindler's List'.On the other hand, Brody is excellent in a demanding role as the increasingly isolated Szpilsman. Much of his role in the second half of the movie is wordless, and in one scene, he actually conveys an emotional release by miming playing the piano (later, he does it for real in the prescene of a sympathetic German officer - it is the first time in years he has played for real). There's no false 'watch-me' mannerisms of the method school here, and no sentimentality - so Brody's character seems all the more believable.The other strength is Ronald Harwood's screenplay. Harwood underplays the Nazi barbarism - there are a few random executions and Szpilsman Senior is beaten up for walking on a pavement - to good effect. He also conveys the idea that music remains a civilizing influence even when around it looks like the world is ending. It keeps Szpilsman human when everything suggests he should be dehumanized by his experiences.",The Pianist

Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of pre-devastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto, and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were. The acting here is tremendous. Brody (who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this) carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain, anguish, hope, and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me, in many ways this is a perfect movie.

It brings home the horrors of Nazi treatment of Jews - as well as some Jews' treatment of others, like no other World War II film.Adrien Brody and the rest of the cast are superb. Adding to their performances is a sparse score, mostly major works of classical music, that serve profoundly to punctuate the mood at all the right moments. The cinematography is likewise apt.The history is related unsentimentally, through the eyes of the main character, who watched unspeakable horrors and documented it in a memoir from which this movie was made. By its honesty, the film becomes personal, and thus not only evokes, but demands an emotional response.This film will move you to tears, so be prepared for a difficult emotional journey.

It's not groundbreaking.  The production quality isn't better.  The leading man acts with a deer-in-headlights expression.But I was mostly bothered by the anti-hero Szpilman.  He's a selfish person, concerned only with his own survival.  Other people give him a lot of assistance, not because he deserves it, but because he's talented.  Is this good?  I don't know.  It seems good that the people of Poland risked and sacrificed much to protect a gifted musician through the Holocaust.  But I don't find Szpilman likable.  Especially after reading ""1952"" at the close of the movie -- I just wanted to bop him in the nose what a jerk.It also bothers me that Hollywood -- or rather, the Academy -- seems to overreward piano playing characters.

This film was a hard hitting film that really gets to feel the psychological torture and desperation of the main character. While it also depicts a harsh reality of the Jewish life during holocaust. The Pianist is stunningly directed film, with harrowing cinematography, as well as great costume design. The Pianist explores tones of both melancholy and depression, as well desperation, and fear, with only a few glimmers of hope. Adrein Brody gives a stellar performance, while providing his greatest moments when he isnt even speaking. His desperation and fear is prominent in his performance.

It has one of the most perturbing moments in cinema, but also the most enchanting, touching, and emotionally jarring. The last sequence culminates the recovery and reclamation of a gift that the Nazi oppression has withheld. We all have our potentialities.

286,andy-933-696608,The Pianist Review,10,30 January 2011,"It is a film worthy of rivaling the legendary ""Chinatown"". Director Roman Polanski brings viewers a dark and almost painful to watch reminder of one man's struggle for survival in one of the world's darkest times. Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody), a Polish Pianist who's love for the piano could not be further defined than in this remarkable tale of courage, misery, and determined survival. Adrian Brody gives a performance that is believable in every account. He doesn't go all dramatic. It is the very essence of his performance that is significant. Just by watching him, you'll think that he is Szpilman, and mastering the Polish accent, playing Chopin on the piano, as well simply showing a sense of confidence in his character. When I watched the film, I saw the very Pianist himself. The tale of this extraordinary musician begins with the end of his career in Polish radio, and it ends with his eventual return to it, as in over the course of 5 years, Spzilman's life is destroyed bit by bit. It all began with a shred of hope, as his family listened and celebrated Britain and France's declaration of war on Nazi Germany, only for it slowly form into the many forms of despair to come. Growing up in a Polish Jewish family, and in the times of the Holocaust, the Szpilman family faced many of the atrocities Jews were subjected to. It all started with the limited financial rights, up to the required cloth of The Star of David, and up to the moments when they moved into poverty infested Warsaw Ghetto. Desperation, humiliation, starvation, death, persecution, and even debt were the many challenges brought on the Szpilman family, losing more and more at the hands of the inhuman Nazi's. The very sight of Jews being forced to dance for their amusement, or even being beaten by their own kind can be very sickening, knowing that these people faced so many atrocities. One scene in particular shocked me, as the Szpilman's witness a brutal murder of Jewish cripple being tossed out his window, thus his own family following him to death's door at the hands of machine gun fire, and sadistic torture. Despite all this, Wladysaw pushed towards the chance for his family's survival, as his last effort to keep them from leaving the Ghetto becomes meaningless, as operation Reinhard came into play, sending many Jews to the camps were their very extermination was its main purpose. All alone, Szpilman survived, living in the Ghetto, as a laborer, secretly working for those who were willing to fight, while hoping for an eventual chance out. His wish is granted as he makes out the wall, and back into the very world that rejected his kind. His difficulties arise as he moves from one location to the next, hiding out wherever he can, avoiding discovery and capture. I have to say this out of a personal respect for Szpilman, he is a tough SOB. He suffered from Jaundice, Malnutrition, and even pure madness as he had to flee from the very war that was taking place right outside his apartment window. Near the film's conclusion, his long urge to play the piano is fulfilled in the presence of Wilm Hosenfeld, a man known today as one of the few members of the Nazi party to willingly hide out and assist Jews. His last words as he gives a farewell to the grateful pianist ""God wants us to survive"" are both strong and powerful, signifying the good few Nazi's had against the Third Reich's perverted vision of God's work. Szpilman's freedom and desire to find this man lead only to the discovery of his deportation, and thus later informed death in 1952 in imprisonment in a Soviet camp. Our film concludes with Szpilman's return to Polish radio, and a grand finale as he plays the grand Polonaise brillante. It is with the very focus of this 5 minute ending scene that the very beauty of his love for Piano is expressed by the very hands of a dedicated actor, moving his hands at the very rhythm of the music. As the credits have rolled, and we continue to watch Brody master Szpilman's masterpiece of musical art, we come to think this is truly a magnificent movie. The director is excellent, the actor not only portrays him on a professionally dramatic level, but also on a physical level, embodying both the weight loss and as well as the practice required to perfectly portray this damaged character. ""The Pianist"" can honest to God be called one of the greatest film's I've ever seen, as Mr. Brody brings the revelation of this renowned Pianist to life further and further as the film progresses, and as we viewers witness further and further what this man has gone thru. He lost his family, he went into hiding, and he even risked his life on multiple occasions in various situations. When you look at how much Polanski's dives us into the life of this man, we start to see that this film is more of personal tribute because as a matter of fact Polanski himself has lost his loved ones to the Holocaust. ""The Pianist"" is more than just a dedication to Szpilman, but it is also a dedication to all the Jews who became victims to the evil that was Adolf Hitler.",The Pianist
287,BeccaGudd,Very well acted but depressing.,8,28 January 2017,I watched this film for the first time yesterday. I knew it was about World war 2 but I didn't realize specifically which parts. Adrian Brody is amazing in this film playing the part of Wladyslaw Szpilman. It reminded me very much like Schindlers List not only because it covers the same themes and time period but also because it really made me appreciate the time in which I live. The way people got treated during that time was horrific and heartbreaking. This movie in my opinion had some very confronting scenes such as Adrian Brody's character getting brutally whipped by a German soldier and also a man getting thrown off the balcony from his wheelchair. These scenes for me were quite hard to watch. Overall though this film was good to watch. I can't imagine it would be easy to act those parts and put yourself into those situations but it was acted very well and very genuine. If you managed to watch Schindler's List then this film you will be able to relate to.,The Pianist

It's almost impossible and inhuman the way these Nazi's treated the Jewish people, almost as if they we're animals. That dancing scene was degrading. I love the way Polanski tackles this topic. It's almost like when you become used to the chaos like the dead body on the side of the pavement and everyone just kind of weaves around without thinking too much about the fact that it's a dead body since they're so used to it. He does an amazing job at painting it like a living nightmare. One in which everyone has learned to live in. As brutal and bleak as this movie is, Polanski always finds ways to sneak in a laugh or two and I love it. His approach is pretty cynical to the whole thing.

290,judemcrobbie,The Best movie I've Ever Watched,10,14 February 2021,"Never before have I been so emotionally engrossed in a movie. Every part of the movie, from cinematography to acting, is some of the best all time. One of the most difficult watches of all time but that interests you even more as the movie goes on.
The movie does a better job of scaring and haunting you than most horrors, yes they aren't the same sort of scare but emotionally you are terrified. The movie had this impending dread the whole way through Mainly because of the score, and especially the lack there of. The only music throughout is a single piano showing that's all our protagonist has left. On top of that it shows the single minded focus he has left. The eerie streets are a personification of his emotions to the end.
The movie comments on humanity and what it takes to lose it. The Germans are shown as almost comic book villains in there single minded pursuit to kill Germans.
The piano exemplifies the humanity that Wladyslaw Szpilman (yeah I'm not typing that again-The protagonist) has throughout the movie as he only hears the piano in times of fearfulness It being the light through his darkness.
The protagonist undergoes one of the most interesting arcs. At the beginning he is an affluent pianist in the Warsaw, always speaking from what we can see. But by thee no he has no city and he is too scared and afraid.
The grainy quality of video makes you feel a sense of disgust, compounding the effect already presented by the movie. But what the quality lacks in, the camera direction and sets are jaw dropping.
Not my favourite but I might have to say this is the best movie I've seen so far. It's pretty hard to enjoy this movie outside of the quality because it is so dark and so scary.",The Pianist
291,nick suess,An unforgettable story of humanity and survival.,10,2 May 2003,"I sometimes look at what are the essential elements of evaluation of a film, and wonder whether the finer debatable points of cinematographical art can be totally divorced from the overall impact that the movie has on the viewer. ""The Pianist"" had such a massive impact on me that I could not score it at anything less than 10/10, and view with some bemusement the comments of the ""spoilers"", wondering whether they watched the same version as I did. OK, we don't all have to agree to agree, but who are these people who are so absorbed in dissecting the minutiae of the `art' that they don't actually take in what is before their eyes.Now, I confess to some bias. I am the son of a holocaust survivor, who himself narrowly avoided boarding the train to a death camp. He is now 85, and I hope he may live to 100 and beyond, but as the generation who can remember those horrors is rapidly passing from us, we are increasingly aware of the global growth of the holocaust denial industry and its exploitation of both the dwindling number of surviving eye-witnesses and the apparently growing number of people so obsessed with their lives of 21st century consumerism that they simply don't want to know. So I consider we are fully justified in the assertion that anyone bleating out ""not another holocaust movie"" is lending support to that vile camp. It's a story that needs telling and re-telling over and over again. Let it never be forgotten by any future generation.And an eye-witness account is precisely what ""The Pianist"" is. Wladyslaw Szpilman wrote his memoir ""Death of a City"" back in 1946 while it was all fresh in his mind, and the view we had was every bit as fresh and therefore as mind-numbing in its horror as if we were living through it ourselves. That is the director's art. That is the actor's skill. That is why they both received well-deserved Oscars. Szpilman didn't view himself as a hero, and Brody portrayed with great finesse his guilt at not being there across the wall in the uprising. There have been plenty of great movies portraying that event from inside the wall, but Szpilman was outside, and we saw his agonising difficulty in coming to terms with his survival when all around him was cruel and pointless death. His reaction to the incident when a number of his group of workers were randomly called out of line and cold-bloodedly murdered (let's not use the word ""executed"", which conveys some notion of legitimacy to the act) is reminiscent of that of Pierre Bezukhov in ""War and Peace"" when he is spared the firing squad simply because when it came to his turn in line the French officer had just got too bored with summary ""executions"" of ""incendiaries"" amongst the Russian civilians.I haven't read Szpilman's book, but I am assuming the movie remains true to his account of events. So if people sitting in comfortable 21st century cinemas find it lacks action, or fails to cater to their minimal attention span, being slow and long, well that's tough, because that's how it was. Look at this comment ""the length and editing of this movie made me feel as if I'd actually been living for five years during WWII"". Yes, you got it, mate! A long slow occupation during a long slow war. A long time to sit it out and try and survive. A long time to focus on getting through each day with the sole goal of miraculously finding yourself alive at the end of it.One of the detractors even hit upon this to rubbish it ""All Germans speak German and all Jews speak English."" Oh, this guy is so sharp! He's failed to pick the obvious code that when people were supposedly speaking Polish, they delivered their lines in English, for the obvious benefit of an Anglophone audience, and whenever German was being spoken, that was what we heard. So whenever the Poles were coping with a  foreign language, so were we English speakers, but at least we had the benefit of subtitles. OK, so this commentator is a German thinking the movie is terribly unfair to his nation. Well, sorry pal, your folk weren't all entirely nice sweet boys during the first half of last century, so please try and get your mind round that idea and you might ultimately benefit from it!The Warsaw ghetto was possibly the most controlled exercise ever in the extermination of a population, but as the Polish people soon found to their great cost, as Slavs they too were considered ""Untermenschen"" and they were just the next in line after the Jews, with the destruction of their city in the creation of eastern European ""Lebensraum"" for the Aryan master race being all part of the plan. We saw their partisans being cut down too by bullets, and the woman shot in the back who curled up in death into a kneeling position almost of prayer became a strong visual icon in the latter phase of  the film. So it ain't just about Jews. It's about one man's agonising journey of survival against all the odds. Not a man who sets himself out as great or special in any way beyond his outstanding musical talent. Just a human being. That's it.I repeat, 10/10, an unforgettable experience.",The Pianist

296,yoyomagoo,Hugely overrated,6,24 March 2003,"I despise the term overrated (partly because of its often use on IMDB) but this movie is the dictionary definition of the term. How did it win those oscars? Why it is in the top 250? I don't know.Polanski's tribute to the holocaust is a largely pedestrian affair that suffers from a lack of style and tautness. The inclusion of many scenes in the movie is mysterious considering the fact they hold little relevance to either the holocaust or the Brody's character's story. The film therefore feels bloated and self-important. Polanski does not treat the subject matter with any opinion or style- and just shows us what happens before casually strolling onto the next scene. Polanski would argue that this is because the subject matter does not need any style or opinion added to it, which is fair enough. However the problem with this is, that it is extremely dull for the audience. The ""powerful"" elements of the movie are few and far between, bluntening their impact. Also, towards the middle of the film, there seems to be a genuinely scary lack of substance and we get treated to lots of long shots contrasted with close-ups. What this is supposed to tell us, is also a mystery. While the movie must be commended for its treatment of the subject matter and Adrien Brody's excellent performance, it feels more guided rather than directed. Its casual attitude to the violence seems mundane rather than shocking and there is nothing here that Steven Spielberg didn't do better in Schindler's List. Essentially dull, rather than powerful, only the last 45 minutes make this film memorable. 6/10",The Pianist

Roman Polanski marked himself as one of the best directors of all time with this film, by showing the portrayal of this character superbly, also having a big part in Brody's Oscar Winning performance, along with showing the ruthlessness of the Nazis and the destruction of war in this movie perfectly. He made this into probably one of the best war movies of all time and one of his best till date.The Story which is true events which occurred to the real Szpilman, written by his good friend Jerzy Waldorff is excellently written and well done to Ronald Harwood for writing an excellent screenplay and he got rewarded for it by winning an Oscar for it.

299,JohnBoyRoy,How not to handle the Holocaust...,6,16 February 2004,"I have to say that my viewing of the Pianist was hampered somewhat by a visit to the Imperial War Museum in London where I saw images of the holocaust that were so disturbing I had to hold myself back from choking.I was intrigued to see how Polanski (he raped a fourteen year old girl by the way-but thats not why I disagree slightly with the film) handled the horror, and I was confused.Yes, this was about the Jewish repressionm torture, and eventual execution but the film felt like a general refugees story with some 'Look at the evil Nazis' set pieces.  In this respect I thought it was disrespectful to what I had seen actually happen in the stock footage from the war.THe characters were only established as Jewish because the Nazis were killing them - where was evidence of culture and heritage?  This would have made the destruction of this hertiage all the more tragic, but no, we didnt see it, so they could have been anybodies - the tragedy lay in the Nazis illogical motivations to eradicate the Jewish people, did it not?Choosing Brody was a mistake too- yes, his acting is brilliant, but if that wasn' a case of the casting director saying,  ""Look, he has a big nose, he's quite trendy at the moment too isn't he?, he looks Jewish (stereotype!), let's hire him"", then I don't know what is.'Private Ryan' managed to personalise this entire issue in one character and was emotionally sucessful, with Schindler's list presenting the same events from this film much more emotionally.  We did not know the victims - but we weren't supposed to, the alienation made created helplessness in the audience: with 'The Pianist' we're meant to identify with the characters, but unfortunately we couldn't, because they were cardboard cut outs, and so their tradgedy becomes almost farce, and therefore innacurate and unworthy of acclaim.I think it has become fasionable to praise this film, so make up your mind after you've seen it whether you like it or not.  Please.The formal elements are excellent though, with the editing a big achievement, keeping the pace gradual and interest inducing.  The music was good, and the ending quite touching, I also enjoyed the subjective POV shots during the combat sequences - the sense of space created was sublime.Narratively though, contrived and underplayed.

302,bateauivre11,`For those who advocate WAR :WE WON'T LIVE THEM IN PEACE!',10,15 April 2003,"The Warsaw Ghetto: Historical BackgroundWhen World War II broke out on September 1st, 1939, the Polish capital of Warsaw was one of Germany's first targets: the Luftwaffe bombed the city intensively for a fortnight, and then troops laid siege. Despite courageous resistance attempts, electricity outages and water and food shortages forced the residents to capitulate on September 27th. The Germans marched into Warsaw on October 1st. Of Poland's 3.5 million Jews, 360,000 - artisans, traders, workers, and professional people - lived in Warsaw, representing roughly one-third of the capital's total population. Following their occupation of Poland, the Germans used SS Police and Gestapo to set out on a deliberate and brutal course of subjecting the Jewish population to degradation, deprivation, starvation, confiscation of their homes, funds, and property, and random killings, leading to their total annihilation - ""the final solution,"" as it was named by the Nazis. By December 1st, they were ordered to wear white armbands with a blue Star of David. Conscripted into labor squads, the Jews were forbidden to use public transportation and parks, to sit on benches, or to walk on the sidewalks. As all of the Jews in the region were forced in, the Ghetto population swelled to nearly 500,000 by November 15th, 1940, when the designated ""Jewish District"" was walled in with bricks. 100,000 Jews soon died, whether from famine and epidemics or from being shot dead at the whims of the SS Police and Gestapo. But the Ghetto inhabitants strove for a degree of normalcy even under such horrible conditions. Schooling efforts continued. Clandestine political and cultural activities were held. In July 1942, mass deportations began. Nearly 310,000 Jews were evicted from the Ghetto and loaded onto cattle cars, sent to the Treblinka extermination camp. The executions touched off an insurrection in the Warsaw Ghetto on April 19th, 1943. The revolt was led by Mordechai Anielewicz, from his bunker at Mila 18, and backed by the remaining 40,000 Jews - only 200 of whom were armed. SS troops, under the command of the infamous Gruppenfuehrer Jurgen Stroop, used tanks and artillery to put down the revolt. 7,000 Jews died during the fighting, which also claimed many Nazis. The standoff still lasted until May 16th. Anielewicz and his core group committed suicide. A few Jewish fighters, including Marek Edelman, managed to escape. The remaining 30,000-plus survivors were either executed on the spot or sent to the gas chambers. The entire Ghetto was razed. When the Germans were forced to retreat from Warsaw in January 1945, there were only about 20 Jews left alive in the city. One was Wladyslaw Szpilman.
About Wladyslaw Szpilman
Wladyslaw Szpilman (1911-2000) [pronounced ""Vuadysuav Shpilman""; also addressed as Wladek (""Vuadek"") Szpilman] was born in Sosnowiec, in Poland. As a young boy, he studied piano with Josef Smidowicz and Alexander Michalowski, themselves students of Franz Liszt. In 1931, he left for Berlin and continued his studies at the Academy of Music, under the direction of Leonid Kreutzer; and the Academy of Arts, under Arthur Schnabel and Franz Schreker. During these years, he composed a 'Concerto for Violin'; his Suite for piano 'Zycle maszyn' (""Life of Machines""); numerous pieces for piano and orchestra; film scores; and popular songs that brought him celebrity in his homeland. At the age of 27, Szpilman had established himself as one of Poland's foremost composers and concert pianists when Poland was attacked. In 1935, Szpilman was hired at the Polish state radio station of Warsaw. He was performing live on the airwaves, playing Chopin's 'Nocturne in C# [C sharp] Minor,' when the Luftwaffe dive-bombed the station on September 23rd, 1939. As Jews, Szpilman and his family (parents, brother Henryk, and sisters Halina and Regina) were soon evicted from their apartment and herded, with several hundred thousand others, into the Warsaw Ghetto. There, Szpilman scraped by, playing piano in the bars where black marketeers and collaborators gathered. On August 16th, 1942, it was one such Jewish collaborator, Itzak Heller, who stopped Szpilman from boarding the train that took his entire family to their death in the camps. Szpilman remained behind in Warsaw. Aided by an ad hoc network of pre-war acquaintances (such as his friend Dorota) resistance fighters (like Janina), and - most surprisingly - a German officer (Captain Wilm Hosenfeld), Szpilman survived the war. Warsaw was liberated in January 1945. Szpilman immediately wrote his memoirs, Death of a City, recounting his incredible but true experiences amidst torment. In a detached tone, his authentic account told of life in the Ghetto and of the victims and torturers in that singular world. The book was published in Poland in 1946 - but was then banned and suppressed by the Communist authorities. Polish radio started up again, fittingly, with Szpilman performing the Chopin piece that had been so violently interrupted six years earlier. He was named musical director of the state radio station. He also resumed his career as a pianist, playing in concerts and solo performances in Europe and America. He performed all over the world in piano duet with Bronislav Gimpel (with whom he also founded the Warsaw Piano Quintet). Szpilman also began composing music again. Many of his 300-plus songs became popular standards in Polish culture. The songs he wrote for children in the '50s earned him a 1955 prize from the Polish Composers Union. He later applied his composing talents to create ballets and classical pieces for younger audiences. In 1961, he founded the International Festival of Song at Sopot for the Union of Popular Song Writers in Poland. In 1964, he was elected member of the Academy of Polish Composers. He retired from concert performances in 1986, but continued composing. He resided in Warsaw for his entire life. In 1999, Szpilman's son Andrzej, whose father had never spoken about the war years (not uncommon among that generation of fathers and sons), arranged for the book to be published in Germany. The new edition incorporated wartime extracts from the diary of Captain Hosenfeld, who died in a Russian POW camp in 1952. The response to the book led to a worldwide translation and publication as The Pianist: The Extraordinary True Story of One Man's Survival in Warsaw, 1939-1945, generating international attention and acclaim. Roman Polanski, who had already met Szpilman twice years before, committed to make a film version of The Pianist. At their third meeting, in early 2000, Szpilman expressed his pleasure that the book was to be brought to the screen by a compatriot. Wladyslaw Szpilman passed away on July 6th, 2000, at the age of 88, a few months before filming of THE PIANIST began. He is survived by his wife Halina and sons Krzysztof and Andrzej.Source: the pianist production notes.",The Pianist
303,bateauivre11,Don't beg for the right to live-take it!,10,19 November 2003,"BEFORE I start.I want to say something to this film detractors:give me something more coherent than 'this film is dull?'.And to all the Polanski detractors:GET IT OVER,MAN!. If you don't appreciate THE PIANIST then you are:1-Not a cinephile 2-You got no soul!._An Appreciation_`Our hope can come only from the hopeless'.
THE PIANIST just moved me the way no other film did.This realistic film has not a wasted scene(all the scenes are just perfection!).But you can't say ` I liked the Pianist','like' is a superficial word.With THE PIANIST you fell more impressed,with a feeling of AWE and after I saw it I feel totally exhausted!.The protagonist, Adrein Brody,well,he  is so convincing as  WLADEK SZPILMAN that he is not 'acting' really.When you saw actors like ROBERT DE NIRO or AL PACINO,you already know all of their `tricks'.How they would react,because they are imbued with the' acting methods'.Brody as SZPILMAN is so out of manners,that it looks so frank,he is just a SOUL.In the first scene ,the film presented us to this artist: he continues to play Chopin in a radio studio while German shells explode outside.This scene is a powerful statement to his personality.It's interesting to see him changing  from a well-dressed ,educated  man to a phantom like figure starving to death.I would give him another Oscar!.The behind the camera' talent of Polanski is unquestionable.Every scene are so breath taking and so real that this film is HUMAN HERITAGE,can't be treated just like  another film about  Holocaust  BUT AS A PROVE OF THE HISTORY.Polanski fans will appreciate even more The Pianist because of `the small details' that  maybe the average film goer would overlook it :that poor woman asking to the people in the streets if they have seen her husband;or this young mother regretful: 'why I did it'.,or another woman with a dying child in her arms begging for a drop of water.THAT DETAIL where SZPILMAN is at the tram,there is a special seat section in the tram for `Germans only',just notice where and how he lays down  his hand before this scene fades out.In the first part of the film we witness how Szpilman's family and an entire group of `individuals' are subjected to humiliations,degradations and random shots by the Nazies(the death is unexpected and doesn't make any sense,without any purpose,the German soldier puts out the gun,stuck in the woman's face and kills her_a woman shot in the street falling into a crouching position).For example the scene when Szpilman's father was insulted by The German officers while walking the pavement in the reality this happened to Polanski's father.And how this people are left to starvation(desperation) only to lose their own dignity.Polanski camera never hesitates.The violent is show without tricks in a cold way and how it really was.Also the film is very effective by showing the  most atrocious violence against the most vulnerable people:The elderly people;cripples;pregnant women and CHILDREN: an image with a tiny boy smuggler whom Szpilman tries to rescue(Polanski,as a boy himself, was a smuggler during this period). A nightmarish state where we see corpses of children laid in the streets. It is not an coincidence that Polanski next project would be OLIVER TWIST. Szpilman,as Oliver,is left orphan and completely alone:deserted by a God,a country and the rest.Our Pianist as Oliver Twist survived thanks to the generosity of strangers. `Survival as an abstraction' or  instinctive ?(in one scene Szpilman pretends to be a corpse!).In  one scene,after Wladek's family disappeared,he walks confused to the streets and enters at a building.There is someone  that hisses to him:is a man hidden inside a wardrobe and `invites' Szpilman to  enter the  hidden place or to `the coffin like shelter'(Polanski loves wardrobes,cupboards_it appeared in his famous films.If Luis Buñuel  used shoes as fetish,Polanski uses this furniture as shields).There are many scenes that reflects the absurdity of  a War State(its main focus is irrationality;cruelty ; annihilation and starvation) total `dispossession'.One of the woman of helped Szpilman,Dorota(EMILIA FOX)said in two scenes  'It's too absurd'(concerning the anti Jew restrictions). Wladyslaw Szpilman,the Pianist, abandoned his Chopin melodies only to hide himself in places where he can't get out,or  by doing  jobs as a mason.Thanks to one friend ,Wlad ek stays locked in an apartment.One of the man who visits him gives Szpilman an advice:'if the Nazies arrive,it's better that they don't catch you alive.In one nerve-racking scene,Szpilman sees below from the window that the German soldiers are entering the building,we hear 'steps noises `and just in case Szpilman opens the window,ready to jump.(luckily they are not there for him!).In The Pianist the historical facts are presented not in a explanatory way,I guess Polanski don't want o underestimate his audience,you should know about the insurrection in the Warsaw Ghetto on April 19th, 1943 and one year later the Warsaw Uprising.In the apartment Szpilman observes from the window `helplessness,this two important events(in a previous scene we see the Warsaw people receiving help from the allies,the supplies of food were dropped from British airplanes.It's shown only for a few seconds,as Szpilman looks at the sky and observes how the packages fell down ,it's a great sequence).Szpilman later hides in another apartment located in the other side of the Ghetto wall,there Wladek gets ill we witness another absurdity of war: in front of his apartment,there is a  'German' hospital but he can't go there for obvious reasons.(once again the lovely Dorota got a Doctor for him).Wladek survives his illness,but as many Polanski films_ if the situation is bad it will become even worst!.A tank in the streets is aiming to Szpilman's building-we hear the sound of the impact,Wladek runs away to the door but it was locked!, later we hear another impact,the soundtrack in that moment is of a damaged hearing after a big noise,this reminds me of that sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN where Tom Hanks went  sudden deaf.In many scenes of the Pianist  Polanski show us `hunger and starvation' and how terrible it must be.One even prefers to die by a gun shot rather than die(slowly) of hungry.That increasing suffering of Szpilman,especially when he struggles to open a tin can of pickles,his loneliness,FEAR and an empty stomach.that make us wonder why Szpilman didn't lost his mind,his humanity?.His attitude surprised me. After the people helped him,he didn't forget the say `thank you'.Szpilman gave a new meaning of the word `THANK YOU'.One of the most memorable moments I ever witnessed in a film in when Szpilman encounters the handsome Captain Wilm Hosenfeld(as one user comment accurately wrote': The can falls off the mantle of the fireplace, then rolls to the seemingly ominous feet of a lone German officer.') Here, however, Polanski -had to intervene: the encounter in the film is dramatic and moving, indeed. There is a classic shot of Hosenfeld,with the camera moving slowly upwards from his leather boots, showing the whole awesome beauty of the Nazi uniform-one of the favorite aesthetic devices of filmmakers.(the contrast between this two men is impressive)In this abandoned house(his last shelter)Hosenfeld asks Szpilman who he is, what he's doing in the abandoned house, and what he used to be.Szpilman stutters `a pianist'.We perceive a piano there ,so,the Captain ask him to play.In this moment' the musician takes place' .We hear for minutes how he plays Chopin.The sun ray from a window lay down to his dishevelled hair,the same light gives a singular effect to his nose.It looks like as it becomes transparent.It give us the sensation that he is half ghost -half flesh and bone.We also perceive  that Szpilman don't want to stop playing.He is afraid because he doesn't know yet `the intentions of the German Captain.I presume that the pianist thought.'I will die after I stop playing'.(after he finishes the piece,just look at his hands).But Wilm Hosenfeld is one of his last saviors(giving him food,an `opener' and a coat).Szpilman once again said the word THANK YOU.Myself ,I have to thank to Brody,Polanski, the real Szpilman(with his wonderful memoir) and the entire cast. Thank you very much for this Masterpiece.Also I have to say that the sound of this film is outstanding ,from the first scene: the explosion in the radio station_ to the sequence where the German soldiers are marching in the streets of Warsaw(the sound of their leather boots has a powerful effect,to the contrary in Pink Floyd `The wall' the image of this marching hammer is the powerful one ).Also `the absence of MUSIC haunts THE PIANIST,his solitary moments.The camera catches Szpilman fingering some unheard Nocturne,playing a phantom piano in a chamber of his memory'.And finally One shot I'll never forget: the ragged Szpilman walks toward us from the middle distance, down a wide, absolutely devastated,empty street in a City we know as Martyr.10/10",The Pianist
304,panchodh_12,Never again,8,20 July 2015,"Soundtrack for this review: El pianista del gueto de Varsovia by Jorge DrexlerIt is hard to review this movie. It is not easy to evaluate this movie in terms of its acting, its quality, its directing, with an armchair attitude that ignores the crudeness and harshness of real life. It is hard to say phrases like ""Roman Polanski, perhaps due to its own experience, captures perfectly the feeling of everyday life of Polish Jews during the Second World War, its sadness and despair but also the tiny moments of hope"", however true that might be.It is very hard to rate this just as a movie, and not as a reminder for the human race of what are we capable of. I'm often reluctant to watch Holocaust movies because I know beforehand that they will have very hard to digest moments, and they are almost an act of masochism, two hours of intense suffering. But they are necessary, they are real stories that urge to be told, and need to be heard so that they don't happen again.In a world where islamophobic parties are winning votes in Europe, where Americans proudly wave a flag that is the symbol of slavery in front of their president, these movies are indispensable. We cannot allow ourselves to fall into the collective madness that Germany fell into between 1933 and 1945. We should have learnt by now that technology has allowed the State to mobilize way too many resources, and the extermination of an entire group of people is only a button away. Not to mention the fact that these things still happen in more remote corners of the world, where they don't destabilize global geopolitics. So it would be too frivolous from my side to evaluate Polanski's direction or Brody's acting, as if this was fiction. The feeling I have after having watched The Pianist is not the one of a film critic that passively observes reality from behind his desk, but an active one, the imperative of making sure that nothing like this ever happens again.",The Pianist
305,LydiaOLydia,"A decent, but unspectacular Holocaust movie",4,25 August 2006,"The Pianist is a by the numbers movie about the life and times of a pianist trying to live through the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. A beautiful musical score predictably results. The pianist himself is an altogether unsympathetic character - we want him to live because we don't want to be cruel, but otherwise we wouldn't have any particular attraction to this man. The movie itself is strictly, for the most part, paint by numbers. Nazis are bad, Jews are innocent yet determined survivors. Well, more to the point, Nazis are bad, though deep down inside they appreciate fine culture and some of them have good hearts. The Soviets, on the other hand, are uniformly bad and stupid, it seems.The lessons of the Holocaust must never be forgotten. However, the pivotal lessons of the Holocaust are not ""Nazis are bad Jews are innocent yet determined survivors."" Those sort of lessons are historical details along the lines of ""The Magna Carta was signed in 1066."" The real lessons of the Holocaust center around what happens when we stop looking at each other as human beings and start looking at each other as cartoons or stereotypes. This is a by the numbers movie specifically because it does what most movies do - it starts with existing cartoon/stereotype views and builds characters around them to tell a story. A better movie would have begun in that place, but then used the power and magic of film to challenge our preconceptions and our stereotypes to truly convey and reinforce a message of hope for humanity.Your life will not be any poorer if you never see this movie, but you won't feel that you wasted your time, either, if you do. Certainly doesn't belong in the IMDb Top 250.",The Pianist
306,erikgloor,I prefer GOOD films about the holocaust,3,29 January 2003,"It's not that this is yet another film about the holocaust. Hard though they may be to watch, when you have one of the most horrific real-life nightmares perpetrated on a completely innocent community as you had in the Warsaw Ghetto situation, films will be made and should be made about it. This happened just 60 years ago, but it's right out of some dark ages tale of Vlad the Impaler or something -- innocents rounded up and slaughtered wholesale for no reason whatsoever -- just because they could be. Just to satisfy some twisted despot's profane sense of reality. If anything, more films should be made about the holocaust.Unfortunately, when films are made about this most sad episode of the 20th century, the tendency to celebrate each film equally understandably arises. No one wants to accidentally align themselves with the few warped minds who suggest it never happened or that it should have happened by saying anything bad about a film about the holocaust. But, in the hope of encouraging good films about the horror the Nazis inflicted, I will now attempt to do just that.What I loathed about this film was that the Nazis were the most interesting part of it. Our hero is a nice man who plays the piano very well. There are some other nice people who help him. His family is nice. But even the most interesting act of benevolence in the picture is performed by a Nazi officer.What was Polanski thinking? Story! Story! Story!Beware, the following paragraph is a total *** SPOILER ***Honest to God, here is the plot that unravels over two and a half mind-numbing hours: A Jewish piano player narrowly escapes when the Nazis take over Poland and evacuate all the Jews to death camps. He waits around doing very little in particular until the Russians come and ""liberate"" Poland. That's it. That's the entire plot. True though it may be, truth is not always stranger than fiction. Sometimes, it's downright boring. The truth, for example, is that I got out of bed this morning and came to work. True, yes. But dull, definitely.This film is a total snoozerama! I kept waiting for our piano player to join the resistance and take out a few Nazis; or have an interesting relationship with one of his benefactors; or carve a piano into a hang-glider and fly to Allied territory. Something. Anything! Instead we are treated to long, long scenes of our hero fiddling about in empty apartments or sifting through rubble for a bite to eat or having rather ordinary conversations with his family or those who help him.I mean, on some level, I get it -- he's the penultimate victim and survivor and artist; somehow immune to the violence because of the sublime expression in his fingers. But THAT is a half-hour short subject film AND NOT a two-and-a-half hour feature film. It just isn't. It's just damned rude to suggest otherwise.Damned rude.This movie review by Erik Gloor",The Pianist
307,ftm68_99,"Move along, no story here",1,27 February 2003,"If you think that movies that deal with Nazi atrocities are inherently worthwhile, then you might think that this movie is inherently worthwhile. If, on the other hand, you expect a movie, whether it deals with Nazi atrocities or not, to actually tell a story, then I'd say there's a good chance you *won't* find this movie worthwhile.  What does this movie give us? Well, it gives us a string of Nazi atrocities, very realistically depicted, and it gives us what I suppose is supposed to be a main character, but it gives us precious little else!  Most of main character's screen time is given over to him being acted upon by circumstances and by other people, but very little of him being pro-active, himself.  And even his passivity might be interesting if we knew what he was thinking or feeling.  But we are never given that information.  We never know what it is that he really wants.  Or how he feels, say, about the fact that his family was shipped off to their probable death, but he was saved by a fluke.  The picture is certainly well-made from the stand point of art direction and cinematography, but story-wise, it's a shambles.  As far as I'm concerned, Roman Polanski owes me big-time.

309,thesundance14,Powerful story told with total honesty and great courage by a master film maker. David Lean would have been proud of this work.,9,24 January 2003,"""The Pianist"", Roman Polanski's new movie is a tour d'force and should be seen by anyone who wants to even consider war of any kind.The horror of this ...this terrible event in Warsaw , Poland from 1939 to 1945 is beyond imagination. Adrien Brody plays the title role as Wladyslaw Szpilman, and  I can't imagine any actor doing a more moving and profound job of portraying this incredible man. This is a griping epic about a terrible time and an even more terrible chain of events that are too horrible to imagine and for the same reason must never be forgotten.Director Polanski catapults into a new class with this work. It is cruel and terrible to look at in many parts but often the truth is just that way. Dare I mention his name with David Lean?  I think so.I have to point to Thomas Kretschmann who plays Captain Wilm Hosenfeld with just the correct amount of Prussian correctness that must have come from his years of living in East Germany. But the world owes the real Wilm Hosenfeld too and it is not lost in the moment nor in the end. The Pianist is the first ""9"" I have given in years for a movie rating.Perhaps as we are drawn to look clearly at the horror of what happened in Poland under Nazi occupation, maybe we can see fit to try to stop war wherever it may try to arise. It may not be within the formate of this forum but this film makes anyone who is sane see. Now we have bigger guns and bigger bombs but the one common denominator is PEOPLE DIE just on a larger scale!!!! So I urge all to pray for peace and insist that this country who we all love and have served, will not set the precedent of a ""first strike"" against anyone. Whomever they might be!!!If we start another Vietnam type thing and it runs the same sort of term as that terrible time, boys currently in the third grade at elementary schools all around our country could die there someday!!!!However, if you or anyone you know has forgotten how terrible war and especially uncontrolled tyrants who want to wage war can be and what they can cause, go see this movie.It is terrifying and Mesmerizing at the same time.It should run away with the Academy Award but because it has not been widely seen I fear it will not.  That in itself is almost a crime.",The Pianist
310,SanTropez_Couch,Harsh Elegance,10,13 February 2003,"The only big dramatic moment comes when Brody plays the piano at someone's request, but there is no auditorium that gives him a standing ovation, there is no applause. There is an audience of one and when Brody finishes the dazzling piece (considering his state, to be sure) he's done. As a matter of fact, the care in which this scene is orchestrated is meticulous (is he just pausing...or can he remember it at all?).The barking gunfire is jolting and crackling bombs send dust and debris flowing through the air. There are no big death scenes; when someone is killed (many of them are already face-down or on the ground), they slump over, the life in their body disappears and they go limp. There is one extraordinary death scene and what occurred to me was the way the camera follows it half-way. It's tense -- we don't want to see, and we never do -- but rather than satisfy us, we can only hear what happens, and it's much more affecting because of it. The film is violent but it isn't gory; it's emotionally powerful but not sentimental; it's elegant and tasteful but not without an edge -- the blackest of black humor that runs throughout the film is subtle and obvious and it's sure not comic relief (and it's not a cackling humor laughing at the hopelessness of a situation like in some of Polanski's other films, either).Rather than add sentimentality and make us feel good about feeling bad, the film fills us up to the brink with the pianist's observations. The criticism this film has unfairly received from a few people that it's ""detached"" is bogus. We are observing the observer (and he's not one of those observers who talks to himself or thinks aloud so as to not leave us in doubt as to what's going on in his head). There is also no overview; we are aware of only what Brody is aware of. We aren't treated to a ""this is how it happened"" approach, either, rather we are shown specific incidents that amount to a whole (a man told to walk in the gutter, for instance). The film has been criticized by some for its portrayal of German soldiers as killing machines without depth. Of course there's the most important scene in the film which proves this completely false, so there's no point in even bothering to argue it.Brody doesn't continue surviving by his wits alone -- which isn't to say he doesn't try his damndest -- he's helped by many others and what Polanski realizes (after his own experiences, how could he not?) is that this man need not live, but he does against the odds, drifting -- painfully -- into survival. His story isn't a ""triumph of the human spirit,"" it's an uncharacteristic end that few met and it isn't treated as a victory so much as a final reprieve.The scene in which Brody realizes the horror he's engulfed in, for me, was when he tries to help a young boy struggling to climb out from beneath the wall separating the Polish Jews' designated area. The look on his face afterwards will stay with me, I'm sure, for a good long while.This film's stature rests as art defending -- and demanding -- art. It's a complete film that could work as a textbook for lifeless hell. Polanski isn't just acting as a mere craftsman, he's using his craft to settle something within himself, all the while never venturing into overtly personal territory. On my way home from the film I was thinking about which was my favorite of the year, which one was the best. I thought of more flashy movies with a style that overwhelms you, risky movies not afraid to go all-out, but then I realized what makes this film so astonishing isn't what it shows you or what it doesn't show you, but the way in which we are shown. Everything is so much more powerful because the awful truths of Nazi horror are shown opposite the stillness of inner turmoil. Then I asked myself which movie had a the deepest effect on me. Not in terms of a gut reaction or an immediate feeling, but which one is the most likely to leave an impression on my soul. It was this one.****",The Pianist

At the beginning, and from the title, I think this movie will give me such a nice experience of music composed in every scene. You know, I expect there are so much soundtrack from classic masterpiece and everything will be connected with music. The very first shot is some scene with piano-beat-rhythm. Suddenly, a great shot from tank try to break the whole building and hurt the main character of the movie. Just, what a great opening for such a reality-based-movie.The overcoming story just a very real experience from Wladyslaw Szpilman himself, and some from Roman Polanski, the director. Every detail of each screen is from an actual event, and the movie is not exaggerating the fact. Like action movie that will expose one or two climax scenes, but this movie consistent with the fact. Some people may think this movie little bit boring, but actually that is the beauty of a realist movie, a realist movie. It is not a beauty of comedy or action, just the history way.With a personal approach, this movie is nothing but a great deal of cinema experience. A war-view from an innocent and humble man, who try to survive in the era of crisis. The view, however, is like ""Grave of the Fireflies"", but the core of the movie is very different. There are sort of soul-power that will make Szpilman keep living, even in the starvation. And this kind of power make Szpilman keep playing his passion as a pianist.But, overall this is a superb movie, not complicated, and enjoyable.

315,billmarsano,Morally Flawed,6,27 April 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***Some Are Born Great Some Achieve Greatness Some Have Greatness Thrust Upon Them. Szpilman, on the hand, stayed home.In about the first half of this film Polanski manages to follow Ezra Pound's dictum--Make It New!--to powerful effect. Although the imposition of anti-Jewish laws in Poland and the herding of Jews into the ghetto have been done many times before, Polanski has somehow made them freshly frightening and has added new (to me) details that underline the terror. Excellent--so far.But then we have to deal with the pianist himself, Mr. Szpilman. There's a real problem here: Szpilman is an utterly unworthy person. I'm not suggesting unworthy of life but unworthy of this film. A film is myth-making by nature and Szpilman is a shabby person indeed. As portrayed here he is singularly uninvolved in anything except his music--morally adrift, in fact. At one point he half-heartedly offers to help in printing/distributing anti-Nazi leaflets but is quickly told, essentially, ""you're an artist--not right for this job."" Possibly that's true but Szpilman accepts the judgment too easily--almost leaps for it. (Who amongst us wouldn't at least put up an argument if told ""Sorry, sonny--you're just a kid. Leave this stuff to us big boys""?Szpilman does help a tiny bit as the ghetto Jews begin to arm themselves, but not much and not for long. He soon asks one of the leaders to help him escape and doesn't seem to notice that no one even tries to talk him into staying on to join in the uprising. Outside the ghetto Szpilman is--with the help of friends who risk their lives for him--stashed in a safe house as the ghetto erupts and then is destroyed. He knows he should be involved, even says so out loud to one of those friends--but again readily accepts the judgment that, well, he's an artist--fighting is for other people. Szpilman is happy to sit tight and read magazines until almost the very end, when he has to survive on his own. The ending is rather too pat for credibility. I was struck immediately by the fact that Szpilman never even asked the name of the German officer who let him live and showed almost no response to the news that he'd been captured. Then the war ends and he goes back to playing Chopin on the radio.Under the same circumstances, I freely admit, I might have done exactly what Szpilman did. And I too would be unworthy. ---------As an aternaive, I suggest Fania Fenelon's ""Playing for Time"" (book or movie).",The Pianist
316,AnonII,Awesome! Makes one forget Schindler's List.,10,17 January 2003,"You can imagine the reluctance of big-studio and money people to make a film directed by a felon still persona non grata in the US, centered on a protagonist who is much more a scurrying rat of a survivor than any kind of hero. But all such considerations are irrelevant when one experiences The Pianist.  The power of this film lies in its ability to once again shock viewers familiar with the Holocaust and cinematic accounts of it such as Shoah (1985) and Schindler's  List (1993). Once again, and seemingly for the first time, it leaves one astonished not only at the brutality of humanity is capable of, but also of the miraculous ability people have to survive the deepest psychological wounds of incomprehensible trauma.
Adrien Brody's performance is a wonder, especially since he seems to appear in every scene, if not every frame, of this epic tale.

317,aleator,Outstanding,8,6 April 2003,"Exceptionally well made with a wonderful, under-stated central performance, the film is let down only by one scene near the end in which survivors of the concentration camp are seen haranguing captured German soldiers. The portrayal of starving, emaciated human beings is always a problem and this film is no exception - everyone looks just too well fed. The fact that a stodgy, tasteless musical like 'Chicago' won the Oscar for Best film over 'The Pianist' is beyond comprehension.",The Pianist
318,Cheesedemon28,Amazing.,10,22 December 2003,"Wow.Let me start by saying that I despise Schindler's List. I loathe it. Spielberg basically turned the Holocaust into a theme park ride. I must also tell you that I don't like Spielberg.Now I must inform you that I am slightly biased. I am a Jewish Polanski fanatic. So to see this film is like to see a masterpiece in play. The most interesting and arguably, the best facet of the film is when the Szpilman familly is discussing what is going on, basically a round table discussion. It shows the exact emotions of most Jews, and non-Jewish poles during the Holocaust with textbook accuracy. Especially considering that Polanksi was a Holocaust survivor, this gives perfect perspective of the Warsaw ghetto.There are also some who say that the fact that Szpilman(sp?) was a pianist had very little to do with the film at all, but in fact, the piano was one of his few motives to survive throughout the whole film.Please, PLEASE, stop saying that there shouldn't be any more films like this. I think people should stop making Holocaust-related films when everyone believes that it actually happened. I personally know human beings that denied it even happened. Venal.So here's the math: Great plot + great premise + wonderful director + great sets + Chopin The Pianist = one of the best films ever made. It's a real shame that it lost out to the tragedy of a film that is Chicago for the best picture oscar.

319,MySilentReverie,One Word; Amazing!!!,10,1 June 2003,"I just saw The Pianist for the first time last night and I just want to start off by saying it was fantastic.  It's a complete perfect 10 in my opinion. I love movies and was really excited when I found out that it was coming out on DVD so I went to the video store and with my luck there was one copy left on VHS.  I got it, watched it, brought it back, and went to Best Buy and bought the DVD.  I love movies and I have to say that this is one of the best movies I've seen for a long time.  It's actually one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life.  Adrien Brody was amazing and he deserved the oscar.  This is the first film I've seen of his and I'm telling you this, it won't be the last.  That man has got some amazing talent. Every time I watch a movie about the holocaust I think to myself god I can't believe that something that horrific happened, I found myself crying harder at this film than any other movie I've ever seen.   This movie really sticks with you too, hours after watching it I still can't imagine how terrified those poor people were.  I am thankful that I never have had to go through something like that myself and I think a lot of us should be more thankful for the lives that we have.  Movies like this should really be used to educate people on the consequences of one's hatred.  If you are a historical drama fan, a Roman Polanski fan, or just a movie fan in general see this movie.  It won't only entertain you, it will educate you and make you feel for all those people whose lives were taken from them so unjustly.  It will make you feel grateful for the life that you have.",The Pianist
320,odor007,"BEAUTIFUL, DISTURBING, FLAWLESS...A MASTERPIECE!",10,1 April 2003,"Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is an absolute masterpiece.  There's really no way to describe it without writing pages, but there's a reason it's currently at #45 on imdb's top 100 films ever (and climbing).  As a film student, I must say that this is probably the most brilliant direction job in the past two decades...Polanski's absolutely masterful sense of timing, his ingenious attention to detail, his passion, and his care for the actor's craft shines through to the end of this film--every color, every grain, every outfit, every face, every camera shot is an artwork, creating a film experience like few others.  This movie also has an incredible combination of joyous scenes, horridly disturbing scenes, and scenes that are so powerful and beautifully-realized that it's hard to take--I've seen many films in my days, and I've cried during about ten of them--usually just teary eyes though.  During this film tears were uncontrollably streaming down my face, and I sat in the theater, simply in shock at what an experience this film is.  Afterwards, on the trip home with a group of friends, none of us talked once for the mile walk.  Once getting home, I was so profoundly moved and had so many thoughts and feelings I couldn't read, watch TV, anything...it all seemed so unimportant and trivial.  I was rooting for Almodovar at the Academy Awards for his amazing job on ""Hable Con Ella,"" but I had not yet seen the Pianist--all I have to say is that it deserved to sweep every category of nomination.  Brody absolutely, without a doubt deserved his award (his performance was one of the best, most precise, most accurate, and most heart-felt I've ever had the pleasure of watching), and it also deserved the Best Screenplay award.  But I have a feeling that not even the Academy, notorious for it's payoffs and balanced out voting tactics, could let the show end without Polanski winning Best Director.  The fact that ""Chicago"" won for Best Picture is a travesty, and I really don't know how that cast got up there and accepted that award, knowing how ridiculous their victory was...but that's the multi-million dollar politics of the Academy Awards.  Anyway, I'm rambling, but EVERYONE must see this film--will go down in history as one of Polanski's best, Brody's best, and as one of the greatest cinema accomplishments of all time.",The Pianist
321,clearwinner,Unable to portray the point of the movie,7,25 October 2014,"The movie opens up with the German attack, then there is some kind of love or whatever scene between the lead and some random girl (who appears next towards the end). Then it shows some family drama. Again here there is no much insight given to the lead so it becomes to rack what is being shown and why it is being shown. I was lost for most of the time during the first half. The events occur very quickly and the tension is slack. You would not fell any kind of tension during the first half because it just shows some random events occurring to their family members and some children. It seems more like a cliché. Well apart from this, the most irritating thing for me was the relation of the lead and his brother. The brother was not happy with the pianist , OK I accepted that fact but how did this contribute to the story. I felt these all scenes were just added for the sake of inclusion of drama in the movie. But it did not go well with the plot. The second half shows the struggle of the pianist which was again badly written. The screenplay was too slack. There were numerous scenes of fading to black and they were noticeable because it was just a 30 seconds scene and then it fades to black. That thing gave me a very disgust feeling. But the film redeems itself in the last few minutes but still all those things were expected. Overall the events does not fuse itself well in the movie. It is based on a true event, I accept but surely does not deserve a place in the top 250.",The Pianist

The acting was average by all except a couple of the very minor characters. I guess being blind or deaf , or tortured or in a wheel chair (with the exception of Daniel Day Lewis) is supposed to give an extra ""umph"" to a performance? Certainly didn't work for Tom Cruise. Wasn't a horrible movie, but did play the tortured artist holocaust card to get most of it's attention.  There is a story in every survivor.

323,s_iliya_p,"A movie to remember, a movie to love",8,30 March 2019,"If I'm being honest, that's probably my best experience with Roman Polanski's art. Speaking of how smoothly the story is told. And, how it challenges our limits, demonstrating everything a director can, murdering, humiliation, free labor/slavery, children starving.
Heavy elements in the movie. Hope and despair and survival.
Maybe more than anything else, I loved that it showed both good and bad actions of Jews and Nazis. Of course it's not even close to a competition when counted, but the fact that it was there cannot be denied. There were some people who abused their friends at some point, and there were people mistreating each other for a little bit more food, and a little bit more prosper in those desperate times.
On the contrary, as brutally displayed the Nazis' actions, I love to think that there is a little bit of humanity inside of everyone and this is shown more than one occasion.
On the same note, isn't wrath, greed, and genocide only observed in humans?
I mean, maybe it is human to kill other people, and it needs something more than that to stop it.
I loved the drama in this movie, many powerful phrases such ""Food is more important than time"" and the music. What a lucky life we have to experience the music in this movie.

325,BlizzyFoxTF,"A very good war film that centers on the brutalities and travails of war, but lacks the ambition of a genre masterpiece.",7,11 December 2020,"A very good war film that depicts the throes of war to a tee, but lacking the nuance that is evident in Spielberg or Cauron's works. Polanski seemed to opt for a less realistic approach in directing this movie, and characters seem more aware that they are in a film than in Schindler's List or Children of Men. In other words, despite the direction being incredibly deft and skillful, it can feel stiff at certain points of the film, and the set pieces artificial and unnatural. The pacing is very well done here, but the fast pace bereaves time for character building. As a result, despite the plethora of violence and moments of despair, they don't land as hard on an emotional level. The side characters/victims are not fleshed out enough, and there's a feel of spectacle for spectacle sake, where scenes play out for an overt intention to fish out visceral reactions. Without ample build up, I find it rather void. There are also quite a few plot contrivances in the film, which point to its main goal of achieving mainstream appeal. The story is decent, and I do not consider it a weak asset despite how simple it is. The protagonist's journey is wild and gripping, but it is not consistently interesting enough to considered very memorable - there aren't quite enough iconic moments or sequences that leaves a profound mark. The reaction between two certain characters at the end of the film could have used a bit more development, especially for one person whom we only come across at the end of the film; a better approach would be to do a dual/ interspersing narrative to introduce that character before that critical scene, such that it holds more weight. Speaking of characters, I feel like there are not enough bad important characters in the film, as opposed to a few good ones that exist. Perhaps it is intentional, with which the film conveys the message that warfare itself is the evil menace while humanity is inherently kind. Still, if there is more contrast presented in certain individuals, those ""noble"" characters would make a bigger impact in both the story and the audience, since it would accentuate the film's ""message"". Lastly, the film's core theme isn't entirely new either. I don't see any new ideas presented in the film other than the cruelty of war, and the struggles of suppressed ethnic groups under tyranny. The protagonist is a lovable character, carried by an amazing performance by Brody, but it is also rather one dimensional that sees little character growth by the end of the film. The Pianist is after all a standard war film, a very well rounded, crowd-pleasing one at that, or at least it feels like one. It does not seem to try achieve much more beyond that.As for the positive aspects, there isn't much that people haven't said already. The cinematography is fantastic, especially the scenes filmed at night. Brody's performance is electrifying and pretty much carries the whole movie. Like I said, the pacing is very well done, and although I find the first hour of the film rather dull, it never feels like it drags at any point, thanks to Polanski's expert direction. The wide appeal of the film means that it is a good recommendation for people who are new to war films. Overall, I don't think it is a 10/10 masterpiece that many hyped it up to be. I think Schindler's List and Children of Men are both far superior films. Yet, it certainly is an enjoyable experience if you are looking for a more palatable war film (there is a fair bit of violence though, so I wouldn't consider it too family friendly).",The Pianist

Challenges and triumphs. And not just your typical Holocuast film. It has something to offer. It's its own thing.Polanski doesn't just lazily try to pull at your heartstrings and hope you'll hand him an Oscar (which he couldn't accept in person).

327,d1494,This film is not outstanding but..,8,27 June 2003,"I have to agree with a number of comments about this film being somewhat standard and numbing. Indeed much of the film goes by and leaves one in that state. However, the beginning and end do transcend that, which is all to the good. Brody gives a fine performance; the music is beautiful as is the photography and the setting.Unfortunately, the other actors are given short shrift and they are one feels, also capable of giving fine performances,had their characters been more fleshed out. Having seen many of Polansky's films, I must say I don't recognize his artistic style here as I've come to know it over the  years. That in itself is not necessarily a negative, however he has made some gripping films and this one just doesn't quite live up to that standard. There are some fine things about this film and I do not dismiss it, and indeed would recommend it to others with some caveats. The film is rather too long for what it is and could have been 20 minutes shorter with no harm done. The thing that most impressed me about the experience of watching this was that I had just watched another holocaust film, albeit one about the holocaust of Cambodia, The Killing Fields. This film has all the emotional tension after repeated viewings that it had the first time, this is what I wanted from The Pianist but it wasn't there. 'The Killing Fields' conveys the nightmare scene of Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and shows how it got there. It also shows very well the drama of people being caught up in the maw of evil beyond their ken. Having watched this extraordinary film first, I found myself  feeling a little detached from the plight of those in this film and it felt like nothing in the movie really reached out and grabbed me the way the subject normally would. I would also say that while I felt 'bludgeoned' by the impact of 'Schindler's List', it also did not reach out to me in the way that 'The Killing Fields' does. It seems that while some movies are greater than the sum of their parts, some are less. This one was less and thus somewhat disappointing, albeit still worthy of watching. I give this film 8/10.",The Pianist
328,vivesi-1,Not brilliant and issue-ridden,7,30 May 2003,"First, I don't believe in praising people for anything who refuse to face their criminal actions. What if Timothy McVeigh had made a good movie? The scale of the crime is different but the principle is the same. What if the guy who kidnapped Elizabeth Smart turned out to be this really cool dude with an artistic vision? Would Hollywood give either of these people a standing ovation at the Oscars? What if Polanski had violated one of their 13 year-old children? I think the outcome would have been a bit different. (For you kids who came along late in the game--The victim was 13 and Polanski raped her and fled to Europe to escape punishment. France would be the country that lets him live freely as a fugitive from justice, if you hadn't guessed that already.)But the movie itself angers me as well. Critics, paid and not, have praised everything about this movie--its honesty, artistry, acting, etc. Sure, it's a technically fine movie. Smarter critics have noted that it isn't a predictable ""triuph of human spirit"". It is wholly observational as some have mentioned. But the underlying premise of this movie is unbearable and could only be made by a man like Polanski, who thinks that art erases crime. The premise is that the artist must be spared no matter what, even if he doesn't want to be. Good, decent people must die, kind of like sacrifices, for the greater artist who must live live live, no matter what kind of person they are. Only Hollywood would applaud this diabolical level of narcissism. Ethical human beings, artists and others, would not. If Polanski were honest and upstanding he would have made a movie about a film director coincidentally spared in the Holocaust who tragically lost his wife and unborn child and then went on to drug and rape a thirteen year old girl (a passion he continued unhindered in Europe. Just ask Kinski.) Let's see the child molestation film, Polanski. (That people *thank* him on this site is truly bewildering. I hope you don't plan to introduce him to your adolescent daughters.)This movie is also a big flip-off to the US (why not Germany? why not make this film in Polish or French? It was aimed like a warhead to the US.) Polanski seems to snicker to himself at our gullibility, at our reliable tendency to confuse the appreciation of art with establishing our own identities. You are what you like in America. And Polanski cleverly capitalizes on this national identity crisis. There are the people who trip over themselves to stutter about their favorite artists, and they use the word ""artist"" as an insult to the less informed. Those people generally love Polanski. And he knows it. Here is the movie to prove it.Completely without reference to its creator, ""The Pianist"" is only a pretty good movie. You know the story and you've more or less seen the scenes and heard the dialogue in other movies. There is nothing new here in writing or direction. It is well acted (Brody was just fine)and stark enough with enough shocking scenes to elucidate a little of the terror of the Holocaust. I have, however, seen more gripping scenes about the same subject (see: The Grey Zone, among others). ""The Pianist"" doesn't have smooth edges (the other reason it's gotten so much acclaim. I'm surprised there's not some Indie formula now to rough up the edges of movies. Hint hint--don't be neat. Leave your movie's shoes untied.) But overall, this movie is not a great accomplishment. Polanski should have the courage to tell his own story and face its consequences in the real world instead of pandering to actors and the US indie crowd. He is a coward and a criminal and we should view his movies through that lens. Polanski is trying to tell us something with this movie, but I don't think what he's trying to say is honorable.",The Pianist
329,psychprofessor,Intense but worth it,9,28 February 2004,"I thought this movie was extremely well done, well acted, paced well, etc. The randomness of some of the actions of the Germans was not surprising if you've seen lots of movies about the Holocaust. Still, when a woman is shot for asking ""Where are we being taken?"" . . . . The main character was infinitely sympathetic, incredibly lucky, and fortunate that he was well known in Warsaw. I particularly liked the scenes with the sympathetic German officer, which put a human face on the ""enemy."" This was the kind of movie that's hard to take, but one that rewards the effort.

330,jiffyxpop,See the Pianist - Especially Now,10,3 June 2004,"A movie about the atrocities committed during WWII could not be more timely to watch than now, at a time when George Bush is comparing the ""War on Terrorism"" to WWII - odd since depending on what your politics are you might think that lately the US is acting more like the Nazis in this film than the rescuing Russians, with the common people of Afghanistan, Iraq and the US, like the Pianist, being caught in between as the inadvertent, non-politicized victims of the ideological/political war between the government of fascists and fundamentalists. Roman Polanski does a tremendous job of portraying the brutality and ugliness of war, and the beauty of human individuality when mercy, kindness, and love are demonstrated in the face of it.    If all the political leaders with their agendas today were forced to sit in a room and watch this together, I wonder what they would say afterwards about it. Polanski had made a movie that will haunt those who see it forever -- a cinematic revelation that wisely reminds us--""Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it."" It makes me hope that if perhaps if more love, kindness, mercy and understanding were demonstrated in politics today, we might be able to get further toward global peace.  Using words like ""Axis of Evil"" on our side, and the terms fanatical fundamentalists use to describe us, only fan the flames of hatred - it does not help to put them out.",The Pianist
331,spinin,Oscar Contender?,8,9 December 2002,"I have been lucky enough to catch this film while I was in Poland a couple of months ago. There was some major hype to it then, but that is understandable since Polanski is one of the most famous Polish directors along with Kieslowski and Wajda. I have watched several Polanski films over the last few months and I really appreciate what he has done over the years. The thing that I most like about him as a filmmaker is that he combines simple and intelligent storytelling with artistic craft that is easy to see. He always claims that he likes to make films that he would like to watch himself as a fan. Most of his films tell engaging stories that are accessible to anyone. At the same time, his techniques are very direct and provide additional enjoyment to those who have a deeper knowledge of film and its devices. I think his films would be good to study in an introductory film class. Enough about PolanskiTHE PIANIST is a true story of a Polish Jew named Wladyslaw Szpilman and his survival during WWII. His name is rather appropriate since he is also a piano player. As the film opens, Nazi Germany has invaded Poland and quickly the Jews are separated from the rest of the Poles. At first Szpilman and his family live in the ghettos, but soon the Nazis begin transporting everyone out into concentration camps. During a hectic sequence where Jews are being led to the train wagons, Szpilman gets separated from the rest of his family. He returns to an empty ghetto where he is one of the few Jews who have not yet been transported. The rest of the film deals with his struggle for survival and his fear of being found by Nazis as he seeks new places to hide.In the first half of the film I was not really getting into it. I wasn't sure where the story was going. It took some time before Szpilman found himself alone and that's when the movie started to become really good. The film is a little detached, which gives it a perfect sense of realism. There is no melodrama here that might be found in other films. Adrien Brody, who seemed rather unimpressive to me in the first half, really starts to embody the role as the film progresses. I started seeing that this film was not about WWII or about the Holocaust. Those are the settings, but that is not what it is about. This was a realistic portrayal of a man who lived in hiding through those depressing times. It is from his point of view and you only get to see what he sees through windows, key holes, or door cracks and you only hear what he happens to hear from people he meets. He has no other way of learning anything about the war or when it will finally come to an end. The film becomes about one man, not Pole or Jew, but just one man and his uncertainties. It could have been anyone. What I liked most is that THE PIANIST illustrates the helplessness of witnessing horrible acts that happen right in front of you as you try to hide. You are afraid to come out and you are afraid to keep hiding. In many ways Mr. Szpilman is lucky because he does not live through the suffering that millions of other people lived through, but his experiences were not necessarily any easier. His loneliness is clearly conveyed in many beautiful and symbolic images. One high angle shot I remember well shows his silhouette as he walks in the middle of an empty street surrounded by destroyed buildings.THE PIANIST has a great story to tell and Polanski's direction tells it well. Since it is about a piano player, there is lots of beautiful music throughout. The main theme is very memorable. This is a subtle, patient, and thoughtful film that does not create excessive melodrama, but rather focuses on realism. The toned down, bittersweet ending is especially strong. I have a feeling that THE PIANIST will come and go from the movie theaters in the US rather quietly and as a result will not be a major contender at the Oscars (This also depends on many other movies that are still to be released soon). I don't think that this is an exceptional film, but I hope that audiences will not overlook it. As I watched it, my enjoyment was at about an 8, but as the film progressed I became more absorbed by it and my appreciation level was at about a 9 by the time it was over. I guess my overall rating would be somewhere between an 8 and a 9, but I would like to watch it again. Another strong Polanski film.",The Pianist
332,pivko,Why the best movies of the year hardly ever get an Oscar?,10,28 October 2003,"Well, I am kind of used to that the best movie of the year never gets an Oscar recently (save for Forrest Gump and American Beauty of course). Most flagrant mistakes of the Academy are their choice of Titanic over As Good as It Gets in 1998 and awarding Chicago over the Pianist in 2003. And the worst thing is that the Schindler's List which is in some points similar yet worse than the Pianist was awarded. Well there is no justice on earth.
Anyway, the strongest point of this movie is the story. The survival of a jewish top pianist through the dreadful WW II in Warsaw, Poland. Of course, there have been numbers of movies like that but this one is so beautifully crafted that it leaves trails in your memory forever. After seing a movie like this one must be assured that the atrocities of WW II must never be forgotten.Couple the wonderful story with a great acting and cinematography and there is a masterpiece and you bet this one is.

From The Solid Direction Of Roman Polanski to the Flawless acting of Adrien Brody This Movie without a doubt can be called a Masterpiece. The Movie is based on The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, who in the 1930s was considered one of the most accomplished Pianist. But the movie is not about his fame, Nor his Glory as a pianist. It's About A Polish Jew, who fought against all odds, Faced situations that he never even imagined and Finally Survived by losing almost everything and everyone he loved. It shows not only a tale of horrific surviving, but also the emotions that many people had to face and fight in order to live. It makes you wonder how people who really faced and Fought against those odd and lived, makes you ask yourself what would i do in that situation? The Cast is great, Whether it is a important character like Fox as Dorota or Minor character such as Ronan Vibert as Janina's Husband. But Adrian Broody Truly proved his worth as an actor in this film, i mean he was so into the character that he will make you believe that he really is Szpilman, He lost over 14 kilograms and developed a unusual body language for some scenes, and an actor of his level deserve much more recognition, but it's a fact that people nowadays prefer flash and looks over true art, however if you are one of those who can appreciate a true masterpiece you must have a look at ""The Pianist""",The Pianist

Especially with the support of the atmosphere and other extras that mix it into reality.Not only there, several important characters are also here, even though wayldek is the main character, but we are also brought to sympathize with other characters, a big example is his own family.The plot given by this film may be a bit boring at the beginning, but after starting to enter Complications, the story is getting better and better, more and more problems arise so that it doesn't make the main character just stay in that state, everything is neatly made and able to make me happy.

337,bkam,Nothing redeeming about this drivel...,3,28 May 2003,"Having read a fair amount about the Warsaw Ghetto, this movie seemed to trivialize it to me. I know that I am not stating a popular opinion, but I found that this film, which put so little into character development and so much into plot, was a failure. *We already know the plot*. So what is the point of the film? Nothing, in my opinion, it adds nothing to what has already been established, and pales in comparison to reading memoirs from the people who were there. Even in terms of plot, there are jagged edges in this film and it is generally an unsmooth and uninteresting ride through material that has been covered ad infinitum by better writers. Rarely have I been this bored in a movie. The violence, I felt, was extremely Hollywood--it was meant to portray the evil Germans against the good Jews. Not that I am a Nazi, but such a ridiculous simplification annoys me. More interesting is how an entire nation (Germany) could allow this to happen--a point which goes entirely unaddressed as we watch three hours of another Jew in another awful situation. A member of the Einsatzgruppen who was killing the Jews was as much a person as Szpilman, with emotions and responses just like his.  The fact that they are destroying other humans does not mean that they themselves are not human, although this fact is ignored in this movie and others by portraying them as monsters.  Isn't there some psychological (and as a result, cinematic) ground to break here?  I feel that most people are familiar with the experience of the Jews--if we must revisit this part of history again, why not try it in a different way?  I hope I don't offend anyone with these comments, because I don't mean to marginalize the suffering that happened, but I feel that with distance we get clarity about a situation. Since no large group (to my limited knowledge of the world) still misunderstands the holocaust, this type of emotional drivel is pointless and gets the public riled up over something long dead, without adding anything new whatsoever.",The Pianist
338,jsmog,Great exposition on the horrors of war.,8,24 September 2003,"This film was not what I expected...not really a film about the Holocaust, instead it shows in terrible detail the struggle of one man, obviously privileged and famous, who for all his talent and renown barely survives the occupation of Warsaw by the Germans.  The first movie I've seen which shows something of the Polish resistance.",The Pianist
339,myschrec,A missed opportunity,7,22 December 2005,"I should explain why I did not rate this film higher. I think it a good film. I think Adrien Brody did an incredibly good job. I think the film more than adequately portrayed the protagonist's near-death experiences. It is dramatic and life-affirming. Many scenes are memorable. Also, as an amateur musician, I can attest to how music can provide purpose, sanity, and sustenance in times of deprivation, pain and fear. Wladyslaw Szpilman was a truly remarkable man whose story of survival was worthy of honoring. But he did little to help others. He observed and suffered from the horrors of the ghetto, but he did little to confront them. Polanski singularly exalted Szpilman's personal survival, when he could have explored other aspects of Szpilman's story. For example, Szpilman's conduct of protecting himself -- and not joining with others, assisting others, or joining the Warsaw ghetto resistance -- was similar to the conduct of the Polish Resistance groups who refused to help the Jews in the Ghetto in spite of the fact that the Warsaw Ghetto uprising was at the time the more successful anti-Nazi effort being waged in Europe. I don't fault Polanski for not exploring so many of the other issues that he could have raised -- just as I do not criticize Szpilman for not doing more to help others. But I think that the movie could have been better. It could have at least raised the question of selfishness and survival. Of course, the film made the Holocaust more accessible and more palatable to a wider audience -- particularly to a non-Jewish audience. Szpilman seemed more like a Polish gentleman than the kind of ""alien"" Jews -- by that I mean the rural, shtetl-based Orthodox Jews -- that the many Poles hated and discriminated against, sometimes just as violently as the Nazis. I suppose that Polanski identified with Szpilman and was particularly horrified that the Holocaust would threaten the lives of cultured, assimilated Jews who were no different than their Polish neighbors. Of course, it is his prerogative to select what Holocaust story to tell. His film is similar to some of the films about Bonhoeffer and other Christians arrested by the Nazis. I just think that other films on this subject -- even those about non-Jews -- were much more illuminating, complex, and dramatic -- like ""Schindler's List,"" ""The Diary of Anne Frank,"" ""Amen,"" and ""The Grey Zone.""",The Pianist
340,GuineaPig,"Good movie, but...",7,31 August 2003,"I think this is a good movie but still I think there are much better ones about WW2 and the Holocaust. The movie is well made and the acting is very good but the subject is so worn out that it leaves you nothing. Why do they always have to see things black and white (good or bad) when war and life is not as simple as that. WW2 was awful, I agree, but give it a break and START living in the present! Some producers, IMHO, try to take advantage of WW2's ""success"" in Hollywood and the film's industry overall to build a name or to be liked by everyone. This sort of propaganda movies are the ones that brainwash people into thinking that some countries or people are evil and some are good without even thinking about the causes and consequences of the actions in the story (specially when is such a delicate subject as this one where the story is actually a part of history and something that affect us all). The film only drives you emotionally through it but it's just that and nothing else what makes it good. I agree the director did a great job with the movie but let us hope this is the last film about this topic or, at least, let us view some new ideas. We are growing with a very flawed perception of the world because of the huge amount of films like this one.",The Pianist
341,cathalokane,Powerful film *Contains Spoiler*,8,7 May 2013,"This is a film that I had been meaning to watch for quite some time, but have only recently got around to it. Potential viewers should be aware that this film is quite harrowing, and is difficult to watch, as indeed any realistic portrayal of this bleak time for humanity will necessarily be.A very normal and vibrant Jewish family are initially relatively nonplussed by the advance of the Germans into Poland. This is a powerful way to setup what is to come, and allows the viewer the unique chance to remember that this is likely how it actually was. This family had no way of knowing the true horror of what was coming their way, and the opening scenes get this across effectively with an interesting and diverse range of personalities portrayed in a normal family.As the narrative progresses we see the family initially remain strong in testing circumstances, and they slowly begin to break as the creeping inhumanity of their surroundings and circumstances takes its toll.The first 90 minutes of this film are a powerful reminder of the lead up to the Holocaust itself and how Jews were systematically de-humanised by the Nazis. The remainder of the film follows the pianist in his attempts to survive the remains of the Nazi occupation.This film doesn't have the emotional hook of Schindler's List despite tackling similar subject matter - although there is a similar Schindler moment towards the end. However, it is difficult to find fault. It is a gritty, depressing and effectively claustrophobic story of a man who managed to survive where few others did. It touches on a variety of themes, such as the question of Jewish resistance and the extent to which such a thing was even possible. It always seems to be obvious to the retrospective observer that resistance had to happen, but we regularly forget that these people did not see what was coming. It is an interesting theme that is touched upon throughout, but I won't comment further as my knowledge of the subject is too limited to comment with any authority.The screenplay, script and acting are superb throughout, and this is a film that any student of history must watch. It is not however to be recommended to someone looking for an evening's light entertainment.",The Pianist
342,B RUBBLE,A good supplement to Schindler's List,7,31 January 2003,"This movie is a good supplement to ""Schindler's List"" in that it follows one of the many individuals that was not saved by Schindler or some other mercenary, and had to endure all the hardships of WWII in Warsaw.  It gives a good viewpoint of what happened to one of the many survivors who lived through the Holocaust in Poland.While I consider this film good, I feel that ""Schindler's List"" is much more compelling, and an over-all better movie.  I gave  ""Schindler's List"" a 10 (1 of only 3 films I have given a ""10"") whereas this movie I think merits only a ""7"".Even now, a few years later, I am still haunted and moved by the scenes and story of ""Schindler's List"", but do not feel nearly that amount of emotion from seeing ""The Pianist"" just a few days ago.

I must say that it was WORTH every minute (late at night).Every single actor in the film had a realism in their character which is very uncommon in many international films. It seems that the director 'made sure' that the film grabs you inside the TV/Screen and puts the viewer in the space and time of Warsaw massacre. Having said this, the props were well selected and felt real.The story telling and the chronology was well synchronized along side the classical composition of Szpilman.This film is not about the Holocaust but about one man and his will to survive the evil that prevailed during the times of Hitler. This film also goes to show 'why should an innocent Jew suffer from the higher level of political war that prevails on this earth'. He just want's to be left alone and continue with his normal life. He has nothing to do with the war, but with his survival and his life. ""Why should he die, if he is not guilty"".In conclusion, this film conveys a message to all of us that we do not need to fight with opponent to win anything, but we need to find way's out of the trouble and war that has 'nothing to do with us'. This is a lesson we must all learn from this film.I am proud of Szpilman and many more who followed his footsteps, because they are the real winners of the war.MUST SEE THIS FILM.My score: 8 out of 10Regards, Neil Bhatia",The Pianist

If there is some reasonable hope for people in the film, there is some merit to watching it.The main character in this film however, really survives by luck, not by skill, and that just makes the hope factor non-existant because at any time, a german could pull him over and shoot him in the head just for fun.

352,crooked_spoons,"Nothing New, Nothing Different...Nothing At All...",4,18 December 2009,"Sadly, The Pianist disappointed me in more ways than one. Adrian Brody did nothing worthwhile, other than save his own skin—and there's nothing wrong with that, I'm sure thousands of Jews did the same. The problem is, I don't care about them either. The Holocaust was a horrible, atrocious, sickening series of events which left millions dead, wounded and mentally scarred. We know this, and I don't mean to brush off anything or downplay the gravity of what occurred, but I've seen it all before.There was some senseless killing of Jews, more senseless killing of Jews, liquidation and a salvation. Nothing more, nothing less. I'm sadly reminded that if an event is horrible enough, people will continue to laud and applaud movies made about it even if they have nothing new to say.Call Brody's acting whatever lovely adjectives you want (minimalist, subdued, etc) but to me, it was bland and forgettable. Don't get me wrong, I think Brody is a tremendous actor, but in THIS movie, I didn't see a man who was scared, nor determined to fight for his life or to see things through, instead, I saw a man who was just going through the motions, ""whatever happens, happens"" in a way. He was neither brave nor memorable and certainly not relatable.I didn't care about him, his family and in the end, none of the characters. And I didn't feel even the slightest hint of emotion. The only time I was even remotely roused was when Halina (I think her name was Halina) was reunited with the family after the second liquidation of the ghetto.In the end, Pianist gives little more than a tired rehash of the same old same old. Things were badI know! But if you're going to make yet another Holocaust film, at least do it right, make it interesting, make it meaningful, make it SAY something. This said nothing more than, ""Look how bad things were."" In the end, his ability to play the piano saved his life, in a way, or it was merely a weary Nazi officer who showed him mercy.If you want to see a real holocaust movie, one need only turn to Schindler's List. I felt, I mean *really* felt, the characters pain and emotional conflict. The book was incredible as well. It was well made and had an actual plot. Not just a broad story arc where nothing other than the ""usual"" happened.-Just because it's a Holocaust film, doesn't automatically make it good.",The Pianist

Although not unique in theme, The Pianist is very much unique in presentation, perspective, and pacing.  Polanski is technically brilliant here, and his portrayal of humanity within a context of universal suffering and personal torment is poignant without being cheesy or sappy.  This is a movie I will own the second it becomes available on DVD, but I would highly recommend seeing it in the theater.

354,lucaslw-93145,A film that cannot compete with any of its peers,7,26 September 2021,"I've seen a handful of holocaust related or adjacent films and media.Schindler's ListLife is BeautifulInglourious Basterds (a bit of a stretch, sorta)Jojo Rabbit (probably doesn't count)Magneto's arc in X-Men: First Class (counts even less than Jojo Rabbit)Band of BrothersWhen I compare The Pianist to these other films, it feels to me that The Pianist neither covers a meaningful niche that the others don't nor does the film do anything that the other films don't do better.As far as Holocaust stories goes, The Pianist is fairly mundane. Adrien Brody's Szpilman isn't a particularly commanding character. He's no hero, he's no rogue, and he's no extraordinary person. He's not even the most spirited person in his family. Szpilman is a man who just happens to be the subject of focus and the movie lacks any dynamic growth in the main character's arc. He's simply an ordinary man in extraordinary times -- a product of fortune and circumstance in a period of grave misfortune. The result is, to me, an unproblematic performance that managed to win an Oscar in the face of weak competition during the 2003 cycle.More disappointingly, the camerawork of the movie is uninspiring. In a movie where the subject matter is dark and heavy, the biggest risk taken by Polanski and the Director of Photography is to slowly drain color out of the film. A choice that didn't add much depth to my viewing experience. Most notably, there is a scene where Szpilman is playing the piano silently and the reveal is done with a frame cut rather than a smooth camera pan, a camerawork choice that seems to echo in the majority of the decisions made on set and in the editing room.In all, a Holocaust movie that isn't as well executed and assembled as Schindler's List, has a story and character dynamics less memorable than Life is Beautiful, and a story less interesting than any of the other aforementioned media. For a movie that runs 2 and a half hours, The Pianist's only useful place in Holocaust cinematography is the immortalize the spirit of a true remarkable story of an unremarkable man surviving through remarkable times.",The Pianist

Terrible and horrifying as the war is you see that not everybody on the wrong side is bad and not everybody on the side of oppressed is a good one. You also see  that in times when there is almost nothing that can keep you going that can give you hope there is something inside to which if we hold very tight it may just allow us to survive and if not that at least to die with dignity.

They are not something to watch when you have a spare couple of hours.A few spoilers within.I was right in my assumption that this movie was going to be a hard ride. There is no joy, only death and destruction. But through it all our man fought his way and in the end survived when nearly all the odds were totally against him.The devastation of Warsaw was complete, and Roman Polanski took us there in this movie, showing us just how bad things were.I felt myself wanting to shout at the Jews to do something, when a few were picked from a lineup, told to lay down, and then a German soldier worked his way along the men lying down shooting them in the head with a single bullet. As the last man waited his turn to die, the soldier had run out of bullets. The Jew laid there patiently while the soldier reloaded his gun, and was then shot dead. I couldn't understand why the man didn't at least attempt to grab the soldier's gun or at least make some type of attempt to get the hell out of there, even if the situation was hopeless. This scene stunned me to tears.The film did show that not all German soldiers were murderous jew haters. Near the end a higher ranking German officer, more educated than most of his men, helped Szpilman with food and a warm coat, although Szpilman was never able to thank the man after the war by tracing him down.Directed superbly by Roman Polanski, and acted brilliantly by Adrien Brody, who both won oscars, the film also won Ronald Harwood an oscar for best adapted screen play.10/10",The Pianist

He communicates his role excellently, but if this is the best, then 2002 must have produced a rather mediocre crop.However, I find it difficult to fathom how this failed to win Best Picture. I'm not judging this on the basis of its depiction of the Holocaust - I always avoid those obvious ones cashing in on the Holocaust's popularity as a movie subject, but this one was rather moving. However, if there was another movie that was really as touching as this one, I can see why the Pianist didn't win.Still, the film is realistic enough, and I find it to be a very effective anti-war and anti-racism movie, moreso than any other I've ever seen.10/10",The Pianist

'Rosemary's Baby', 'Repulsion', 'The Tenant' and 'Chinatown' are all movies which have a great sense of mystery and dark addiction about them but when you mention 'The Pianist', it is his masterpiece.Roman Polanski rejected offer to direct 'Schindler's List'.Though it was a great movie as well,but after 'Pianist' we came to know what he was really thinking.The tale of Wladyslaw Szpilman is told in a flowing and natural way that creates an atmosphere no other War movie can.The story moves like a storm and there isn't a frame you can skip.You cry, you feel pain and you start to feel as a part of miseries of people trapped in Warsaw Ghetto.No other movie has been able to portray the Holocaust better than 'The Pianist'.Even people who want to know what Holocaust was, should watch this mesmerizing experience.Any review of this movie is incomplete without mentioning Adrian Brody.The worries, the hideouts, the hunger and the misery of Szpilman is naturally depicted to you by his powerful performance which earned him a deserved Oscar.The scenes when he is dragging A Can of food around the place he is hiding really brought me shivers to the feelings of a prisoner of war though I have my own experience of GULF WAR in 1990 to relate it with when I was just 10 years old.The realistic atmosphere of the movie is not to be missed by anyone.'The Pianist' is one of the best movies ever made and the best war movie ever and to consider that it is based on a true story of survival, makes it much more Powerful movie.",The Pianist
362,sackleywhistle,And the award for best picture goes to...,8,13 October 2003,"... Chicago. Oh dear. What a travesty. 2003 continued the trend for the politics to rule the Academy Awards, giving the most prestigious gong to the boring Chicago over this, possibly Polanski's last great masterpiece. Not that he won't make more films, but that this is his finest since Chinatown, a genuine return to form. And with the current stigma against him in the US, he had to seek out funding from four (count them) countries to ensure this worthy, important film got made. It is the kind of story which has it all - heartbreak, loss, love, death, prejudice, malice, violence, hope, despair, humour and triumph. And that is because it is the story of a man, a real man. An acclaimed, well-known Polish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman is our guide to the ghettoisation and subsequent extermination of the Warsaw Jews in World War II, evading capture because of his connections, but watching his family go to die. He survives by joining the Jewish uprising, then hiding in apartments and then ruins in war-torn Warsaw, fleeing from conflict, an outsider watching the dehumanisation of his kin from the inside.Comparisons between this and the earlier Schindler's List are obvious, particularly in the early evacuation scenes, but rather than one being better than the other, they are merely companion pieces, each approaching different aspects of similar material, shot through with restraint, respect and brilliance. However, while the facts of Schindler's life are open to question, this feels much more real. Szpilman's position is purposefully ambiguous - while he is a man stuck in a desperate situation, seemingly doomed if he does not act, he does not have the bravery others have to stand up and fight. Indeed, at times it seems he dismisses the brutality of others to pursue his own ends - such as when his brother is arrested - but this is merely because there is the sense that everyone is doomed, and if you stop to help someone less fortunate, you may forfeit your own life. His bravery comes instead from his sheer refusal to give up and become a number, another Jewish corpse. By the closing act of the film, you come to realise that he was a man who had respect and a career, even prominence, stripped of everything - his dignity, his clothes, his home, his family, even food - but finding a way to survive, until it blows over and he can once again play the piano. By the end, it seems that this is the only place where he succeeds as a person - he did not relate well to members of his family, he has no lover, he passes from person to person, in passing friendships. But when he plays the piano, people listen and he can express all those things that he otherwise could not in life.This is by far the most handsome film Polanski has made, every shot filled with detail and beauty in one form or another. Sticking to his ideal of only putting the camera where best to view any given scene from, there is no visual baggage or fancy editing at work, simply old-fashioned, straightforward, immersive storytelling. By shooting from a detached point of view - many scenes looking down on action in the streets below, or through cracks in blasted windows and roofs - you not only get a sense of being a spectator to the events, but feel Szpilman's interaction or lack of in those events. This, along with the editing, gives the film a good sense of pace. The first hour goes by quite quickly, filled with anecdotal and historical information, as events in Warsaw go from bad to worse in a matter of days. Then as Szpilman becomes more alone, time begins to drag on, filling the emptiness of loneliness with readiness to move and hide if trouble comes calling. And then finally, the end is insight - the Russians are coming to free Warsaw from the Nazis - and you know it is just a matter of time until that release comes and normality returns. This is truly the work of an auteur, and it is testament to all involved that a film running at two and a half hours feels as though it could have been longer and you would not have minded.All the actors acquit themselves well, but this is Adrien Brody's film. Delivering on the promise he showed in smaller roles in The Thin Red Line and then Summer of Sam, Brody does a wonderful job with Szpilman, conveying a range of emotions simply with his eyes. Special mention should also go to Emilia Fox stepping up from British TV and making a good job of it and Thomas Kretschmann, who, after all the horror of the film, makes a genuinely touching and human Nazi. His scenes with Brody are among the most affecting, though they share very sparse dialogue, conveying everything through silent actions. Top prize has to go to Kretschmann's face as Szpilman plays the Piano for the first time in nearly four years, followed by Brody's weeping relief, not only at having his life spared but at being able to play, for what he must have thought was for the last time in his life.That Brody and Polanski won major awards for their work on this is highly deserved.

363,mihkelm1,wrenching,6,3 August 2012,"The Pianist is not a very spectacular movie. It is on a harrowing subject - the Holocaust - but lacks the depth, that makes you want to watch it further. The characters are not very developed. They just flash by one after another. On the other hand, this movie is based on a life of a real person. What the film does make clear, is the miracle of how The Pianist survived against all odds. That is the one positive aspect of this movie. Other than that it is unlikely to be much of an experience, it probably scares faint-hearted people and likely isn't meant to be watched under 21. The movie depicts cruelty and hunger, but that's pretty much it. What it doesn't reflect, is how unnatural all of it is. It all seems too usual.In a sense the film is realistic: shows death just picking people one after another.",The Pianist

365,colebt33-780-179547,"The best of it's kind, and the best of Roman Polanski",9,25 September 2010,"They say that the best story you can tell is a true story, and considering World War 2 is one of the greatest historic devastations of man kind, you can understand why there have been so many instalments about this tragic, dark time in human society. Until now, I always thought 'Schindler's List' (by Steven Spielberg) to be the best of the WWII films, but then I came across 'The Pianist', directed by the highly acclaimed Roman Polanksi. The creator of 'Chinatown' and 'Rosemary's Baby' has truly out done himself with this incredibly powerful, visually compelling piece about the Jewish ghetto in Warshaw.The Pianist follows the story of piano player Wlad Spielzman and his constant struggle for survival in the German occupied city of Warshaw, which I have already mentioned. What started out as few new rules (the wearing of arm bands, the saluting of passing German officers on the sidewalk), became a vast series of evacuation orders, transporting, herding, and holding Jewish people as if they were animals. After managing to escape the latest ship out, Spielzman flees to the dead, empty roads and streets of Warshaw, living off only the kindness of strangers.One of the great things about this movie is that the main lead is neither a hero, or a blood thirsty rebel our for revenge, he's an ordinary man who's just trying to stay alive. This I think allows the viewers to really relate to him in some way, making them really care about what happens to him as he wanders the streets of Warshaw desperately look for means of support, food and shelter. It also adds a sense of realism, because when I think about it, if I was in that same position, which I'm very thankful that I wasn't, I wouldn't speak out, or stand up against those who clearly have the power over my life. I would remain silent and still, because under these conditions, being brave is just another word for being stupid.Adrien Brody's portrayal of a man who had his freedom, his livelihood, almost his whole life stolen away from him is so heart- breaking to watch, I'm very glad that he received an Academy Award for that performance (I was a little surprised when I found out that Adrien was the youngest person ever to receive an Academy Award, I mean 27 isn't that young is it?) Roman Polanksi's images of war do not focus as much on the spilling of blood as you may see in other modern war movies, however there were a few scenes of grittiness that added some dramatic effect. I personally enjoyed the pointless shooting of Jewish randoms, where they line up every marching Jew and take a bullet to the heads of a selection of those unlucky bunch. Steven Spielberg showed the same thing in ""Schindler's List"" and it had a considerably powerful essence to it. But back to my earlier point. ""The Pianist"" does not focus on bloody, visually enhanced images of war, but rather on the depriving treatment of the Jewish community. The insulting of not being able to sit on public benches, the demeaning humiliation forced by German soldiers for amusement, all add to the heartbreaking sense of helplessness which also creates more dramatic effect.One of my most favourite parts of the movie is the end, or close to it anyway. The scene when the German soldier finds Spielzman in an abandoned house trying to open a can of pickles. After explaining his story and finding out that he is a pianist the soldier asks him to play something, just at top of his head. After a considerably long silence and a beautiful piano solo, the soldier spares his life and hides him in the attic, secretly supplying bread and jam to him. The most enjoyable thing about this scene is that it really reflects the symbolism of the pianist's extraordinary musical gift, because in a dark time such as this, music is the only pure thing that still remains, and in the end it is the thing that saves the pianist's life.This is arguably the greatest of the WWII films. It's intelligent direction and efficiently powerful images are very hard to match and Adrien Brody made history with his wonderful portrayal of the deeply effecting piano player, Wlad Spielzman.",The Pianist

369,Don Stephens,Intelligent and Powerful,10,1 February 2003,"""The Pianist"" is the kind of assured, confident movie that only an older director can make.  Sure, directors like Wes Anderson and Quentin Tarantino have exhibited prowess beyond their relatively young years, but the allure of a seasoned professional is unmistakable and inimitable.  He knows you'll be impressed through sheer storytelling magic, and won't jump through hoops to get the audience from point A to point B.I have read Michael Medved's deliriously inane comments on film and film criticism, and he wrote Roman Polanski's best work since ""Chinatown"" off as simply a ""Holocaust drama.""  I disagree.  Yes, the main character is Jewish in the nineteen thirties and forties, and the Holocaust is used as a backdrop, but this is a simple story of survival.  Ronald Harwood's screenplay does not go into tons of exposition about who the Nazis are or what they're doing there, and doesn't use insulting little title cards to sum up the situation at the beginning of the film.  It respects the audience's intelligence.  We know what the Nazis did, and it doesn't labor the point.  Polanski is gentle, yet masterful, letting the story flow instead of yanking it one way or the other.  It uses a minimum of dialogue, and doesn't try to convince us of what is wrong or right.  It expects us to know better, and therefore doesn't enforce a kind of ham-handed moral high ground that would be easy to trip over in a film like this.  It accepts everyone involved as human beings instead of faceless and soulless killing machines in gray.The centerpiece of the film is Adrian Brody's performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman, the Polish piano player who watched his family get packed on a train heading to a concentration camp.  With Polanski's spare direction and Harwood's lack of dialogue, Brody is the only thing to focus on.  One should not underestimate how daunting of a challenge this really is.  Actors have broken under lesser pressure, and something like this requires whoever plays the part to immerse himself wholly in the role; to become the character instead of looking like an actor going through the motions.  Brody more than rises to the challenge.  The soldier from Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" and the punker from Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" vanish.  Brody is Szpilman, it's as simple as that.  The feat is superhuman.""The Pianist"" is everything a great movie should be.  The direction, writing, acting, and everything else are exemplary.  All so much so that they become invisible.**** out of 4",The Pianist

However, Brody fails to give his character real emotional depth and the story fails to deliver any real insight into the mind of the pianist Szpilman.

It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off. It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away. (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest 'safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head. Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won!

I KNEW it would be tough to watch.  I've seen what I consider to be the epitome of World War II films, 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Schindler's List', and I've had enough.  The movies today pull no punches. Blood, death, war, cruelty.  It's why war is hell. Today's filmmakers can be as graphic and real as they wish.  And I suppose that's the problem I have. It's all so real, it hurts.  One-third of the way through, I considered getting up and leaving.  But like a rubbernecker, I stayed to see the rest of the carnage, and hopefully a glimmer of humanity.I'm glad I stayed.  After behaving fairly 'normally' in the beginning, Adrien Brody as Szpilman gets to act his way to his Oscar nomination.  The camera is rarely off him; the movie must live or die with Brody's ability to move us.  By the end, you see the work that went into the part, the gauntness, the hunger, the pain.  After seeing the other films nominated with the 'Best Actor' category, I believe Brody deserves the Oscar.  It will probably be the role of his life.What I liked best was the 'tunnelvision'.  We could often only see what Szpilman saw, like out of a small window, as if the rest of the world were this vast unknown.  All we knew what was in front of us-- death and more death.  All we knew was what Szpilman appeared to feel-- ""Stay alive"".  He does, by luck and opportunities taken.  Szpilman is not a hero, nor is he portrayed as one.  His is but one story of the very few that survived the Warsaw Ghetto and the Holocaust. There are others, but what sets Szpilman's apart is his fame and notoriety as a pianist, and the amazing 'good fortune' that allowed him to live past the war.Although I have seen enough movies involving the Holocaust, I felt more informed as to what the Warsaw Ghetto must have been like, day after day; its oppressiveness, its shrinking, its decay.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 only because of the plethora of scenes of Nazi and wartime cruelty.  Yes, I know that's how it was, and they were only being accurate. It's merely a reaction on my part to having seen ENOUGH of this horror.  Otherwise it would have been 8 out of 10.Kudos to Roman Polanski for bringing his vision to the film.  His childhood wartime memories obviously helped to shape 'The Pianist'.  It is powerfully directed, and the best work Polanski has done in many years.  Although he has tough competition, I can totally see him winning the Best Director Oscar (although not being there to receive it, of course).

I have not become immune to the subject and frankly, Polanski does start to touch on the horror and the random acts of inhumanity. However, the pianist character left me cold. A man who is almost completely devoid of any character. Neither a hero or a villain, but just a dull, cold fish. He barely shows fear and certainly aside from two moments when he looks upset (family taken off and little boy beaten to death) is robotic. I saw no Oscar performance here, found the constant leaping from subject to subject disorienting and had no time to really get to know anyone in the story but the robot.

Why are some capable of such monstrous inhumanity while others behave with unbelievable selflessness to total strangers in need?The few reviewers who thought this film lacked action and was boring, can I respectfully suggest they stick to less demanding fare in which no thought process is required at all.For others who have not yet seen this film - please do so - but be prepared to be very moved by it.Adrien Brody will surely never surpass his brilliant performance in the role of Wladyslaw Szpilman. Roman Polanski has made the movie of his career. 10/10",The Pianist
408,Close_The_Door,I'm physically upset,9,25 January 2006,"I knew Roman Polanski's talent but was not prepared to this descent to Hell, described in painstaking detail. I'm physically upset after watching this film. The sense of disgust is real. How awful. How awful.I could not help identifying myself with the Jewish Poles in Varsovia. I couldn't help thinking that the paralytic old man thrown down the window could be my grandfather. Couldn't help thinking that the kid savagely pulled through the wall could be my brother. Couldn't help thinking that the girl asking the SS-guard the wrong question and being killed just for that, could be myself.The film describes beastly destruction of any dignity, and yet the struggle for surviving despite everything, even if rationally you realise that, perhaps, it would be even better to end it all at once. It describes the dishonesty of people profiting of this situation to make business out of your misery. It describes your need of believing the words of men NOT of their word, if they promise you life. And affection and courage surviving despite all this.This film could make a good pair with ""der Untergang"" with Bruno Ganz, which is also such a masterpiece that you may risk feeling sympathetic with the Nazi. Have you had this temptation? Watch ""The Pianist"".",The Pianist
409,isaacch-99917,Unforgettable...,10,9 July 2016,"The pianist was a classic , have-to-see movie. Its one of those movie that will go down in history. Its undoubtedly a touching movie for every being and very sad and tear jerking for some. Its based on a true story of a man trying to survive the holocaust and the general destruction in the ghetto of Warsaw during WWII. He used his music almost as a savior for himself. He was just a pianist. He didn't want any trouble. This film shows how a middle class , Jewish family turned into five individuals struggling to survive or escape the ghetto. It shows what a terrible time Jews had to go through , without showing the worst of it , by not showing any scenes of the concentration camps. This film educates us how the Jews did not only die during those times , but they were tortured and killed and intimidated publicly.This film expresses love, torture, tragedy, death, violence, ignorance, sympathy and much more. The magnificent acting in this film expresses all these factors brilliantly. many think this film is depressing , but all it is, is the ugly truth. People think this is depressing , but they haven't seen the worst of it.",The Pianist
410,RenoirSoda,Only wish for world peace,8,19 May 2020,"Piano music is a beautiful manifestation of human glory, and the war slaughter shows the darkness of human beings. The strong contrast between the two makes people feel absurd and ridiculous. In the movie, human glory finally survived the craziest dark period in human history, but in reality, how much human glory went out in the dark period. Human beings can create extremely beautiful things, and at the same time they can completely destroy them. As bright as the light is, as dark as the shadow underneath.",The Pianist
411,GranHotellover,The film serves a very simple purpose,7,6 May 2020,"The film serves a very simple purpose, to show you that if you were a Jew in occupied Poland, every day you were grasping for survival. That the Nazi's took away the dignity of people gradually and got more brazen with killing them as time went on. Because of this very simple narrative some have given the film 1 star which I think is unfair. I have watched some unwatchable films with shaky cam, poor acting, editing etc. This was a pretty decent production with some great Direction not a 1 star film.However I do have to wonder whether we have moved past this type of simple film. As someone interested in history I occasionally enjoy watching films around the war to see it from another perspective or to get further details that I did not know. The minute I saw Emila Fox's character look wide eyed and shocked at some restrictions, I looked up a timeline of antisemitism in Poland. Turns out like much of Europe antisemitism had been prominent in Poland way before the occupation. It can be dated back atleast a decade just from legal restrictions. From then on I doubted how much care had been put into accuracy. I am sure there is much to be learned from a first hand account that Wladyslaw Szpilman was able to provide in his autobiography but I can't help but think you would get more from reading his book in his words rather than this romanticised version.It does tell a very simple story of Nazis were bad, Jews were victims and people that helped the Jews were good. However I do believe that this film would be a good introduction for some people to see the war in a more personal , emotive way as I think over time the young have distanced themselves from the atrocities to the point they easily joke about it. I could picture older children watching clips of this film to facilitate their engagement with the subject matter.However for anyone interested in a beautifully shot epic, their are films on the war that are more visually interesting. For anyone who already knows details around the holocaust their are films that are more informative. Since the millennium I have seen a number of films that look at the war from less well known angles, they look at the Nanjing Massacre, Soviet atrocities while attention was on the Nazis and so on.",The Pianist
412,p-39630,a brief evaluation,8,23 May 2020,"Cruel war, turbulent world, the fate of the jews rise and fall, but the heavy war themes become unique because of the perspective of music and art.
Different from the general world war ii films, the film does not magnify the pain and feelings, but USES an unusual and true technique to find the most calm and emotion-free narrative technique to tell the story.
For example, when a Nazi officer suddenly picks out a group of jews to lie on the ground and put his hands on his head, the fate of the individual has long been fixed by the war, and the fear that greeted them is no longer from the unknown future, but from the known future.",The Pianist

414,puckbond007,The Pianist-7/10 is the powerful true story of holocaust survivor and talented piano player Wladislaw Szpilman...,8,14 March 2003,"Possible SpoilersThe Pianist is the powerful true story of holocaust survivor and talented piano player Wladislaw Szpilman, who escaped certain death in the extermination camps and outlasted the war hiding out from the Nazi's in Warsaw, Poland. A story that is obviously very personal to controversial filmmaker Roman Polanski and is handled with great thought and care. Adrien Brody is very good as the title character, a member of the upper-class living in Poland with his family which include his mother and father, his brother and two sisters. He makes a living and a name for himself playing the piano for a radio station until the beginning of World War II when Germany invaded Poland and stormed into its capital city. As a Jew, Wladislaw and his family are rounded up like dogs with some 500,000 other Polish Jews and ushered into a concentrated part of the city until they are sent off to ""labor"" camps. This film is about what people do to survive and what lengths people are willing to go to make sure of that survival. People are completely stripped of their dignity and pride and are forced to turn on each other. I thought the first hour of this film was great, with its often shocking brutality of the German's, the utter despair of the Jews and the togetherness of Szpilman's family. After he gets separated from his family(rather by a little luck I might add) and forced to survive on his own I felt the film lost a lot of where its heart lie. The rest of the film is Szpilman moving from hiding place to burnt out hiding place avoiding detection by the Nazi's and Non-Polish Jews always scrounging for food and water. It does become very redundant and tiresome and some could consider it boring. Even as his fellow Jews do try and fight back Szpilman still hides in the shadows. As somebody mentioned earlier it does come off as very cowardly and I have no problem in pointing that out. As I said this is a film about what people do to survive, but still Szpilman's unwillingness to take any real action makes us feel less sympathy for him...and this is a character that we should care about. Overall, The Pianist is a good film about Holocaust survivor Wladislaw Szpilman but not a great one. A good, thoughtful story by director Roman Polanski featuring a good performance by Adrien Brody but ultimately really doesn't deliver the power and lasting impression a story like this should.",The Pianist
415,etoukesteph,the sad sweetness of the sound of persecution.,7,3 July 2004,"More than a masterpiece on the poetry of wartime, Roman Polanski uses the eyes of an artist in his tribute to the suffering of Jews in Warsaw. Less concrete than that of a soldier, yet more resistant, the experience of Wvadyslav Szpilman expresses his negligence of the gravity of the wartime situation to an unfortunate sudden change of fate. Polanski's picture of WW2 Warsaw is a very deep one, revealing details which characterized the Jewish suffering with an outstanding touche of proximity; a fight over a pan of soup which ends with a man licking up spilt porridge on the ground, a woman gone mad after the disappearance of her husband, another one having herself caused her baby to suffocate as she tried to conceal its cries...This movie goes beyond the details of the ongoing of the war itself to reveal the sad and frustrating consequences on its victims. How can Wadek survive without his family, without food but even more with his ever growing urge to satisfy his wish to play a piano. He follows the sound of playing as often as he is lucky to. In this a perfect repertoire is mounted, involving Beethoven, Bach, etc.Wadek's pure and sympathetic nature seems to call for tolerance in wartime. Funny  and creative, he could eventually be considered a spectator to these events. One could attribute the luck he has and the intermittent support he receives to some providence. Yet the experience is real and his final contribution to building a new nation summarizes the lessons to be drawn.",The Pianist

After he gets bamboozled into writing(playing the piano) a movie for his friend, he is cast upon a ship writing(playing the piano) a movie as they approach the island(Germany) where they will shoot it. Naturally, he falls in love with the main woman in the movie who is also the main actor in the movie he is writing(playing the piano) a script for. When they get to the island(Germany), they are captured by the natives(Nazis) and the girl he falls in love with gets sacrificed to a gigantic gorilla(the German Army). For the rest of the movie, they run through the jungle(Germany) trying to find his girl that was taken by the gigantic gorilla(the German Army). Eventually, they manage to capture the giant gorilla(German Army) and take it back to New York(Poland) to show it to the people for money> Obviously, the gigantic gorilla(German Army) gets loose in New York(Poland).

421,modern_maiden,A powerful depiction of the unconquerable human spirit.,9,26 February 2003,"""The Pianist"" is the first film I've seen that comes close to depicting the utter destruction of war. The scenes of the aftermath of the bombings struck me particularly hard.  When you see those scenes, remember that the same destruction occurred accross most of central and eastern Europe, by Allied bombs as well as Axis. Few cities were left unscathed, yet they all rebuilt themselves, brick by brick, a testament to the power of the human spirit.The first half of the film was so full of horrible acts of cruelty, that I began to wonder if I really needed to see all this. Polanksi more than succeeded in making a statement about the horrors of war and genocide. It's not a film for the feint of heart. The second half of the film, though showing the terrible ravages and suffering of the survivors of war, also revealed the hope and determination, the resiliency of human beings and their desire to survive.The acting and directing was superb. Every action was meaningful and powerful, the cinematography breathtaking. Adrien Brody was impressive. The music and piano-playing scenes were so beautiful that I could forgive the fact that it was unlikely that a perfectly tuned piano would be found in a bombed-out building in sub-zero weather.
My only other criticism would be that I feel Polanski was a bit too obvious with the good vs. evil characterizations. For example, the evil Germans were all scowling and ugly, except for the lone friendly officer, who was handsome. The same stereotypes apply to the protagonists: heroic underground rebel Jews were either handsome or jovial, and the gentiles who helped them were beautiful and fair-haired and looked like angels. Maybe it was symbolism, but it seemed a little too simplistic to me.However, that's a small complaint, because overall the whole film was incredible, both technically and emotionally. It's great to see a war film that is not from a military point of view. Oscar, Oscar, Oscar!",The Pianist

424,chris12345678,Most personal movie for Roman Polanski,9,23 August 2020,"This is the most insightful movie about WWII ever made. Germany, led by a demon-possessed madman Hitler and terrorized into submission by his minions, against better judgement of most of its military commanders started a war in Europe believing it could lash back against the Versailles treaty. Poland led by the worst politicians one could wish upon a country was the first victim. Polanski and Szpilman, a promising pianist, on whose story the movie is based (but some of the scenes come from Polanski's own past), weave a tale of survival in the madness that follow. Poland was mercilessly bombed by Nazi Germany and then invaded from the East by Soviets. It was occupied until the end of the war and since it was home to most of Europe's Jewish population it was picked by Nazi leaders to be the graveyard of Jews. Scenes from the Warsaw ghetto leading up to the transportation are a mix of Szpilman's and Polanski's experiences. After that it's mostly Szpilman. He was holed up in an abandoned apartment on the Aryan side of Warsaw just by the Jewish ghetto wall by members of Polish resistance (the largest resistance force in Europe counting over 1000,000 members, contrary to the lies spread by Hollywood who want it to be the French resistance which was a joke compared to Poland's) and he witnessed both the ghetto uprising of 1943 on the other side of the wall (watch the scene with the cannon) and then the Polish Warsaw uprising of 1944 which was a festival of bloodshed that cost the lives of 200,000 Poles.The blowing up of the military hospital with a panzerschreck and the destruction of the tank, and everything else belong to that bloody event. Without spoiling, what happens next, is the most human side of WWII ever put on screen. Spielberg, watch and learn. The drama of so many good human being caught up in all this madness. God bless you Roman Polanski for this movie, God didn't save you for nothing. God have mercy on all good people who perished during this madness, whichever country they may hail from. Never again.

426,tarantino_feet_pics,Thoughts on The Pianist,7,28 May 2020,"The Pianist is the story of one Polish Jew's struggle for survival in the Jewish Ghetto during the Holocaust. Based on the real life autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman and directed by Roman Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself, is a triumph of the human spirit and a tribute to survival.The horrors of the second world war are realities seared into the public's consciousness and go without saying but seldom is there a film that depicts a slowly developing society under Nazi occupation. Starting with Jews only being able to have a certain amount of money in their possession, having to wear the star of David in public then to being forced into a ghetto, their own micro-society and eventually progressing to the wholesale extermination of a race. The pianist paints this continued degradation of the Jewish people in great detail, giving each new development room to breathe and be fully explored.The pianist is raw, detailed, emotional and surprisingly non-dramatized. Perhaps the films biggest asset is it's honesty. In most world war 2 or holocaust films often is the antagonist characterized as a courageous man. The antagonist survives by way of his skill, fearlessness and bravery, he outwits and bests his Nazi occupiers. Instead Wladyslaw Szpilman is fearful, nonplussed and weak. A man of tremendous will sure, but he survives as a result of luck and the humanity of others.As a survivor himself, none other than Roman Polanski could depict the holocaust so accurately. Brilliantly he conveys a sense of helplessness. Suddenly you are a passenger in your own life, unable to steer the course, you are at the whim of your environment, an environment that tries it's damnedest to crush you.A powerful and important film to be saved forever in the annals of film history and it will be remembered as such.

I have rarely been so taken into a movie, its atmosphere, its reality, as I was in this one.  It also brought to life a portion of history with which I thought I was familiar but whose horrors and day-to-day miseries have never been portrayed quite so clearly.  I was very glad the film was in color, as opposed to black and white, for the simple fact that I wanted to see what the people were going through as if I were seeing it myself.  I like black-and-white for artistic reasons, but color was a good choice for realism.  Adrien Brody's performance was very touching and real.  You could almost feel his fear, his suffering, and his physical pain, mainly from hunger.This is one of those movies that made me think about how blessed I am and how blessed I have been in my life because I have never had to experience anything nearly as hellish as the life that was portrayed in this movie. I can only imagine the feeling of desperation these people must have had day after day.  The brutality and sheer insanity of war was once again quite vividly portrayed; everyone should pay attention and learn what beasts human beings can really be.There is a line in the movie that was very understated and not particularly necessary to the plot, but the scene where Szpilman tells his sister that he just wished he could have gotten to know here better and she simply replies `Thank You' with such emotion in her voice, brought tears to my eyes.Very rewarding and a must see.

There are but very few movies which have been able to depict the atrocities faced by the Jewish community under the Nazi rule with a realistic portrayal of those times. ""The Pianist"" is certainly one among those. Even though this movie focuses on Szpilman's evasion from a otherwise certain holocaust with some luck and good helpful acquaintances, it skillfully shows some of the most moving scenes depicting human hunger, helplessness and hardships faced by the Polish Jews.
The acting performance is top-notch by the cast, especially Adrien Brody as Szpilman.

440,wonderfulfable,Brilliant and yet sad......,10,22 March 2003,"I went see The Pianist tonight feeling a bit curious and expecting the usual Saving Private Ryan spread. Man, I was wrong. This Roman Polanski directed film effectively conveys the horrors of The Holocaust that the Polish Jews have to endure during the German Occupation in Warsaw, Poland WW2. Jews; young and old, are shot for no reason, abused, and ridiculed. Caught in the middle of this nightmare was Wladyslaw Szpilman (brilliantly potrayed by Adrian Brody) a young and talented pianist and his Jewish family. They, like other Jews, were forced into small ghettoes and are sealed off from other parts of the city. There, they live their lives in poverty, waiting to be deported to concentration camps. In a heart wrenching scene, he was separated from his family and was forced to survive on his own in the ghettoes of Warsaw. From that point of the movie, it started to run a little slow. Even so, Adrian's performance shows him constantly hiding in the shadows, waiting, watching, fearing whether the next day would be his last. He doesn't talk much in this part of the film but the facial expression and body language tells it all. The other actors that supported Szpilman like his family also convey the sense of looming fear and dread that is also present in the other Jews in the film. This really and I mean realistically, gives us the impression that the Holocaust is much more than just the slaughtering of 3 million Jews (FACT;from the start and end of WW2).Some points of the movie are interspersed with haunting piano solos. Being a music appreciator especially piano acoustics, the music from the film further conveys the suffering endured by our pianist. There is one piano solo that still resonates in my eardrums, but you will have to find out for yourselves.Roman Polanski's beautiful cinematics truly captures the emotions and horrors of the war. A noted scene would be when Szpilman walks through the battered city ruins of Warsaw, a look at this scene reminds me of the blown buildings of Hiroshima after the first A-Bomb was dropped.One of the best films of the year, its going to be in my DVD collection later this year. Its a shame if the Academy does not recognize the talents of Adrian Brody and instead giving it to others like Daniel Day Lewis for Gangs of New York. Still, its very tacky to give it to actors who potray psychopaths. 9/10",The Pianist
441,zmarc,Is it possible to make a bad Holocaust film?,10,28 January 2003,"Is it possible to make a bad Holocaust film? With such drama and history, it seems difficult. This one is certainly moving, and even shocking: you'd think we'd have seen everything by now, but some of what the Nazi's did is beyond comprehension. The story is the true story of Szpilman, Poland's greatest pianist. The Germans take over Poland, put him and his family into the newly established ""Jewish Sector,"" and eventually kill his family. It's a miracle he survived. What I liked about this film is the way it's so understated. Our protagonist isn't a hero: he just a guy. I compare him to a rat. I don't mean that in a negative sense, just that he's a rat scrounging for survival, and every time you think he's down, up he pops again. But it's not really a survival story either: mostly the guy survives via luck and friends. He doesn't particularly want to survive in some ways, he just does. It's like he's so overwhelmed by his circumstance he doesn't know how to do anything else. Adrian Brody gives a terrific performance as Szpilman, especially toward the end when things get desperate. Polanski is smart in his handling of the film: he just gets out of the way and lets the story tell itself. I didn't notice one superfluous camera movement or transition: you just forget you're watching a film and get wrapped up in the time period. It is a long film (over 2.5 hours) but every frame is important. One intriguing aspect that I felt was brilliant in retrospect (a bit of spoiler here) is that we don't get to really see Szpilman play the piano until late in the film. Sure there's a brief scene at the beginning, and a couple in the middle, but he's not really playing. That's wonderful, because part of Szpilman's pain is that throughout the war he has no piano to play, and we, the audience, glimpse that pain through the subtle absence of his playing during most of the film. When he does play at the end, it's a catharsis for both of us -- we've both been aching for that moment. We're overjoyed at his joy at being able to play again. Superb. All that said, where does this film rank in cinema history? That's difficult to say: it's tough to criticize a Holocaust film without coming across as a brute. This is an excellent film, and I liked that it tells a different story of the war and shows us new images and a new perspective, but ultimately it can't escape what it is: a Holocaust film. That tag carries a lot of baggage, and frankly, once you've seen once Holocaust film you've seen portion of all others. There's some new material here but it's definitely not as original as Life is Beautiful, a film I liked far more simply because it dared to be daring (a comedy about the Holocaust). This is a great film in the sense that it's well-done, emotionally moving, and has historical significance, but while I wouldn't have a problem watching Life is Beautiful over and over again, I can't say the same thing about The Pianist. I'm very glad I saw it, and I might watch it again on DVD, but like Schindler's List this is not a movie you want to watch over and over again. That diminishes it slightly in my book (for instance, it wouldn't be in my top ten favorite films).",The Pianist
442,waltergl,"Out of a horrific time, a beautiful work of art",9,21 March 2003,"Roman Polanski's The Pianist is without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made about the Holocaust, and easily one of the top five films of the year. The story is essentially Adrien Brody's quiet, good-natured classical pianist struggling to survive the horrors of the Holocaust. We watch him and his loving family as their hopes for liberation are slowly crushed, and, in an extraordinarily moving sequence, how he is separated from them, their fate left a mystery to him for several years. The rest of the film concerns Brody alternating between hiding and running from the Germans, witnessing pieces of the war, glimpsing and, to an extent, collaborating with the Jewish rebellion in Warsaw. It is a quiet, slow-paced film, often musicless but occassionally accompanied by beautiful classical pieces. Polanski's direction is subtle, disciplined, and impeccably well-timed. Brody's performance is also subtle, and he says very little, but compare his demeanor and facial expressions at the end of the film to how he looks at the beginning, and you see a profound change. Brody strikes all the right notes for this part, delivering a quiet performance of resounding power.As far as the subject matter, you need to look to Polanski himself to truly understand why this film is significant. There have been several films made about this subject, most notably Spielberg's brilliant Schindler's List, but none quite capture the same tone that this film does. Polanski was himself a Holocaust survivor who survived not unlike Brody's Szpilman. He was not heroic, he did not defy the Nazi regime as Oskar Schindler did, but he hid, viewing the horror from an objective distance and avoiding it at all costs. Spielberg put us in the thick of the horror; Jews were shot and killed right before our eyes, the blood splattered in front of the camera. With Polanski's film we watch the horror unfold at a distance, from fourth story-windows we see tiny Nazi soldiers shooting tiny Jews in the street. There is a realism and urgency to what we are watching because we are seeing it as Polanski and Szpilman did, and we wonder if perhaps one of those soldiers may look up and see us. The Holocaust was a horrible event most of all, Polanski reminds us, because heroism could not save the majority of Jews. Szpilman could not confront the Nazis head on, or he certainly would have died. Instead he hides in corners, watching and recording the events of a dark time in the world's history. The ultimate catharsis, for Polanski and for the late Szpilman, comes in the final scene, when the pain and suffering of the Holocaust is transformed into beautiful art, and Polanski places us in the audience, close enough to be touched but far enough away to feel as if we're really sitting in the same room. Playing piano was Szpilman's catharsis; filmmaking is Polanski's. The Pianist may not be Polanski's ""best"" film, but by watching it we see a glimpse of his soul, letting go of the demons left by the Holocaust.",The Pianist
443,Krome,A mirror to our own conscience,8,8 August 2003,"Generally, I skim through the user comments on IMDB taking great pleasure in seeing what others have to say about the film I've just seen. Today, though, I feel astonished and disappointed by some of the things I've read.
The holocaust occurred for many reasons; social, economic and political. However, what fuelled it was a colossal failure of the basic human qualities of compassion, empathy and understanding. It's a nauseating paradox, repeated throughout human history, that when people are regarded as fit only for slavery and destruction it is their persecutors who are made truly subhuman by their actions.I'm not attempting to label the authors of some of the posts here as Nazis or fascists but I am deeply concerned that a film dealing with this issue can provoke such truly thoughtless comments. Of course, it's possible to accuse The Pianist of failing in its ambitions if it cannot convey to every viewer at least a fleeting sympathy with the characters. Perhaps, though, it succeeds by highlighting the lack of comprehension that makes obscenities like the Holocaust possible even today.Maybe some people viewed the film as simply entertainment, in which case I can see why the plot or characterisation might not be to their liking. The Nazis just keep on behaving like thugs, the Jews sit there and take it and the central character doesn't finally go on a revenge killing-spree, liberating Warsaw single-handed. And getting the girl, of course. If you want formulaic movies with sympathetic heroes and a nice, untaxing storyline there are plenty to choose from. I just don't see how anyone could watch this film without understanding that it's about as close to the truth as it could be without passing into the realm of dramatised documentary. Yes, it is based on a true story and sorry - real life has a habit of occasionally deviating from the popcorn norm.So, sorry to pick on the following. Genuinely, it's not personal - your comments are simply the most recent.musidora - If you found it hard to relate to the selfishness of Szpilman perhaps you might consider that many, many Holocaust survivors report an ineradicable guilt, even in the face of all they endured, because they owed their own survival to putting themselves first. For example theft of food in concentration camps was common. What do you think you would do in the same situation if the price of your life, or your child's, were a crust of stolen bread?kylan-1 - You wrote: `He just stands there with a dumb look on his face and fumbles around'   `So whats the big survival story here?'
Seriously, if you were malnourished, cold and being used for slave labour do you think you'd be feeling chipper enough to be a modern-day Spartacus?jmrex - You wrote: `How can anybody enjoy watching a chronicle of how lacking in spirit these people were? It sickens me.'It really is hard to understand how a whole people can sometimes kneel before its oppressor, seemingly without putting up a fight. How can people be so passive in such extreme circumstances? How can they just stand by while their neighbour is murdered and quietly wait their turn? Well, the same thing happens every time the human race decides to turn on itself. From Poland to Cambodia to Rwanda you can see it repeated. Plainly, it's something that happens when a society is reduced to its component individuals and the moment of rebellion seems to each an impossibility. If anything is sickening here, it's your comment, jmrex. If you truly find the concept of human despair something inferior to you in some way then let's put another point on the scoreboard for the Nazis. If all you want to do is simply enjoy a film and leave it feeling better than when you entered the cinema then look for something different next time. The audience leaving the screening I saw were subdued and said their goodbyes to one another with choked voices. That doesn't make any of them better people than you but I think it shows a maturity that you haven't yet reached. I wish you well on your journey there - you'll find the view much better.
Bhagwan Thadani  - You wrote: `The entire movie was so ""outre"" that I actually laughed when a German officer pulled out his Luger and shot a Jewess to death for asking ""Where are we going?"" How ridiculous can this myth of the Jew suffering at the hands of persecutors become?'
Please tell me you're not serious. That you know this really went on. I simply cannot understand how anyone with even a passing knowledge of the Holocaust could really think this an exaggeration or regard it as a `myth.' Perhaps you should find the time to talk to some of the people whose families were reduced to a handful of individuals or even just a sole survivor. Maybe if you heard from someone who was there, still carrying the tattoo on their arm used to mark them like cattle, how their mothers, fathers, siblings and children were murdered you might begin to understand how woundingly misinformed you are. The Jews, gypsies, gays, dissidents and other victims of the Nazis were slaughtered both systematically and capriciously. If your life is worthless to someone with power over you then it is a matter of no consequence all to them to end it for the slightest reason.While blindness to the suffering of others, whoever and wherever they may be, remains a part of the human condition the subjects of movies like The Pianist will be not only moving but a salutary warning. It could happen to any of us unless we appreciate the lessons history offers.",The Pianist
444,Krome,Redemption through music,8,7 October 2003,"I've just watched The Pianist for the second time and once again feel utterly compelled to comment here. The first time I saw this film, my mind was filled with the horror of the story - and my alarm at some of the fairly unpalatable comments others had posted.This time too, I find myself almost overcome with emotion but now because of the music, which somehow seemed incidental to me before. The scene where a ravaged Szpilman plays Chopin (Ballad No. 1 in G Minor, Op. 23) for the German officer left me shattered. The beauty and sheer elegance of the piece simply annihilates darkness for as long as it lasts and its memory provides a benchmark for the human spirit when the last note has faded. Even in the midst of the incomprehensible darkness of the Holocaust there was still light, even if it was only able to shine in the hearts of people able to remember its warmth.I consider myself an informed music lover but I believe this is the first time in my life I've ever truly understood its deepest beauty. For me this confirms The Pianist as a truly great film. It's certainly not unflawed but if a definition of Art is that which provokes genuine realisation in its audience then Polanski has here become an artist.",The Pianist
445,fadedGlory,"Powerful, moving, - but who is Szpilman?",8,5 February 2005,"I won't repeat what so many others have already said. Yes, this is undoubtedly a moving, shocking and powerful movie of what happened to the Warsaw Jews during World War 2 - a great film by Polanski.I watched it the other day and something kept nagging at me. Szpilman, the pianist protagonist, reminded me of another film character but I couldn't place him. Then the penny dropped: Szpilman is another Dr. Zhivago.Both character are essentially outsiders to what happens around them, the momentous events of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath, the Warsaw ghetto and the Holocaust. Both are introvert artists who live in a world of their own, relating to most people and events around them in barely more than a superficial, disconnected way. They only make the weakest of efforts to get involved in, and influence, the turmoil of their time. Szpilman appears to be even more of a loner than Zhivago, who at least had the ability to fall in love with Lara. The Pianist is a single man who devotes his life to nothing but his music. His last words to his sister are significant: ""I regret not knowing you better."" Then, as he escapes destruction through no heroic action of his own, he becomes a total outsider to the violent events of the Ghetto uprising and the final battle for Warsaw. He watches the horrors from the windows in his hideouts, silent, barely reacting. He only comes briefly alive when he finds himself alone with a piano, which he can't play for fear of being discovered - but he plays it anyway, fingers in the air over the keys, hearing the music without making a sound.When he has almost reached the end of his strength, barely surviving thirst, hunger and exhaustion, he is saved by a humane German soldier who makes him play the piano. As he does so, you see him coming alive through the powerful effect the music has on him. It almost seems as if through all his preceding suffering he has missed his music more than his family and friends who have all been wiped out by the Nazis. This scene now reminds me so much of Zhivago who sits alone in the depth of winter, in his remote house on the steppe, writing poems as this only means of survival.Eventually, Szpilman is saved by the tides of war, and we see him at the conclusion of the film playing the piano for a large audience in a grand concert hall. Yes, he made it through the Holocaust, and his artistic strength hasn't left him - but what has happened to his humanity after having witnessed so much brutality and suffering? Who is this man who can still find beauty in music? How does he deal with the loss of his entire family and those who helped him survive? We never get an answer to that. And don't get me wrong - it is through no fault of Adrien Brody who fully deserves his Oscar. No, the answer lies in the character of Szpilman himself, someone who, like Zhivago before him, survives the madness of the world by fleeing in himself. In doing so he makes it impossible for us to know him, or even really care. And that may be the weakest element of this otherwise great movie.",The Pianist
446,majaho21,Masterpiece with the director's personal touch,10,3 March 2017,"Roman Polanski's The Pianist"" is a film that will either haunt you, make you feel sad, angry, overwhelmed, deeply touched or disturbed, but it will definitely not leave you feeling indifferent. It will play with your emotions and it will smartly and slowly pull you into the ruins of the 1940's Warsaw, Poland. Although it touches the global theme of the Holokaust, it actually tells a story of an individual, named Vladislaw Szpilman. The director brilliantly displayed simple scenes in front of the viewers. He showed everyday situations and the acts of torture one after another and gradually exhibited the true nature of merciless and cruel Nazis. Once the story has finished, the viewers are left with a magnificent portrayal of the most brutal, darkest and deranged era in human history. And all that through the point of view of the leading character.*Spoilers* When Poland was invaded by the Nazi Germany in 1939, Szpilman's family knew that there would be some trouble and they could sense danger. However, nothing could prepare them for the events that were about to happen. Nazi soldiers striped the once-prosperous and affluent Jewish population of their properties, homes, money, jobs and finally, they destroyed and took their lives. As Rose said for Jack Dawson in Titanic: He saved me in every way a person can be saved.; something in that style, but with the totally opposite meaning, could be said for the Nazis: They destroyed them in every way people can be destroyed.The Nazis not only took their lives, but also, before the killings, mocked at everything that meant something to them. Jews were forced to wear David's stars so that they could be recognized at any point. They were not allowed to gather at public places, to go to cafe bars, to walk on sidewalks... Many of them were annihilated just because they were picked on, for no real reason. Adrien Brody's acting was superb. He walked through the city streets, witnessed horror, executions, starved children and dying old people, and there was nothing he could do. He just walked, day after day, hoping that we would survive for one more day. And he did survive, but not because he did something extraordinary. He was just lucky and he managed to find himself at a right place at a right time. Brody showed his gradual physical and physical decline: he lost weight, he was barely possible to run away and hide, he got ill and was very close to death. He transformed from an elegant and sleek piano player into a human wreckage. He was full of life while courting a young music player at the beginning of the film and later, he became a lost, hungry, desperate griever who lost his entire family. He was a walking skeleton looking for shelter where he would wither in peace - survival was just a dream in the end. The wonderful flow of events and gradation at its best, once again! A turning point in the film happens when Szpilman was hiding in an abandoned villa. He was looking for a can opener when he was approached by a German officer. To our and Szpilman's surprise, the officer showed understanding, compassion and his love for music! This wonderfully-played character made a point: that humanity lives within human beings regardless of their nationality and position. The relationship between these two men should be a guide to all human relationships. The officer Hosenfeld was not compassionate because he wanted something in return (although he needed Szpilman's help later in the film) but he was moral, just and humanity was part of him. If I had to describe this film in only one word, it would be ""masterpiece'!!!!",The Pianist
447,paul_imseih,Bland and Obscene,1,8 February 2003,"So this film has won the Palme D'Or? I didn't see any reason why...The film is well executed in its use of the usual Hollywood visual clichés, rendered in a more ""European"" style. A fusion of the worst of Hollywood and the worst of Europe. The result unfortunately is even less than the sum of its parts. I am extremely concerned by the lack of any real ideas beneath the thin veneer of story. I felt that the film rubbed my nose in one awful even after the other while presenting only caricatures (or often no characterisation at all) of the participants and victims - especially the German characters. So we have caricatures versus caricatures, without a caricaturist's sense of humour or insight.I found these caricatures quite obscene - they obscured the fact that the Germans who committed such atrocities were ordinary men and women - not merely evil-laughing ""monsters"". That European Jews who survived this period went on to murder and torture Palestinians and reproduce the exact same ghettos imposed on them for every year since 1945 is testament to that. I wonder if I'd win the Palme D'Or by switching the roles and making a film about the Israeli organised Chatila massacres or atrocities by the Israeli Army in the West Bank? The result is that the real power of the film was completely lost in the process of presenting the facts of Szpilman's experience of that period. I found no insights in this movie - either into art/music nor the Holocaust, and certainly nothing about Szpilman. Is it true to fact in its unrelenting depiction of atrocities committed? I didn't care anymore after 30 minutes. I am no historical revisionist so after the 4th violent atrocity in the first section, not only these acts, but the whole film became silly and patronising. A far more unsettling and profound film about evil, art, personal responsibility and racism from this period is definitely István Szabó's ""Taking Sides"". It leaves Polanski's film far behind in every filmic and intellectual aspect.The Holocaust compels us to think and act, even if entirely beyond comprehension.

Admittedly, reading the book makes it very dull to watch, but as I read the book after watching the movie, I was stunned, and even watching it again on DVD makes the reality of the book sink in. The soundtrack and the images give it a wonderfully haunting air that words can't possibly do.The Pianist is a movie about the Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman who finds himself and his family caught as Jews in World War Two. Although the whole war story is a bit clichéd (Anne Frank, La Vita e Bella etc.) I don't think I've ever seen a movie that captures world war two so perfectly. Once the Nazis have made a ghetto in Warsaw, Szpilman must fight to keep his family together at all costs, though after little more than a year has passed, his family are predictably taken away to a concentration camp, though Szpilman survives, being rescued by a Jewish policeman. After working in the ghetto dismantling the wall, Szpilman breaks free and begins his two year life in hiding while the city of Warsaw literally crumbles around him.I think that this movie is driven by the true horror of world war two for the Jewish people. As I said in the introduction, it is haunting and sticks around with you for a few weeks. Also, the movie starts out very scary, but rather than building up to a climactic end, it gradually gets less and less 'in your face' and shocking. As it is a Polanski film, there is a lot of gore in the beginning and the true horror of WW2 is at its highest.

This is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman (played by Adrien Brody), a brilliant, young, Jewish pianist living in Nazi-run Warsaw. Before the war, things get slowly more and more horrible for the Jews, eventually resulting in the setting up of the Death Camps and the beginnings of the Holocaust. Wladyslaw gets away from the Death Camps, ending up instead within a Nazi labour camp. With the help of old friends, he escapes from the camp and hides in the ruins of Warsaw, with the aid of a sympathetic German officer.This is possibly one of Polanski's most disturbing films, yet it has what many would regard as a 'happy ending', with Wladyslaw being rescued by Russian troops pushing the Germans out of Warsaw. The camera-work is particularly brilliant, alternating between light and dark, yet never with any cheerful vibes. The performances by Thomas Kretschman and Emilia Fox are very good, but as always in his movies it is Adrien Brody who steals the show.This is a bleak and bitter view of the holocaust through the eyes of one who escaped it, and the fact that it is a true story only adds to the power of the film.

Nevertheless, not all of the stories from this era translate very well into film and this is no exception. Polanski is so full on with the horrors that many of them fall into cliché and the result is that there is no emotional response left from the viewer for the rest of the film. For example, there's a woman who's had to kill her baby (how on Earth would they know?), there's a man who eagerly scoffs food of the filthy ground..and so on.. It seemed Polanski felt the need to cram in far too much. For heaven's sake he even crow-barred in Shylock's line from Merchant of Venice about being Jewish AND being human at the same time; how 'convenient' that the pianist's brother had the play on him! Nevertheless, there were some painfully wonderful moments such as when the pianist is in hiding in a room with a piano which he isn't allowed, for obvious reasons, to play. You have to see the moment to appreciate it. Unfortunately it is a moment which is all too rare. The part at the end, where he is made to play by a German officer would have been much more emotionally charged if we felt that this officer was a genuine threat. In summary, this film is too crammed with misdirected emotion to be as tear-jerking as Schindler's list.",The Pianist
456,Donolog,"Polanski delivers a personal masterpiece, and a masterpiece that is personal",8,26 May 2003,"Disclaimer: Considerable discussion of the plotThere are not many of us who could have our spouse and a number of personal friends visiting murdered by a group of cult members and it not be the biggest personal tragedy of our lives.Such was the case for Roman Polanski in 1969, when a group of those following cult-leader Charles Manson brutally murdered Polanski's wife Sharon Tate, who was eight months pregnant with the couple's first child, and a number of the couple's friends at Polanski's Hollywood home (Polanski was travelling at the time).As tragic, and horrific as this was, it followed an even more troubled childhood. Polanski, and his Jewish parents were living in Poland at the outbreak of World War II. He would ultimately separate from his parents as he escaped the Ghetto to seek refuge with Catholic families in the countryside. Meanwhile, his parents transferred to concentration camps where his mother would meet her death in a gas chamber.After a career of filmmaking that spans nearly fifty years, Polanski has arguably created his best work ever with The Pianist. The film, a true story, begins at the beginning of World War II as Germany has begun bombing Poland, and follows pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, and his quest to survive his persecution as a Jew under Nazi rule.The film follows as his rights are stripped away from him and his family. First the family loses its sense of security, then their possessions, then they're forced to move to a ghetto where they live in poverty and terror; ultimately his family and friends are shipped off to concentration camps where we all know they will meet their death. Szpilman however manages to find ways to avoid this, first by staying on to perform slave labour in the dismantling of the newly vacated ghetto, and later by going into hiding in the underground supported by a network of Polish nationals. There is nothing heroic about what he does, he just does what he can to survive, and every step of the way there are many who don't survive.Polanski's direction of the film is excellent, yet subtle to the end. Messages are not spoon fed to the audience. The pace is borderline slow, yet captivating nonetheless. Because Szpilman manages to escape before being sent to a concentration camp, the film ends up being less about the Holocaust, and more about what happened to its victims before the camps.The Pianist is the first of two films (The Quiet American being the second) I've seen recently that in their timeliness have added texture to how I view the World and how it deals with Iraq. Early in the film, Szpilman's family take consolation in the fact that Britain and France have declared war against Germany in response to its invasion of Poland. They assume that it will be a matter of weeks before they are emancipated from their newly found oppression. I don't want to get particularly political in a movie review, but the film does do an excellent job of portraying just how much damage can be done by a dictator once he gets going, and that while these may end up as faceless newscasts in on our end, there are real victims on the other end that rely on the rest of the world to oppose the tyranny that affects them.",The Pianist

460,ryuakamrvengeance,Surprisingly Good,9,16 October 2007,"When I first watched this film, my mind was quick to compare the film to Spielbergs ""Schindlers List"" as many other viewers have probably done also, but then the film took an unexpected twist, which changed my perception and comparisons entirely. As Szpilman and his family were walking to the train (taking them to certain death) I though to myself ""not another concentration camp movie, how predictable"" but how wrong I was. Just as Szpilman was saved, so was the movie, as it became an original, unique insight into the ""Ghetto"" that I had never seen before. Rather then take an obvious route and show the depression of the ""Death"" Camps, Polanski takes a different path, a path of isolation, desperation, and a will to survive. One shot that sticks out in my mind, is after Szpilman is saved and walks through the deserted city, (a bit like Cilian Murphy in 28 days later).Szpilman does all he can to remain alive, and sometimes you do worry for him, as when he drops the bricks, or is caught with the food sack, and throughout the film you are forever thinking about whether or not he will make it; he must come close to death about 10 times! The scene towards the end, as he plays piano for the German officer, was one of the most moving and powerful scenes I can think to remember, and it is worth watching the film just for that scene alone.Overall, a very similar, but equally different experience to Schindlers list, but nevertheless, just as brilliant",The Pianist
461,georg-60,Masterpiece with one flaw,8,10 May 2009,"""The pianist"" by Roman Polanski is a masterpiece that graphically depicts the horror of the Nazi time in occupied countries, especially, of course, for Jews, and gives you a better, for more vivid, idea of how it must have felt for the affected people in those days, more so than any history book. It does so without relishing in unnecessary gore - don't get me wrong, the scenes depicted in the film are harrowing enough, but there are certainly much more graphical accounts of the holocaust and you never feel that the film ""indulges"" in those pictures for the sake of it. But you get a real sense for how, little by little, the Nazi's pulled the rug under the feet of the Jews, making life a bit more difficult for them every day to the bitter end. There are many other good things to say about the film, which are already said so I don't want to repeat this any more. My only problem with this film is like with some other biographies or epic narrative that stretch a period of time, especially if centred around one characters is that there is a certain lack of interpersonal drama here. Szpilman, the main protagonist is the cornerstone of the film but we get to know very little about anyone else in the movie and therefore, we feel that we don't even get to know Szpilman really well, for there is no better way of characterising a human being than through his interaction with others. He doesn't even seem to be close to anyone. He has some family and some admirers but always seems a bit aloof. To the people who save his life, he expresses gratitude but rarely concern, personal interest or asks if he could help. Apart from that, it is a great movie that deserves much of the applause it gets.",The Pianist
462,TorpidOne,"Good, Interesting, but not Great.",7,9 February 2003,"The first half hour or so of the Pianist really struggles.  It shows the same coming threat that we have seen in other movies, yet does not do as good of a job of making them as horrific or tragic.  Polanski tries his best, and certainly there are scenes that one would think would horrify. Yet knowing what would happen later, and having seen films such as Schindler's List, the early parts of the Pianist just don't have the same emotional impact that they might have in years past.However, once the film becomes more about the individual struggles of the Protagonist, it starts to take off and captivate the audience.  I particularly enjoyed the way Polanski let us feel what Brody's character was feeling rather than have him overact in reaction to pleasant and unpleasant surprises.  This allows the audience to draw their own conclusions without trying to make them think they have even a remote clue what it would have actually felt like.The sets in this film are really outstanding.  They bring to mind some great sets like those of Saving Private Ryan, The Third Man, and Ran.  It really felt like war came to a beautiful city and destroyed it.  I never felt like I was watching special effects or set engineering.  This for me was the best part of the film.Second best would have to be the actual music.  While it does not approach the level of Amadeus in terms of integrating music with the plot and glorifying great music, doing so would not have felt right in this film. The music also felt more personal and prodigal.",The Pianist
463,Eli_Cash,Jarring Holocaust Piece of a Man's Determined Survival,8,15 June 2003,"This was improbably my first Polanski, not surprisingly my first Brody, but certainly not my first World War Two/Holocaust picture.  I have to admit I knew little going 'in' to this except holding foolish thoughts like 'how many more times are they going to make a movie on this topic?' 
Polanski blows that preconception apart.  He provides a startlingly fresh approach to the genre which includes _Schindler's List_ and to a lesser extent, _Saving Private Ryan_.  Like 'SPR' _The Pianist_ uses technically proficient shots of horrific violence.  Unlike 'SPR' these sequences are sporadic and always come like a jarring physical blow.  Much like some of the more successful practitioners of some forms of metal and punk music, you can come off being far more brutal and shocking if you're not so thick with the dissonance.Yet much of _The Pianist_ power comes in the form of traumatic psychological violence.  Like _Schindler's List_, this is the story of Jewish survival at all costs during the Nazi Pogrom.  However unlike 'SL', this is not the epic broad-stroke of an entire population's suffering but largely the tale of a single man and his efforts to stay alive.  Not to say that either this or 'SL' is significantly better than the other, they are to disparate in their approach to be fairly judged tete a tete.  But _The Pianist_ accomplishes a few things 'SL' couldn't by narrowing its scope somewhat.  Not that Polanski completely throws away the horrible effects such atrocities had on a wide range of people.  We learn that it takes the fellowship of his people, the kindess of the underground German resistance, and a few other more unlikely supporters not to mention no small amount of sheer luck for Mr. Szpilman to survive.Brody is terrific as Szpilman logging more screen time than just about everyone else combined.  I hope to see him again as soon as possible.  Now to go see more Polanski immediately.",The Pianist
464,hot-chocolate,Intense,10,26 January 2004,"This movie was fabulous!  One of the top 10 for me.  History was never one of my strong subjects nor am I interested in making into one... so any if there are any inaccuracies I won't notice.The imagery is powerful, moving and intense without being overly graphic, vulgar or gory.  The history of these crimes is a horror and there is no way to convey the true feeling of being there.  I love the perspective of the movie through the pianists eyes'... he is part of so many circles; the artist... the family member... Polish... and just plain human!I squirmed in my seat, felt uncomfortable and quietly reflected on the grotesque behaviour of the Germans.  Today we get upset, whine, complain, and throw hissy fits while waiting in a line-up at the bank, or the movie theatre.  The Polish people lived through an atrocity...movies like this give me something to ponder when I am feeling full of self-pity and lose my perspective!

465,TwistedIvory,A Terse Statement,9,14 April 2003,"I did enjoy this movie and its depiction of semi-actual events.  However, the length and editing of this movie made me feel as if I'd actually been living for five years during WWII; normally, this immersion in the environment would be wonderful, but in this bleak, depressing scenario the effect was to make me exhausted.  The editing depended heavily on close attention to detail and scene, as Polanski is certainly not given to fast editing (thankfully); however, the presence of several spurious scenes ultimately led me to feel tired upon completion of the film. A great movie -- I give it a 9 -- but it could have been better had the movie not felt like an epic crossed with an opus.",The Pianist

I don't think you can really finish this movie and not feel sorry for him. The last scenes with his family are so poignant, with just a few lines of dialogue, the director touched on the essence of saying good bye. His love of music, and not being able to play personally touches the audience. As music is his life and passion, not exercising that talent only drives sorrow to the extreme-degree. The look throughout all the scenes of the film express the dread of his character so clearly: the look of holding back tears and not giving up. This only adds to his dignity as someone trying to survive and bring the humanity out of others.",The Pianist

In fact, it's entertaining enough as you watch it--those actors who look more like schoolboys from some prestigious English boarding school than starving Polish Jews, the mean Nazis, those duplicitous, red-cheeked Polacks. Among the many other stupid things about this movie that I've forgotten since I saw it is that everybody is always speaking in English. Now there must be hundreds of holocaust/evil-German movies out there and in most of them all the Germans and their victims speak English! Come on! It's just ridiculous. Let's have a little authenticity, Roman.

469,Sennin,"Manipulative the first hour, lineal during the rest",5,22 February 2004,"In a general way, this movie can be divided into two parts, that differ in temporal terms, as well as in substance ones. The first part, shorter in time, seemed to me to be similar in content to those save the whales spots that Greenpeace makes you watch in school to generate environmental conscience. Not that I have a problem with Jewish folk, nor the whales, in fact I find extremely appalling both genocides, but the truth is that the victimist discourse that tries to bring the public into tears by making them feel impotent in front of the images is a very wasted one, particularly if the topic in discussion is the Jewish Holocaust (not to mention the whales). It would have been interesting to see Polanski driving the narration in a more objective way, showing the cause and the effect (in other words the reason why the Germans invaded Poland and persecuted the Jewish folk, as well as the persecution itself), and not only the effect, especially if proceeding that way the victimization of the Jewish is out of question (there's no way to be an apologist of the Holocaust, but there could have been a little sketch of the poor excuse for a twisted logic there was behind the invasion that would ""explain"" the behavior of the German soldiers in the movie), but would have avoided to fall into the coarse cliché it did. The second part, that entails a sudden twist in the narration, characterizes for being quite faster then the previous one (justifying its longer time), becoming a sort of adventure movie, well-driven most of the time, but that tended to be superfluous and implausible (fact that, by the way, has in this movie a wider tolerance rate: facts that in other movie would have tasted false or fictitious, in this movie were forgiven, due to the fat that it was ""based on a real story"") by times; in which the ups and downs of the pianist are told in a lineal way and without focusing that much on the external events, closing the public's perception: as opposite as in the first part, where one was witness of the ""pathos"" of the main character's family and the entire ghetto; in this one, one only gets to acknowledge only the facts concerning him. On the other hand, by the same time this perception is closing, one can feel a relief concerning the effectist discourse mentioned above. In deed, by this time they start to enter the scene the pro-Jewish characters, that seem to appear as life savers in this sea of anti-Semite people. But this relief comes a bit late into scene, as the public is already determinated by the previous scenes. From the technique aspect, we find the strong side of the movie: the photography is just splendid (keep an eye for the scene where the pianist finds himself before the destructed Warsaw); as well as the piano playing scenes, which are not only of a visual interest, but also provide us of an exquisite hearing pleasure (While many may complain about Chopin and say he is some sort of Gustavo Adolfo Béquer of the music, in the way that he didn't compose for art, but in order to get dates; they cannot deny that he is just more that a deployment of mere virtuosity à la Malmsteen, but that the music has a feeling and beauty that surround it). Regarding the acting, we must say it is well over the average but it isn't something out of this world, nor something like that. In the case of the secondary characters it's not that easy to tell, as there are so many and their performances are too little to define an opinion. Nevertheless, despite these last favorable points, I must continue to think that Polanski could have made a greater effort in this movie, since just by it self, or in comparison with his previous work, is quite unsatisfactory.",The Pianist

Some of the images shown here, and what they imply, are just so incredibly horrific and depressing that I can't get them out of my head. This is not only because of what they're actually showing, but also because of the very realistic and grounded way they're presented; most are captured in a single long take and a lot of these sequences aren't shown in detail as they're shot from a distance. At times absolutely nothing is even shown, and instead a single sound effect can be incredibly powerful.Despite a few specific key moments standing out, that's not to say that the rest of the runtime is uninteresting. The plot is unpredictable at every turn and the script isn't afraid to kill off lead characters. There are also many moments with absolutely no dialogue and complete silence were the minor mannerisms in the characters carry the scene, which is elevated by the absolutely excellent performances. The story takes place over a long period of time and the protagonist ends up in many different locations; the way in which he ends up in all these areas though, is very rarely shown. He'll often be somewhere, for example a concentration camp, planning to escape, then the scene would immediately cut to him outside of it, not telling you how he got there until a few minutes later when it's mentioned in a conversation. This is a very unique way to pace a film, and it mostly pays off; I really like that you have to play close attention to follow every plot point and that the script doesn't hold your hand or spoon-feed you. On the other hand however, this does mean that some elements of the story do end up feeling a bit rushed and underdeveloped in the second half as some plot points go by so quickly that it's hard to get attached to them. It is definitely impressive though that despite this film being an entire two and a half hours long, my biggest issue with it is that I wanted it to be longer, as it's really never boring.Roman Polanski may not be the best person, at all, but his work on this film is undeniably excellent. There are plenty of extremely impressive long takes and the direction is fantastic, managing to change from a close up, to a wide, to an over the shoulder in a single shot, without you even realizing. The cinematography really makes you feel as trapped as the lead character and the production and costume design are also absolutely flawless, perfectly presenting the time period. The choice to barely use any music throughout the entire runtime built tension very well and stopped any scene from becoming overly melodramatic. The technical aspects of this film are mostly stellar, the only two exceptions being one otherwise amazing scene with somewhat cheesy sound effects and a very strong overabundance of fade to black transitions, which got really annoying after a while.Overall, The Pianist has some of the best scenes in film history and, despite a few flaws, is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen.",The Pianist

But I would have to say that the pianist moved me more then the retreat.  I know this is pretentious but I just wanted to say it to emphasize the greatness of this film.
In my mind, if Shindler's List was ranked #7 on AFI ""100 years, 100 movies"", then this movie would have to be ranked somewhere between #1-6.  Of course I don't think Shindler's List is the #7 movie of all time and I doubt ""The Pianist"" is in the top ten, either (though maybe the top 20), but that is beside the point.This movie highlights what very few movies dare to say.  This is that it is not enough mearly to survive, but to survive as a human being.  This point is stated multiple times throughut the film (i.e. ""I'm cold""; when Szpilman expresses his emotions through a moving score with the German; how Szpilman eats the Jam plain without the bread like a small child; etc., etc.), and is really what makes the film great.  Brody really expresses how close to an emotional zombie Szpilman comes, without (in the end) eventually becoming one.  I think the reason that the film came across so powerfully, without being sentamental, was that Polanski was there.  I know this has been said before and will be said again, but I don't think it can be under-emphized.  P.T. Anderson makes great films about ""the valley"" because he lived there, Spielberg makes great films about family relations because he was very hurt when his partent divorced, Quintin Tarintino makes great films about low-lifes partially because for many years he lived and interacted with lowlifes as a video clerk in L.A.  Polanski was able to make a great film about the holocost becuase he was there.And to all of you who have previously said that Brody flatlines on his acting I feel you have unfortunelty mistaken bad acting with suttle acting.
Overall this is maybe one of the greatest films of all time10/10",The Pianist

Maybe the problem was with the editing. I don't understand how the director even got nominated.  I ""do"" like some of his work, but not this movie. There was only one scene that made the movie from being a total bust. That was towards the end, when the main actor plays the piano.  Based on the reviews, I bought this movie sight unseen.

491,uberbrodie,"Well crafted, well meaning, yet flat.",10,27 February 2003,"I tried very hard to like this film.  It was just near impossible to engage with it.  As far as art direction, compostion and filmmaking, the film was well polished but dreadfully standard.  This left the task of creating a enjoyable or powerful movie to the story and the acting, both of which were... well, flat.  Realizing that the story was based on real events it doesn't seem fair to criticize the story itself, but stagnated flow made me wonder why the story really needed to be told in this format.  The main character goes from respectible to subdued to squashed to positively disheveled, and yet there seemed to be no reason why He should be cared about any more than the other thousands who died.  The man who acted the lead did a tremendous job of portraying the role but it wasn't enough to make the character truly compelling or interesting.  He just went through the whole film with the same expression, the same emotion, this dreadful... sameness.  It made me wonder why he had to be saved, when there were others around him who at least seemed to do something, feeling something, have some will or humanity.Partly this is just a reaction to the hype, which i thought it didn't live up to.  Other user comments praising this film demonstrate that there are two sides to every issue, and many different points of view, most people seem to enjoy it. skipping it then might very well mean missing a movie that you will enjoy immensely.  I personally found little in the film to keep me interested, engaged, caring, or even entertained, and i'm not really sure why it won the the Palms D'Ors, other than PC reasons relating to its subject matter.  Just my personal view, but i really could have put my time and money to better use.",The Pianist
492,lvburns,The Metaphor of Music,9,17 February 2003,"This is a Holocaust film, among other things.  In my humble opinion, the movie is about what happens to love, passion and life when oppression is permitted to take control of lives.  The one metaphor, and the primary one, that strikes me most deeply is the use of music as a bridge.  A bridge in that the Szpilman's hid their money in the father's violin.  A bridge in that Wladyslaw met the woman (another musician) who would later help him, despite her marriage to someone else, during a music broadcast over Polish radio.  A bridge in that many of those who were in the ghetto with Szpilman, as well as those outside who could help, did so because of his reputation as a musician.  A bridge in that the only thing that kept Szpilman from insanity and perhaps death during critical times during his hiding was the music he kept in his head.  Perhaps most importantly, and certainly most poignantly, a bridge in that music was the only connection between Szpilman and the German officer who discovered him, and likewise perhaps the German officer's only connection, other than the photograph of his family, to what remained of his humanity.  Just the look on his face as Szpilman played spoke volumes in shock, sorrow, apology, sympathy and maybe regret. Finally, music (the arts) as a bridge to an enduring place beyond repression, beyond death, inhumanity, loss and tragedy.",The Pianist

The movie is well made and the acting is very good but the subject is so worn out that it leaves you nothing. Why do they always have to see things black and white (good or bad) when war and life is not as simple as that. WW2 was awful, I agree, but give it a break and START living in the present! Some producers, IMHO, try to take advantage of WW2's ""success"" in Hollywood and the film's industry overall to build a name or to be liked by everyone. This sort of propaganda movies are the ones that brainwash people into thinking that some countries or people are evil and some are good without even thinking about the causes and consequences of the actions in the story (specially when is such a delicate subject as this one where the story is actually a part of history and something that affect us all). The film only drives you emotionally through it but it's just that and nothing else what makes it good.

Firstly, the music, the most important feature of this movie, in my opinion. Chopin nocturnes and polonaises are perfectly chosen and arrayed to create an unforgettable atmosphere. In one scene, they even take time to play the whole piece of music, without interfering. Secondly, the actors in the movie: none of them are/were really well known, but WOW!

As the demanding role of Sziplman is more than enough to tell the whole story. He has to fight his way, not with submachineguns and grenades, by trying to stay alive even when the odds seem vastly overwhelming. We see him being forced by the German army to move from one place to another with his family, and the drama escalates as he gets separated from them later on, to find himself armed with only his wits, and a seemingly useless talent, which is of course, playing the piano.Do yourself a favor, and forget all this nonsense about anti-Semitism for 150 min, and get yourself a copy of this movie.

There was no distinction in  the movie between Wehrmacht (army) and SS. The SS uniforms (at least the officers') were black. Their caps had a skull and crossbones on it.

510,bigrab65,Vastly over-rated and highly simplistic,3,23 June 2003,"With a rating of 95 percent at Rotten Tomatoes and a place in the top 50 at IMDB I was expecting this to be a challenging film about the Holocaust. This however was not it.  All this film says about the Holocaust was that life was tough then, little else.  This is a rather obvious truth for everyone except Holocaust deniers, so why spend two hours telling us this. The film has story that is much too conventional and one that unfortunately lacks any great meaning.The depiction of the Germans is perhaps the most straightforward you are likely to see.  All you get is a bunch of stereotypical cinematic Nazis without any subtlety, until the final twenty minutes, when, SPOILER, Spillman runs into perhaps the only good German in all of Poland, if you go by the depiction of the Germans up to this point, who allows Spillman to escape.This film simply alludes to some major questions instead of going into any depth.  It shows a Jewish character who was from a certain point of view helping the Nazis, yet we do not see why this character is doing what he is doing.  At least not in any depth.One of the most remarkable things about this film is that it is about a Pianist, someone you would expect would have a soul.  However, Spillman is simply a non-character which makes him being a pianist seem rather superfluous.  This, however like the rather brief reference to the Merchant of Venice seems to be Polanski's main tool in this film: to allude to things that are deep and worthwhile, while saying nothing of the sort himself.A brief glimpse through some of the reviews will find that a lot of critics have a rather simplistic view of the Third Reich, which may explain why they liked this rather simplistic film.  One critic wrote that the Nazis were for barbarism and challenged everything that was beautiful and pure.  This in turn would lead them to oppose Spillman and his profession: the professional pianist.  This, however is not a rather simplistic view of the Nazi regime. The music that the Nazis opposed most strongly was modern music, in particularly the atonalism of the sort written by the great composer Schoenberg.  This music was viewed by the Nazis as being crude.  Hitler, himself was Wagner fanatic.  However, the issue of Wagner opens up a lot of major historical issues that I can't go into.  If, as some film critics are implying that this film is saying these things about the Third Reich, then I think this is a sad reflection of the intellectual state of modern critics. Although we may find The Third Reich totally repulsive we must not take the simplistic that it was a place where all great music was neglected, with the same being true for the Soviet Union.  These regimes had a particular view of what was great in music, and a lot of these composers, the German composers admired by the Nazis and the Russian composers who worked within the Soviet regime are greats in music.  The important thing to realise is that these regimes idealised music and other works of art and that is where the problem lies.  The thinking behind this was quite often quite complex, with thinkers such as Hegel leading the way. Personally, I thought that the film made no such comment on the Third Reich, but if it did I find little validity in it.",The Pianist

512,jon-1679,Mixed emotions...,3,10 March 2008,"I have to say that I was left with very mixed emotions after watching this film. On the one hand, we have a supremely talented pianist, forced to endure what the vast majority of us will never have the misfortune to experience, surviving all the horrors of the Nazi regime; and on the other hand we have a man who is prepared to let his family go off to die while he runs away, leave his fellow Jews to fight with the Germans (while he runs away again) and allows everyone else to risk their lives in order to help him. This man did nothing heroic to help himself, and certainly nothing heroic to help anyone else. His indifference to everyone apart from himself was almost unbearable. The only tears we ever saw were for himself towards the very end. No tears for his family, his friends, his people. The only emotion he ever showed was for Dorota, and let's not forget that her character was actually made up for this film, she was never in the book of his life. When you have to invent characters to try and help an audience to sympathise with someone then it speaks volumes.Now, war does terrible things to people, so who am I to judge this man, but surely there are better stories from better people to tell than this one. Does this story justify a film being made, just because he was a good piano player? Is this a man that we can all look up to?

513,sunnyujjawal,amazing & excellent historic film,10,30 October 2020,"The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later.What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell.",The Pianist

However, and I am being honest here, when I heard the title, ""the Pianist"", I thought that it was kind of a joke, like how a person with a Polish accent (or Italian, I guess, or European) would say ""penis"". You know, like, ""Look at-ah that kid's pian-ist!"" So basically what I'm saying, is that after I watched it a second time I knew what it was about and was not so disappointed.As for the Nazis, I pretty much agree with the movie's point-of-view, which is that they were bad. Evil, actually, is probably closer to the truth, but I'm trying to stay objective. Speaking of which, my biggest complaint of the whole movie: Where was Hitler? Okay, the movie is not exactly about what I thought it was going to be about. Fine. But how many people like me expected Adrian Brody to become Hitler's piano player and give him the old around the neck with the piano wire? I'm sure if you look around the room you will be surrounded by raised hands. In conclusion, Captain America is a legend, and that is because in his very first appearance in comic books he knocked Adolf Hitler right in his sorry jaw; Adrian Brody, however, not only did NOT punch Hitler in the mouth, but he was perched above an enclave of Nazis for a whole week and failed to report their location to Sgt.

519,stephan-9,Honest Portrayal Of Szpilman's Complex and Horrible Situation,10,13 January 2003,"Danger: Spoilers Ahead
I had an opportunity to see The Pianist this weekend, and I must say, I thought it was excellent - more so than I had expected, and I generally appreciate both Adrien Brody (who plays Wladyslaw Szpilman) and Roman Polanski.I've seen pretty much every WWII and Holocaust film ever made or subtitled in English, and The Pianist is quite possibly the best (in my mind better than my previous 3 favorites of this genre: Europa Europa, Life is Beautiful, and Schindler's List).  Have read pretty much every book on the subject I can find, also, I can say that The Pianist also strikes me as the most balanced and realistic portrayal of the situation - and indeed this may be a problem for some people.  (Like Schindler's List and Europa Europa, The Pianist is based on a true story - and I think it conveys this story more convincingly than either of those films).What I think makes the Pianist such an excellent film is that it accepts the moral ambiguity of people on both sides, and makes obvious the fact that opportunism as much as ideology played a part in the actions of individuals on both sides.  One ""villian"" in the form of the Jewish Police officer also plays a beneficial part in the life of Szpilman.  The unexpected hero in the form of the sympathetic German Hosenfeld does not reap any reward for his good deeds.  Szpilman himself feels that perhaps he should have stood by his comrades more directly in various actions such as the Ghetto Uprising, and while everyone who has read about it thinks they understand ""survivor guilt"" Polanski and Brody do an excellent job of making you believe that Szpilman really feels it.Some reviewers seem to have missed the point of the moral ambiguity, which I find disheartening.  They say that the good Jews help Szpilman out of sympathy, ideology, and comraderie, and the Gentiles out of opportunism, guilt, and only because he is a great pianist.  I felt that the film showed that both groups who helped Szpilman had reasons ranging through all of the above, and part of the truthfulness of the portrayal was that the ""moral divide"" was not so clear.The scene with Hosenfeld, in particular, struck me as being indicative of the filmmakers' perspective on this. While many may believe that Hosenfeld doesn't kill Szpilman because he is a great pianist, the beginning of the scene, in which Hosenfeld questions Szpilman with no weapons drawn, calling none of his subordinates to him, and in a civil, human tone is indicative of the filmmakers' belief that this person's core beliefs have eaten through his indoctrination.  Hosenfeld has no reason, within the context of the Nazi system, to bother to find out anything about Szpilman, yet he does.  When Hosenfeld attempts to get out of the prison camp by saying he helped Szpilman, it seems a desperate attempt rather than one calculated during the time in which the tables were turned.  It becomes the undeserved punishment of someone who, for no reason other than his own character, performed good deeds in a terrible situation (which he helped to create, but which others of equal anonymity who went unpunished did more to create and less to counter).Similarly, the moral ambiguity is amplified by the pragmatics of the situation.  When Szpilman's brother and sister choose to be with their family in ""relocation"", their actions read as ""morally correct"" but pragmatically quite stupid (as Szpilman himself comments).  It calls into question whether or not it is equally morally correct to save yourself in order to carry-on the struggle to save not just yourself, but what is left of the community, perhaps even to join with Partisans in a direct attempt to change the situation.  Szpilman recognizes the value of carrying on, but feels tremendous guilt about both abandoning his family and not joining in the Ghetto Uprising.It is this moral complexity which makes The Pianist so compelling. It does not attempt to paint the picture in terms of ""Good Jews"" and ""Bad Germans"", but rather that both sides had their heroes, villians, and confused people who could be seen as both, and that not every good deed was rewarded or bad deed punished - which from my readings, and from the stories my grandmother has told me (such as my Grandfather's life being saved by a Ukranian SS officer), is much more honest and plays on-screen as more compelling and realistic. The film does this without overstating its point and falling into the trap wherein it tries to make Jews ""equally culpable"" for the Holocaust. Rather, it makes clear the morally complex situation into which people were thrown, and that each responded to it according to their own character.
I think Szpilman would find this film an appropriate interpretation of his writing, and I recommend both the film and the book to anyone who is interested in such topics.",The Pianist

522,martin_lange,Boring and missing the point,3,27 May 2003,"Contains Spoilers.Roman Polanski committed one of the cardinal sins of the film and entertainment industry: never revisit a topic if the ultimate contribution has already been made.The ultimate holocaust movie is `Schindler's List'. Polanski's `The Pianist' falls way short of it in every respect.The only way `The Pianist' could have made a difference (and covered new ground) is in explaining how the main characters, Szpilman, could life with the fact that while he was hiding, people died on his behalf.He hid during the Nazi destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto. From his room, he could see his fellow Jews fight and die.He hid during the Polish uprising just before the Red Army arrived. Polish resistance fighters died in front of his eyes.People who hid him, died on his behalf. His helpers were caught, handed over to the Gestapo (WWII Secret German Police), tortured and killed.So, how did Szpilman cope with this during and especially after the WWII?Not even an attempt of an explanation is made by Polanski. In failing to do so, he has (in my opinion) completely missed the point of his own movie.The result is an undistinguished Holocaust movie with all the usual trappings. Sorry, Mr. Polanski, but Mr. Spielberg has been there before and has done a lot better.My advice - safe the movie ticket and borrow `Schindler's List' on video/DVD instead.

524,praveen1013,An Adrien Brody show,9,10 March 2007,"After waiting for quite long after seeing its trailer, I finally saw the pianist. The movie was entirely different from what I thought. Set on the backdrop of the holocaust in Warsaw, 'The Pianist' tells the gripping story of how a Polish Jewish musician, Wladyslaw Szpilman, survives the pogrom. All the humiliating decrees that were issues right from the Nazi invasion of Poland are brought through different characters and the general sufferings of the Jewish families are brought through Szpilman's family. Szpilman's family is sent to extermination camps along with all other Jews. But Szpilman is saved by his piano lovers(5 of them on various occasions).Adrien Brody with his desolate face has breathed life of a pianist in this movie. Some reviews here complain that just because he was a pianist doesn't make his life valuable over others. In my view,the pianist in him had made him a character one wouldn't allow to die. Born in the same family, while his brother is rebellious, the pianist is benign. As it is said here, musicians don't make good conspirators and the piano makes him a soft and lovable character. He never shows an outburst of emotion at any point in time. He doesn't participate in the uprising thought he helps it. The gentle way he talks to his lady love(supposedly) while moving to the ghetto or during their meeting on the road, the way he talks to anyone for that matter in a pleasant and soft voice speaks much about his demeanor. The scene where he asks for a loaf of bread in hunger after much hesitancy and the one where he plays the piano in air(unable to control his passion) are deeply moving.Though Roman Polanski doesn't convey anything significant here as in Schindler's list,'The Pianist' shall send you to deep melancholy wherein you shall find your soul strike a resonant chord with his music combined with sadness and sufferings . The music is still ringing in my heart..",The Pianist
525,ashcoounter,"Brilliantly Narrated, Visually Stunning!",9,1 February 2003,"Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Hervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars.

528,mafioso,entertaining but predictable,8,26 January 2003,"*WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS*Being a music major I was very eager to see this film.  My verdict: The Pianist is a film well worth seeing that you will enjoy, however it has its share of flaws and should not be considered Oscar material except maybe Adrien Brody for Best Actor.The film's main problem is its predictability and attachment to a 'formula'. Way too much borrowing from ""Schindler's List"" and nowhere near that film's dramatic ""best picture"" impact.  I really prefer B&W for WW2 movies. If you were expecting various forms of Jew bashing you got it.  If you were expecting Mr. Szpilman (the hero) to be miraculously spared the awful fate of his fellow jews ""on the train to labour camps, gas chamber etc."", you got it.  In fact he is the only member of his family spared, and Polanski (director) creates an awful loose end by never mentioning, not even at the end of the film, what happened to his family.  How Szpilman manages to survive can only be described as a completely implausible miracle (but if that's what you like, great)  Overall you may also find the film's pace a tad slow, especially the part where is shuffled from apartment to apartment by friends (almost 1/2 hour of screen time if I recall correctly)  Did they really need to bring in the doctor at that one point? (we could tell he was suffering so that scene should have been cut on the cutting room floor). But perhaps the greatest insult to the viewer is the German officer near the end who instead of blowing his brains out takes pity on Szpilman and says ""Ja, play me somethink on de piano"". (yes, he just happens to take refuge where there is a beautiful grand piano for him to play)  And so a little Chopin from Mr. Szpilman's bruised fingers (i.e. hand double for Mr. Brody) saves the day and at War's end he is back playing the piano for Polish National Radio or whatever it's called.  Too bad that nice officer got killed later on anyway.  Far too predictable for my taste.  I could have guessed that sort of ending from the very beginning.  And no love story either except for a little flirtation with a girl who marries someone else as we discover later.  If you love Chopin and the Beethoven ""Moonlight"" (what else were you expecting) remember to thank Chopin and Beethoven, not Polanski and his crew, as the music 'saves' the film from being very average.  Just remember this film is no Schindler's List so don't set your expectations too high. Notwithstanding the film's flaws, I felt that Adrien Brody did quite a convincing job despite the formulaic plot in a difficult role portraying Mr. Szpilman and therefore ought to be nominated for ""Best Actor"" at the upcoming Oscars. (unlikely to win even if nominated)  Otherwise no other nominations deserved.  My rating 7.5/10.  See it in the theatres if you must otherwise this will make a decent rental.",The Pianist

What I don't understand is the people who claim that this movie is stereotypical, ""good Jews"" vs. ""evil Nazis""  Have these reviewers even read Szpilman's (sorry about the spelling) accounts of what happened? I've read the book, and let me tell you...the movie is almost word for word from the book.  There are a few minor changes, but yes..the germans threw the elderly man in the wheelchair out the window..yes, they beat a little boy to death as he was trying to sneak back into the ghetto..I believe they severed his spine...yes, they randomly picked workers out of line and shot them in the head...etc. etc. etc.  it all happened.  Szpilman did not write this 30 years after the incidents...he wrote them a year or two later.  Somehow I don't think his mind grew a little foggy over the details...Also, I don't care what anyone says, there can never be enough movies made about the Holocaust...how can there be?  How can we as a society ever let ourselves forget such a monstrous occurence in human history?

But the reason why this genre of film has not worn out is because each of these films brings new perspective and added insight to that part in history. The Pianist brings these types of movies to a whole new level.  It is difficult to bring to words the effect this film can have on people, so forgive me if my words come off as thoughtless.Powerful. Settle. Inspiring. Sad. Hope. After seeing this film I was deeply moved. This film represented the horrible happenings of the Holocaust in settle, yet very very moving way. It provoked me to think about how lucky we all are to live without enduring such hardships. As time progresses, people begin to forget what seemed to be so recent, in this case the Holocaust. As new generations evolve, they begin to lose appreciation for such a terrible time. The Pianist brings us back to that time, and gives us a first hand experience as to what kind of brutalities went on. Being a member of a newer generation myself, I never fully appreciate and still probably don't foully appreciate what happened, but The Pianist has surely had a profound effect upon myself, and most likely my peers as well. The entire film is captivating, and the Holocaust through the eyes of real-life survivor Wladyslaw Szpilman is deeply moving. I would be terribly disappointed and saddened at our society if I hear that someone walked out of seeing this movie without being moved or affected by it. This is a must-see film for everyone, as it heightens our appreciation for the hardships people go through for the sake of their children, and for humanity.",The Pianist

When it did I was elated, for I too was caught up in the 'Razzle Dazzle'. Then I watched 'The Pianist' and the movie just blew me away. I loved the subtle things, his day to day survival, even how the colour slowly drained from the screen until we were just left with muted grays. The scene in which the tank rolls down the street and matter-of-factly begins to shoot at passersby is delicately and simply executed. No blood, no special effects, no music, just a running lady stopped in mid-stride and slumped in the road. It really brought home to me that this was NOT just a movie, and it never sets out to be just a movie. It is truly a re-telling of the truth of Spilman's life. Brody truly shines in this role; he is neither too bland or too over-dramatic. It is truly difficult to carry a picture by oneself and remain compelling throughout. Polanski and the entire cast and crew truly deserved the Best Picture Oscar for 2003, and I am at least grateful that I had also rooted for Brody to take home the Best Actor statue.",The Pianist

The dilemma is: how can the film show us this one story and, at the same time, connect it to something larger, more meaningful, more complex? Bergman, one imagines, would know how to solve this problem. Polanski, I think, does not, and modestly tells his story in a fairly straightforward and uncomplicated way.Naturally, since the subject of this film is the holocaust, I kind of wish I could say more either to praise it (for representing its subject well) or to condemn it (for representing its subject badly). But there isn't much more to say. Telling even one survivor's story is, obviously, a very laudable thing to do, but it hardly makes the film one of the greatest of all time--or one of the greatest holocaust films, either.",The Pianist
537,PainCakesxX,The Pianist,10,29 April 2006,"Being a pianist myself this film really struck me differently than most. The Pianist tells a story of pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), who loses everything including his family and belongings and is forced to live a life of constant hiding and fear.Taking place during the Holocaust, The Pianist portrays brilliantly the evils that took place during the mass genocide that took place. The disturbing events that take place in the film will leave a deep imprint on the viewer's mind for time to come; and it is certainly not an imprint that you would want to have.Much of the imagery and events that are displayed on screen are very realistic. In fact, the director, Roman Polanski, went through many of the events that were shown in the film as a young child which could explain why he was able to portray these events so well.One of the key factors in the film was the music. The music that kept Szpilman alive during this very dark time in history. The music that kept Spilzman going. Most of the music was written by Frederic Chopin, Polish composer who's music was very important to not only Szpilman but may of the Poles who suffered.While the pianist is not for everybody, it is a magnificent movie that tells a story of how a pianist uses his talent to help him survive through one of the most troubling times in history.",The Pianist
538,accelerius,One of the best holocaust films made,9,21 July 2014,"The Pianist stars Adrien Brody as the titular character Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous pianist living in Warsaw, Poland, during the second world war. While it has standard holocaust fare about the Jews being mistreated, you can't help but feel anger and sorrow at the sights of children being shot and piled up in the streets. The story revolves around how Wladyslaw tried to survive in the war torn city by hiding behind cupboards, living in the ruins of bombed houses or in apartments in which he was not allowed to make a single noise for fear of giving himself away.Roman Polanski is in another world in this film. He himself was a victim of the German Nazi mistreatment and harassment as he lived during the war and he makes us feel as if we are too. He deserved the Academy Award which he received for this film. Only he could convey all the intense feelings of fear and depression of the Jews. The scenes were stark and violent at times and at others would bring a smile to your face. There is a marvelous scene in which Wladyslaw is in an apartment secretly and cannot make a single sound as the Germans will then hear him. He sees a piano in the same room and sits down to play it. We see his shoulders and head moving to music and hands moving as if he was playing and we even hear the music in the air. As we start to think that they will surely hear and start to fear, the camera shows that his hands are merely moving above the piano keys and we realize with relief and regret that he is not in reality making any sound, as the music is all in his head. Adrien Brody is simply superb in this true story, playing a man who spends most of his screen time being quiet and not making a sound. His body language and facial expressions convey enough emotions to carry the entire film. He rightfully deserved the Academy Award, which he won at the age of 29 making him the youngest actor till date to win the award. He touches your heart and stays there. His role is definitely one i wouldn't be able to forget for a long time. While the film is about the atrocities on the Jews, and for most of the part shows the inhumane and degrading conditions in which the Nazis make the Jews live in, the film doesn't make one want to run home and turn on Inglorious Basterds while throwing darts at a dartboard with a Hitler portrait on it. This effect was deliberate as it shows that not all who serve under the devil are demons. Roman Polanksi must be lauded for this open minded view considering that he himself was treated deplorably by the Nazis. The story is simple yet will capture you and is one of the most classic true stories and the cinematography is memorable. Its the score that really stands out, especially the parts of the piano. The music is haunting and expertly performed. The acting of the rest of the cast, while it doesn't really stand out, is acceptable. The film is high on emotions and if you haven't seen any holocaust film before then is the right place to start.

The Pianist follows Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew hiding from apartment to apartment within the heart of Germany. This is rather unique for Holocaust films since most Holocaust films take place within the concentration camps, but this film doesn't have a single scene in one.Adrien Brody's performance is genuinely one of the best I've ever seen, seeing his body deteriorate on screen is difficult to watch as he struggles to survive, but makes it all the more immersive. The production design and sets are perfect in my opinion and also play a huge role in immersing the audience, I really felt as if I was in the heart of Nazi Germany watching this film. The direction and cinematography might be boring for some but I really loved Polanski's use of perspective in this film, many shots are set up from the perspective of Szpilman looking out his apartment window as gunfights occur down on the streets which I thought was a great artistic choice.I can't recommend this film enough, it's a must watch.",The Pianist

Tragically, it could happen again, to another group of people, to us or to our children.  History too often repeats itself...For me, ""The Pianist"" is one of the most moving and powerful films of my lifetime.  Each person brings to a film a different life experience.  I have been to Warsaw and seen the ghetto; I have been to Auschwitz.  I will never  forget the sadness I felt.  It had to be a horrifying and hopeless time for Polish Jews, and for those few who were able to survive the Nazi occupation.  The story of Wladyslaw Szpilman mesmerized me; I was close to tears throughout much of the film.Polanski's filming of Szpilman's story is honest and unsentimental.  All aspects of the film, especially the music of Chopin, add brilliantly to the whole.  The actors are well-chosen - family members, friends, strangers who helped.  Thomas Kretschmann as the German officer is perfect.Yet it is Adrien Brody's performance that triumph's in ""The Pianist"". He portrays Szpilman as a man of many layers and moods - first smug and self-satisfied, next mystified and unwilling and unbelieving, finally strunggling to help his family survive.  When he is cut off from those he loves, his music, his life, Brody is especially powerful.  He shows us Szpilman's hopelessness, boredom, frustration, longing, fear, his desperate will to survive.  I could not keep my eyes off his expressive eyes (and eyebrows). I will always cherish this compelling film depicting both our humanity and our inhumanity.  I was ecstatic when a surprised Adrien Brody won Best Actor at the Oscars.  Roman Polanski's well-earned win was also deserved.  And for me, it WAS the best film of 2002.

Polanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of ""point of view shooting"" by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film's poetry.In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin's music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski's usual story-frame).Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance, Polanski's sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski's long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood.",The Pianist

This movie was so interesting that it made me stopped what I was doing and watched it until the very end.Back at school, we were taught about the second world war but since this is the Philippines, most of it involves the Japanese and the Americans and little about the European nations.

Even today, few can have the courage to bring themselves to discuss this topic. However, one person did, and his name was Wladyslaw Szpilman. Based on his memoirs, The Pianist tells the story of how he was able to survive the war while living in fear.The film shows very graphic savagery and brutality from the Nazis towards the Jews. Some sequences are very hard to watch but the drama and acting felt very real. Its an important true story that depicted the grief and uncertainty of not knowing if you'd see your family again, the pain and sorrow these people had to endure must of been horrible.Adrien Brody has crafted one of the best performances I've ever seen, matched with terrific cinematography, a gripping score, and a direction from Roman Polanski that shines as being one of the best films about WWII.

553,mleach,"Based on a true story, The Pianist recounts the experiences of Wladislaw Szpilman, a brilliant Jewish concert musician in Poland during World War II.",10,19 November 2002,"Based on a true story, The Pianist recounts the experiences of Wladislaw Szpilman, a brilliant Jewish concert musician in Poland during World War II. Szpilman's extraordinary story of persecution, family tragedy and, ultimately, survival is brilliantly rendered in what is arguably one of Roman Polanski's greatest achievements as a film-maker. The Pianist does not flinch from re-creating the appalling horror of what happened to Polish Jews in the Warsaw ghetto, or avoid their eventual fate in the Nazi concentration camps. Nevertheless, this is not a dramatised documentary or a grim history lesson, instead The Pianist focuses very much on Szpilman's personal journey and what we see and feel is through his eyes. More by luck than good judgement, he becomes a fugitive and escapee in occupied Warsaw, where his terror and isolation are only offset by the help of friends and his memory and belief in the music he has performed. Adrien Brody (Bread and Roses, Summer of Sam) has already received considerable critical acclaim for his mesmerising performance as Szpilman and he is ably abetted by an impressive ensemble cast. British writer, Ronald Harwood, provides a sensitive and measured script; Pawel Edelman's photography provides luminous, unsentimental images and, of course, there is the music which is a major character within the film, setting tones and atmosphere. Above all, though, this is a Roman Polanski film and, considering his own World War II experiences in the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos, this may be his most personal and heartfelt film. Certainly, The Pianist is one of Polanski's most perfectly realised movies and, deservedly, won the Palme d'Or at this year's Cannes Film Festival.",The Pianist

This is one of the most amazing films I have seen in my life, it was excellently adapted, directed, acted and produced. Adrian Brody was magnificent, you could feel all the way through his feelings, his troubles, exactly what he was going through. I have never seen such a strong piece of work, in book or film, that has shown the treatment of the Jewish people during WW2, and their struggle to survive. It did, I am quite glad, show the relationship of the Nazi officer and Spzilmen as it showed that some of the Nazis did have a concience and the relief I felt when the officer brought Spzilmen food! I will remember this film, it was one of those unforgettable ones, such as The Green Mile or Girls Night, that really do touch you deep down and show the genuine feelings of its lead characters.

War was like this, you waited and waited in a room to hide from German patrols and house seeking, remember in Warschaw they fought really hard and there was a huge uprising in the city itself with hundreds of German soldiers killed.

556,vertigoandstrangelove,Long Time Coming,9,12 March 2003,"This is what you wait for if you're a movie buff. An eagerly anticipated film that gets great reviews and a number of awards across the Northern Hemisphere...that is actually worth waiting for. And if said film happens to be made by a personal favourite director ('Rosemary's Baby,' 'Chinatown' & 'Repulsion') fallen on hard times ('Pirates,' 'Frantic' & ugh 'Bitter Moon') so much the better.What I really liked about this film was the wonderful simplicity with which Polanski tells the story, while at the same time displaying his mastery of cinematic technique. Much like the pianist of the title, he hits the right notes throughout; from the opening scene where Germans bomb the radio station where he is performing, through the tribulations of his Jewish family, to the 'Schindler's List'-esque Warsaw ghetto scenes and on to the final grim struggle for survival, this is a tour-de-force for the aging director.The plot builds steadily to the final section of the film, where the pianist wanders, frightened and shaking, among the ruins of a bombed and burning Warsaw, still trying to dodge the few retreating Germans still in the city. He is finally caught by one, a general, in the ruins of a formerly grand house...a scene that is sure to go down as a classic.I saw this film on the day it opened in Australia and the cinema was packed. There were the usual packed-cinema sounds; coughing, munching of chips, slurping of drinks, muted conversation.

557,ochiang,Powerful film about hope,10,11 January 2003,"Only word is able to describe the new film by Roman Polanski: AMAZING!  I never thought that a director could transcend the viewer past the holocaust while in the middle of Germany's occupied territory.  But, Polanski does it superbly in the ""The Pianist"". In the first scene, we see the title character, the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), playing on Warsaw radio while bombs drop literal right outside the  window of the studio.  Actually, it only takes the repercussions of a bomb that explodes through the studio to get Wladyslaw away from the instrument that we see clearly that he was made to play with elegance and beauty. Polanski is able to quickly set up to the viewer the giftedness of Wladyslaw.  He is considered the best pianist in Poland and, some say, the best in the world. However, as World War II rolls on, Wladyslaw's family is driven from their home to the Warsaw ghetto where the Nazis place all the Jews.  The struggles that the Jews in Polish must endure are portrayed powerfully throughout the middle hour of the film. Polanski focuses on the Szpilman family as they adjust from a life of comfort to poverty and misery. Wladyslaw is only able to play in a restaurant where the affluent of the Warsaw Jews go to drink and mingle where his talent is ignored and under appreciated.  A patron even asks him to stop playing so that he can count his money.  His brother, who is selling books on the street to support the family, even blames Wladyslaw for the apathy of the rich for the poor. As the film progresses at a steady pace that never loses its direction, Wladyslaw is able to escape the concentration camps and works his way out of the heavy hand of the Nazis and into the helping hands of friends from the past. Polanski portrays the camaraderie of men in beautiful images and story lines as Wladyslaw moves his way around Poland in hope that the war will end with the occupation of the Russians.  Not only is this film hopefully in the understanding of human dignity between men but also what true compassion is to look like:sacrificing ones own comfort and life for the comfort of another who is less fortunate.  To lend a helping hand beyond presupposed prejudices and, as a result, bringing out the unique humanity of each person that can be hidden from one's own heart and eyes because of what we are told to believe about others. There is so much more that happens as Wladyslaw tries to free himself from the oppression of the German occupation but that is not the point of the film. It is focused on Wladyslaw, who is wonderfully portrayed by Adrien Brody.  The direction of Polanski is wonderful and the cinematography is superb.  The story is compelling throughout and remains believable so that the viewer can be brought into the midst of Wladyslaw's struggles and deliverance. There can be hope in places that are devoid of hope.  We must be able to see beyond the surface of what our eyes see to those things that make our hearts leap and rise.  This hope can be found in something as small as the eloquence of a hungry Polish Jew as his weak fingers work fluidly over the keys of a stand- up piano in the middle of a war torn building.  It is difficult for us to see anything noble come out of something as horrific as the Holocaust.  However, ""The Pianist"" vividly illustrates that there is beauty in the midst of darkness, a friend in an army of your enemies, and hope when despair seems to be our only choice. Film can transcend what our minds can not imagine and the ""The Pianist"" succeeds in this endeavor.  ""The Pianist"" will shock you, surprise you, and, in the end, make you want to stand up and cheer as listeners of Szpilman do.Because of Polanski's success in executing this film, he has made one of the best portrayals of the atrocities of the holocaust.  But, more than that, he has made a film about the freeing of the human spirit and joy that is accompanied by the sacrifice of oneself for another.",The Pianist

I was amazed, moved and touched, especially by Adrien Brody's performance, which was nothing short of flawless. The whole direction the movie takes and the truthfulness with wich Polansky tackles some of the most jarring events is amazing. Polansky doesn't want us to shed a pool of tears, he keeps the flow of events swift, doesn't dwadle on any particular scene where the atrocities of war are being shown. As a result, we don't get lost in the melodramatic aspect of war. This is instead, a survival story, and one told from the point of view of a very charismatic person. Adrien Brody is simply superb in his role as Wladek Szpielman, his performance is one I will quite possibly never be able to erase from my memory. I was taken by his character from the get-go, especially by the sweetness of his personality, his frankness and simple humanity. People were drawn to him immediately, and would risk their safety to help him. I am not a religious person by any means, but just before the movie ended I found myself thinking, not without a tinge of shame, of the biblical phrase ""The meek shall inherit the earth"". Wladek survived. He lived on because his only eartly passion was for his music, and this was enough to see him through genocide and live on to be 88. He never let himself be consumed with hatred or anger. There's something we can all take from that.NK",The Pianist

This film was not in wide release and that's too bad for the masses to see such a moving, graceful, masterpiece.  I downloaded it from the 'net after I saw it on the big screen and have seen it 2 more times since.  I can not tire of this fantastic film. The film as a time piece is the best there has ever been on WWII and it's influence on society.  The Pianist's cinematography was second to none.

Unlike last year where Denzel W. robbed a good lineup of Best Actor nominees.

It was good but, it could have been great (ie Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful) The reason it was not, I felt, was it was excessive. After seeing that many innocent jews executed, killed in battle, or beaten on the street, one just becomes desensitized to it. By the end of the film, I don't believe I felt, or was capable of feeling, anything. I guess the fault lies not entirely with the film. I suppose with the excess of violence this generation is exposed to everyday, Polanski probably felt he needed that much killing in plain sight to tap our emotions. Yet past movies depicting the holocaust have done a much finer job of imprinting how terrible a tragedy it was, and that's why they are great.But maybe I am wrong - Maybe Polanski was not trying to make a great (in the sense I've been using the word) film, but a simpler story about one man's amazing survival.

565,robertlangella,This is one of the best films I have ever seen,10,1 July 2017,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do. Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect.

Probably I've never been touched by a movie like this one. It's not only a biography of a great pianist, it's a documentary about a whole era, a documentary about thousands of people that suffered years ago, that lived, suffered and died, about their everyday lives and their everyday experiences. I've read much about the second world war and I thought that I knew how it was like and how people suffered, until I saw that movie, it made me see with my own eyes what my brain couldn't imagine, the film took me back in time and space, I was in Warsaw feeling every Jewish lived there that time. Also the movie portrayed the life and experience of Wladyslaw Szpilman flawlessly, in times I was feeling him, I was somehow suffering while I'm lying in my bed crying over someone that has already died 16 years ago. The soundtrack fits the events perfectly, the visuals are not impressing but that actually helped concentrating on the emotional aspect. I have never thought that a film could touch me this way, made me think about my real life now and thankful more than ever that we are living in peace and not suffering, it also made me think about all the people that suffers in our days, having a more clear picture about how wars and suffering could be like.",The Pianist

I was so fascinated by this one that I sat still for 2,5 hours.I didn't have subtitles, but luckily I understand a bit of German, so I could follow these discussions as well. I think anyone could watch the movie without understanding German, so I hope no one has passed the movie because of that.There were many scenes without any dialogue. Still these scenes could tell the story and were meaningful, but also interesting. The viewer is able to feel the grief that Szpilman feels during the movie - all the humiliation, starve, thirst, loosing family and so on. I found it very interesting to see how Szpilman's confidence changes during the years - how he gets kind of weaker and surviving by using his primitive instincts.I wasn't familiar with Brody's act, but I was so impressed by it. No wonder he won the Oscar. How he changes his physical performance was amazing. He makes the viewer feel Szpilman's sorrow. Like I said before I don't usually like movies without talking, but Brody made the movie so interesting. He really can act and speak by using body language and facial impressions.

573,cemilcamci,Pure awesomeness,8,13 November 2017,"A great movie on a powerful, essential subject -- the Holocaust years in Poland -- directed with such artistry and skill that, as we watch, the barriers of the screen seem to melt away. The closing scenes of the movie involve Szpilman's confrontation with a German captain named Wilm Hosenfeld -- Polanski's direction of this scene, his use of pause and nuance, is masterful. Szpilman takes to performing sonatas in thin air, eyes closed, those jittery fingers stroking nothing but air. It's a wonderful moment in a wonderful, ghastly film, and one of the most moving arguments for the redemptive powers of art ever made. Crafted without a whiff of melodrama, this motion picture takes a steady, unflinching look at the plight of Jews in Warsaw. Polanski, who was a Jewish child in Krakow when the Germans arrived in September 1939, presents Szpilman's story with bleak, acid humor and with a ruthless objectivity that encompasses both cynicism and compassion.VERDICT: ""High-Quality Stuff"" - This is a rating to a movie I view as very entertaining and well made, and definitely worth paying the full price at a theater to see or own on DVD. It is not perfect, but it is definitely excellent. (Films that are rated 3.5 or 4 stars)",The Pianist

577,dolboeb,A Brilliant Movie For Everyone To See,10,8 June 2003,"This movie is definitely not about Holocaust, not about WWII, not about Jews vs. Germans and Poles, albeit such interpretations do occur to many critics.The movie really is about survival. Was it all worth it, after all. Isn't there a price too high to be paid for survival?

Definitely the best Holocaust movie.  Easily the best war movie.  The directing and acting were brilliant.  Some of the scenes are so memorable.  The piano works by Chopin are ever so beautifully rendered.It is a shame that a movie like this one is only showing in limited release in a city like Toronto while Maid in Manhattan, Just Married, and other Hollywood junk are showing everywhere and breaking the box office.Best Picture Best Director: Roman Polanski Best Actor: Adrian Brody Best Cinematography",The Pianist
579,arunkj78,A Masterpiece,10,6 December 2004,"OK folks...here is the truth. I almost slept while watching Schindler's List...That movie I guess was first of its kind and I can understand its impact which it had on people. I though it was bit dragging sometimes. Don't get me wrong here, that movie was too lengthy for the content. I don't think anybody would talk about the movie Schindler's List, instead they would talk about Schindler. It is not the same with 'The Pianist'. It just pulls you into another world and you realize it only when the movie is over. Tremendous movie making!! The central character in the movie is of course the pianist Szpilman but the movie comes a full circle by portraying the life around the pianist. It is the movie making that is prominent here. If someone talks about Szpilman more than Roman Polanski and the movie in general, I would be surprised. Here it is Roman Polanski that sells. For Schindler's list, it is Schindler who sells not Spielberg.",The Pianist
580,kimba21,"Excellent effects, authentic display of Nazi-violence, but lacks otherwise",7,19 April 2003,"(no spoilers) This movie displays very detailed the cruelty and inhumane treatment particularly of Jews in Poland during the Nazi regime.  The special effects in the movie are as brilliant as you would expect them to be after having seen movies like Saving Private Ryan, for example.However, when it comes to a logical and interesting story-line the movie really would not have suffered from improvements. I mean, displaying Nazi cruelties has been previously well shown in other WWII movies (Schindler's list for example) and alone it doesn't represent anything original and neither does it add up nicely to an interesting plot. Although it might have been very important to Polanski to stress the war crimes committed, a pure listing of horrifying events does surely not make a good movie, it rather fills you with disgust.The pianist's love towards music, the emotions during the loss of beloved ones and during separation in addition to those horrifying scenes of cruelty and in general more plausible acting rather than a mere run-and-hide movie would have made this movie less boring (if you can describe horrifying scenes as boring).During the first 45 minutes I wondered if I actually wanted to watch this movie at all.  Later in the movie I felt better, though.  In general, the movie shouldn't need to be that long.",The Pianist

582,jedsalazar,A beautiful symphony of emotion....,10,3 April 2003,"I will begin this review by stating that the weekend I viewed the film was a classic fest. Films like Amadeus, Citizen Kane, Schindler's List, and 2001 could have easily rendered this film much less than it was. What I experienced at the theatre was a raw appreciation.Adrien Brody lays the bricks of the road to greatness. The unknown actor has amazed us all, in this inspiring snapshot of the human spirit. The emotion given in this role has surpassed many of the greatest films of time. I think we all expected an emphasis on the combination of beautiful music and an undistinguished script. Brody applies a rare performance that demonstrates the possibility of perfection. A rare illustration of flawlessness.
Unfairly, from the opening credits I was comparing the film to Schindler's List. The two films shine in their own rare illumination. I knew not what to expect from The Pianist, and still I was overjoyed with the ending result. Something to emphasize that we have not forgotten, and memories don't die. This is film. This is brilliance, craftsmanship, creativity, and virtuosity. Another reminiscence, of the decay that lurks in the human soul and the divinity of overcoming these evils.Throughout the film I felt my emotions piercing during the atrocious imprisonment, and segregation of human beings. This era challenges my beliefs in human decency. To have lived to see such a time when abominations were carried out negligently intoxicates me that times are past. Yes, this is all leading up to the fact that the film caused me to involuntarily cry. I wasn't weeping, but I noticed a tear during one scene (which will remain disclosed).If you have ever wanted to celebrate the generosity, sympathy, charity, and tenderness of the human soul, see this film. The most important time in history. The allowance of the celebration of individuality, uniqueness, and humanity. We could all use this film at a time of counterfeit reasons for innocent bloodshed in this war of arrogance.",The Pianist
583,chuckie_cheese,absolute accuracy,10,18 January 2003,"Not only was this film based on a true story (same title), but it followed the book very closely, right down to the family sharing the last caramel. And unlike many holocaust stories which are written years later, The Pianist was written by Mr. Szpilman just after the war. The extraordinary thing about the book is that at no point does Mr. Szpilman ever make a judgement on what happens to him. He just reports the facts. I saw the film 2 days after finishing the book, and I was stunned at the beauty and accurate interpretation of the film.",The Pianist

It was absolutely beautiful and it touched my heart as well as my stomach in parts, if you know what I mean. It truly shows the hardships of the people during WWII, their suffering, and their pain. You truly feel with the main character, and for the families in this film. Adrien Brody was outstanding, his transformation through the film is out of this world. He was well worth the Oscar. The film also presents an interesting twist in parts. I found it overwhelmed with my interest all the way through. The film, the music, and the pianist were superb!",The Pianist

It seems that Hollywood has ran out of ideas in making a beautiful film that will stay in your mind,forever.The Pianist is not just a movie, it is an experience.The Pianist is a story about a young Jewish musician named Wladyslaw Szpilman,a brilliant pianist and composer,probably the most acclaimed of his time until the World War II made him give up his career.This powerful,triumphant film will leave you breathless.It follows Szpilman's journey for survival during the Holocaust with the help of a sympathetic Nazi Officer.He lost his family and was separated from his friends but that made him stronger.Survival was his masterpiece.It is both depressing and uplifting.The film was nominated for 7 Oscar in 2003 and won 3 including Best Actor for Adrien Brody's greatest performance is his career.I haven't seen Schindler's List before, but this film might be the greatest Holocaust film ever made.Bravo to Roman Polanski.This is what artistic film should be like!!!",The Pianist
587,kingfish1328,One mans haunting journey,9,20 September 2003,"Roman Polanskis Pianist is a haunting film that had on the edge of my seat as I journey alongside with Szpilman through Poland in WW2. I found the film to very realistic and very polished visually.   I was very critical with this movie being that it took me nearly a year to see it. Holocaust films tend to be downers, but I couldn't avoid it any longer. Brody deserves the Oscars being that he is in every frame of the movie from the midpoint on. His portrayal of Szpilman is hypnotic and heart wrenching. I feel giving this film any criticism would anti-semantic. One thing bothered me about the movie though. It didn't seem to go together very smoothly. It was a sequences of scenes that seemed to be cut together to show Szpilmans journey opposed in showing a plot with any type of flowing through-line. Being that this a true story, it is okay being that life doesn't always make a good script. Polanksi's goal was to tell Szpilmans story and not make a Hollywood blockbuster. I just feel it could had been edited more smoothly. I especially loved the relationship or lack there of one of the German officer toward the end of the film.

There was a fine level of detail - such as a flawless performance of Chopin's Ballade in Gm using a purposefully out-of-tune piano that was fitting for the scene of a burned out section of the city.The stark reality of the war and the Holocaust was presented with no reservation  - as one person mentioned above, just as if it were simply being reported by the author. And because of some of the more horrific moments - even as beautifully as this film was shot, I might find it difficult to watch ever again.

This is not another World War film, defending the Jews, or another `Hollywood' high budget combat movie. In fact Jews are symbolized here as innocent people and they can be anybody who has been discriminated in the world, throughout the history. The story is responsible in confronting you with Wladyslaw Szpilman's life style and persona. The point is not the war or the racial and religious issues, indeed it is the study of people. Pianist is a profound look at the man's psychological behavior within his society and himself. It challenges human emotions during the hardest times of life. After watching this film one may realize the hope, fear, sensation, egotism, and enterprise that every person has toward life. The protagonist is not a hero, rather a survivor. He sought to stay alive and he made it, by sacrificing everything that he had. He left his beloved family, and decided to run away instead of following the fate. His home town is destroyed and his people are being tortured and murdered in front of his eyes. Yet nothing stopped him in reaching his goal. The protagonist is in a war, but this war can be in the midst of anything, not only the enemy on the other side of the wall. The conflict can be within him and his soul, him and the society, culture, ideology or another individual.Pianist is a must see film for all the people, regardless their gender, race, and nationality.

While it was an atmospheric, impious piece I didn't think it was as good as people are saying here. Brody's performance did what the role required, he displayed fear and so on quite effectively, but felt his character lacked any subtlety. One moment he's a panicked but handsome man, then he suddenly falls ill, grows a beard, and becomes a stumbling wreck. And then everything goes back to normal.Furthermore, the portrayal of the brutality going on around Szpilman, I felt, was nothing special. Of course the wanton disregard for life, the lining of of people to be shot and so on are all very moving topics, and the camera angles through broken windows and so on worked very well, but I can't see how people think this film's portrayal is so superior.It's definitely worth watching, but it's pretty straight-forward.",The Pianist
593,GCENGPC,A nice effort by Polanski but...,6,10 July 2003,"***Possible Minor Spoilers*** The Pianist was not as good as it could or should have been. But of course it has a few great features in it like the acting epscially from Adrien Brody, who won an extremely well deserved Oscar for his role as the Jewish pianist, Wladslaw Spzilman, the photography, and editing. But ultimately it was very mediocre. The story of the film is very unoriginal, many of the characters seem to really have no depth making them just seem flat and lifeless, and it sheds no light on the Holocaust subject and whatever elements of that subject that were covered in this film was already covered in the past by other films already. The only thing that was actually original in this film was showing the Nazi officer who helps Spzilman in the end. And as Polanski goes, his direction in this film was very uneven and by the end he didn't really have much of an explanation to his movie, I think if he wanted to make a Holocaust movie, he should have done his story growing up in the Krakow ghetto or something similar to that since he was there and witnessed everything that happened there while as Warsaw goes, I don't think really knew what happened there considering how the uprising sequences in this movie seem somewhat uninteresting. In conclusion, I can't help but give credit to Polanski (seeing him win the Best Director oscar was nice), but Schindler's List really steps all over The Pianist in every single aspect. I give The Pianist 5 out of 10 stars.",The Pianist

The harsh realities of the way the Nazi's set out for the Jews and the development of how they did so was successfully and shockingly delivered. So much so that It took me a long time to gather my thoughts on the film to muster an opinion. The sheer deterioration of character 'Wladyslaw Szpilman' played by the brilliant Adrien Brody was delivered impeccably in how weak and fragile this once successful man became.Needless to say, the score was lovely.

Some guy with a great talent has suffered like this and has seen the war how it's to be seen on the screen.I must admit I can very much appreciate good ww2-movies, also movies as die fälscher make me think for what has happened over 60 years ago.

No, it's not Schindler's List, but it isn't trying to be. Schindler's List is a study on the psychology of mankind, and how the human race needs to change to survive. The Pianist, however, is nothing more than a simple tale of survival. There are no heroes, no villains, or even antiheroes. Just a simple man trying to live through the chaos around him. And in the midst, Brody still seems to convey how much he misses the way things used to be; when he could just sit down, play the piano, and not worry about the trials in the world around him. So no, it still pales in comparison to Schindler's List, but in my opinion it is better than Sophie's Choice. An excellent film.",The Pianist

A Jewish pianist in Poland caught up in the horrors of World War II. The Nazis invade Poland, confine the Jews to ghettos then ship them off to concentration camps.This an excellent look at the Holocaust through a Jewish man's eyes, but I can see how the violence could be upsetting to some viewers.

But after seeing it I realized that it has far more reasons to watch it.The different thing from most other movies about war is that it is just about one single person. The struggle of one man. That's why you got more details about war and how people really felt. It allows you to be a witness of the fight of this very man, his feelings, his fears and his happy moments. Sometimes you feel happy for him because he got a new home and people that support him, and in the next minute you want to cry because of this terrible things that are happening to him.You can say about Roman Polanski whatever you want. But he did a masterpiece with this movie. It also was so good because Polanski has been through this horror. He lost his family during World War IIand that gives the film even more deepness.Maybe the title of the movie scares some people. They just thing it's about piano playing and music. But this is the worst reason you can have of this film. The main story is about a pianist, that's right, but it's about his survival because of music. His love and passion for music helped him to never stop hoping. And this is what this movie is about. It's about a person that lived through all that horror without stopping to believe.Never judge a film because of the title. Watch the Pianist and I'm sure you'll will think about things in a different way.",The Pianist
604,Benjamin00,My favorite WWII movie,10,2 November 2013,"Yes that may be an overstatement and I haven't seen Schindler's List yet. But still this is my favorite WWII even after seeing Saving Private Ryan.The movie does an excellent job of portraying the very talented Jewish piano player, Wladyslaw Szpilman. He starts out as a nice and honorable piano player for the local radio. But as the Nazis invade Poland his live gets more and more difficult. After numerous changes including armbands declaring their Jewish, confining them to a very small area, basically starving them.He does what he can to survive and eventually get's taken away from his family which brings out this whole spree of bad luck for him. He works hard labor building a wall and gets beaten there. He gets outside of the dreaded wall and gets moved into an apartment. Complications eventually force him to move to a different one. Then the uprising of the Jews begins and he is forced to live in an abandoned hospital then in a destroyed town. He there meets a kind Nazi General who helps him. Until the Russians come in.I think it's important to note Wladysaw's evolution in the movie. He starts out as, like I said before, an honorable guy. Then he starts becoming, as the Nazi's start cracking down, instead of a nice guy he becomes this food scrounging guy who has a limp and is desperate for anything. It's kind of comical and very sad at the end he has this can of vegetables that he carries around because its his only source of food. He holds it in a way which makes it seem like it's his baby.In conclusion, the directing, acting, lighting, visuals, everything about this movie is great it explores the struggle to survive and the cruelty of man towards a certain race all because of a scapegoat.

605,giordana_01,Yet Another Holocaust Movie,1,27 February 2005,"I left ""Schindler's List"" haunted. I left ""Life is Beautiful"" incredibly sad. I left ""The Pianist"" bored and very, very sleepy.I'm not saying the Holocaust isn't a worthy movie subject, but it's all been done before, and much better. There's not much to care about in ""The Pianist"". As told here, Vladek Szpielman's story isn't especially compelling or interesting. He survives the deprivation of the Warsaw ghetto, goes into hiding, endures more deprivation, then plays piano again. The end.Szpielman seems strangely unaffected by the horror unfolding around him. He witnesses various atrocities, sees his family get deported, and watches 2 executions and a cremation, yet his facial expression never changes. He goes from starving before liberation to playing the piano on the radio afterward, with no explanation of what happened in between. And why does a man in hiding pull aside the curtains to watch a shooting outside?I'm not afraid of a film where most of the action is internal (like ""The Hours""), but this film has almost none of that. We get no clues about what Szpielman thinks or how he feels about anything. ""Schindler's List"" and ""Life is Beautiful"" convey the horrors of he Holocaust much more effectively, including their effect on the survivors. ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" tells a much better story about life in hiding.To those who say Holocaust movies are needed as long as there are Holocause deniers, I can only say this; there literally hundreds of Holocaust movies out there. If a small number of people are still denying the existence of the Holocaust, making another 100 movies isn't going to convince them.",The Pianist

But it was not about music... it was about the Holocaust. I stayed and watched but only because one of my long-time friend's grandmother was clubbed to death on the streets of the Warsaw Ghetto (site of the movie) so there was a personal and painful connection.I asked another friend, a young American Jew who lives in California, if the movie made him feel confident, outgoing and positive, or wary, uncertain, fearful, and negative. No surprise - it was the latter and how could it be otherwise? I would be hard pressed to think up a more effective means to screw up Jews' psyche than to produce a movie just like this one. I wonder if Roman Polanski was secretly and unknowingly financed by SDOPOAJ (Syrian Department of Psychological Operations Against Jews)The problem with making people fearful, and that is what this movie does quite successfully, it that they become diminished. As Lord D'Abernon (1857-1941) said: ""The worst atrocities are probably committed by those who are most afraid"". I think that the Jews' oppression of the Palestinians may be rooted in the fear that Jews feel in their very souls... and this is being fanned, constantly it seems, by films like this one. The world would be a better and kinder place if the Jews would stop wallowing in their victimization and move on to positive things where they are so well equipped to make big and positive contributions.",The Pianist
607,mbrandlymolett-53-897035,Tragedy,8,8 October 2020,"This is the second Roman Polanski film I have ever watched. This is probably now inserted in my Top 10 of films.
I'll note that I did not notice how much of a staple Adrien Brody is an actor, and well he may not have deserved to steal a kiss from Halle Berry, I'll respect it and am definitely a fan and I would love to have dinner. He acts in one of my favorite Wes Anderson films Darjeeling Limited, and I managed to overlook this historical gem. I saw the 2005 rendition of King of Kong a solid 4 times in theaters and I always just knew Adrien Brody as the guy who kissed Halle Berry.
This film is first of a reminder of what blind following can lead to. I try to make light to deal with my own sense of dealing, but this film is dark and it is truly an inspirational film. I managed to watch through critical lenses, a stiff drink(s) and that's just an unhealthy way I learned to cope, function and minimize. There is no minimizing of this film in so many levels. Watched through blank eyes, I've never heard of Adrien Brody or seen the impact of the saddening ensemble cast was overwhelming. How I did not cry is beyond me, but my heart goes out to anyone and has always gone out to the Jewish community. I do forget that Jewish people are descendents of the children of Israel. I believe the persecution felt so normal to them because of many years of persecution from every community they've lived in.
On track, this film is a biopic of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrian Brodey) a Polish Pianist for the Polish Public Radio. The film opens up with Wladyslaw at work, playing the piano live on radio, as the not visible Nazi's cause very visible damage to the Polish. The setting is Warsaw, Poland, 1939. What starts off light, ends with complete demolition.
Today classical music is almost considered a dying genre of music. Sense there's no words or stories being told to people they have little interests. However, music is a powerful source and relay so much information in a film. Polanski is of the time where films also have composed pieces. This is often done with major budget films and this is a major budget film. Rightfully so, as a story of survival, unity and compassion lie deep within us all.
Wladyslaw is playing the piano for the Polish radio as bombs are bombarding the city. Wladyslaw is in the middle of a beautiful number live on the radio and is advised by his producers to cut the number and go off air. By no judgement he continues to play until in a shot that is only contained by the music itself. There is a 180 line between the composer and the producers with mid shots of the producer's booth. The scene starts off with Wladyslaw and his producers, they run, there is an explosion, now Wladyslaw runs. This scene tells of Wladyslaw's dedication to music and ignorance.
The next scene I want to discuss is the thrown out neighbor scene. This consists of beautiful pans and tilts. We see a captivating shot of the Nazi's awkening neighbors from acros the street through their balcony windows. One family has a handicapped member and that member is made to suffer. However the suffering continues. We pan back down to the streets and the Nazi's have the Jewish neighbors shot in the streets. The audience is given a limited view to their surroundings as does our protagonist. We often only get the 180 degree rule in this film for that reason. We mentally are constrained, as well as physically, and emotionally.
The last shot I will discuss is when Wladyslaw yet again escapes the clutches of death and jumps to the other side of the hospital wall. In the middle of two rows of destroyed Polish housing stands Wladyslaw. Looking at the shot on pause I thought a needle in a haystack if it were unspeakable hell. At first the audience is centered with the wall then we pan up and see all of the destruction that has been caused. In relation to the haystack comment, Wladyslaw is one of few who escape death. Sadly, he watched from his window as life vanished at every moment.
I loved this film. The content to me would put it in the Horror category more so than the drama. It just felt like Wlad kept finding new hiding places then the bad guys would discover him. I enjoyed finding the compassion in the characters throughout the film.",The Pianist
608,Dimitrisfederer,An unforgettable masterpiece,10,30 August 2018,"The pianist (2002) is a film directed by Roman Polanski and it's centered around a polish jewish musician (played by Adrien Brody absolutely perfectly ) and his struggles to survive in world war 2 . This film is truly a masterpiece in every single way and ,even though, we have seen a lot of stories about the holocaust this movie is still very shocking . 
The main reason is Polanski's amazing direction . The pianist is such a beautifuly looking film that i couldn't take my eyes from the amazing shots i was witnessing and of course the oscar-worthy Adrien Brody who gave one my favourite performances of all time . 
The rest of the cast is great and all of the characters feel real , like how a biography should be ...
But the most impressive thing about this movie is music. 
Every time Adrien Brody played the piano i was literally crying , especially in the third act with the German character which was the best part of the movie for me . Overall this film is really great in showing the costs of war , as well as sending the beautiful message of how music can bring people together even if they are from opposing nation . I would recommend this to everybody

Out of the three-hundred movies I have rated on this platform, there are only three that I could never watch again:The Pianist
Schindler's List
Requiem for a Dream""The Pianist"" deserves a rightful spot in this list. Directed by Roman Polanski, this masterpiece of a movie focuses on the true story of Wladek Szpilman, a Polish Jew who plays piano for a living. Unfortunately, this is around the time when Nazi Germany occupied Poland, and set up concentration camps and ghettos for the mass liquidation of anyone that didn't meet the requirements of Germany's perfect and idealistic Aryan race.In this behemoth of a film, Polanski shows determination and skill as a moviemaker and captures the true horrors of the SS; how they ruthlessly murdered six million Jews during World War II. This is the story of Szpilman being saved from liquidation and living a life on the run from the Nazis merciless regime.As one pointed out, cinematographer Pawel Edelman makes great use of his skill by slowly draining the color out of each individual scene that occurs in the film, perhaps symbolizing the decline of Szpilman's physicality and mental health. Often though, there are streaks of color throughout the movie, such as Szpilman's magnificent renditions of piano pieces, most prominently being the works of fellow Pole Frédéric Chopin. It is here where Chopin (my favorite composer) shines bright in a world of turmoil and death.Adrien Brody does an incredible job as Szpilman, and he rightfully won the Academy Award for Best Actor at the age of 29, being the youngest one to do so. His determination is effectively shown to encapsulate the true story of Szpilman, a story full of sorrow, heartbreak, and rejoicing.This isn't just a film. It's a memoir, a piece of artwork in the fact that it doesn't hold anything back from the truth of what occurred some seventy-five years ago. This is a film I couldn't watch again without being distraught by its content, however, I consider it to be one of the greatest films of all time, and something that should be respected and honored.",The Pianist

620,user-7630,This movie was an insult,4,7 June 2012,"What was the motivation behind making this movie?Was it to teach people about the crimes that the Nazis committed in WWII? Probably not, The Pianist came out in 2002, so there were already hundreds of movies out there that depicted the Holocaust.In my opinion, if you want to do another Holocaust movie, it should be because of one of two reasons: 1.) You want to tell a really interesting story that happens to be set in this time and location. Or 2.) you want to do a character study. Maybe show both sides of the medal, and try to analyze what could make people do horrible things like this.The Pianist was neither of those two. The plot is as simple as it gets, a Jewish musician tries not to get killed and to flee from the Nazis. That's pretty much it. So what we get is basically a loosely connected series of scenes, where 1-dimensional Nazis do terrible things to 1-dimensional Jews. It's very important to understand, that there are psychological mechanisms behind what the Germans did in WWII. If you just depict them as flat monsters who just love to do horrible crimes, the viewer just thinks ""Yeah well, I could never do stuff like that."" Guess what, under the right circumstances, you could. There are two German movies about that subject matter, called ""Das Experiment"" and ""Die Welle"". Watch them if you haven't seen them.The characters being as flat as they are also makes it hard for me to get invested in their fate. Don't call me heartless, I'm just complaining about the way the movie was made, I'm not saying I don't care about the real people this happened to.And this brings me back to my opening question of why this movie was made, and to what made it an insult for me instead of just a bad movie. The Holocaust is a sensitive issue for many people, so it's not hard to touch something in the viewer by just showing Nazi crimes. And the people who made this movie knew that. The Pianist had ""Oscar"" written all over it, and because it neither tells an unusual story, nor explores the characters, that's just what the movie is: A cheap way to win everyone involved an Oscar. And they use a horrible event where real people died to do that. That's what makes it insulting for me.It's competently made, it's not ""terrible"" to watch or anything, but the circumstances make me hate The Pianist instead of just discarding it as another movie I didn't care for.",The Pianist
621,Alan Smithie,No Hollywood studio would ever have dared touched this one...,10,28 March 2003,"A film usually is a great film because of the emotion it evokes from the audience. It is usually great because it shows us the 'reality' of life during troubled times. This film does both, and more. Yet, you almost never are moved to anything more than the verge of tears. You don't ever feel sorry for any of the characters including Szpilman. It is extremely existentialist, with a eerie Beckett-esque feel to it through out. The scene of the soup-snatcher and of the old Jew man being thrown off his wheelchair from his balcony high above the pavement couldn't have been written better by Beckett himself. The whole idea of the music playing in your head is so enchanting, yet you don't ever feel depressed but instead smile and hear the music in your own head. The scene of Szpilman playing the piano yet not playing it, is something that will continue to haunt me for a long time. Brody is Szpilman, every character is their own person, no one could have replaced them and none could have done another role. The music pieces are brilliantly chosen from a wide collection of the work that Szpilman played, so is the cinematography. This film would have been so easily about Szpilman's heroic life, instead it's about his music, and his survival to play that music, nothing more, nothing less. It's not about the Jewish cause, it's not about the life of his family members, it's not even about his love story. It's a very rare film. And by the end of the film, you're left with a sense of incompleteness which must have been Szpilman's life but his music seems to fill that void for him and for us as well. I wouldn't say it's a must see, because that would be a term you'd associate with a Hollywood blockbuster, this is a must know.",The Pianist

626,debojyoti_bhattacharya,A complete masterpiece,9,9 June 2021,"As a child in Poland, film director Roman Polanski hid from the Nazis after escaping the Cracow Ghetto through a hole in the barbed-wire fence. Over the years since the war, he has looked for a story that would convey some of the things he experienced. Then he came across the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew who survived the Warsaw ghetto. Polanski called upon Ronald Harwood (The Dresser) to write the screenplay. The Pianist won the Palme d'Or (Best Picture) at the 2002 Cannes International Film Festival.During the German invasion of Poland in 1939, renowned pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) is in a Warsaw radio station performing Chopin's ""Nocture in C-sharp Minor"" when the bombs start falling. Although the technicians run for cover, he keeps playing until a blast shatters the window of the studio. At home, his parents (Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman) are packing to leave the city but Wladyslaw's brother (Ed Stoppard) and two sisters (Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Raynor) believe there is no need to do so, given the radio reports that England and France have declared war on Germany. However, this upper-class and cultured family is disheartened when the Nazis march down the streets of Warsaw.Soon the inconveniences of not being able to eat here or to walk there are magnified into the wearing of the notorious armbands and the ignominy of being herded with thousands of other Jews into a walled-off ghetto. Wladyslaw is able to find work playing piano in a restaurant that caters to black marketers, and he's makes some valuable contacts, including a member of the resistance who gets his father a work permit. But all is for naught when in August of 1942, the Nazis begin rounding up Jews for ""deportation."" As all the members of his family are herded into a freight car, Wladyslaw is pulled out of the line by a friend in the Jewish police. He is put to work doing grunt labor for the Nazis.Up to this point in the drama, Polanski and Harwood have given us little that we are not already familiar with from countless other Holocaust films. The last portion of The Pianist focuses on Wladyslaw's isolation and loneliness in Warsaw over a three-year period. After escaping from the ghetto, he contacts the resistance and is shuttled from one vacant apartment to another where his presence has to be kept secret. He is totally dependent on the ministrations of those bringing him food and news. From the windows of one place, he does witness the Jewish uprising in the Warsaw ghetto. Later, while hiding in the ruins of the bombed-out city, he is discovered by a Nazi officer (Thomas Kretschmann) who decides to spare him once he hears him play the piano. He brings him food and even gives him the coat off his back.Many kindnesses of quite ordinary yet very courageous men and women enable Wladyslaw to survive the war and resume his life as a musician. Sadly enough, Adrien Brody's performance keeps such a tight rein over his character's emotions that there is little evidence of his gratitude for all that has been done for him.",The Pianist

Everything about this movie looks authentic, with what appears to be a cast of thousands.It is quite inspirational, and the music alone is worth the price of admission.

What many, many survivors of war and the Holocoaust lose at least temporarily is their purpose, the life of their souls, either to bitterness or madness, or simply confused by the wave after wave of remembered horror after horror.  We learn in the climatic piano solo played for the German officer that Szpilman may have been reduced to starvation and hiding for his life, but the life of his soul, the purpose and spirit are still just as fiery and abundant and flourishing as ever. The Piano itself has saved him from insanity, the piano that has always waited, and the moment of their reunion is one of the most brilliant pieces of filmwork ever.

642,Laert,To show how it really was like doesn't mean to make a good movie.,4,13 April 2003,"Spoiler!!!!!!!!! There are plenty of movies set in eastern Europe during the second World War. And I'm sure that ""The Pianist"" is not among the best of them. Certainly it is important for such a movie to create an adequate atmosphere, to let the audience feel the dimension of the brutality and inhumanity of the nazi regime. Yet I think that Polansky focused too much on it and the rest of the movie suffered from it.The movie was meant to be a portrait of Szpilman. Now, what have we learned about him? He survived the war, he lost his family and his possessions, he had to suffer... I didn't feel like I learned a lot about his nature. The same is to say about Szpilman's family. Polansky failed to show the uniqueness of his characters.Instead he showed many scenes of violence and brutality, a lot more than necessary to create the adequate atmosphere. What for? To show ignorant people that nazis did horrible things? But I don't think that ""The pianist"" was meant to be a movie for ignorant people. To let you feel the brutality? Well, after the fifth scene of that kind I wasn't able to feel anything of that kind any longer. It was just needless and disgusting.There are two scenes I want to point out. The first is the scene where the SS-officer finds Szpilman and forces him to play the piano. This is the most impressing scene of the whole movie. You feel the desperation in the music and the performance of both actors is great. Then the scene in which the same officer leaves his overcoat for Szpilman. Why did Polansky include this scene??? I can not find an answer. The outcome of it was so obvious that there could not be any suspense at all. Of course Szpilman runs out to meet the Russians in that coat, of course they think he is an SS-officer and shoot at him, of course he survives - 5 minutes of the movie completely lost.For those who would like to see a movie treating the same topic absolutely differently I recommend ""Gloomy Sunday"". And sorry for all the mistakes!",The Pianist
643,lilboyblue80,Best Holocaust movie I've seen,9,2 March 2003,"I've seen what I guess I would consider the three big Holocaust movies of recent years--Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful, and now the Pianist. Now, it's been awhile since I saw the first two, but I believe that the Pianist is the best one of the three for me.  It's also the Best Picture of the year, whether the Academy picks it or not!I was thinking totally different things after I watched this movie than I was after I had watched Schindler's List.  I remember thinking about how awful it must have been to go through what all those people went through after Schindler's List; all through the Pianist, all I could think about was the evil that human beings were committing against each other and wonder how that's even possible.  So while The Pianist doesn't portray the entire ordeal that the Jewish people endured from beginning to end quite like Schindler's List, I think it does a better job of communicating the even more terrifying idea that humans can be so evil.
****Spoilers****
The perfect example of this from the movie is when the Germans enter the apartment across the street from the family in the ghetto, and when the grandfather of the other family cannot stand up, they wheel him over to the balcony and dump him over.
Of course, the evil that human beings are capable of is not the only thing this movie portrays.  I love the climax of the movie, when the main character has his final encounter with the German who helps him.  ""How can I ever thank you?"" he asks.  ""Don't thank me,"" the German replies.  ""Thank God.  He wants us to survive.""  That doesn't seem to make much sense, considering everything else we've seen in the movie!  If God wants us to survive, why is he letting all this other stuff happen?  Well, for some reason, all this evil does go on, despite God's existence, but he wants us to survive, and he does preserve a remnant.  That's the entire history of the Jewish people--not just during the Holocaust!
As some other posters have pointed out, the movie does a good job of showing both good and evil in the Germans, good and evil in the Jewish community, and good and evil in the Poles--both sides of human nature in all groups. It's not black and white.
It's amazing to contrast the struggles of the characters in a movie like this one, and the characters in a movie like, say, The Hours.  Now, I thought The Hours was a very good movie.  I can relate to it relatively well; it's the kind of thing many of us in modern America deal with, even if we don't deal with those specific situations.  But whatever we're facing here, now, it's nothing compared to what those poor people in Warsaw were facing.  A movie like the Pianist really puts that in perspective.",The Pianist

646,sallyimad_90,Survivor Tale,10,4 December 2009,"In the movie ""The Pianist"", Władysław Szpilman is a famous Polish Jewish pianist working for Warsaw Radio. Jews were exterminated and massacred under the National Socialist German Workers' Party, or Nazis. The remaining population was humiliated, had to carry limited amount of money, and were discriminated by being forced to wear the blue Star of David, also the Nazis starved the Jews in order to exterminate as many people as quickly as they can. Finally, they put the rest in concentration camps and gassed them.Szpilman was among the slave labors in the ghetto, but he managed to escape from German captivity. He was hiding from bunker to bunker, looking desperately for bread crumbs or even a drop of water to help him survive for the next day. Szpilman survived with the help of his friend, and luck.Throughout the movie ""The Pianist"", the director Roman Polanski focused on the sadistic of the SS officers, especially when they throw out the handicap old man from the balcony because he could not salute them! Besides, the director illustrates another aspect of the movie, when he presents the passionate of the pianist, describing Szpilman playing piano.The horrible scenes of the annihilated buildings, streets, and houses associated with the style of dressing of the 1940, gave the movie a sense of reality. The idea of the movie focused on how a human can survive using his brain, and luck is a good example of what the movie addressed. We can see that through the chances Szpilman had; he was arrested, sent to a ghetto, he escaped and got shot, and finally a German officer discovered that he was hiding, instead of killing him, he gave him food and looked after him.",The Pianist

I saw it at the end of January and weeks later Wladyslaw is still in my mind, his story, his trials and his love for life. Polanski's best work to date, Adrien Brody pulls off the best work of his career so far, hopefully this will be one of his building blocks to greater works. I have told everyone i know to see this movie, to open up their minds to the hatred and passion depicted in this horror of a tale.

652,gmj2005,A Masterpiece,10,20 February 2012,"A true masterpiece of a film, and Adrien Brody is the master actor such as I've never seen before. Until now I'd only seen him in the odd mafia flick, but in this he was sublime. All the actors gave amazing portrayals, but for me Brody stands out perhaps because of the extremes he was required to go to in this role. I'm not sure if Brody is a piano player, if he's not, then he may be the best actor I've ever seen. The viewer becomes invested in the characters of this film, but Brody is our guide through it all, and his character is the most developed of them all in this film. Others were scant where they could have been more full, maybe. The production quality, the settings, dismal depressing & terrifying scenes, all seemed nearly too real, one can easily lose themselves in this movie, immersing so fully it is nearly a shock when the ending comes & one is thrust back into the modern time and body. I had no idea this movie existed until today, nearly 10 years after its release. I watched it on a lark, not expecting anything of this level certainly. Once it began, I was lost to it through the last piano note.",The Pianist

I do not know too many films of 150 minutes length, which has the power to keep its viewers so well fascinated by its powerful story and the main character as The Pianist did to me. The fact that this was based on a book, which was written by the real main character himself, is make this film even more interesting. No Hollywoodish script could compete with such a story in a million years.Even beyond of the cinematic achievement, films such as The Pianist play a role of modern day history documents. When the last of the Holocaust survivor will go, society will be left with diaries, books, museums and such films to refresh its darkest memories of its past.10/10.",The Pianist
654,boatking,Good film!,7,18 August 2017,"This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is. The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European. And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).",The Pianist

It's a very quiet movie in my opinion, doesn't have many chaotic moments which I think it's fine cause the real objective is to show the war by his perspective, the guy who has to hide away in order to stay alive. Just perfect.",The Pianist
656,RedRidz,"Amazing, vivid and unforgettable Movie!",9,28 August 2012,"What a fabulous movie! Very very touching and realistic. One of Adolf Hitler's first major foreign policy initiatives after coming to power was to sign a nonaggression pact with Poland in January 1934. Poland had received the former German provinces of West Prussia, Poznan, and Upper Silesia under the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. Britain and France deployed their force in poland. However, neither Britain nor France in 1938 was militarily prepared to fight a war against Nazi Germany.During that time, people were in exigency and crisis. This film shows that exact situation. People were inconsequential. I saw how people endured the situation, how they were killed by Nazies . Certainly I'm going to give this credit to Roman Polanski and Ronald Harwood for making this film so realistic. Haven't seen such a worst situation before this. What is crisis? You will come to know after watching this film. This film shows exactly how it was in real. A poor hungry old man threw a bowl of food from being eaten by a poor woman. The poor old man licked the road in order to eat the food that came out of the bowl. The man was deranged though. This one is my best part of this movie. Another best part is, a young boy was selling caramel for 20 zlotys. A caramel for 20 zlotys! Can you believe this? Situation materialized it. Wladyslaw's father intended to buy a caramel. However, he had only 10 zlotys. So he collected other 10 from others around him. Worse part is, he divided the caramel into 6 pieces and distributed to other members of his family. Very very pathetic and regretful. There are so many tremendous moments that touched my heart but I can't mention them all simultaneously.I'm impressed seeing the survive of Wladyslaw.Every film doesn't have a great ending, nevertheless this film has a great ending! Of course the Nazies were vanquished in the end.",The Pianist

My favorite part is when the pianist hides himself in that apartment, eating crumbs, starving nearly to death, playing imaginary piano and watching tank destroying resistentes from window - it's a confinement but also a safe shell, with delicate comfort and delusion and temptation of death and aspiration of life. It's like my own personal experience when facing stress, hiding myself in a physiological or physical safe corner, facing the temptation to live like this for the rest of my life, and finally force myself to get out to face the outside world.

The war-torn realism and sheer horror re-created under the direction of Roman Polanski shook me to the core. I cried several times during the film, and it was difficult to make it though the end of the movie. I can easily understand now, why Polanski received an Academy award for best director, and Adrian Brody for Best Actor. The role of Wladyslaw Szpilman would've taxed and challenged the talents of any elite male actor in Hollywood, and yet Adrien Brody accomplished the task better than anyone I can imagine. He translated the character's hopes, loves, and especially his horror and despair in such a genuine fashion, that it's amazing that it comes from a 20-something year old actor. Makes me wonder how & where he was able to draw those intense emotions to make it seem so real. Anyway, this is a film that I think every person should see at least one time, for any number of reasons.",The Pianist

662,Nicki77,Superb and very touching,10,14 February 2013,"This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one, sensitive man whose family are torn from him (never to be seen again, perished in the Holocaust) and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror whilst in hiding during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust (of which there are many all-consuming portrayals of only a fraction of the stories which occurred). Brody puts in a marvellous and utterly touching performance as Szpilman. The story is abound with terribly moving vignettes which depict the emotional and cultural breakdown of Warsaw's persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them; the overall inability of the community to stand-up to the systematic destruction of their neighbours; the acceptance to wear the Star of David armband (the scene where his father is hit by Nazis and forced to walk in the gutter rather than on the pavement); the arrogant survivalist attitudes of the Jewish Sonderkomando-police force; the young Jewish boy profiteering from petty food-stocks in the ghetto holding area; and then the opportunists, like Szalas, who manipulate Jewish fugitives in hiding outside of the ghetto. The relationship between Szpilman and Hosenfeld may seem to come into the story far later than expected – about three quarters of the way through – but it is nevertheless the right moment, arriving at the most vulnerable time for both characters – and Polanski creates nothing short of a masterful 'forbidden fruit' by way of coupling the pair, united in their passion for the piano, but whereby the discovery of their friendship would spell immediate death. Superb. It is both touching and a reality check when Hosenfeld offers Szpilman his great-coat, adding afterwards that he has another, warmer one for himself in a slight, yet perhaps ashamed, departure from his humane self and a return to his Nazi persona. The dark humour which later follows up this parting-scene – (Russian soldier: ""What's with the f*****g coat"", Szpilman : ""I'm cold"") – was a welcome piece of comic relief however bleak the subtext. The film's ending is with both deep sadness for the lives lost and destruction wrought, and, with a staunch optimism for the future. In my opinion ""The Pianist"" is one of the greatest Holocaust films made. The horrors are not forced upon us in the face, but they are presented using the eyes of one man, hidden away from it, seeing it only as an escapee and we get an understanding of its emotional scale to a far greater extent as we are forced to think and hide with him.",The Pianist

Well at the second viewing on DVD it was still as powerful and haunting - however I say this with a great deal of respect to Polanski - I will never watch this movie again. You know the feeling you have when you just had an awful day at work, had some horrible news from a friend and there is reports about a natural disaster that have devastated the life of thousands on the news. All you want to do is get a bit of escape from reality with a nice movie in the evening. A word of advice - Do not watch the Pianist. Yes is is a masterpiece - but oh so depressing.

Adrien Brody's character escapes and the rest of the movie circles around his experience... the movie was OK, but really overrated. Overall Adrien Brody does a great job, but not his best work.

It aims to do exactly what it did and it presented me with conflicting emotions on what I felt was a very consistently tense feeling throughout the film as there is always a looming danger, it also pieces together the beginning of the war to the end and the downfall of the reich and the personal struggle of a man through one very real and unfortunate story of resilience and struggle that ultimately left me wanting to wipe the film from my memory and be able to watch it over from the start, great film and would recommend it to anyone looking for a very real and gritty outlook on the reality and brutality of being a Jewish person at that moment of history",The Pianist
667,solussemper,The Pianist is a great Movie.,10,6 August 2014,"The 2002 film the Pianist was an amazing story of Wladyslaw Szpilman a World War two holocaust survivor. This film was directed by Roman Polanski who himself was a Holocaust survivor. This combination created a film that brings the Holocaust to the big screen in a way never before realized. Szpilman is played in the film by Adrien Brody, who does an exceptional job at portraying the stoic Szpilman. This film represents in many ways the any of the Holocaust survivors, and the seeming randomness of the means by which they survived, as many did not. The director did not choose to make this a thriller for a purpose while there were certainly parts of this story that were thrilling to the survivor, Polanski's direction places emphasis on the mundane things, that at any moment could have gotten Szpilman caught. It was this chance, this randomness that Polanski wanted to bring to the viewer. The cinematography in this helps add to the grittiness and the realism of the film. In the final scenes when Hosenfeld, played by Thomas Kretschmann, discoveres Szpilmans hiding place Polanski uses pause in a very masterful way. In fact Polanski's use of pause throughout the movie brings it to life. I really enjoyed this film, I had never seen it before but as a World War Two film fan, I really enjoyed the story from a personal perspective. The fact that Polanski himself was a Holocaust survivor just adds to my interest, and love of the film. This film is a fantastic example of the stories of the Holocaust survivors.",The Pianist

676,jhaile1,The Pianist (observation and comment),10,1 October 2006,"What a film! The character played by Adrien Brody was so magnificently and accurately projected. Compared to other films of the era, the actor projected the character with dignity. Even when it was so difficult to remain rational in an irrational time, the character was humble and focused. The characters played by the other cast members were just as smart and outstanding, some times challenging to understand as to why 'Henrick'would react in the way he does to some of the brutes the Germans inflict on ""Jewish prisoners."" Despite his reactions it was also refreshing to know that he would refuse to join the 'Zander Commanders', which he could but he declines to the offer. In times of such difficulties people would do anything to sustain their life even if it is for a second, yet 'Henrick' would refuse to abide by that nature of human traits. Some one said once, 'temptation is a true measure of character.' Even though by joining the 'Zander Commander' he could have benefited himself and his families' stay in the camp would have been improved for the remaining of their days before they were gassed should he join, but he was clear and firm that he wouldn't join'em. It was also comforting to learn that some people in the Polish civil society remained rational in such trying times, such as hiding Szpilman in their flats. Why would they take risk in hiding a Jewish man in their house? I have seen many films projecting a certain time-frame in the history of mankind, this film by far outplays them all. Like 'The Diary of Anne Frank this too is based on true story that really took place in the last century. The Jewish people have suffered tremendously thru out history, especially in Europe. The story projected in this film tingles a normal human to a state of sadness to a point of making one question that such people (Germans/NAZIS) did exist at some point in contemporary Europe. Since I have seen this film I grew very interested in learning why people hate others to such a degree? I have yet to come to the understanding of the concept of hate, but I am learning. Some experts say that hate is a result of fear embraced by self doubt that the hate-monger espouse due to fear he/she may not be able to compete and win over the person/s they wish/intend to eradicate.",The Pianist
677,Shade-3,Polanski's dormant talents blossom in this screen adaptation,10,25 December 2002,"Mr. Polanski has been investigating other realms for a few years now, with some head-rearing during The Ninth Gate and Bitter Moon, though the grand genius has been muffled in those tales. Here, Mr. Polanski's unique cinematic vision erupts in dangerous imagery as only he can bring it to the screen. The scene where the man in the wheelchair is thrown from the window loudly echoes Trelkowski's fall(s) in The Tenant. Polanski functions at his best when working with an 'outsider' tale and here has a protagonist who is an outsider in every sense, from the first frame to the last. Alone in the studio with his piano, a sole individual inside his tight family, and alone in Warsaw, Adrian Brody's portrayal of Wladislaw Szpilman's true outsider offers Polanski the method to achieve his strong telling of the solitary individual. I will never forget the bent-over death contortions of the female fighter in the streets, Brody's pain at losing him family on a train bound for Treblinka. Mr. Polanski, thank you for your work, and for your dynamic telling of a little-understood period of history. Bravo!",The Pianist
678,henryfool,a brooding brody eloquently stars in a film that has been done many times before.,6,29 January 2003,"First, let me state that this is my first review on IMDb - so the film touched me enough that I feel compelled to comment on it.
Second, Adrien Brody was excellent.However, films about the German horrors against European Jews are not a new thing.  There are very few people who will see this film that have not already seen others (i.e. Europa, Europa, Schindler's List).  Because this film is likely not a wide release it can't claim any role in being a ""learning tool"" for those ignorant of the horrors of WWII.  Therefore, I think Polanski did the story injustice by inserting too many blatant acts of brutality.The film marginalizes itself with these obvious acts into a wartime horror film, instead of dealing more abstractly with the true impact of war on a single human or family.The film does not pick up until the second half when the pianist is forced to escape on his own.  It doesn't deal enough with the problems encountered by those harboring Jews (only very briefly alluding to it) and could have done more with the German officer character who truely becomes this person's saviour.In all, the film is well done.

The musical component gives this story a hopeful reality others don't share. It makes you feel starved and cold, alone and chased by evil. Even minutely hopeful.Many people think ""enough already"" and often turn away from ""Holocaust movies"" since each is painful to watch. Don't do that or mankind increases its risk of global genocide. Watch this no matter what and be frightened by historic reality. Chopin, Beethoven and Bach will revive your spirit as you never imagined. Participate in making peace.",The Pianist
680,Angle Eyes,good movie,8,11 February 2003,"This movie is beautifully shot and features some great acting. It has a nice mix of romance, drama and action scenes. The piano music fits the story nicely. I could not help but compare ThePianist to Schindler'sList, which i think is slightly better, as it has a more complete plot. ThePianist's plot is a bit thin; we get to see how the Jewish Pianist experiences the war years in Poland, chronologically. There's only a very thin connection between the things that happen and the fact that he's a pianist, which imho is not so satisfactory.Don't get me wrong; it's a good, sad, movie: see it if you can.",The Pianist
681,valy1111,A very lousy movie.(some spoilers),5,8 June 2003,"There are so many things that I don't know with what to start. I think I will begin with main character though. OK, Adrien Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a somewhat known pianist that was working at Warsaw radio station. But the war starts and everybody's life is about to change. Then the whole movie watches closely the main character during WW2. I have to say that the plot is practically inexistent in this movie. Szpilman never does something interesting, he doesn't try to help anyone, people are dying everywhere around him and he shows almost no emotion(he just watches). Fortunately there are several people who help him, otherwise he would have died too. You can't sympathize much with the character and there is no romance involved, no love story in this movie(though I think it's more real this way). Near the end Szpilman almost gets shot by russians that confused him with a german(because of the coat he was wearing). If they would have killed him that time that would have been really hilarious(but I guess he was lucky - those russians probably were not too good shooters since they missed in close range like that; perhaps if they were germans. :D).Considering the times I can say that people were actually eating food almost all the time. In fact I have never seen before a movie that presented so many people eating. I remember what one of the characters said: `Food is more important then time.'. Well who can argue with that anyway ? The effect that it had on me is that I got hungry too. I'm not sure that this was was the intention, but that's what happened(the movie was quite lenghty too).Is this movie is good at something then that is without question to present the atrocities of war. It shows people being humiliated, shot without reason, burned alive, beaten to death(even children !), run over with a truck, thrown out the window, blown to bits by a tank's cannon etc. If this is your thing you might need some kind of medical treatment.Since most of the reviews end with a recommendation, I will make one too. I would like to recommend it but frankly I don't have for what. Weak interpretation of the main actor, boring script, though it has some very good piano music towards the end. My mark is 5 out of 10.I apologize for any grammar/spelling mistakes made. English is not my native language.(IMDb spelling check is very good and helped me a lot to correct some of the mistakes). Ah, and one more thing in case you are confused: War is definitively not good.",The Pianist

In many ways, the movie remembered me of La vita è bella, especially in the gut feelings it rendered.I don't cry often when I see movies, but when I carry the plot through my next dreams, I don't tend to forget them.

Its not a bad film, in fact it is very well constructed and quite moving. But I guess I just could not escape the feeling that it was begging the audience for sorrow and feelings of guilt. Maybe even commercially trading on the murder of millions of Jews? I felt that it was a one sided political message. Anyway I was worried that the Pianist was going to be of the same ilk. How wrong I was. There are no political overtones, it is simply a stunningly crafted human story of one man's survival through the horrors of Jewish oppression and WW2. The film is tragically beautiful. The soundtrack is haunting, and the acting superb. The story is simple and well crafted and the cinematography is gorgeous.

The film was a co-production of France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Poland.

It really made me think back to how it was in Szpilman's day. The best bit was when Hosenfeld saved Szpilman. That shows that in every bad group there might be some good people. It was sad at the end when Szpilman couldn't save Hosenfeld, because, even if he is German, he had saved Szpilman shouldn't have been sent to the concentration camp. I rate this movie a 7 because it had both a part of fictional parts (which might not be that unreal) and both a bit of history in it. It was a shame to see the Nazis doing all those horrible things to the Jews but it was very inspiring and recommend this film to you even if it might be a bit gross in some parts.

As there a bunch of movies showing the horror and terror about War and Nazi Germany, but this movies stands on a different level in this arena. One moment to another we just cannot move our eyes from the screen because of the sensational acting performance of Adrien Brody and Glorious direction of Roman Polinski. There are many scenes in the movie where you can do nothing but imagine how human mind can get corrupt to certain beleifs and turn that beleif into something that no one ever can imagine.

I cannot fault anything about this movie and the devotion Adam Brody must have put in to play Chopin is fantastic! Being a musician myself I cannot express how hard and stressful it would have been to learn to do that in such a short time. I think that Roman has made a perfect movie here and there is not one thing that he could do to better it. The quality of the acting from all the cast in particular Adam Brody is absolute perfection. It really makes you think you are there living the nightmare with them, and this is what good films are all about. They make you emotionally attached and I am so glad I was not living in the war.

The fact that you can see the horror of the holocaust through the eyes of a normal family makes everything more believable. Polansky wisely decided not to include a love story (not even hinted at)and the Warsaw ghetto looks exactly like you can see on the history books. Superb acting and directing, some scenes of this movie you will probably never forget: after being arrested by the SS, a group of jews stands in line and are told to be ready to move. ""Where are you taking us?"" a woman asks shyly. The answer is a bullet through her head, shot by the SS officer Whenever the SS raid a house, you are actually inside the house yourself, looking for a way to escape...

Its genre is war/drama and directed by Roman Polanski. Also, it is an adaptation of a real person's life, Wladyslaw Szpilman. Throughout the movie, you will witness his process of trying to escape the war. Szpilman was acted by Adrien Brody and his performance was amazing. When I watched this movie for the first time, I felt every emotion so intense. I felt his loneliness, despair, sadness, and tiredness. Especially, the scene of walking in the street -between a lot of ruins- and playing piano in his mind on a chair was impressive. Adrien Brody won the Oscar for the Best Actor with this performance and it made him the youngest actor to win in this category. If I watched this movie at that time, I could say this was not a surprise. As far as I can remember, I was also impressed by the colors of the scenes. You can see so much grey and blue in the scenes. They made the scenes colder and more effective. There was a lot of pain in the movie and to know they are real is really painful. The people who eat from the floor, die because of thirst and hunger or just for they talked...

In addition, I can say that the music in the film also impressed me very much.

He simply does what needs to be done to survive.And Adrien Brody captures what Szpilman must have been like. (From some angles he resembles the young Arthur Rubenstein.)

Gorgeous camera-work from Polanski that perfectly captures the desolation and destruction of wartime Poland. Perfect pacing in terms of storytelling. On top of this, an achingly beautiful subplot that highlights the sorrow of a man who is stripped of his ability to express his innermost feelings through music, a craft which he has dedicated his entire life to. The soundtrack music that we do hear is rightfully tragic.

713,qodtorren,So over-rated...,4,3 October 2003,"Simply put, I was NOT impressed by this movie.  For as much hype as it got, I expected a well done, bleak and depressing, nazi era film.  Well it wasn't.The characters are cut outs of the traumatized people we are supposed to feel intimate with.  The storyline moves along too fast, and we get no chance to develop an attachment to anyone.  It's as if Polanski assumes we will automatically feel a sadness and connection to anyone persecuted by the Nazi's.  Well in real life, of course.  It's as if we are hurried along just so the director can get us to the point in the movie where we watch Adrian Brody's character suffer, starving and freezing.  None of the relationships felt authentic, but they had all the trappings to make them look that way.By the end of the film I was left feeling like there could have been so much more.  I don't think I missed the point on this one.  So many people fell head over heels for this film, but personally I think it's a shallow love affair.  And yes, I probably sound angry.  That's because I was hoping this film would be all that it seemed.  You won't really be wasting your time seeing it, and you might like it, but it's not a gut-wrenching depiction of Nazi-era cruelty.",The Pianist
714,Digesis,"Bravo, yet another Holocaust film!",10,20 January 2003,"The reason I found this film to be so compelling is because yet again another movie expresses the destruction of humanity during the Holocaust. I don't think this topic can ever be ""overdone"", and I'm glad that a film about the subject is made consistently every few years. The beauty of this film is that our protagonist is not a ""hero"" in the classical sense. He's an artist struggling to survive. Living in a life of music and beauty didn't prepare him to run from the Gestapo. We don't see him jumping out of windows and landing on his feet, nor do we see him beat up the bad guys, or ever really fight back. Instead we see him stumble, run, and beg for his life. His character illustrates what a ""real"" person did to escape brutality. Brody's performance is amazing! The depression and isolation Szpilman must have felt is portrayed so convincingly. The parallels with the classical music works extremely well. The music lived within Szpilman just like his will to live did. Neither of these could be taken away nor locked up. A definite 10+ from me.",The Pianist
715,9902439Claessens,the best holocaust movie ever made,10,1 October 2002,"last weekend, I saw Roman Polanski's The Pianist and what a movie. The grizzly reality feeling of the movie shell-shocked me in the first place but later on I recognized the pure feeling of the film: The horror what war does with innocent people truly is. the main story isn't about a war hero, but about people who don't want to die in this madness. Every aspect of the film is really done for an reason and in his place and you don't feel this as entertainment.the music is what hit me the most. the classical tunes had such an enormous impact on me and portrayed the feelings of the main role of the pianist. The fact that there are no hero's in a war movie is for me more than a welcome benefit. No war in the world should have hero's who can't die. Everybody in this movie can die, every second of it. The scary moments are real scary.

721,drella1966,The best Polish film in years,10,9 September 2002,"I was not a big fan of Polanski's work before I saw 'The Pianist.' I wasn't crazy about 'Rosemary's Baby' or 'Chinatown,' or any of his early his that some of my friends watched millions of times. I kind of liked 'Repulsion,' but that was it, and I'd only seen it once and have not felt like giving it a try again since. But watching Roman's latest release felt like something so much different, something more than any of the 'good' films I have enjoyed watching in the past weeks, years maybe. Throughout the whole two and a half hours, I was never for a single second bored or distracted, my thoughts could not drift away from the story that was so majestically unwrapping in front of me, making me a solitary witness of Wladyslaw Szpilman's wartime fate.The entire room was silent from the first moment, when on screen appeared pre-war movie chronicles, showing Warsaw on a sunny summer day, with people crowding its streets, parks, theaters and avenues, lined with 19th century apartment buildings, similar to the ones you can see in today's Vienna or Prague. And then the viewer's quickly taken indoors of the building where the Polish Radio station used to be, inexisting today, into the recording studio where the well known pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is on the air, in the middle of a concert created by that most Polish of all composers, the quintessential exiled patriot spilling his heart out in memory of his lost fatherland, also one of the most talented pianists of all time, Frederic Chopin. Chopin's music will return later in the film, and in the grandiose closing scene the surviving Szpilman will be shown once again, playing his music in front of a full-house audience in the Warsaw Philharmonic, barely a year after the end of the war. It has been pointed out by the all-knowing Polish film critics that such a 'structure' is typical of Polanski's works, as many of his movies begin and end with a very similar scene, the story coming back to the point where it had started. Is it something that comes out unnatural? Artificial? Awkward? Certainly not, and having witnessed the whole terrible madness and turmoil of war, the viewer barely notices the resemblance between that elegant, solemn concert at the end of the film and the more 'private,' intimate moment of Szpilman's opening performance so brutally interrupted by bombings. But the critics w i l l  analyze that, so let them do it. that's how they earn their bread.But what annoyed me most about one unfriendly review of 'The Pianist,' published in one of Poland's most popular weeklies, 'Polityka,' was the unprofessional tone of the writing, which all in all sounded more like some piece written for a school paper by a cross young boy  envious of a friend's successful performance in a school play. The author just could not resist painting himself as a lone ranger daring to criticize a medium-quality film (or, as he puts it, an unfulfilled work made of a very promising story), while everyone else in Cannes was on their knees complimenting the director on his latest production. Very strange, because in my opinion a critic at work would better use their eyes and hearts and souls rather than their personal feelings, especially the pride and envy that devours them, when finally, after years of repetitive and imitative trash we have been given a truly great movie. And what do the critics do? They ignore completely the authentic and deeply moving power that radiates from the screen, and put down the absurd statement that Adrien Brody's acting is 'surprisingly emotionless, as if the whole story was happening next to him, without his participation.' And all that under a huge still of the actor walking by himself on a deserted ghetto street with scattered personal belongings of the people just driven away to be executed, with as desperate a look on his face as it's only possible, including red eyes screaming desperation, beautifully raised eyebrows and a half-open mouth- the face of a weeping, deeply disturbed man.And in the end I'd like to add that, again in spite of what the critics say, this film is not a cleverly made string of tricks that Polanski turns on us, nor is it a line of very convincing 'real-life scenes' from the ghetto, shown more like stills on a projector than a film production. It is in fact a rather fast-paced story, only as fast as needed to give the viewer an honest picture of what war was like in Warsaw, or, for that matter, any other big town in Poland (Polanski himself spent much time in the ghetto in Cracow when he was a child). It has scenes of fighting: we learn about the outbreak and defeat of the Ghetto uprising in 1943, and the great Warsaw Uprising in August 1944, at the same time as Szpilman, already in hiding outside of the ghetto. We see examples of bravery and sacrifice, but also of spite, swindles and denunciation. But also we see people passing through Szpilman's life, touching him for a moment, then disappearing, then emerging again, by chance, people he has known, people he loved, befriended, people who helped and who used him to get their own. And finally the incredible character of the German officer, wonderfully placed by Thomas Kretschman, to whose kindness the artist was to owe his life, illuminates the story with a lighter, poetic shade of raw feeling. And, very important information for all my American friends: it's all in English, except for a few passages in German which I believe are accompanied by subtitles!",The Pianist
722,admat,without passion...,7,7 September 2002,"Very simple form, very serious and important subject - how to estimate? Second world war, ghettos, Judes extermination are well known topic for Poles and rather unknown for the others, unfortunately... People from European countries, from USA etc. can see the cruelty of war time that Polish people already know. But the form is almost academic and this is why I have some remarks.  First of all: Brody is too young and his play is without feelings, we can feel a big distance between the film director and the film matter (Polanski was a ghetto prisoner!), there is no passion in this movie - like it was in Spielberg's ""Schindler List"". I can't just say: ""good film"" or ""bad film"", but I should say: ""very realistic"".",The Pianist

It is a dramatical film, but what is really amazing about it is the fact that it is based on a true story. It also encourages us to think that there is good out there even if it is surrounded by evil. If you do not watch this than you will be missing quite a thrill.

730,kmlincke,A must see!,10,13 November 2002,"I was deeply touched by this film about a Polish pianist trying to escape the horrors of the Warsaw Ghetto.Other than many Holocaust movies, this one has no humorous intermezzi to interrupt the gruesome reality displayed. I consider this to be an interesting directorial choice. In a way it makes it even harder to watch, but that's what makes it more realistic than other films about this subject. Reality in the Warsaw Ghetto was torture, period.Film will always be an entertainment medium. Therefore the director needs to be extremely careful not to turn a serious topic like the Holocaust into something ""entertaining"", for example by bringing up a lighter subject every now and then, allowing the viewer to relax. Polanski did a fantastic job in using the medium without jeopardizing the contents of his film. No emotional scene was cheesy, no scene appears ""staged"", no over dramatized acting, no tearjerking violins. And the result: an even more emotionally moving piece. A message that doesn't seem forced, and yet there is one.
On a side note: I venture to say not every Nazi was intentionally doing evil. Many jumped on the bandwagon not knowing what they got themselves into, unable to quit once they found out. Watch carefully, especially towards the ending, and you will discover an interesting character.

731,aarojame,Watch this movie!,10,13 May 2003,This was truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. The Pianist left me speechless when I left the theater. Adrian Brody was brilliant as Wladyslaw Szpilman in his true life struggle for survival during the Nazi invasion of Poland. Not since the Diary of Anne Franke has a story of a Jewish family or an individual that is hiding for their life been so emotional. This is a must see for every person!,The Pianist
732,apnycla,Oscar Bound,10,5 December 2002,"""The Pianist"" is poignant, disturbing and chilling, yet, somehow remains encouraging and hopeful.  The great lengths at which one will go to survive, or at which others will assist in survival while risking their own lives is encouraging and hopeful, reminding us to be mindful of one another and accepting of each others differences.The acting is sensational!  I would declare an Oscar nomination is in store for Adrien Brody. The transformation he undergoes is nothing short of brilliant!  He is subtle and natural.  At times there is literally no dialogue and in the silence there is greatness achieved.  Jessica Kate Meyer is also exceptional as is Ed Stoppard, Maureen Lipman, Frank Finlay and so many others right down to the extras that were cast.This film is graphic.  You want to close your eyes, but it forces us to recognize that we cannot close our eyes to hatred and the destruction of humanity.",The Pianist

It will be a timeless classic I know of that. Brody's acting was subtle and right to the point. You could feel everything he was feeling by just looking in his eyes. Not only was this movie inspiring but it was true and that makes it that much MORE inspiring. To survive in the lowest forms of life, to have everything taken from you and still persevere, is a miracle. It's hard for many of us to believe, but it did happen. Some users have said that it is not as good as those of other holocaust movies. But I believe they all tell a different story so can you really compare? This one, The Pianist, seems to really capture the life of the ghetto. Sure you escape the death camps but you've only escaped a camp, not death. It didn't let anything go by, it was true to World War II's awful images. I reccommend this to anyone who wants to see a beautifully written story about a man's life.",The Pianist
735,AC_G,Grand Review,10,10 March 2003,"Unbelievable film. This deserves the Oscar for best picture. Hands down the best film of the year. Adrien Brody delivers a masterful performance.

736,jomarie10,Thought Provoking,10,22 January 2003,"I saw this film several nights ago and find myself still thinking about it several nights later. I will not bore other readers with a rehash of the plot, but I will say that this is certainly the most challenging film of about the Holocaust I have seen. Roman Polanski has delivered an amazing portrait of the horror and the beauty of human life. Polanski justly deserves every bit of praise and award he receives for being so honest and so skilled at delivering movie to the world. The role of randomness, fate and just blind luck in the survival of Szpilman, and by extension everyone who perished or survived those years, has humbled and horrified as a human being. That he survived to write out his story is amazing when you consider how many times he might have made the wrong turn, or said the wrong thing, knocked on the wrong door and met his end. That he survived and was able to write his story with unflinching honesty and without gloryfing his own actions is even more remarkable. How many of us could be so honest and not be tempted to cloak ourselves in heroic actions? Many people have commented on Szpilman apparent lack of heroism. They seem bothered that he was just a man who was pushed into freedom and helped along by many acts of kindness, as if this was a character flaw, that he would be more worth a movie if he had been more daring and noble. In an odd way it was his passiveness in the face of danger that in part gave him the chance to survive and then to tell his tale to the world. Szpilman, as a friend said to me, is an everyman, neither sinner or saint, hero or villian. None of us who have never experienced anything remotely akin to his situation can predict with honesty how they would behave if confronted with the same choices.  We would all like to think we would behave bravely, nobly and honestly, but we can never be sure what the deep desire to live would lead us to do in our human need to cling to life. I would also like to add my appreciation for Adrien Brody's remarkable performance. It was so subtle that it appeared not to be acting. This was a performance of remarkable depth. He deserves an Oscar, although I doubt he will receive it. Subtle and understated never is well appreciated. I recommend this movie to anyone who has an ounce of taste and love of filmaking as an art. This will be something that will stay with you long after you leave the theater.",The Pianist

738,SpongeBob5862,An amazing film; highly recommended,10,30 July 2009,"Set during the time of the holocaust, The Pianist traces the life of Jewish-Polish musician Wladyslaw Szpilman. He faces many struggles such as being separated from his family and friends. He is also forced to hide with the help of non-Jews. One of the people that help Szpilman is Hosenfeld, a captain of the German Army.I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves music. The soundtrack is simply superb, and it adds another layer of depth to Szpilman's profound life story. I think this movie also shows the real power of human compassion during times of struggle.The Pianist also features the acting talent of Adrian Brody and the directing talent of Roman Polanski. Both of them did an excellent job in communicating Szpilman's story to the audience. This is probably one of the best movies made about the holocaust.",The Pianist

So many young kids do not know the meaning of our freedom and rights. Seeing this movie will be a wake up call; hopefully before it is too late. Without telling the details of the movie, the movie has beautiful scenery, people and buildings. At first I did not think I would like the movie since it was about a Pianist; I knew nothing about it. I quickly changed my mind. The fact that this man was a pianist was not the central theme; it was used to show his life and that of all his family. The actors and actresses were beautiful and the roles were the finest acting.The actor who played 'the Pianist' was fantastic and haunting. The scenes were of beautiful color.

I was absored completely by this movie. I felt the pain of each character, and i cried at the end of the movie. And especially the main one. I'm a musician myself, and i can appreciate it from the eyes of a musician. After all him being a PIANIST has saved his life. That's the power of music, that's the power of talent. Adrien Brody is a great actor, at least in this movie. He not only portrayed Mr. Szpillman, he was LIVING in his flesh. He deserivs an Oscar more than anyone else. He touched me to the depth of my heart. And it really is hard for any actor/actress to do. I very rarely get impressed SO much these days, when there's so much of crap out there!

We do not flinch from the story or move to another part of the story when things get agonizing. We stay with Wadislaw Spzilman. We see how his life and the lives around him are transformed by what starts out as all-too familiar discrimination and paranoia and devolves into an inhuman cruelty that has rarely if ever been matched in history.Seeing the Holocaust from a first-person perspective, with a master such as Polanski at the helm and such an intelligent lead is a revelation.",The Pianist

The pace is real, the faces galvanizing in their humanness, the emotions are not over-charged yet bursting with raw violence and unanswered questions.More happy, cosy Americans should see this, a few times; hopefully gaining if only the slightest gut-wrenching understanding of what war is really like, on the loosing side.  If it appears boring to you, then you are lost, for you remember not, nor have interest in history and are bound one sad day, to repeat it.This movie is not happy, nor should it be, but the horrible truth it speaks (yet only of one life here) needs to be poured like salt over our minds as we watch true atrocity; to keep the wounds raw, so as not to forget; ever.I give it 10/10 for keeping the brutality of history alive in our hearts, thereby adjusting our perspective on life.",The Pianist
749,lindahl-alex,Solemlny Beautiful,10,24 October 2010,"The plight of this Polish pianist is one that could not be created. The feelings evoked by this film are backed up by the authenticity of the personal account it was based upon. Yet, as most Holocaust films/stories are emotionally powerful, this one was different. It was not based in any sort of concentration camp or labor camp. The man somewhat free in body, but tightly jailed in spirit.Throughout the entire first part of the film, it may be gaged that Szpilman is a quite a reserved person. He, unlike his brother, does not lash out at the ongoings of the Nazis. This personal trait makes the emotion felt from the film that much more awing. Because of his reserved nature, the watchers are lead deep into Szpilman's being when we are able to sense his feelings.Isolation is another huge piece in this film that takes it to the near limits of human capacity. As soon as he is split from his family, Szpilman never has any kind of deep interaction with another being. The account goes as far as to let him live alone for somewhere around a year. There is one scene specifically in which the isolation hits an unimaginable peak, due in part to the way the scene is set up.As soon as Szpilman is split from his family, the entire movie takes the turn of complete bleak color. The luster of color had been toned down once the Nazis started to occupy Warsaw, but the color becomes much more toned down.I can honestly say this is one of few films to touch in such a way. The guilt he feels for living, and his family dying leaves me speechless. Adrian Brody does an excellent job of portraying the solidarity of Szpilman's spirit during his time of hiding. The mood of the entire film is excellently presented, and perhaps much in part to personal relations of Polanski. The classical music played throughout the film doesn't do any damage either. And finally, the somewhat strange 'love story' between Szpilman and the music is as beautiful, if not more, than most love stories out there today. The Pianist is a truly magnificent and emotionally stimulating film.",The Pianist
750,fedechirinos,Incredible,9,7 April 2015,"The Pianist is a very personal story for two men: Wladyslaw Szpilman, the eponymous subject of the film and author of the book on which it was based, and director Roman Polanski, whose own horrific war time experiences paralleled Szpilman's. As an artistic Jewish youngster growing up in Poland during the holocaust, Polanski was able to identify closely with Szpilman and use his traumatic tale to convey his own feelings about life in Poland under Nazi rule. Although personal, it is also a universal story of endeavour, triumph, fate and resilience. The emotionally charged subject in the hands of such an impassioned and gifted director has resulted in a film of heart-wrenching tragedy and chilling horror, and one fully deserving of the honors bestowed upon it - including the coveted Palme D'or at Cannes - and Adrien Brody in the title role. While The Pianist focuses on one person's extraordinary story, it also emphasises that almost every holocaust survivor possesses an equally terrifying account. Almost without exception, each would make a worthy subject to film, but with so many already existing, it becomes increasingly hard to do so in an original and effective way. Even during the course of The Pianist, the brutality of the Nazis, exemplified by the many scenes depicting arbitrary and callous executions, becomes all too familiar. That doesn't diminish its impact, but it does make one yearn for a fresh perspective. What The Pianist is able to offer in this regard is the true story of a gifted young Jewish musician whose world was his family and his music, until he was deprived of both when the Germans invaded Poland in 1939. Szpilman was an intense young man, living in an upscale neighbourhood of Warsaw with his extensive family, including his mother (Maureen Lipman), father (Frank Finlay), brother Henryk (Ed Stoppard) and sisters. The film begins with him playing Chopin for Polish radio when the first bombs are dropped. As he flees the studio, he meets a pretty blonde cellist Dorota (Emilia Fox), but their subsequent attempts at dating are thwarted by their different faiths and the Nazi imposed edicts prohibiting Jews from many sectors of the city. With providence playing such a prominent part in Szpilman's life, so it would with Dorota as their paths cross again many years later. With the establishment of the Jewish ghettos, Szpilman's family are relocated before being shipped off to concentration camps. His fortune and musical renown intervene and he is plucked from the line boarding the trains by an influential friend in the Jewish police. Over the following years, as he endures unimaginable hardship and depravity, both elements play significant roles in his survival. For all his bravery and fortitude, it is luck above all else that divides him from his family and friends who perish. Adrien Brody is eloquently understated in his portrayal of the dignified Szpilman, relying less on the sparse dialogue than the manner in which he expresses his unrelenting suffering. The bleakness of the situation is masterfully captured by the muted palette of Pawel Edelman's cinematography. Only when the Nazi stranglehold finally begins to loosen under the allies' ascendancy, and liberation nears, does the first glimmer of sunlight fall on Warsaw's decimated streets. Polanski uses this symbolism again when a shaft of light cuts across Szpilman's gaunt features as he plays for a Nazi officer whose compassion and musical appreciation result in friendship and salvation rather than assassination. ""Thank God, not me,"" says the officer. That such an intervention spared Szpilman so that his playing would be heard and his story would be told, may be difficult to accept, but based on The Pianist, it's one to be grateful for.",The Pianist

I felt the movie plot made it very engaging. I haven't read the book, but from my own family's history I watched it with a very personal angle. ""The Pianist"" is a tale of horrors and and unexpected miracles through the life of Wladek, played flawlessly by Adrien Brody set in Warsaw during and after the WWII. When the protagonist's life changes inevitably throughout the course of few months, so drastically, one may wonder if he makes it alive at all. Depraved of family, brutal treatment by Germans and Poles alike, Wladek's courage continues to surprise us. Saved by a few good Poles and at the end by the German officer (played by Thomas Kretchman) he makes it. Broken, emaciated, speechless, but he makes it. With the soul filled with his only one true friend, Chopin, he plays throughout the movie, he manages to come to life again.Its a wonderful story of survival in the times when no one could have been trusted, one could have only wished for a miracle or a quick end.

The movie does not merely portray on military fighting or any serious battles but it focuses mainly on the life of Splitzman (played by Adrien Brody) who was known to be the most famous pianist in Poland at the time.His life headed for the worse after his family was taken away and he was forced to work hard labor for the Nazis. Though later he escapes and was hidden by some generous Polish people, his life became a nightmare after everyone in town left due to the effects of the war and he was left all alone to face & hide from the Germans with whatever strength, leftover food and luck he had...till the Russians came.The best war related kind of movie since Schlinder's List.

The protagonist in this movie gives the viewer no reason to root for his survival. The heroes are everyone who helps this person survive when he obviously does nothing to help himself. Watch the 1978 Holocaust or Uprising (2001 Leelee Sobieski) or Schindler's List, and you'll see that everything in this movie has been done before and done much better.

It is a personal film of a great director who might find a chance with this film to cope with his past.

The movie was good at first but then got very slow. The only thing that made me like it was the fact it was based on a true story. I have seen other holocaust movies that were ten times better than this. I do not see how anyone thought this movie was so great. It was so boring towards the end i would have turned it off if other people weren't watching it with me. I am a huge holocaust nut and this movie did not do it justice.

765,brimariex19,Comparing Director and Style to Szpilman and the Emotional Intensity of this film,9,27 November 2011,"The Pianist is a true story full of grit, fate, and even a little bit of hope. Director, Roman Polanski, understands the horrors of this 1940 Nazi invasion due to his experiences of being a survivor himself. He, like the main character Wladyslaw Szpilman, has experienced the mortifying encounters of murder, separation, torment, torture, and even a conclusion of hope. Viewers can understand his experiences through the eyes of Szpilman. The Pianist is not a story of one holocaust survivor. Rather it's a story of two, portraying the director's emotional and intense experiences as well as Szpilman's in this realistically accurate film.This film is truly honest in the depiction of what the Polish Jews saw and experienced during the Nazi invasion. Right at the start of the film, the viewer already experiences the hardship of the war with the bombing of Szpilman's radio station. From there, viewers continuously get hit with unbarring, cringing scenes. About thirty minutes in, we see the first true death of Jews by the Nazis. The Nazi Police take an elderly man in a wheel chair and throw him off a balcony. This scene is brutal as we hear the cries of Szpilman's mother, adding more emotions and intensity.Throughout the movie, a viewer can see Polanski's directorial style. He consistently portrays sad or emotional scenes through the eyes of the protagonist. In the ghetto, a Jewish man attacks a Jewish woman for food. The food falls on the floor, but the man does not cease. He lies down and eats it right off the muddy dirt. First, Polanski shows Szpilman and then the elements of this unfortunate occasion. These types of shots occur throughout the movie. Also, officers are mostly shown with low angle shots and Jews getting killed with high angle shots. This shows how the officers are superior and Jews are inferior all the time. The Pianist reflects intense reality. The part that is one of the most realistic scenes is when a Nazi Officer stops the Jews and simply chooses certain people to lay down in the middle of the street to meet their fate of getting killed. The rest have to watch this painful action and continue on with their day as if nothing occurred. It shows the true character of the Nazi's and the torment and torture of the Polish Jews. The film is extremely powerful. Every element, every scene, every shot is crafted to show the power of the Holocaust. It makes a viewer cry, feel the heartbreak, cringe at the sight of death, and feel sympathy for what the actual Jews had to go through. One of the best emotional scenes is when the Nazi Officer aided Szpilman and helped him in his hideout, giving him food and water. It shows how one life, good or bad, can make a difference. Szpilman did everything he needed to do to survive. He was not a ""hero"" or a fighter. He was just another man trying to make it through, just like Polanski. They both received an enormous amount of good luck. In the end, hope came through and leads them to freedom and a better life.",The Pianist

Even to the smallest characters that are only on screen for a matter of seconds are up to par. Also having the film be based off of a book adds to the amount of detail that the director has put into the film. I am talking about the things Adrian Brodie's character sees throughout the streets during this hard time for him. In the end The Pianist is a great story that is accompanied by great performances. The story of the Holocaust is a topic that should and will not be forgot and The Pianist keeps those who lost their lives in memory.",The Pianist

Overall i loved this movie i watched it about 3 times. I cant really think back if there was anything that i disliked about the movie. Another interesting thing i loved was the beauty of the main character playing the piano and also the piano being a saving factor for him in the end with the general that found him in the building.

The movie generally embodies the pain suffered under occupation to get the very first rights, and how silence could be the only response to the suppression of faced by the invader, seeing the people you care about the most being taken and nothing could be done except surrender.

777,Jacobpski,A Powerful and Brilliant Piece of Filmmaking,9,22 December 2012,"The Pianist, the true story of the pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman who must face the horrors and hardships of the Holocaust, is a powerful and emotional film. Roman Polanski, an already accomplished and renowned director, brings a whole new realism to the events of the Holocaust and makes the viewer feel as if they are actually witnessing these horrible events. The movie begins with Szpilman playing the piano for a Warsaw radio station, amid the sounds of destruction in the background. The beautiful sounds of the piano against the sounds of horror and bloodshed creates a powerful contrast throughout the film, and injects more emotion into the events portrayed. The movie continues, with Szpilman and his family having to face monetary troubles, and then eventually being forced to move into the Warsaw ghetto. Within the ghetto the Polish Jews face terrible hardships, and are treated in a horrible way. One of the first examples of this terrible treatment is when several Polish Jews are forced to dance for the entertainment of the Nazi soldiers.As the movie continues, the level of emotion continues to get stronger. One of the most saddening and powerful moments of the film occurs when an old man is thrown out of the window of his house by Nazi soldiers, and in turn is ran over by their car. It is horrible that events such as these occurred, and they are shown in violent detail.The acting in this film is superb, as each actor portrays their role perfectly, and they make you feel for their characters. Adrien Brody, as Spzilman himself, features in all but two scenes of the film, and owns his role perfectly; this is Brody's film. It is hard enough a task to be on screen for must of a film, but to keep the viewer captivated, even in moments such as when Szpilman is searching for food, is an honorable achievement in itself. Brody fully deserved his Oscar, as his performance is both captivating and memorable.Overall, The Pianist is a great achievement of filmmaking, as it is captivating, powerful, and important to watch. If you have not yet seen this film, I would advise that you do as soon as possible, as it is not one to miss.Rating:9/10",The Pianist

782,tuningcourse,absolutely stunning,10,11 January 2005,"Polanski, unlike any other filmmaker, has a way of getting into your very core and evoking unconcsious emotions that seem to manifest themselves for days after. The Pianist is the type of film that initially strikes one as powerful, but perhaps so much so that its core essence requires time to settle and be processed. As several days have passed, I find my focus of attention ever more on the film and the ingenious manner in which it was designed. Really, few words will do the film justice but if I may say visually stunning and existentially powerful, perhaps that may be a meager start. The film is less a story of the main character's nightmarish struggle for survival during the unspeakable occupation of the Nazis in Warsaw; it is a pure visual study of hell observed primarily through the character. My God, how Polanski orchestrates this feat of cinematic power is hard to discern but his consistency in doing so is nothing less than pure genius. From the character's hideaway in an abandoned flat and the brutality of German soldiers always occurring at a distance as a panoramic backdrop to the character is an element I've never really seen done on this type of scale. If I may say Polanski has succeeded in creating a new cinematic dynamic, that wouldn't be an exaggeration. In the present climate of Hollywood silliness and superficiality, The Pianist is a rare achievement that rates it among the best films of all time, if not for its incredible usage of technique, but for its utter message of human evil and the struggle for survival against that evil which we, as the present generation, must always remember and never forget.

786,barracuda377,A sad yet beautiful accounting of the life of a Jewish Pianist,9,4 May 2014,"The Pianist directed by Roman Polanski is based on the memoirs of Wladyslaw Szpilman, played by Adrien Brody. The film takes into account the adversity that he and other Jews faced during the time that Nazis occupied the city of Warsaw, Poland. In the beginning of the film we see Szpilman, an accomplished pianist in the studio recording his piano playing. As he plays there is a panic beginning to ensue as explosions are occurring throughout the city. During one of the explosions Szpilman suffers a minor injury to his head. When Szpilman arrives home he finds his family packing as if to flee Warsaw, and in the end like many other Jewish families they choose to remain in their homes. Polanski incorporates a series of montages to show provide information that is prevalent to the circumstances. An example is when Szpilman's father, played by Frank Inlay is sitting at the table counting money as they discuss what to do with the extra they have been forbidden to have. A heated discussion ensues between Henryk, Szpilman's brother played by Ed Stoppard, his sister Regina, played by Julia Rayner and his other sister Halina, played by Jessica Kate Meyer. He then takes us into a walk that Szpilman takes with Dorita, played by Emilia Fox where they want to go to a local business establishment and they find themselves unable to enter as they do not serve Jews. By incorporating a montage like this the audience can see the transgression of the liberties that Jews were stripped of without having to relive the whole amount of time, and the audience is able to envision the strength that it took for the Jews to survive such treatment. Szpilman and his family, like all Jews that chose to remain in Warsaw were moved to the Warsaw Ghetto, where they were to live and work. Polanski ensures we understand the struggles that the families went thru, the deaths they witnessed, and how in many cases they would chose to leave a blind eye to another being mistreated just to ensure that they survived. Szpilman during this time in the Ghetto attempted to save a young boy who had snuck under the wall and on his return was caught and being beaten as he attempted to crawl back through. As families were brutally murdered in the streets Szpliman's family sees others close their curtains and turn off their lights as if not seeing it means it did not happen. It is an example of surviving the onslaught of abuse to other humans as a means of keeping their own sanity. As time continues on the families are yet again moved and even appear to be separated from each other. Those selected would be sent to a large courtyard where they sat for hours if not days prior to being put in to cargo cars and sent to Concentration Camps. Szpilman's family was one of the many Jewish families in this courtyard, in which a mother is beside herself for killing her baby, a young Jewish boy is selling caramels for a high price of which he will not be able to keep or use the money. They can only imagine what awaits them as they sit there together and the scene where they are loaded into the cargo cars is beyond disgusting. Szpilman survives being placed in the cars and finds himself working at tearing down the walls that had been built around the Jewish Ghetto, now that they were almost all gone (other than those working). He continues on and ultimately finds a way to get in contact with someone he knows on the other side and is kept in hiding for quite some time. While it was not death, it was not a great situation for him as he was not allowed to go out and often times starved and taken advantage of. As his time of isolation continues he turns to his music, which seems to be a means of keeping his sanity. When all those that had attempted to help him were no longer alive or able to continue assisting him, Szpilman finds himself doing all he could to survive on his own. In the end it is his return to the Jewish Ghetto that brings him face to face with a German soldier, Captain William Holsenfeld, played by Thomas Kretschmann. The fear in Szpilman's eyes as he is confronted for being somewhere he shouldn't, then the gratitude when Captain Holsenfeld not only spares his life, he also brings him food and provides him a jacket for extra warmth.Overall this film was met with tears of sadness as I watched the abuse and persecution of those that practice the Jewish faith. It is disheartening to know that in the history of the world we continue to treat those that have different beliefs or values with such disregard. A couple days after watching this film I watched The Book Thief with my mother and husband, and while it was more about the German families and the impact the war had on them it was just as disheartening as it clearly showed that many of them did not believe in the mistreatment though many still averted their eyes. I would definitely watch this movie again, and if you have not I would strongly suggest it. It is not for the faint at heart, though I think it is important that we realize that no person should have to struggle so against adversity to survive.",The Pianist
787,ml8878,"""...10 minutes into the film, I was captivated.""",8,21 May 2005,"""Crap, I rented the History Channel."" That was my initial reaction when I was met with a 20 second long, low-detailed, roll-footage type introduction to The Pianist. I knew I didn't need another lecture on the ""horrific Nazi death camps"" and one more dull lesson on World War II weaved into what Hollywood puts out as a ""movie."" However, about 10 minutes into the film, I was captivated. As the story began to unfold the life of a large and happy Jewish family living in Warsaw at the beginning of World War II, I started to see traces of genius in Polanski's newest creation.For one, each character had a personality so tangible that the viewers can point out resemblances in their own personal lives. This had a stunning impact on me. It just isn't the same when a story is always about that ""someone else."" However, Polanski did an awesome job in making that ""someone else"" personal. One of my own favorite characters was Henryk (played by Ed Stoppard), the brother of the ""pianist"" (Wladek Szpilman-played by Adrien Brody), who had a stubborn, intellectual, street-smart whim to him that I can identify in a few of my own friends. Of course, Brody was a great actor as well. His passive, stoic response flowed from a seemingly natural-born personality that was so fitting to his character. His personality was never out of place or awkward but well-blended into the climate set by Polanski.Secondly, the director had an excellent charm with the mood of the cinematic. It's interesting to point out that the sky had nearly always been dark and dreary. The clouds and the overall attitude of the film were grey and overcast. They resembled harbingers of a coming storm. It was symbolic, and also foreshadows the coming doom that few people expected and even fewer had hoped to avoid. Polanski, himself a Pole who escaped the grips of death in the camps, spared few shades of darkness in painting the Nazis. Next, it must be noted that Polanski was a master at contrasting mood. A tragically horrifying scene could be followed by a scene with Wladek playing the piano beautifully in a bustling restaurant. By doing this, Polanski noticeably heightens the blow of the calamity and as a result, made the movie so much more spectacular.Also helping to set the sinister mood was the music, which was stunningly beautiful yet overwhelmingly poignant. From Chopin's ""Nocturne for Piano in C Sharp Minor"" at the very beginning to Chopin's ""Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise for Piano, Op. 22"" at the very end, the bittersweet sweet aura of the movie cannot exist without the music. One of the best classical soundtracks of the past years may be from this very movie. The piano genius, Szpilman, represented all the talents wasted away by Nazi rule. Lawyers, writers, politicians, and musicians alike were the subjects of those mass graves and human ovens, and the trills of the keys made it so real, so heartfelt. It was something one needs to experience to know the truth of.I encountered only a few moments of discontent when watching this movie. One of them was that some of the characters seemed quite random and generally impromptu. Itzak Heller for example, the Jewish Police recruiter, seemed to appear out of nowhere, yet the family speaks of him as if he was an old friend. Other parts of the story I felt needed a little bit more elaboration as well. What annoyed me the most was that the director seemed to part with the rest of the family in the middle of the film without ever mentioning them again. However, since this is not a spoiler, I have no need to go into the details.No, I have yet to see a movie that is perfect in every aspect. Though in this human world of flaws and opinions differing from mine, I forfeit my dissatisfaction at the beginning of this film to admit that this has been one awesome experience. It has not only changed my view on Polanski as a director, but also the entire period of the Holocaust in general.",The Pianist

When the movie ends one thanks those Allies who gave up their lives to restore order and peace in this world. Movies like these should be treasured for future generations to learn the value of peace and brotherhood.",The Pianist

792,sebastian-pupillo,Disappointed,2,8 June 2005,"I went to see this movie with pretty high expectations. Polanski has quite a reputation. I felt the film was dull, lacked artistic imagination and its trite presentation of history really disappointing. Apart from the scene with the suitcases, I found the whole thing banal, way too heavy handed and very clichéd. If you are interested in the subject of the film, I recommend you read the following couple of pages from a memoir of the son of a Holocaust survivor at the web address below. In the five minutes you will take to read it you will learn more about this period of history than in the three hours of watching this excruciatingly dreary film. http://www.normanfinkelstein.com/article.php?pg=18&ar=1",The Pianist
793,entirely-1,Great Film for Musicians,10,23 June 2005,"As a musician, I have to say that this was one of my favourite films. Perhaps only because I enjoy history as well, and this was so well done. I have seen it three times now, and every time I am again in awe of the main character's courage and strength. If you've ever seen The Legend of 1900 and enjoyed it, you should be happy to hear that this movie is similar in nature and scope. The strength of the story and plot line is admirable, especially considering that much of the movie is set with one character and little to no dialog. This movie really takes you into a war-torn place and makes you understand how it feels to be truly alone in the world - without even the comfort of music. Compared to other holocaust movies, I would still rank it near the top, even close to Schindler's List in it's mood. A great show for people who want more than just entertainment, it has a wonderful story, and is very well acted. A must-see for musicians and history buffs everywhere.",The Pianist

795,taylorngreene,Add onto your must see list.,10,25 March 2015,"This film I can't put into enough words how hauntingly beautiful it was. Everything was done perfectly. Was captivated and moved deeply. Adrien Brody gave an excellent performance and deserved that Oscar. I watched this after I've seen the film ""Shindler's List"" which was another good one and everyone should see at some point in their life. This one hit a stronger cord in me though. Both wonderful films, this one you get to see everything from the other point of view which I much prefer. I chose to review this film because my grandmother lost about half or more of her family during that gruesome time. It nauseates me to think this sick thing happened. I just have to say a thanks to Roman Polanski for showing that to almost a tee in those 150 minutes.",The Pianist
796,christy_luvs_roxy,Brilliant,10,28 October 2009,"The Pianist reduces the human being to its most basic instinct: to survive. Along the way, through excellent directing and acting, the audience is taken on a emotional roller-coaster ride. The joy of family and the love each shares. The cruelty of the dark side of human nature. The things one is willing to do and go through in order to survive. The fear of life and death. The fear within each of us that keeps us wanting to stay alive. Depressing but very real, a lot of emotion is expressed in The Pianist. At the end you will leave with a heavy heart because THIS is something like you've never witnessed before: we're too comfortable in this modern age, we have yet to experience the horrors of being war victims. But also, this movie will sharpen those humanistic qualities within us that has been washed away by the worries of money etc. in the contemporary life. This movie will make you look closely at the persons you love, tell them you love them before leaving for work each morning and this will be because you will realize that life is short and unpredictable and maybe in the next second, you will be gone so LIVE life while you can.",The Pianist
797,d-34755,Excellent.,10,3 August 2015,"When I first went into watching this movie, I was expecting a boring movie of the life of a Jew in Austria during the Holocaust. I was completely surprised by the movie's content. In one word, it was unbelievable. The music was outstanding, and the acting was near flawless. Saying that this was based upon a true story, really adds on to my love for the movie and the storyline behind it. Personally being a World War 2 junkie, I enjoy these kinds of movies; however this particular movie brought comparisons to Schindler's List for me. I believe that this movie is right up there with great World War 2 movies along with Schindler's List. Overall, it was an excellent movie.",The Pianist
798,vishakhasen,"Poetic, Poignant, Beautiful",10,4 December 2015,"This film moved me. I have been a sucker for films based around Nazi Germany and World War II, but this was the only film that truly devastated me to the brink of tears. Perhaps I was in the right mood for it. This is the kind of movie you watch curled up in a heavy winter night with a warm cup of coffee and absolute silence. It is a treat for the soul.The most admirable aspect of the film is The Pianist's will to live on. His courage and refusal to give up reminds us of the common courage in everyday people. In the film, the Pianist himself is not the victim of most brutalities, he is more of a witness to what goes on around him. More than a fighter, he is a survivor. He never truly wishes to die, he wants to live on. I will never forget the scene in which he he sits in an empty hospital, playing the piano in the air, trying to drown out the horrors of the shooting around him. Striped Pajamas, Schindler's list, Book Thief... none of them come close to the utter majesty of this film's cinematography. 10/10 for this movie. Such brilliant characterization, such amazing motion. What a film! This is the stuff legends are made of.",The Pianist
799,jdlee05,Good Movie,10,26 January 2006,"I thought the most amazing thing about this movie was that for more than half of it there was very little spoken dialog. Adrien Brody was able to communicate in a very powerful way without speaking. It made his performance even more spectacular. Also, the music was breathtaking. Any movie with Chopin's Ballade in G minor is a good movie. I also liked how his ability to play music saved his life. When he played for the Nazi officer the officer decided to spare his life, he even brought him some food. I think that is a good lesson to learn about music. It can cross all boundaries. Even boundaries between Jews and Nazis.",The Pianist
800,barwarkishan,Excellent and realistic,10,15 August 2016,"The pianist is a historical drama directed by Roman Polanski. It is based on an autobiographical book written by Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played the of the talented Jewish pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody won Oscar for this movie. Also the movie won awards in almost all categories.It's a story about the struggle of the pianist to survive the Nazi occupation of Poland during world war 2. Wladyslaw Szpilman was the greatest piano player of Poland in 1930's who lived in Warsaw. Movie is centered about the transition period of Jews at Warsaw after the first attack of Germany in 1939. I have no words to describe the horror of that holocaust due to German attack but the movie shows it and you will feel the horror while watching it. Little hopes of the Jews during that hard times keep the movie alive.The director Roman Polanski was also in Poland during the attack. He also had unforgettable memories related to world war 2. There were many rise and falls in his life which were a source of inspiration for making such movies.The movie is not made just for the entertainment of the audience. It's a slow paced and a bit long movie but the emotional attachment and sympathy with the characters will keep you engaged till the end. There are lot of things to learn from this movie as it exposes the harsh realities of world war 2.The struggle and the efforts made by the pianist in that hopeless situation is a true source of inspiration for each of us. So, you must watch it.",The Pianist
801,jrbzowski,Stellar.,10,31 March 2016,"As a Polish descendant I take pride in most movies regarding our storied heritage, yet most films lack a correct historical context and often times are so off of the intended story line that the film is ruined, Polanski is brilliant with this film in its ability to evoke emotion from any viewer, although morbid the film is an accurate and sad reality of millions of people and is one of few films that can depict the holocaust in a somewhat realistic manner. Adrien Brody is stellar in his Academy Award winning performance playing a passive Polish Jew who survives and avoids Nazi rule. Polanski himself uses his past and applies it to the film as he himself was a survivor of the war and of course of his dark and sad past of the murder of his wife Sharon Tate, you can see his emotion through his films and although perhaps morbid this film is brilliant and any avid movie goer would love and appreciate The Pianist. A Polanski classic.",The Pianist

803,sorayaklong,The Pianist is about young Jewish man who his talent for playing the piano led to an unexpected journey,8,20 June 2017,"The Pianist is one of many films about the holocaust that I've seen lately which shows either perspective of Jewish man in Warsaw, Poland struggling to survive WWII during the long years that people in Europe thought were antagonizing. I feel moved by Adrien Brody's main protagonist toward the middle of the film. He desperately in search to stay silent, keep out of sight, and his survival to remain alive. It gives me quite an idea of how things weren't so great for him or for anybody during those dark times. I'm forever grateful even though it burns in my fiery soul. Adrien Brody is one of the best choice for best actor in the Pianist. His mind, body, and soul led him through the German-Nazi turmoil to a new and bright future.",The Pianist
804,anishasolomonprime,Outstanding and Outspoken,10,11 February 2017,"I won't spoil the movie, but this movie isn't afraid to make a point or get a message across. It hits hard emotionally and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. I believe that anyone who hasn't seen it should, but it isn't for everyone. The rating is correct, but like I said earlier I won't spoil the movie. This movie is excellent at shocking and getting a point across. It portrays a story and struggle in a way that words cannot say without spoiling the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but I will not say if I cried or not since that might be a spoiler. This is a must-watch, but it isn't for the squeamish or those who are not ready for a tough message.

806,sp1s,But why is he a pianist?,8,3 October 2005,"First, I have to give a disclaimer. I am not able to give full justice to this movie. It depicts events that exceed the horizon of my understandings. I've seen the Warshaw ghetto, and the concentration camps that are mentioned, and I can only say that I am not capable of understanding whether the cruelty shown does compare with the historical events. It is the discussion heard in the context of ""Schindler's list"", when Jewish critics said that the holocaust cannot be shown in adequate picture. I cannot comment this; but it should be mentioned.The movie did lack, and I am still trying to understand if it lacks it deliberately, one thing that I can comment about: The joy of music. I spend considerable time listening to classical music, mostly piano concertos, and I find it pretty hard to believe that Brodys character is supposed to be a pianist - apart from his slim fingers. He is a pianist like some other man is a bank clerk, it is his job; but he neither seems to miss it, nor does it seem to influence his thinking or feeling. Maybe it is too romantic to believe that the joy of music would survive under the circumstances he experiences, but the topic is dropped without much ado. When he picks up playing piano again, he just plays like he has never missed it or never seen anything that might influence his way of playing.Now, I was watching all that movie mostly to see his reunition with music, and I was surprised how little the scene did tell me. Why does he never play wrong notes? Why is there no different emotion mixed in the music, which is, after all, one of the most emotional piano music ever written? There are young polish pianists like Anderszewsky that could have provided such emotions, maybe only subtle; but I firmly believe it could have been done. For reference, see how Helene Grimaud played the Beethoven concerto on the eve of 9/11/2001. For me, Brody was playing a heartless man. Maybe this is how Polanski intended it to be.For the remaining aspects of the film many good things have been said. It is, after all, only rarely depicted how much the polish people had to suffer. Warshaw was completely destroyed by the German army days before it was liberated, this is too often forgotten.",The Pianist
807,hamtish,A truly beautiful movie,10,16 October 2017,"This movie left me in tears, the main character plays this role perfectly and most people can recognise and relate to the issues in this movie - such as apartheid, not being part of todays society nor feeling welcome in certain places and within certain groups. I didn't pause this movie for one minute. I felt a lot of mixed emotions. This movie is beautifully made, one part of it - when the SS soldier saves the main character - shows that there is hope for humanity, that people with their gratta at the right place may have the ability to avoid their prejudices and save another human being, even if they are brainwashed not to. I truly recommend The Pianist, you won't be disappointed.",The Pianist
808,TDSchef247,"Good movie, but something is missing.",7,17 May 2006,"I do not believe there is anyone who has seen The Pianist who wouldn't claim it to be extraordinary. I do also believe that to be true but the entire movie i felt that there was something missing. When i first sat down to watch this movie i was expecting to actually see him play the piano. I wasn't looking for a tale of survival. I compared this movie to The Castaway with Tom Hanks. I was thinking to myself about how i wished the title of the pianist to have been more fitting, and comparing this movie to Castaway, i wouldn't have liked that if that had been called the post man.If you agree or disagree with me please let me know, me and my friend have argued many hours about this topic and we would like some other views.",The Pianist

I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad.

812,saimekucukalim,Excellent !!,9,26 December 2017,We can say without hesitation The Pianist is a masterpiece. Thls movle is based on true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman who in the 1930s (in war time) was considered one of the most successful pianist. But the movie is not about his success. It is about A Polish jew who was fought against all bad things and faced situations that he never imagined and he finally survived by losing everything and everyone. The character played by Adrien Brody. He is tremendous actor who captures his character completely and carries the film with his amazingly real performance. He makes the story of an unforgettable experience. The dramatic life or death plot is very gripping. It is a very touching movie that should be seen by everyone.,The Pianist

They were the lucky ones, A bullet through the head. Or those who worked their lives away, And left among the dead. The ones they tortured, screaming, Till they could scream no more. I still see, their lifeless carcases, Piled high upon the floor. My mind's still locked inside those walls, For me there's no release.

The man from the start of the movie The pianist is still just that a pianist and watching him struggle through this war torn land that was once his home was a shocking and brilliant spectical to watch.

825,ryanrclark2004,Very good movie about a man with a passion,9,19 March 2006,"This was a very good movie. The director was Roman Polanski, he does a great job of showing the characters emotion. If the character is nervous then you'll see them twittering their fingers. This movie reveals the tragedies of the Holocaust, and really makes you mad at the Nazi's. I have nothing against people that are formerly related to Germans. But, it shows the German's as basically animals. Yet it does show that some of them have compassion. Just like there are good and bad Germans, there are good and bad Americans. I want to start out by saying I'm in my early teenage years, and this is the second R rated movie I am allowed to see. I wasn't freaked out by the violent aspects of this movie, but this quite a disturbing movie. Polanski does a good job of showing the hardships of the Jewish people of Europe. It has some intense action sequences. I play the piano, and have been playing it for eight years. I kind of relate to the piano player in it, he has a passion for it, and he was taken away from it due to the war. I find that disturbing. The piano playing scenes are incredible, and I don't know if Adrien Brody was actually playing, but whoever was I give a standing ovation while sitting down.",The Pianist
