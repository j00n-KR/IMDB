0,SnoopyStyle,thin beautiful erotica,6,15 September 2015,"College art student Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) is dumped by his first real girlfriend Suzy. He is so devastated that he develops insomnia. With nothing to do during the night and running low on cash, he decides to get a job at an all-night supermarket. It's his way to get Cashback for his useless time. Sharon Pintey (Emilia Fox) is the quiet weary checkout girl. Sean Higgins is his womanizing lifelong friends. He starts playing with time and even freezing it.The constant narration hides the fact that this is a pretty thin story. It is beautifully shot. Much of the talk is about the naked women. They are model good looking and I have no problems with that. If the naked girls and the slick look are taken away, there isn't much else. The romance with Sharon has limited drama. It may have worked as a short but expanding into a full length movie stretched the material a bit thin.",Cashback
1,paul_haakonsen,Not your average romantic comedy...,5,6 April 2012,"Initially I had expected more of a laugh-out-loud comedy from this movie, but found myself not laughing once throughout the entire movie. Now, that doesn't mean that the movie was bad or crappy, far from it. ""Cashback"" was actually a rather nice movie and a fresh take on the romantic comedy genre.The story in ""Cashback"" is about Ben Willis (played by Sean Biggerstaff) who gets dumped by Suzy (played by Michelle Ryan) and for some reason he can't sleep after that incident. So he have 8 extra hours every day. He takes up working at a supermarket during the night shift to pass time, and finds out he is able to freeze time. Ben is an artist and starts painting the women in the supermarket, taking off their clothes while time is frozen. Also working at the supermarket is Sharon Pintey (played by Emilia Fox). Ben falls in love with her and a relationship starts to bloom.""Cashback"" is driven by a good story, although it is not a storyline that pushes forward at a high pace. The story, however, is well complimented by good acting performances. And the score that is used in the movie really works so well with the story. The music was perfectly used and well-selected.The movie is unlike other romantic comedies I have seen, because ""Cashback"" is not really a happy story, it is more the story of a broken heart, the path to mending it and managing to find love again when everything seem gray and hopeless. If you are expecting a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy that is straight off the writer's desk in Hollywood, then you might be better off with another movie, because ""Cashback"" is not one of those mainstream movies.""Cashback"" is a beautiful movie, both story-wise and cinematography-wise, but personally I found the movie to take rather long to get almost nowhere, and it dragged on for a bit too long. I could have used something more upbeat to speed the movie along, and for that reason I give it only a 5/10 rating.",Cashback
2,writers_reign,"Yes, Please ...",3,16 September 2016,"... cash back with apologies for wasting my time. Clearly the film was underwritten by Sainsbury's in return for mega hype and, for good measure, product placement worthy of an Oscar nomination. Were I on the Board of Sainsbury's I'd have instigated a move to buy all existing prints plus the negative and buried the lot in a landfill. I know that actors often have it rough having chosen a precarious career in the first place but how desperate can Shaun Evans and Emilia Fox have been to sign up for this drek. Apparently this is an expanded version of an eighteen minute short produced several years previously with a virtually similar story line which unacountably picked up several awards. The mind boggles.",Cashback
3,lastliberal,The bad news is that time flies. The good news... is that you're the pilot.,8,21 February 2009,"How many can stare at some spilled peas on the floor and find beauty. With this film, you may never look at still life the same again.How do you fill the time that is flying by. We may not have the ability to freeze it and just enjoy the beauty of nature, but maybe we can spend some more of it appreciating life's beauty.The cinematography and music really captivated me and set the mood long before the ingenious freezing sequence. It made the nudity something to be appreciated and enjoyed, not some cheesy titillation.Ben (Sean Biggerstaff) is creating this world after breaking up with his girl (Michelle Ryan). There are a lot of laughs in the film with other supermarket employees, who are really interesting characters. There are flashbacks to Ben's childhood that provide other very interesting moments. Hayley-Marie Coppin, for one. But, it is not until Ben and Sharon (Emilia Fox) start seeing each other that his life starts to get back to normal.Everything is not all smooth from then on out, and we get to see the same scene with Sharon that we saw with Suzy in the beginning. It was very original. It is what happens in life when we see one second of a two-second story.But, the moment when Sharon walks into the Proud Gallery was just precious, and you knew things would work out.A magical ending to a great film by Sean Ellis leaves us wanting MORE!",Cashback
4,grantss,Good comedy-drama,7,10 May 2014,"Good comedy-drama. Ostensibly a drama, yet it is as its best when it's a comedy. The movie certainly has pretensions of being a drama and starts off quite seriously and with the idea of making a dramatic point. The seriousness carries all the way through, yet the conclusion is not that profound, and is quite predictable.No, the best parts are the comedy moments. From a point the movie switches from pure drama to a central dramatic theme with hilarious side-events and scenes. Any scenes involving the boss and/or the kung fu guy were brilliant. The soccer match...Ultimately the great comedy is weighed down by the mediocre, not always plausible or interesting, drama. If this was a pure comedy it would have been brilliant.Decent performances all round.",Cashback
5,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Cashback,10,28 July 2007,"How can anyone miss the poster for Cashback? Featuring a beautiful blonde in a supermarket who's almost naked from the waist up, her modesty protected by the words of the title, I guess you're forgiven if you mistake this for some low brow sex movie. But Cashback is anything but low brow, and sex is just a small part of the equation. Based on a short film of the same name written and directed by Sean Ellis, this is easily one of my favourite movies this year. It's intelligent, sexy, and nothing as raunchy as the poster would suggest, but full of little elements of surprises that connected, some of which are wickedly naughty.Cashback is a beautiful romantic comedy, filled with fantastical bits which elevated it to another plane altogether. There are some technically brilliant transitional and special effects that do make you go wild, but at its core, it's the story it had to tell that truly wowed me. Although it's a romantic film, it's firmly rooted in the pain of a breakup. Anyone who's gone through one, will know that feeling of despair, and hopelessness that life seem to have taken a turn into. And our protagonist Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) is such, when we witness his (literally) painful split with his girl Suzy (Michelle Ryan). For the first 10 minutes, I could totally identify with Ben, his thought processes, feelings, and his suffering. Ben suffered from insomnia, and is trying hard to find ways to pass the time. Since he couldn't sleep, he found the perfect win-win solution, and that is to utilize the time to earn some money, cashback, if you will, for services rendered. It's about finding our own space to pass time, to keep ourselves occupied, and to while away the idle moments instead of wasting time thinking about the what-ifs. Getting cashback of course is an incentive, but never the prime motivation. I could tell you all about the setting up of A Nutshell Review, but that's another story (along the same veins) for another day.Like my other favourite British movie of this year (Hot Fuzz), Cashback has its primary setting in a supermarket, where Ben ends up in, working the graveyard hours of a 24hrs chain. Thanks to its quirky manager and madcap co-workers, there's no lack of shenanigans that they get themselves into, and we spend time with Ben as he explores and studies how each of them deals with the mundaneness of their lives. And a supermarket checkout girl, Sharon Pintey (Emilia Fox), catches his attention, but is he ready to embark on another round of relationship?Cashback has plenty of keen observations of love and life in general, coupled with its witty dialogue and dark sense of humour. But it's not rapid-fire pacing all the way, as the quiet and contemplative moments far outweigh those scenes, and pave the way for some meditation within yourself. Like I said, I found the story easy to connect to, and these moments allowed some time to ponder and draw parallels. The last third of the movie is simply powerful, and coupled with Ben's imaginative ability (which I will not reveal just what), it totally moved me, and sounds out some sliver of hope.And what of the nudity? Sure it was slightly edited here, but I thought there's nothing to fuss about. It's true that the female form is beautiful, and this film provides that sense of appreciation through Ben's artistic talent (and of course, the camera angles, the lingering moments, etc). It's lovely, but never in a pornographic way, Think of it as visiting a nude art gallery, and you get the drift of how nudity's treated in the movie.With an excellent soundtrack to accompany the story, I felt that Cashback has all the ingredients of a hit movie, with a strong story, wonderful characterization (a mixture of key characters and caricatures) and absolutely lovely production values. For those who's fallen out of love, Ben is certainly someone whom you'll root for to pull himself out of the rut, and one whom you'll encourage to embark on another romantic journey in all earnestness with a person he fancies, contrary to the advice given by his best friend who seem to have a problem eating his own cooking, so to speak.While it's a piece about the dread in relationships, of breaking up, what you do and how you handle the pain, it also comes with a picture of hope. It's a simple story, yet emotionally powerful without being overly sentimental, predictable or cheesy. I've so many favourite moments in this movie, that I'll be more than tempted to buy the DVD when it's out. And it certainly is a strong contender for my movie of the year 2007! Highly recommended, and you must watch this film before it disappears from our screens!",Cashback
6,siderite,"Wasn't great, but it has class",8,8 September 2007,"For a romantic movie, this is really good. It isn't really a romantic movie, it is more of a introspective view of reality, based around the story of a supermarket clerk who can't sleep and dreams of being a painter. But the romance comes so easily and the way the movie is made is truly artistic.However, if you expect something really active, with lots of fun and conveyor belt kiss and tears scenes, you will find this lacking. It is not a film about boy meets girl, rather one of finding oneself and seeing the world around with new, open eyes.Bottom line: a nice film, a bit boring at times, but ultimately worth it. The last few lines are the best part of the film, they make you understand what was the message the writer wanted to transmit and makes you understand some of the more seemingly irrelevant parts of the movie.",Cashback
7,ksf-2,bored supermarket worker,6,21 March 2021,"Bored and recently single, Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) seems to have a bad case of insomnia. SO much time spent watching the ex Suzy, ( Michelle Ryan) run through his mind. yawn. so Ben takes a job at the local market, and joins the others in passing the time in un-constructive ways. but it still goes by so slowly, that he freezes time while he's working at the store. and undresses them. and draws them. SO MANY boobs. full frontal nudity on the ladies. NOT for the young ones! nude women all over the place. it moves pretty slowly. Ben narrates the whole movie, with the other characters occasionally speaking. if we wait long enough, we'll stumble across a plot. an hour and ten minutes in, we find that Ben may date co-worker Sharon. and the store employees have hired a stripper for the manager's birthday party. where things happen, and now Sharon is mad at him. so he freezes time. but it doesn't help. can he make Sharon understand? its an age old story. this must be the plot -- trying to straighten out a misunderstanding with the girlfriend. she seems to be his muse. it's kind of like Clerks. a week in the life of. not bad.

8,KineticSeoul,Sometimes it tries to be more than what it really is,6,26 March 2012,"Now I like these modern fantasy like movies with psychological interpretation of things that go around. And when I first saw this movie I thought it was brilliant, but watching it a second time after a few years later it just doesn't seem all that special. What this does is over dramatize scenarios and make it seem more than what it is, even the dialogue. Okay, so the premise is basically about a guy that is depressed about his break up with some girl and is dramatic about everything. I guess maybe some can relate to this. But he goes into his fantasy world and of his perverted past which might be relatable as well to some degree but comes off a bit pointless at times. This movie makes a lot of reference to time which can be really relatable because our life is ticking away every second. And thus you can ponder more on your life as we get older and that theme stuck out. The protagonist who is a over dramatic or melodramatic depressed guy is able to freeze time or slow it down during some instances or it's just in his imagination. And I liked how it leaves it up to the audience to decide although it points to the direction it's all in his head the most. And the part about the over dramatic depressed guy working at a supermarket majority of the movie while bonding with his fellow workers is engaging. The problem is sometimes this movie just didn't seem to know which direction to go and just blended bunch of elements in one movie thinking it might be uplifting or something, which isn't the case. Which isn't really shocking since this started out as a short film lasting about 20 minutes but the director added more onto it. Despite this movie not being blended all that well...Passable. It's still a engaging flick that was enjoyable. It just isn't as clever, intelligent or artistic as it tries to portray itself as.6.3/10",Cashback
9,sddavis63,It Does A Marvellous Job Of Portraying Time Frozen,1,6 August 2011,"The basis of the story is that Ben (Sean Biggerstaff) has the ability to stop time in its tracks, freeze everything but still be able to move about himself. That basis is appropriate. As I was watching this, I had the impression that time itself had frozen, and that this movie was never going to end. Just my opinion, of course, but I found this dull beyond belief.The story is pure pablum at best. Ben's girlfriend has dumped him and as a result he can't sleep. So he takes a job on the night shift at a 24 hour supermarket and while there he somehow discovers this time freezing ability. Being an artist, of course, the first time this happens he undresses all the women shoppers (and apparently all the women who shop at this supermarket are very attractive) to admire them artistically (for what other motive could he possibly have for such an act?) During his time at the supermarket, however, he does discover the answer to his lovesickness - cashier Sharon (Emilia Fox) - for whom he falls head over heels.The story is lacking. Ben and Sharon are likable enough but the rest of the characters are either unlikeable or ridiculous. The humour is at best dry - but even dry humour should include something that makes you smile. This didn't for me. It simply became an exercise in endurance - was I going to be able to make it through this. I did - but it took a lot of effort. (1/10)",Cashback
10,Buddy-51,the secondary characters are more interesting than the principals,5,9 September 2007,"The small British film ""Cashback"" is a sporadically engaging, but ultimately unsatisfying rumination on art, love and the relative nature of time.The idea for the movie is, in many respects, better than the movie itself. Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) is an art student whose girlfriend has just broken up with him after years together as a couple. Ben is so emotionally devastated by the rejection that he becomes virtually a dead man walking, an incurable insomniac who goes literally whole nights without sleeping. To assuage his pain and to make the time pass more quickly, he takes a job working the late night shift at a local supermarket. While there, he develops the sudden ability to make time ""freeze"" at will, kind of like in that old ""Twilight Zone"" episode, ""A Kind of a Stopwatch,"" or the movie ""Clockstoppers"" (though Ben doesn't need anything as mundane as a magical time piece to accomplish the feat). Most of the movie is spent chronicling Ben's interactions with his amusingly eccentric co-workers as well as with the beautiful young cashier named Sharon (Emilia Fox) with whom he falls in love.For all its undeniable cleverness and charm, ""Cashback"" never really finds a way to turn its fantastical premise into anything other than an overused gimmick. Indeed, it's hard to tell what exactly Ben thinks he's accomplishing when he pauses everyone in mid action. It doesn't even make much sense within the context of the movie's own storyline, since stopping everything dead in its tracks is certainly no way to make time go FASTER, which is what Ben, in voice-over recitation, keeps telling us he wants to do.The movie is actually at its most enjoyable and authentic when it drops all the silly time-stopping shenanigans and pretentious philosophizing and simply shows us the day-to-day activities of Ben and his fellow employees at the market. One of the themes of the movie is that time moves more slowly when we are trapped in tedious jobs and activities, yet, ironically, it is those very on-the-job activities that are of most interest here. Much of the credit for that goes to the delightful performances of Stuart Goodwin, Michael Dixon and Michael Lambourne as Ben's loopy male co-workers. They are certainly more interesting as people than Sharon and even Ben himself are.Sean Ellis has written and directed the movie with a great deal of elegance and style, utilizing sophisticated ""freezing"" techniques, a smoothly-gliding dolly camera, and a classical music score to great effect. The pacing is often tedious, however, and we sometimes feel less like a witness to Ben's bizarre time-stopping ability than a victim of it. There were certainly times when I wished I had the power to make this movie go faster.Part of the problem may be that the material was originally made into a short in 2004, then expanded into this feature length film in 2006. That may explain the feeling we get that the movie is stretching itself further than perhaps it is able to go. Still, there's much that is good in even this elongated ""Cashback,"" although it certainly leaves one wondering whether the shorter version might not in fact be the better way to go.",Cashback

12,A_Different_Drummer,"erratic, uneven, with moments of pure genius",7,26 August 2015,"Sean Ellis loves women.Never met the man, probably never will, but that was the #1 takeaway from this uneven but thoroughly interesting film.Lots of layered construction in the story.Borrows from the Forgetting Sarah Marshall meme, starts with the protagonist losing his main love, that is the setup for all that follows.Borrows from THE GIRL THE GOLD WATCH AND EVERYTHING, using the ""time freeze"" technique to sync up the viewer and the exposition.Borrows from Ferris Bueller's Day Off, using a probing sort of voice-over to fill in the uneven parts of the story, as with the time freezing (see above) But most of all, when you leave the theatre (or turn off the DVD) if you think about this film at all -- and you may -- what you will remember most are the orations on the beauty of women and the joy of discovery thereof, along with related ideas on how the nature of the female form may not itself be the original art form...? Very uneven -- all the fun parts are off the top, by the half-way point you might be excused for thinking you had stumbled into a regular run of the mill romcom.Fox steals her scenes, exactly as one might expect.",Cashback
13,atlasmb,A Clever Comedic Contemplation,8,20 September 2013,"There are quite a few negative reviews of this film, but the overall score is good. One reason for that could be that this film transforms as it plays out.At first I thought I was watching a rather juvenile comedy, filled with misogynistic sexual references and noisy bodily functions. And the voice over made me wonder if this film could be more than a too obvious snoozefest. But then it turned into a conversation about aesthetics, then a philosophical contemplation, then a mystery, then a romance.The actors all played their parts well. The photography was imaginative. The music was one of the best parts of this film.I especially liked the way his ""stopping time"" was analogous to remembering a moment and to capturing a moment in art.The ending line is ripped straight from Ferris Bueller. That was a little annoying, but then again maybe it was an homage.Cashback is a fun film. Just don't take it too seriously.",Cashback
14,kenjha,Insomnia Rules,8,24 May 2008,"After breaking up with his girlfriend, an art student can't sleep (for weeks!) and finds a job at an all-night supermarket in London. He also has this amazing power to freeze the world (at least in his mind) so he can take his time drawing what interests him, mainly the naked female form. Biggerstaff is likable as the young man with insecurities while Fox nicely plays the lovely lass he meets at work. The stylish direction of Ellis, who also wrote the story, expanding a short he had made a couple of years earlier, infuses the film with a sense of freshness. There is a memorable flashback scene featuring the artist as a young boy and a Swedish exchange student.",Cashback
15,sol-,Pausing Time,6,14 April 2016,"Heartbroken and suffering from chronic insomnia, an aspiring artist takes a night shift job at a local supermarket where he finds a hidden talent for pausing time, but is this gift real or imagined? With such an inventive premise, 'Cashback' opens with quite a lot of promise, but it does not always deliver. Purely metaphorical or not, the stopping time stuff is interesting as it gets our protagonist to wax poetic about time seeming to go too slow except for those brief moments that you only wish could last forever. There is also a lot to like in his philosophy that he might as well get a job to at least ""get cash back"" for his time spent awake at night. While he makes for an empathetic deep-thinking protagonist, Sean Biggerstaff never once acts like a true insomniac though and while his work colleagues get up to some comical mischief on the job, the film misses a ripe opportunity to look at madness spiraling from apparent sleep deprivation. The film's biggest drawback though is its over-reliance on sentimental voice-over narration; Biggerstaff tends to only talk in poetic clichés (""it felt like all the oxygen had been sucked from the room""; ""what is love?"") and a maudlin music score does not help matters at all. There are, however, sufficient comedic quirks to keep things afloat; Biggerstaff's recollection of looking at porn magazines ends with a hilarious gag and a seemingly superfluous sports match turns out to be very, very funny. A talent supporting cast helps too, with Stuart Goodwin getting the best laughs as a boss who tries just a little too hard to be hip all the time.",Cashback
16,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Cashback"" brings new artistic life (and a touch of fantasy) to the indie romance",8,9 August 2009,"Based on his Oscar-nominated short film of the same name, Sean Ellis' ""Cashback"" is an elegant and funny independent film mixing elements of drama, comedy, romance and fantasy. Musing on the relationship between the speed of life and love, ""Cashback"" is an artists rendition of a familiar romance formula.""Cashback"" begins like every other romantic comedy, with its main character Ben (Sean Biggerstaff, best known as Oliver Wood from the first couple Harry Potter movies) getting dumped by his girlfriend, launching him into insomnia and unrelenting personal reflection in the form of narrative. But Ben is an aspiring portrait artist, so Ellis, like his protagonist, reflects that appreciation for imagery in his direction, giving every scene stylishness and grace.Ellis moves the camera in fascinating ways that capture our attention, making so many shots and sequences have an epic quality. At the same time, it's interesting that the film uses so much narrative, making it seem more literary, almost a memoir even, yet Ellis never leans on this writing -- so many images stand out memorably.The fantasy angle of the film comes in when Ben discovers he can slow down and pause time for as long as he likes, a skill he learns at the local Sainsbury's supermarket where he's taken up night hours to make use of his lack of sleep. A long-time connoisseur of the female form, Ben freezes time to draw women in the supermarket, often times nude, yet he reserves some modesty when drawing his new crush, Sharon (Emilia Fox), one of the store clerks. Ellis perfectly captures these images of Ben's affection and the result is that we see the beauty that Ben sees.""Cashback"" is very sexually forward, unafraid but not gratuitous or obnoxious in its use of nudity or sexual reference. Its sense of humor comes mostly in the form simple things like quirky characters and clever one-liners or quick shots. Its humor relies on the viewer finding it endearing and lovable.The movie is also a meditation on time and love, giving us something to think about more so than letting us draw our own meaning. What usually happens is that just as we have surmised our own understanding, more narration comes in speaking of new ideas and we're sort of left confused. Other times, the narration adds key thoughts to our heads that add meaning to what comes next.Boiled down, ""Cashback"" is a really fresh take on the boy gets broken up with, does something as a result, finds new girl and struggles to make sense of love in the meantime. Adding in the simple fantasy element of time control, it manages to look at what we've seen in movies in ways we've never really seen them before, which dresses up the romance clichés quite nicely. ~ Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Cashback
17,billcr12,Mildly Amusing,6,2 August 2012,"Ben has broken up with his girlfriend Suzy and can't sleep. He works at night at a supermarket, and he fantasizes that he can stop time itself. Eventually, his dream becomes reality, and he uses the unique talent to undress women and sketch them nude. Obviously, the script was written by a guy; as many of us would do the same thing. A flashback to Ben's boss's birthday party, where he kisses Suzy, and a girl from the store where he works who asked out on a date witnesses it and storms out. He freezes time, but discovers that he cannot change the past. His friends play a practical joke on him posing as art dealers interested in his sketches. A real gallery owner sees his work and is impressed. Cashback has a romantic and sentimental ending, which was a little too cute for my taste, and overall the movie is mildly amusing.",Cashback
18,Chris_Docker,Could have been worth seeing for more than the 'artistic' nudity,4,30 April 2008,"Cashback is about a young art school student getting over the break-up with his girlfriend. He thinks about her 24 hours a day and can't sleep. So he gets a night job in Sainsburys to fill the night-time hours. There he imagines he can freeze time. This handy trick lets him do things like undress attractive customers to raise his artistic sights to higher levels. Inevitably he manages to date a check-out girl in real time and stop daydreaming.The idea of time freezing as metaphor for what happens when you are stuck in the past is a good one. It also suggests an excellent attribute for any artist who has to freeze something in the mind's eye long enough to re-create it. The problem with Cashback is that it succumbs to its own folly. Originally conceived as a brilliant, Oscar-nominated 18 minute short, writer-director-producer Sean Ellis has tried to make a feature length coming-of-age sexual odyssey from a successful quickie. He even uses original footage from the short. This is sad.In more experienced hands, it might have worked. The idea of losing oneself in sentimentality was expertly delivered in Kar Wai Wong's 2046. But Cashback takes a great idea and then gets lost in it. We get strong sexual images from our protagonist's childhood. A Swedish baby-sitter's detailed backside. A schoolgirl who flashes for 50p. Then lots of nudes in the supermarket as he studies them for future drawings. Except for the check-out girl, nearly every other person is a gross caricature. The overweight, middle-aged art-school model who farts. The overbearing and sexist Sainsburys manager. The macho-boasting co-workers. Better handled, they might be funny. With more depth or slapstick, it might be enjoyable comedy. But even then it would be undermined by lines like, ""I watched the landscape as it clung to the last hours of sunset."" And if it was a better film, Sainsburys would surely be within their rights to sue.Why didn't he bring in some good writers instead of trying to do everything himself? Cashback shows Sean Ellis with a reach that is far beyond his grasp. If it weren't for the Matrix-like freezes and cheesy similes, it could be re-titled, ""Smutty Fantasies of an Art Student."" It does have one well-executed scene, which is the ending. Although predictable, it is beautifully done and adds an extra layer to the 'between the moments in time' imagery. Otherwise the movie's greatest benefit is a little 15-rated soft-porn for 14yr olds sneaking in under the radar. For that, it fits the bill admirably (the BBFC found that it was, ""explicit but . . . entirely natural rather than sexualised"" and that, with the 15 rating, there are ""no constraints on nudity in a non-sexual context""). Sean Ellis had a lucky break and lost his cinematic virginity with an acclaimed short. Someone should have mentioned it is time for him to move on.",Cashback
19,smatysia,I can't decide,6,31 December 2019,"The big debate about this film seems to be if it is creepy and prurient, or not. I can't decide. Yes, the nudity could be considered gratuitous, but then you could say that about any film. Many, many films were made in the Forties and Fifties with adult themes but without nudity. Female nudes are simply beautiful, and that has been known and celebrated by artists for centuries. Was all that prurient? Maybe. Is my opinion about this prurient? Maybe. But I liked the film, and would have probably liked it less if it had been censored.",Cashback

I had to find other things to do while watching just to get through it. And I SO did not care about this guy's problems. Listening to the whining narration was painful. I wish I could erase this movie out of existence.",Cashback
21,TdSmth5,Good romantic movie that does not forget about Eros.,8,27 September 2007,"As a love story, this movie is excellent. There are some good musings on time, love, art, beauty, which are fairly insightful. There's also a coming-of-age sub story here, which I found very true-to-life and devoid of fantastic elements a la Hollywood.What is I found particularly effective is the performative character of the film. The narrator rather then wishing time to go by fast, rather than trying to escape time, jumps into the moment and freezes it. At this point most action in the movie stops, and things slow down considerably as if the filmmakers are asking the viewer to do the same. Boredom can quickly set in with this kind of movies. The main character uses this prolonged Now to contemplate the eminently contemplable: beauty as represented in beautiful women and their bodies. And fortunately for the viewer this movie has a lot of beautiful women.Oddly out of place is the actress cast as is his love interest who is not particularly beautiful at all, especially compared to his ex (Bionic Woman's Michelle Ryan). Neither are the two strippers who, well, should have been beautiful.As with all British movies, the humor is not everyone's cup of tea. Some dialogue and scenes are funny. But then there's a goofy extended soccer/football match, which is neither funny nor serves any purpose in the film.I found the score to be just horrible. Especially the orchestrated parts and in particular when the director has the need for a song to be a character in the movie. Musical tastes are highly subjective and individual so if one chooses to let songs have a role in a film by increasing the volume and stopping action and dialogue forcing the audience to take note of the song, one runs the risk of annoying some viewers. However, they redeemed themselves here by introducing a wonderful song by Royksopp, which I've never heard.

22,jaybob,A film for those of us willing to suspend belief & have an imagination,9,6 March 2009,"The plot of this film is one of the basic 4 movie plots. Boy Meets Girl etc. Now how do you make this old standby, a gem of a movie.Sean Ellis the Writer/director in 2004 first created this as 17 minute short & besides being nominated for an Oscar, it won many other short film awards, Deservedly so. Using a vivid imagination,some fantasy, a very good cast of characters & the cooperation of a major Chain supermarket he & his team created a brilliant short/The following year,He expanded his screenplay to feature length & with the same cast of near unknowns made a first class comedy.It is a bit naughty in spots, BUT its mild compared to other similar films. There is a fair amount of nudity, Non-sexual & cleverly done.The film was released here in the US in July 2007 for a short 2 week run playing in ONLY 9 theatres.As typical that good films with no major stars in it get next to no release, while junk with front page stars play in 2000 theatres.As I stated, there are no major names we know well in this.The leads are. Sean Biggerstaff (he was in a few Harry Potter films)and Emelia Fox (daughter of noted star Edward Fox), Both are absolute delights.You must suspend belief & accept the fact time that our hero can maketime stand still. & like in many films of the past, there is a happy ending and the stars dreams and aspirations can happen.Thankfully there is no slapstick humour, but plenty good natured fun. As noted above there is nudity, but the bodies are beautiful to begin with. Our hero is an aspiring besides being still in an Art school.For sport fans there is a crazy football (soccer) game,They do not waste too much time on this.The song score is pleasant, the sets are very good,in fact I liked everything in this film. If you have a good fantasy imagination I think you will love it this like I did, It is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.Ratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 93 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)++++ for this type of movie this about the highest rating possible.",Cashback
23,Enchorde,Original intelligent romantic comedy,7,22 August 2009,"Recap: After a painful breakup from his girlfriend Suzy, Ben begins to suffer from insomnia. To make something off it he starts to work the night shift at a local supermarket. There he thinks about life, tries to heal his wounds and develop his interest, to paint. With him on the shift is an odd group of characters and each of them has their own way of making the time go by.Comments: A little different romantic comedy. Much more thoughtful and reflective than most other movies it brings an element that many movies in the genre lack. The main character Ben is almost philosophical in his way and the comic elements of the movie is delivered, as in many other cases, by the supporting cast. Ben's best friend Sean and his adventures with the ladies is one of the best, but his co-workers add their peculiar humor to the picture. Those are characters that could never be in the spotlight, but as supporting characters they excel.But as it is Ben that drives the story its pace is quite slow. This is not one of these fast paced crazy filled comedies that are quite common. But I didn't miss that pace. Actually its slow, mindful approach was a piece of fresh air.There are two additional points I like to comment. There are some nudity in this movie. But this is not to be mistaken for a movie made for teenage boys. Unlike many other movies where nudity is just thrown in to cover a bad story, here it doesn't disturb me. It fits in. The other point is that Sean Ellis, the writer/producer/director has been very creative and imaginative with his cuts and camera movements. They are sometimes subtle, but surprisingly good and well worth to keep an eye out for.7/10",Cashback
24,jaredmobarak,The two meanings of crushCashback,10,18 August 2007,"Upon seeing the much talked about 2004 short Cashback a couple years ago, I was utterly blown away. I checked out Sean Ellis quickly after to see what was next on his slate. To my surprise, it was a feature length version of his brilliant short. I didn't know what to think, how could he hope to enhance what worked so well in 25 minutes? How could he risk ruining the beauty and magic of what he had? To my shock, he not only kept the stunning visual flair and emotive compositions, freezing beauty and time, he enhanced it completely. The film Cashback is a pure work of art to be viewed with a gallery mentality. This is not a movie to be taken lightly, but a piece of art to behold with wonder and thought. It is a journey through the meaning of love and the beauty of everything around us.Our story involves an art student named Ben who has just experienced a bad breakup with his first real girlfriend. The thoughts running through his head and the void that the departure has made in his life causes him to be unable to go to sleep. Not able to deal with the extras hours of torture, making him stew in the memories that were long gone, he takes a job working the night shift at a local supermarket. Why not get cash back for his traded extra time? While his co-workers deal with the monotony of eight hours by avoiding the clock, fooling around, or messing with the customers""helping the ladies"" is a hilarious game of theirs, with fantastic payoff at the endBen finds that his way to get through time's sluggish pace is to stop it altogether. He freezes time and space so that he can spend it looking at the beauty that is reality. The still-lifes of life itself are there to be looked at if one takes the time and effort to do so. Being that the female form has always been an inspiration of beauty to him, he starts using the women customers, in suspended animation, as his models to hone his drawing and painting skills. Amidst everything, he and his co-workers take a journey together in life and its cyclical nature and run-ins with coincidence and fate. When Ben falls for his friend Sharon, his world opens back up and he sees what it is to truly be alive.The plot is simple yet deep in scope. There are many ideas being put out there, but it is not the words of our characters that help express them. Ellis has chosen to give us a mostly silent film, where the visuals are the real impetus and force behind its progression. Told with voice-over throughout its duration, the audience is allowed to bask in the mesmerizing moments put to film. Between his wonderful transitions from present to past recollections of childhood, seamlessly panned over from timeframe to timeframe, to the living paintings walked through by Ben, to the breathtaking slow-motion sequences, you will be transfixed and unable to divert your eyes from the screen. His use of light and glares on the women he allows to fill the frame is amazing and almost every single second could be paused and put on display as photographic artwork. Some of the compositions and use of mise-en-scène are astounding. From the fearless framing of empty space while the focal point is just standing in the corner, to the use of the scene's environment to create space, either Ellis or his cinematographer, or both, is a genius. I keep thinking of the moment Ben is drawing Sharon at the checkout line, the frame is 95% filled with the white of the back of his pad, only the tiny triangle of space in the top left corner allows his face to be visible.There really is nothing aesthetically bad I can think of saying. Cashback is as visually stunning a film as I have ever seen, and coming from a first time director is all the more impressive. With all that said, though, the movie is definitely not for everyone. The prudish should stay away because there is a lot of nudity throughout. I would say that while almost all of it is tastefully done and likened to a gallery setting where nudes are the norm, it could still be uncomfortable for some unused to it being so prevalent. The female form is never really exploited here and never used to titillate. It is a fill-in for the beauty in the world that people just don't take the time to seek out anymore. Each composition containing the curves of a woman's body is a sight in its own right. Ellis had a vision and he nailed it completely.All the acting is good as well, especially our leads Sean Biggerstaff as Ben and Emilia Fox as Sharon. They both film effectively and the silent moments of their faces emoting their feelings for each other only enhance the story rather than slow it down in pacing. All the supporting players are great also, adding some wonderful moments of levity and helping keep the movie's tone from being too dramatic. Again, though, these characters are only vessels being led around to show us the love in the air; it is their actions that speak louder than words ever could. I don't know whether Ellis refilmed the moments from his short or just used the original footage, but it all keeps the same aesthetic and feel. Those minutes are used almost completely in the first hour, which is surprising because the final act is so well done and cohesive with the start. The final scene at the gallery and outside is just plain gorgeous and puts a fitting conclusion to a masterpiece of style.",Cashback
25,thekarmicnomad,A very British 'comedy',7,9 July 2011,"This is an excellent movie but could be miss-sold. If you are after a glitzy, easy going, U.S style comedy with some boobs thrown in you are up for disappointment.The first half an hour is quite down beat and devoid of laughs. The pace of the movie is slow and considered and it is a little darker and grittier than a standard commercial comedy and quite 'artsy'.The camera work is fantastic! There are some truly amazing shots, so understated their brilliance almost sneak past you(like the falling into bed sequence). The narrative and acting is spot on. The story is engaging and very humorous in a typically dry British way.Despite the bare chested lady on the front I watched this with my girlfriend and we both enjoyed it immensely.*Warning* There is bucket loads of nudity. It is all very tastefully done but sitting through this with mum and dad could be excruciating.",Cashback
26,itamarscomix,Fresh and Creative,8,30 July 2012,"Cashback zigzags back and forth between true inspiration one minute, and clichés of romantic comedy and physical humor the next. But even at its worst, I found myself enjoying it, the wonderfully fresh camera work and the simple but fun story. It's true that the rom-com elements, as well as some over-long slapstick scenes like the embarrassing mirror montage and the whole football scene, don't add much, and the film probably worked just as well as an 18-minute short, but the more beautiful parts more than make up for it, and even in the romantic scenes I found myself rooting for the protagonists and sharing their happiness, rather than cringing at the cheese - not an easy task by itself. Overall, a very impressive directorial debut for Sean Ellis, and a thoroughly enjoyable movie, halfway between a feel-good dramedy and an art-house film.",Cashback
27,MihaiSorinToma,A superb way of telling one's story,10,1 February 2018,"Being traumatized after breaking up with his girlfriend, an apparently normal teenager gains insomnia. As he tries to kill time, he gets a job at a local supermarket where he begins to experience a lot of weird facts about life itself. He's trapped between the boundaries of reality and imagination with the ability to freeze time and thus being able to see the world from a very different perspective.It's a movie which benefits from an unique artistic direction, presenting what initially seems pretty ordinary story, but manages to take it to a complete new level. The whole idea of stopping time is simply astonishing, very well thought and implemented into the film, bringing a lot of spice into an already excellent blend. Speaking of which, the movie is able to combine a very good plot, told in a special way by the main character as the story progresses, a couple of complex and very different characters, much drama and romance into the same place, thus the result is incredible. Besides being captivating and very interesting, besides the affection the main character demands and also receives from the viewer, and also besides the excellent acting, this one manages to be funny in many moments, even hilarious at times, bringing a change of mood whenever it considers it necessary.As you might have guessed by now, I was truly impressed by this movie. It managed to provide some high-quality time with its story, its excellent characters and actors, its impressive artistic and cinematic direction, generating plenty of emotion, drama but also laughter. It seems like a biography but the way it is presented definitely made me fell for it.",Cashback
28,mario_c,Like an intimate and deep thought brought to the screen,8,17 May 2009,"CASHBACK is like an intimate and deep thought brought to the screen. It's like a personal diary, as the always present narrative speech proves, where we can see all the thoughts, illusions and hopes of a mind that is lost, not only in time but also with its own feelings. The screenplay has excellent lines with deep and philosophical thoughts and feelings that everyone felt at least one time in his/her life. However the best part of this movie to me is the cinematography. It has beautiful shots, plans, transitions, still images and paintings... like another user said it's ""art in motion"". At parts it can be considered a poetic film. But what's even more interesting is that it mixes all this artistic ambiance, the melancholy, the beautiful and deep thoughts and feelings, with some elements of crude humor and eroticism... I think it really never loses the elegance, but that scene in the beginning when the old model is farting while he's posing in the Fine Arts School is simply hilarious. Like occurs in that scene there're a few more where this smooth and melancholic poetic feeling is interrupted by a great crude and hilarious laugh! And that's good! The erotic element is also present and is very well done as well. The scene where we see the nude and astonishing beauty of the Swedish girl is sweet and seductive at the same time.Not being absolutely original in its elements, because it uses some ideas we have already seen in other flicks, globally I think this film is different and some kind of innovative, at least transforming an usual and boring supermarket job into something poetic and deeply emotional...",Cashback
29,witster18,good effort,8,8 August 2007,"Ellis took great care in making 'Cashback'. The plot is original and the subplots are fairly well-developed. The film has many moments of brilliance. Some of the concerns I had about the film tying in early segments and bringing it all together were unwarranted. The film does a good job of completing the love story. The sexy, art driven style leaves a host of connections that you'll be thinking about well after the credits end. The color, the colorful cast of (developed)characters..take note Hollywood, and the direction of this film, stand out as strong points... I was surprised at Ellis' successes in incorporating the crazy band of characters into the love story. As far as genre, and overall quality, this film falls between 'Career Opportunities' and the original'Great Expectations'... leaning closer to the latter in quality..drawing on many of the strengths..and some of the weaknesses of both. Ellis' direction is above average...as is his writing....the comedy is funny.... the love story complete....this deserves its rating here. Recommended. 80/100",Cashback
30,Superunknovvn,Nice little sleeper with flaws,7,28 March 2008,"I had never heard of ""Cashback"" until I noticed that eye-catcher of a DVD-cover in my local videostore. It doesn't happen very often that movies with an interesting DVD cover are also very interesting to watch. ""Cashback"" is the exception to that rule.The movie has got an interesting concept. Ben, a guy whose just been dumped by his girlfriend, suffers from insomnia and takes on a job at a supermarket to use his extra time and make some money during the night. There he gets to know some wacky characters who all have their ways to fight the boredom of their eight hour-shift at work. Ben has got his own technique: he ""freezes"" time and walks around, looking at the beauty of things (mainly nude women).""Cashback"" starts out so great. It's heartbreaking to watch Ben suffer from the break-up with his girlfriend. The movie gives us even more to identify with when Ben takes on the job at the supermarket. We all know that feeling of being stuck in a dead-end job with an idiot boss and time just won't go by during your shift. And when Ben starts freezing a moment in time for the first time, that's the obvious highlight of the film - especially for men, who can watch Ben living out one of their greatest secret fantasies (just why are there only girls who look like supermodels in this movie?).It was interesting for me to learn afterwards that this portion of ""Cashback"" had been a stand alone short movie two years before the release of the full length feature. (Apparently, it has even been nominated for an Oscar!). Well, that makes a lot of sense in hindsight as the rest of the movie seems very much built around it.Firstly, the character of Ben's boss has a weird change of personality. Whereas he is kind of aggressive in the time freezing-sequence, he comes across as a ridiculous, but likable dork in the rest of the movie. The tone of the story also shifts curiously throughout. ""Cashback"" starts out as a clever drama in the vein of ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind"", then all of a sudden there are some totally goofy and uncalled for feelgood-comedy moments spliced in (worst offender is an unbearable montage of all the main characters getting ready for a party by dancing around in front of their mirrors - yuk!). When the movie ends, it has turned into an unrealistic romantic comedy with a sappy ending, leaving the viewer with the feeling of just having watched a strangely incoherent film.Knowing that director/writer Sean Ellis had to extend his original idea and write a whole motion picture around it, I can see where this incoherence is coming from. It's a bit of a shame that Ellis wasn't able to stretch out the feel of the short movie over the course of 90 minutes, but ""Cashback"" is still an enjoyable little flick with a great cast and some highly intriguing scenes. Definitely check it out, if you get the chance.",Cashback

32,rajdoctor,Cashback,4,10 June 2007,"The IMDb review of this film impressed me and I went to see this movie because it was running at low seat occupancy and I presumed that if I do not go to see this movie early it might be taken off the theatres by next week; thus an early rush for this movie.The story is about a young boy Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) and his life  ambition, interest, friends, thoughts and love. It starts with Ben's broken relationship, and sleepless nights, leading him to take a night shift job in a mad Departmental store with unusually crazy characters; where Ben finds new love (Emilia Fox) of his life and carry forwards his hobby of painting his love on canvass. In the end Ben gets the needed break at a prestigious art gallery with his paintings and new love besides him.While in the theatres - I had imagined the direction to be too amateurish and biographical  like done by a gang of college kids. I was true. I read later that the Director Sean Ellis (does not that name sound a take off of the lead character Ben Willis?) had made 18 minute short film with the same name in 2004 and that was nominated for best short film at Oscars. That must have inspired and motivated Sean Ellis to make a full length feature film by the same name in 2006 with the same cast.I have not seen the 18 minute version, but I can imagine that it would be much more entertaining than this full 102 minute feature film, which is entertaining in bits and parts, blushingly touches a delicate theme of female beauty, and has a few moments of young humor.The director has lost the focus of the movie in too much of a biographical sketch. It is too self-obsessive and repetitive in some unique values of stand-still time concepts. The director had possibility of exploring the female beauty and body or the stand-still time concept, but instead Sean Ellis has tried to put too many things of commercial interest in the movie  that becomes an uncooked Khichadi (an Indian dish of mixed grains) in the end.The lead pair looks great, and have acted their role decently, but nothing much to write about. The movie in major parts is a bore. May you find joy in associating with some scenes that may make you say the movie is OKAY, but not for me  it is a NO-NO.(Stars 4 out of 10)",Cashback

35,Flagrant-Baronessa,I kept smiling like an idiot,9,24 November 2006,"What an intense and creative film this is and what a treat it was to have the charming Sean Biggerstaff present it at the Stockholm International Film Festival. He is proud of 'Cashback', and rightly so  for you will be pressed to find a prettier fantasy or funnier characters in a film this year.'Cashback' is director Sean Ellis' debut feature and he recreates the atmosphere of his same-titled short film with deft strokes, breathing life into a fantasy movie masking as a romantic comedy. Do not write it off on the basis of this negatively-connoted label, rather see it as a creative drama that delivers comedy by the bucketload. The fact is that 'Cashback' delves deep into the emotions of its protagonist Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) much like a drama. It opens with his girlfriend dumping him, screaming and throwing things. In the following weeks, Ben suffers from insomnia and thus finds that he has eight extra hours at his disposal. To pass the time, he works the dreary nightshift at Sainsbury's.The supermarket job is mundane at first but soon offers an outlet for Ben's creative side. As an art student, he learns to find the beauty in still images every second of the day. This includes the unspeakable beauty in a spilled bag of green peas on aisle four. It also includes freezing time and undressing women (Ben finds great source of interest in the female form), arguably the film's most intense sequences. Here there is a kind of seamless intercutting of scenes, scenery, flashbacks, reality and fantasy that all melt together fluently as the director navigates through Ben's life and thoughts. The latter soothingly narrates the course of events, which cements his likability as a central character.The unspeakable beauty in the dreamy cinematography is rivalled only by the other side of the tapestry  the comedy. I was rather unprepared for this diversion into hilarity, and expected Cashback to be a drama. Naturally, the amount of well-placed comedy floored my low expectations. In the front row for hilarity sits Ben's two colleagues at Sainsbury's, whom he introduces in brilliant ways. These are two dumb and goofy guys in their late teens who pass their time doing pranks and acting like idiots, such as smuggling sex toys in women's shopping bags at Sainsbury's and guffawing at the effect when she sees it and picks it up. The passing of time indeed proves a central theme in 'Cashback'.But there is a wide array of noteworthy performances from the supporting cast, not just in Barry and Matt. Ben's boss also proves a massive crowd-pleaser and the level of seriousness which he applies to situations (such as the mighty football tournaments between supermarkets) is a goldmine for comedy. As ever, there is a romantic interest (Emilia Fox)  a girl who works at the same supermarket during the same shifts  who is the film's most likable and interesting character, bar none. My theatre audience also demanded Sean Biggerstaff on some info on this lovely actress.It needs to be said that 'Cashback' is a sexually aggressive film with plenty of nudity and stories of sexual awakening. All women are also suspiciously attractive (it has often been brought up, beamed Biggerstaff in the Q&A session). It's funny, it's sexy and it's sweet  puffed full of insights in Ben's narration. Better yet, it is a surprisingly ambitious film that strikes me more as a mainstream feature than quirky indie fare (if it wasn't for the nudity). For instance, the classical score is so epic and well-fitted that it sounds like it belongs in 'Gladiator' or any other high-profile sweeping epic. For that matter, Sean Ellis has worked in a homage to the latter at one point when the boss gives a rallying speech during the football tournament, telling his employers to think of him 'as Russell Crowe'.The film has only two faults as far as I can see it: its wildly unfocused story and its slightly cheesy ending. The former did not prove a problem or a distraction, but rather made it feel like 'Cashback' attempted a lot of different story lines and detours and diversions. That said, I can see how it could be considered a problem. The ending discards some of the unpredictable magic by tipping into saccharine but it is nothing fatal. The fact is that Cashback is a remarkable film in both comedy and drama aspects and I urge you to watch it if you are even a slight fan of Biggerstaff.9 out of 10",Cashback

38,ayoreinf,How real is the imagination?,8,10 January 2013,"I've seen this movie over two years ago, about a year after seeing its shorter version. I still remember it as vividly as if I've just seen it. Aestetically it's a stunning film, it's simply painfully beautiful. The actors do their job well, the pace is right, it doesn't suffer from most of the ailments of first feature length production, ailments that many highly regarded directors demonstrated in their first (or early) feature length productions. There's only one obvious miss in the entire film - a mystery that the director/scriptwriter added to the longer version without really figuring out why is he doing it, so it's left there in the film unsolved with no relation to anything. But the rest is so close to perfection that I'm willing to ignore this next to insignificant flaw. There's still one more point I want to make, because I think that's the main point the movie makes to begin with. The movie's official summery always states that Ben, the movie's lead, ""imagines"" he has the ability to freeze time. That's also the way Ben himself refers to his ability, but the movie itself is far from clear on that issue. It's not like Ben is presented as a superhero or something of that sort, but in both versions of the movie what he imagines is presented as real. This leads into a real deep discussion that I won't conduct on this stage but for me this movie is really about the question I presented in the title of this review, not many movies dare going into deep metaphysical issues while still remaining free of pretentiousness, Cashback does it, and for that fact alone it deserves all the accolades it was given and more.",Cashback

Even without the romance, Cashback has enough story to enthusiastically enthrall you to the very end. It's got some excellent elements of light humour to support its sometimes heavy themes and also encapsulates you in this in depth character study. However, some may say that the film has a few plot holes in terms of the time stopping to pass time idea, but overall it is very effective in telling an advanced story. A very good, sometimes emotional film, that tugs at the heart strings at times and is very exciting.

It also introduces a lot of quirky characters. Unfortunately, the second half is weaker and doesn't fulfill expectations. However, the several moments of pure grace in this film, helped by the wonderful soundtrack, counter the few weaknesses. Yes there are several naked women but it works in the context of the story although some might seem gratuitous. I liked the gallery of secondary characters although none were particularly developed.

The meager attempts at humor fall flat, mainly because the tone established is one of syrupy love-lorn romance, not ironic comedy in the style of (say) CLERKS. And despite the premise, don't be mistaken into think this is anything like CLICK - there is no logical explanation for time standing still other than the young man's whim.

This character, Ben, learns how to freeze time at his dull late night job at a supermarket.Ben takes this opportunity to disrobe and violate (figuratively) every attractive female patron of the market, taking time for ample sketching of their naked forms.Neither Ben or anyone else in the movie engenders the slightest bit of interest, empathy, or even consciousness. The relatively short running time seems like hours spent without reward. Even the abounding number of attractive female nudes fails to lift the interest level a single notch above numbing boredom with shades of bad taste and implied perversion.A thorough waste of time!",Cashback
44,axlrhodes,About as intelligent as a nude porn mag.,1,3 February 2011,"I recently watched the 17 minute short of Cashback and for the life of me, i cannot explain the 7.5 rating on IMDb. The film is just an adolescent, leery production that was no more intelligent or thought provoking than flicking to page 3 of a UK red top newspaper. The dialogue about the clock watching i could identify with but the overall message is grotty and ill conceived. In a world where beauty is seen mostly seen as only being skin deep, this film does nothing to dispel or encourage any other kind of thinking. The film thinks it's being clever but anything but. Its obvious and foul in the way it looks at how men view women as nothing more sex objects. This is the film equivalent of six builders having a tea break,wolf whistling and shouting like apes at any unfortunate young female passer by. If this film struck a chord with you, you're the sort of person i don't want to know. Awful, awful , awful!!!",Cashback
45,larry-411,A sweet little masterpiece,10,20 September 2006,"I attended the world premiere of ""Cashback"" at the Toronto International Film Festival. I walked out in a daze. I had a feeling I'd seen something special, that moment when you have to pause to take a breath and reflect on what you've experienced. I still had about 20 films to go at the time, and ""Cashback"" raised the bar and became the benchmark against which all the others would have to be compared. As it turned out, nothing came close. Of the 30 plus films I saw that week, ""Cashback"" tops the list.Literally built around the short film of the same name which screened at festivals in 2004, triple threat writer/director/producer Sean Ellis did something ingenious. Rather than take his 20 minute piece and expand it to fill 90 minutes, he created a new Act One and Act Three to bookend a reworking of the original short in the center. And he pulled it off with a tour de force of light and sound. The result is an eerie, compelling twist on the classic Outer Limits episode where time stops while the protagonist weaves in and out of the frozen characters in another dimension. It may sound like sci-fi, but this is a sweet romantic comedy whose storyline is among the most original I've ever seen on screen. The concept is brilliant and the result magnificent.The look is lush, cinematography by Angus Hudson breathtaking, and ""Cashback"" features an appropriately sweet score. They combine to give this low budget project a big movie feel, destined for the wide audience it deserves.Most of all, I believe ""Cashback"" is the vehicle which will introduce newcomer Sean Biggerstaff (Oliver Wood of ""Harry Potter"") to the world. His star tun in this film as protagonist Ben Willis left me speechless. The camera loves him, and he is on screen virtually from opening to closing credits. This film is his to make or break. It rests on his shoulders, and he owns the material.As they say, you'll laugh, you'll cry, and I walked out with a tear in my eye and a smile on my face. And no other film I saw at the Toronto Film Festival did that to me. ""Cashback"" is a sweet little masterpiece.",Cashback
46,Ozzy2000,Great Light Comedy,10,23 May 2008,Originally a short film is was skilfully expanded into a feature first time director Sean Ellis. I think British films find producing comedy a bit difficult but this one is not bad light comedy. The story is about an artist Ben Willis who cannot sleep after his separation with his girlfriend. He decides to get a job as a night packer in a supermarket. As a consequence of his vivid imagination he freezes moments of time in his imagination when he sees attractive females and imagines them to become naked. Of course this is known to be a favorite male pastime anyway but Ben uses his images to transform the nude poses to Art which sought of legitimizes his obsession. Eventually Ben transcends viewing women as just objects by his artistic and ethereal portrayals. The effects in the film and slight intrigue create a pleasurable little film and is worth catching on DVD. Males should be warned there is some scenes involving nubile naked young women and should contain themselves if ladies are present. ;O).,Cashback

49,cashbacher,What could be creepy works very well,10,9 December 2019,"The major premise of this movie is fundamentally something that in other hands would be creepy, but in this case, it is so well done that it leads to a love story. Ben Willis is a student at an art college, and he is involved in a nasty breakup with his girlfriend. This leads to a major bout of insomnia where he does not sleep at all for days. In order to make something positive out of this condition, he takes a night shift job at a local supermarket. His co-workers are a strange lot that engage in many activities in an attempt to alleviate the boredom of working nights.
Ben discovers that he has a strange power, he is able to freeze time, where every person and object but Ben is locked into position until he restarts the universe by cracking his hands. During the period where time is frozen, Ben can manipulate the objects, moving and adjusting them.
In one segment, he locks the supermarket in place and then goes down an aisle, disrobing the women and then making detailed sketches of them. He does so in order to capture their beauty and he carefully puts their clothing back in place before he restarts time. In other circumstances, this would be incredibly creepy, but it is so well done that you feel for Ben as he struggles to make something of himself. Ben comes across as being truly interested in the women as an artist and not as a voyeur.
There is also a bit character named Natalie that fulfills the fantasy of nearly every boy slightly north of 10. For a small amount of money, she will drop her underwear and then lift her skirt in order to give a boy an extended flash.
There is a happy ending, but it takes some effort and convolutions to get there. The performances of all the characters are superb and complement each other very well. Ben's best friend is one of the most memorable bad-boy supporting characters of all time. While he may not have any redeeming qualities, he is essential to making the story work.",Cashback

He goes to work at a grocery store, where his imagination and eccentric coworkers help him through the breakup and put a little romance back into his life.There is some artistic nudity, where our protagonist sketches various men and women in the buff; none of it seems gratuitous, it's just one more part of the film. I'm a big fan of artistic nudity, although I have to admit I've never been able to get chicks to strip down in the supermarket as they do in this film. It's a talent, certainly, that every man could use.Overall, it's a slightly offbeat romantic comedy of the sort we could use more of. Not formulaic, not predictable, but enjoyable and entertaining. I watched it with my girlfriend, who refused to pose artistically afterwards, but you can't have everything. I've noticed that romantic movies don't necessarily translate into romantic activities for the people watching them; there should be a category of movies that does so, although I don't know what it would be.All in all, it's a good date movie, good couch movie, just a good movie to watch when you're in the mood for something lighthearted and quirky.",Cashback

Men fail to pick up on serious clues from girls that could reward them in a big way. Men are so lost.Oh, but what if you can freeze time and take girls' clothes off. But that's about two minutes of the movie. If you want that, you'll get short shrift.This gives us writer/director Sean Ellis' snapshot of young British men and women who are connecting on every possible level, good and bad. meaningful and stupid, but mostly for naught because ... well because they are young and stupid.

A familiar theme, but this one is done very artfully in a very comedic fashion. His so-worker are very infantile, yet funny - and the young lady he falls for is enchanting.Lots of nudity in this one - but that does not get in the way of the story. Best moments - when he shares his gift with his new girlfriend - and his friend Sean continually being rebuffed by girls he is trying to pick up. No really bad moments in this one.THis kept my interest throughout & reinforced my long held notion to make every minute count. Come to think of it, why am I doing this? (writing these reviews) Is there a better use of my time? And what about all the movies I watch? Could I be doing something more useful?Then I think I have been purposeful my whole life - very little time to really sit back and relax in the moment - without so much to do. So why not?

The story is set around a young art student who has split up with his girlfriend and struggles with the breakup. This leads him into a world of sleepless nights and more questions than answers. His Body clock becomes dysfunctional as he starts a job in a supermarket. Time pauses and he sees things with such clarity, a second can become an hour or clarity is lost and an hour can become a second. As a result he finds beauty and a muse in a girl he meets at his new job.Some scenes are filmed with such artistic talent its hard to believe the same director filmed other parts. This was originally a short film lasting 20 mins and 2 years later the final full length cut was finished and it shows. Although the final cut has some very beautiful extra moments it seems to suffer in the editing department. Certain scenes overrun and drag and suffer to fit in with other parts of the film. As a result sections drag and the magic is somehow lost.Overall the film is great and the story is interesting. I would like to see 15 - 20 mins cut out of this film to make it the truly finished article. It should be a case of less is more. At the moment its a mish mash of something trying to be beautiful and something trying to be ""Human Traffics"" long lost cousin. I was waiting for Danny Dyer to make a cameo at any moment. Definitely worth the watch and definitely worth paying for. I give it a 7 but could have been an 8 or 9 without pointless immature stuff. I would also warn anyone who has a problem with nudity and sexual content that this film contains both. Most of it is done with poise and beauty but some of it is done with British slapstick at its most average.For American watchers look out for a fuller Michelle Ryan from Bionic Woman when she was healthier and more Beautiful before she turned into an LA matchstick.

54,ssto,amazing,10,16 July 2007,"amazing movie!haven't you had the idea to freeze the moment, to stop the world from turning so you can enjoy a particular moment forever? Ben Willis can do this. And he does it, for this exact reason - to lock on the moment, so he can enjoy it forever and then move to another moment to enjoy, because this is life - a sequence of splashes, so beautiful, but also so faint, you can miss them in the blink of an eye. in the end, make sure you have as many of those moments as possible, because this is what you'll cherish most in this life - those precious moments of love, beauty, emotiona beautifully told story. it is mixed with many funny moments too, so that if you don't want go deeper in the story you can just enjoy another movie about employees having fun at their boring job.but there is also the other side of the story - the search for beauty. this search with eyes wide open, without prejudice, without hypocritical puritanism, just the pure enjoyment of God's creations, just the pure freedom of nudeness. how brainwashed must you be to deny the beauty of the naked female body? but lets not go into this...and i also loved that creepy moment when Ben discovers he may not be alone in this world of frozen time! examining this plot line of course is not subject of this movie, but how genius it is to integrate it into it!creative director's work, great visual effects - its so nice to see how the advancements of technology are put to work for something beautiful, the way they were supposed to. great acting, great story that always keeps you close to it, never at a distance. at one point the movie made me think of 'Whatever Happened to Harold Smith?' - another great British movie similar in tone and pace. at another point after i watched the movie i thought of the beautiful 'Bin-jip' ('3-Iron')as a hastened conclusion: very highly recommended movie! i loved it, watch it and decide for yourself10/10peace and love",Cashback

To occupy the late night hours when most people sleep, he takes on an overnight job at a local supermarket and joins the crew of night denizens. Ben has aspirations of becoming an artist and to pass the time he amuses himself by freezing time and admiring the beauty of the various female customers and another co-worker, Sharon (Emilia Fox).

56,Manal1987,Cashback (2006): Art and Narcissism,6,25 December 2016,"In his semi-autobiopic debut feature film Cashback (2006), writer and director Sean Ellis offers us an exclusive look inside a young artist's mind – his mind. His protagonist, Ben Willis (nicely played by Sean Biggerstaff), is an art student who decides to work the night shift at a local supermarket to overcome a recent breakup and an ensuing incurable insomnia. His lack of sleep develops an artistic habit of freezing time and seeing into the beauty of mundane surroundings that usually go unnoticed.A very promising premise that loses its rigor to narcissistic self- immersion.It is true that art is inherently narcissistic; it is all about the artist's vision of the world. The artist allows us to see things differently by shunning the familiar and comfortable collective outlook and assuming an individual perspective. Nevertheless, as the saying goes, it is takes two to tango, and the artistic process, even though innately egoistic, is not self-reflective. The audience is always an integral part.Much of the film's freshness and originality have been obscured by Ellis's aimless meandering through his vision as an artist. It is definitely wonderful that he shares his exceptional vision with us, but he ignores the refinement necessary for viewers' reception. The end result is a picture that lacks focus and purpose, and borders on infantile disarray. Although it clearly sets itself within the boundaries of metafiction, the tone comes off as distant and lofty (pretty much like Biggerstaff's face throughout the movie) that the comic and amorous elements have become irrevocably dissonant.I love films that leave me with mixed feelings. However, Cashback has left me with mixed feelings I cannot relate to or even attempt to understand. I do not think of myself as an artist but I cherish imagination more than words can say, and I know that confusion (the state of being confused and confusing) is one price to pay for this wonderful gift. It is the artist's choice though to either reach out or further distance him/herself. I mentioned earlier that the film is metafictional in the sense that Ellis's artistic choices in delivering the film to us is echoed by Willis's choices in trying to impart his art on the world around him. Both handle the outside world and its inhabitants as inferior subjects detached from the self to the extent that the humanity of the connection is reduced to a microscopic size; the human element in Ellis's picture is basically as emotionally aloof as the love relationship between Ben and Sharon.The artist's eyes notice things that we cannot see, and attract our attention to them. Ellis and Willis have got only half of their job done.",Cashback

The premise of being able to freeze frame time was fun even if it has been done before. The part I was not prepared for was the lead character's droll and depressing persona. When he freezes the scenes to explore things up close, he talks and we are forced to listen to the most unintelligible, self-indulgent drivel in film history. One can always forgive the young girls and boys for incoherence and sophistry, but please someone, anyone, kill me now before the next monologue. They were brutal.

58,Sanou_san,Simply brilliant,10,6 December 2008,"Cashback was certainly a hit for me. Considering that I got curious how Sean Biggerstaff shows his talent in his self-employed character on screen, this movie was indeed a brilliant one. Cashback is mix of comedy, romance and a bit of mysterywell it was well emphasized all throughout, but I believe many viewers would interpret it in a variety of different ways, and that what makes the movie even nicer. The story of the film centers in the character of Ben Willis (played by Sean Biggerstaff). Broken, retarded and extremely imaginative, he tends to resort his blank thinking and direct his attention on working in a supermarket as night shift. Soon, things get weirdly mysterious as his imagination manage to lure reality and froze time unexplainably. This, what makes the movie good; the style, substance, effects, phases, timing, editing, writing and plot make it worthwhile to watch. It isn't all about romance and retelling of experiences about break ups and tiring relationship ending into disasters, but an interesting abundance of fresh story.Everybody has their own interpretation on how Ben's activities are going on; he may be either just imagining things or trick time as he wishes. Everybody got involved with Ben's imagination but ironically inexplicable to begin with. It was the wit out of mystery that added the movie's brilliance; the comedy, romance, flashbacks, revelations and obscenity hauls the attention of viewers who dig deep on how a movie works. They may say the movie overflows with a lot of nudity as its main weapon to catch viewers' attention, but obviously there is more than to it than that. The crew was fitting as well, they didn't imply tediousness with their performances both inside and outside the film, and rather they implore simple interest as you lay in the couch following their story. All in all, this was indeed a rare decent film to find, and I don't bother screwing myself waiting for this to come out somewhere.Watching Cashback wasn't a waste of time and energy, I would really anticipate how Sean Biggerstaff manages to flounce his talent on screen and attract more future opportunities in his career.",Cashback

I especially loved the subtle transitions between scenes, that preserve the flow and the quietness of the story.Yet if only the director could pull that off! The fragile construct of the romantic relationship collapses at around the football game. The direction seems to loose interest, it meanders around the characters, gets lost in chaos and finds salvation in a rather bland and superficial cliché ending. Childish humor elements take over for what the story lacks and suffocates whatever is left of any subtlety.Especially the side characters don't help the story, but rather distract with their clownish acts. The goofy store manager overacts his part the most. And i have no clue what a stripper on a party is supposed to mean... If there is a latent message hidden somewhere, i can't see it.Shame!

Unlike pretty much every other romantic film, this film looks at love, sex and relationships from a male perspective rather than the usually corny and uninteresting (for males anyway) female perspective. As a heterosexual male, I must say I really enjoyed this film because it gives a very recognisable view of the male psyche and the different kind of feelings males experience in male-female relationships, varying from superficial attraction to deep passion and love.I'd recommend it to every heterosexual male, however I'm not so certain I'd watch it with my girlfriend :-)",Cashback

I wanted to enjoy this movie but I didn't as much as I wanted to, not really sure what happened but perhaps I had different expectations.I preferred the insomniac movie Fight Club.The end of this movie was also so cliched, boy's new girlfriend sees him kissing his exgirlfriend and that's the end of that relationship before it even began.

I haven't seen a movie that combined comedy, fantasy and drama with such elegance and perfection. Comedy is superb, the story was believable (in a ""fantasy"" sort of way) and I have to admit I didn't mind the nudity at all. Don't be taken in by the IMDb score as it is not a ""blockbuster"" type movie, its very simple. Anyone who has any feeling at all about making right and wrong choices with girlfriends/boyfriends will understand the main character very easily. Supporting cast is excellent as well, don't we all have at least one friend like Sean? Although there is a lot of nudity, it is done very classy. In no way do I think the main character is a pervert or just plain shallow. Artist of all kinds see beauty in different ways, this is how Ben sees it! This movie surprisingly reminds me of ""To kill a mockingbird"" in that the experiences the main character experience seem so simple and real that they probably are. If you are one that usually doesn't stray from the mainstream this one will make you a believer that there are more great movies out there than just the ones you see trailers for during the commercials. A must see. Warning, judging from reviews of those that ""hated"" the movie, if your a feminist you might want to pass on this one. Although as a man, I have to tell all the ladies out there, ALL men think like this from time to time (regardless of what they tell you) and I think the director is just telling it like it is.

I wouldn't call the movie profound or brilliant, as others have, but it certainly is thoughtful, creative and original. A common mistake in thoughtful movies is to be TOO serious but this movie has enough funny characters to avoid that mistake. Also, the title ""Cashback"" was such a mistake. A much better title might have been, ""Still life"" or something to do with time and art. If you like indie movies that try to go deep, rather than big, then you will probably like this film.",Cashback

Luckily, too, is that our artist guy only undresses the girls in the supermarket to ""sketch them"" (not unlike a completely still model). Sounds a bit creepy? Sure... or a dream come true in many male minds.I think the romantic development is nice, realistic... slowly unfolding and sweet. There is not much emotion from either one, and that theme of numbed emotions runs throughout the movie. You get a sense that movement towards ones dreams and away from the doldrums is essential to living a fulfilled life.The biggest challenge with a movie like this is that the intended audience is hard to pin down. It's not a traditional romance, not a science fiction movie per se, and the many nude scenes will attract some while chasing others away.

70,geoaar-1,Incredibly Immature,3,23 August 2015,"A vapid tale of a young man (teenager?) going through normal adolescent angst - about as deep as a puddle of crocodile tears.Here is a young man so tormented by his recent breakup with his girlfriend that he simply can't sleep - at all. So what to do with the extra hours? Why, get a night shift job at a grocery store. A store inhabited entirely by equally immature and one-dimensional jerks.But our hero finds that he has a secret ability. Where it came from nobody knows, but he can freeze time! So he's free to wander around the store, undressing the (all drop-dead gorgeous) women in the store. But this isn't for any prurient interests, No! He's an artist after all and he just wants to appreciate their natural beauty and draw a few sketches of them. And maybe fondle them a little too, but only in a very artistic manner.Add to this the most rudimentary of plots and a few more cartoon-like, one-dimensional characters and you have Cashback. A boy is heartbroken over a short relationship, he gets a job, and falls for the girl who works at the store. The end. This is philosophy and meaning of life as seen through the eyes of a lovesick thirteen-year-old boy. It's just pathetic.The troubling thing to me is that there are so many over-the-top reviews of this movie on IMDb singing it's praises as one of the great movies of all time. This says to me that there's either many more horny adolescent boys writing out reviews for such movies, OR there's a small army of paid reviewers cranking out laudatory comments on demand.

""Cashback"" is an example of how good a film can be without expensive special effects or out-of-the-ordinary story lines. Just fantastic writing and carefully-blocked cinematography. Having enjoyed the 2004 short it's based on I was afraid they'd muck it up, but the integration is seamless; the feature faithfully answers the questions we had about the sketch. The story itself is so mundane it's almost cliché; a hundred movies have already been made on the same fundamental premise. But that too is premeditated; as the main character says, true beauty is found in the ordinary. It's not a matter of finding it, it's a matter of seeing it.",Cashback

Some special shooting techniques which twist the concept of time and space by instantly relocating an object from one space to another really work, like the relocation of the queue of adolescent boys to watch Natalie showing off her fanny to another unrelated queue, and the relocation of Ben from the phone to his bed.One goof is that nude scenes tend to be on the excessive side of things, and sometimes probably too much than necessary to convey the message. The movie also tends to be slightly long-winded as some scenes can certainly be cut shorter, like the football game one. Despite these, it's a nice film to watch and to spend one and a half hour on.",Cashback
73,tombrookes2007,you would NOT ask for your cash back,7,6 September 2011,"This English low budget film tells the light hearted tale of Ben Willis, an Art College student who gets a job to deal with his newly acquired insomnia. He has just suffered a relationship break-up and sinks into a mini world of depression and dream like statuses. It does this with a pinch of silly humour and nudity. When in his supermarket night shift job he realises he can pause time and add dreamy scenarios to the mix. He also befriends a wacky mix of slacker friends.This is a surprisingly easy, charming Brit flick of cult worthy labelling. It is likable, different and subtle, being a piece of visual escapism for an average 20+ soul-searching male. Michelle Ryan (of EastEnders fame) is the ex, and the title cash-back refers to the phrase cashiers ask when customers pay by card. The supermarket job is with Sainsbury's. Emilia Fox also co-stars (Silent Witness).A modern Brit Clerks?During time pausing Ben can ogle and draw naked women.Nick Hancock, Keeley Hazell, also cameo.",Cashback

The type of which that are very common these days. But it really surprised me... This movie is something else... Something more that I could ever think of.This movie tells us about two beautiful ideas - If you don't stop for a minute, you might miss the beauty of life and remind us of the beauty of the female body.Ben likes and observes women/girls, not in a horny way, but in a way, of which he can always see beauty from them. When he pauses time in the supermarket, he undresses them, and see them, look at them, observe them. Then he draws. Hundreds and hundreds of sketches and drawings of these naked woman. He knows where exactly to find this beauty, then he draws the beauty that lies within the frozen second.This movie actually has a LOT of nude scenes (which I really like and that's what we dudes like to see).By the way, this isn't a filthy movie, if its what you're thinking of, but to understand beauty is to see beauty...

Can't believe anyone would decide to be in this movie if they hand even an once of self respect which in this case I guess most of the females didn't. Find it funny how Hollywood is saying we should respect and nit objectify females yet totally are okay with people making crap like this...Honestly it's embarrassing, creepy, and downright an assault to all females.

The movie ends wonderfully.Women may be a little put off by the nudity. My wife didn't complain, probably because the main character and the movie showed it in the context of art and appreciation of the beauty of the female form, something my wife has heard me admit a love for and didn't leave me!The rating is about right I think.

78,smccar77,A beautifully done existential romance,9,15 March 2011,"""Cashback,"" is an innovative take on the romantic comedy genre. The film more than fulfills all of the expected trappings. The characters are both quirky and realistic. The humor ranges from sexually explicit to subtly introspective. The story and conflict revolve around the tumults of romantic pursuit. While the above define ""Cashback,"" as part of the romantic comedy genre, the film is a great deal more. ""Cashback,"" distinguishes itself from other similar films by contextualizing the humor and romance within philosophical quandaries about time, love and beauty. Rather than immerse the audience within an easily identifiable framework, the film asks questions and then develops tentative answers. The process of mental exploration is brought to the forefront. The effect of exposing these musings is a wonderful film that encourages the audience to do some reflecting on their own.As is common in the genre, the film is composed of a variety of common and everyday situations. However, instead of assuming that meaning is clear through simple depiction, the film leads its viewers through an analysis of the various interpretations a situation is subject to. The majority of analysis comes from the art student Ben. An extended bout of insomnia has led to his day increasing by eight hours. To pass the time, Ben takes a job at an all night supermarket. Ben's thoughtful and artistic inclinations combined with dull labor are the inspiration for the philosophical musings. The combination of voice over narration, creative camera work, moody music, and smart dialogue act in synthesis to lead the viewer through the creation of several perspectives on life. The assumption of the filmmaker appears to be that the process of self-reflective discovery is as interesting as the implementation of behavior based on introspection. In all fairness, this assumption is not particularly new or unfamiliar. ""Cashback,"" is, however, very successful in making an internal and unseeable journey a very enjoyable and watchable film. The narration combined with quirky behavior provide a subtle and easily accepted commentary on both the situations and the situations interpretation. More importantly, the film is very purposely subjective, therefore allowing the audience to interact and critique the interpretations at will. In essence, the film accomplishes the ethereal task of implanting the audience within the perspective of another mind, while maintaining the audiences ability to comfortably maintain their own agency and analytic tools.On a personal note, I will be recommending this film to all who will listen. As the dull gray Chicago winter overstays its welcome, a thoughtful comedy gives just the right succor. ""Cashback,"" is a wonderful film for the casual movie night, romantic evening, or wine steeped philosophical meander. 9 of 10 stars.",Cashback

80,MashedA,Worth Seeing,7,22 August 2007,"Cashback suffers from an Identity crisis; it desperately wants to be arty, desperately wants to be funny but almost certainly wants to be taken seriously. Whilst it has varying levels of success with all of these areas it does leave you somewhat perplexed as to what genre it wants to be? Should it be comedy with subtle art (with screen transitions which felt oddly out of place), or should it be a quirky drama that reflects the angst of young love and its trials and tribulations? I'll be honest I really liked the film but feel it would have benefited from staying in its original format as a short.The whole film suffers from what feels like bolted on back story, when you make a short film you are entitled to go a bit mad, you can take liberties that somehow add to an eclectic montage. Whereas with the real deal you have to link each segment in a logical and consistent way otherwise it feels disjointed. There are periods in this film where it is achingly slow, the nudity scenes are done tastefully and with some humour, but I wasn't entirely sure that they were warranted although they were easy on the eye.The acting by all concerned was up to a very high level, Sean Biggerstaff will almost certainly move onto bigger and better things. The store manager was a modern day Reg Holdsworth (Coronation Street) and made me laugh with his megalomaniac and desperate ways and lastly the Kung Fu guy was hilarious.Overall I enjoyed the film although it was a little indulgent in places. 7/10",Cashback
81,cemk-2,May become my all-time favourite.,10,12 December 2008,"I had first seen Cashback as a short film (see Cashback (2004) on IMDb). It was excellent and I had just watched it in the first place for it had Sean Biggerstaff as the lead -he was excellent in ""The Winter Guest"" and I wanted to see his performance seven years later. That wee film blew my mind. When the long version of ""Cashback"" was out, I had doubts as I didn't know how they'd extend a very-well made short film to a 102-minute job. The answer, as I found out, was ""excellently."" This film is so different and yet so much the same at times (I mean, one-on-one, shot-by-shot same) as the short version, however you believe you watch a completely different story and yes, it is. So, enough with the shorter version and let's talk about this as a separate film.It is excellently made. The budget isn't exactly great obviously and yet you don't need any big spending for this. The script, with its characters and its fiction is matchless, perfect. The secondary cast is also excellent, they support the main story with lots of laughter and beauty. Emilia Fox is great as the beautiful Sharon because she's not only beautiful but also can act her socks off. As for Sean Biggerstaff, he never stops to amaze me with his performances. I could write a lot about him, but let me just say he is one son of Glasgow who should make the city proud as hell, just like James McAvoy. These two Glaswegians, Biggertaff and McAvoy, are truly tremendous Scots actors and I wish there were true equivalents of theirs in the States...To sum up, it's a fantastic film, fantastically made, and surely as it's a feel-good film you wouldn't expect philosophical solutions to change your life, but if the industry's name is entertainment, then it's what it does perfectly: It keeps you entertained and makes you feel great at the end, and makes you leave the cinema or the couch by the telly feeling very positive about good scriptwriting, great directing, and very good, very impressive acting. What else can you ask off of a film, really? As I said at the heading, this superb British independent film may become my all-time favourite film and that says a lot, does it not?",Cashback
82,aequanimis,"A film with lots of potential, but ultimately falls flat",5,5 April 2019,"I remember watching this movie a couple years ago and really liking it, but now that I watch it again, I find it hard to stay captivated and to not think about how truly creepy our protagonist's actions are.The film continuously prods me to ask ""what now?"", and the feeling that it was a bit too long stuck with me long after. There's a fairly long scene in the middle of the movie that felt unnecessary and out-of-place, and it was hard to be drawn back into the movie afterwards. This may be a result of the film originally being a short-film and not having enough substance to be a feature-length movie, or just a shoddily put-together movie.Additionally, I found it hard to take our protagonist's rants about beauty and women seriously when I really thought about how creepy it was the he felt no hesitation to undress women in the supermarket when he froze time. I love discussions of beauty, and I think that there is something beautiful and wonderful about nude bodies, but ultimately, undressing unsuspecting women strikes me as predatory. I think that if the movie had followed him as he drew women with their clothes on when he froze time, it would've been a different story and I would've felt more comfortable accepting this movie's analysis of beauty. However, that didn't happen, and it was a major part of the movie that kept it from being a great movie.All in all, there were scenes that were really well-done and that I really enjoyed. This movie can be fun to watch at a surface-level, and the soundtrack was pretty great. However, the depth of its ""analysis of beauty"" really is only surface-level, and doesn't really provide much if you try to look deeper into it.",Cashback

The other thing about this movie people don't seem to like the amount of Sex and Nudity in it. I didn't really care for that part--if you just avoid it, its a masterpiece. They use sex due to the fact a lot of artists use the human body as a piece of art, and Ben is a male using a female as an example; opposed to a female, who'd use a males body.

It screams of a young art student's desperate attempt to say something meaningful but actually has only the dumbest, most base things to say.The film's hilariously pretentious and meaningless tagline is ""Sometimes love is hiding between the seconds of your life"". Make no sense to you on a first read? Good, because it makes no sense after you have seen the film either.The protagonist in this piece of drivel is an aspiring artist (of course he is) who works in a menial job stacking shelves at a supermarket (ah, the under-appreciation budding artists out there - breaks your heart, doesn't it?) To relieve the tedium of his job, he pretends he can ""freeze time"" and appreciate the beauty all around him. This is where the film really starts to bite. How does this insightful young man appreciate beauty? What wondrous things can he see that we ordinary folk fail to? Titties!!! Basically, he walks around mentally stripping women in the supermarket and contemplating their bodies. Hilarious. What a GENIUS!!! This wouldn't even be so bad if he was discovering some kind of ""hidden beauty"" or something all human beings share but is easily overlooked. But no! The only inhabitants of this Sainsbury are Page 3 bikini models! That's right - all perfectly formed, 19-24 year old stunners; waxed, toned and in perfect condition. One of the customers is even KEELEY - the famous Sun topless model. I mean you are JOKING, aren't you? This is a 13 year old boy's idea of ""hidden beauty""!!! I won't bother discussing the rest of the woeful storyline that serves as a plot, suffice to say that when our young boy genius walks into a professional art gallery, the owner is immediately dazzled by his mediocre sketches and indicates that he has a big future. Yup, that's just how it happens in real life! If you find this movie interesting or profound, you truly are as ignorant and facile as the director.Disgracefully bad.",Cashback

92,Haynerator,A Picture Says 908 Words,6,23 February 2009,"Developed from a 2004 short film of the same name, 'Cashback' is the story of 'Ben Willis' (Sean Biggerstaff), who has just broken up with his girlfriend, 'Suzy' (Michelle Ryan). As a result of the following grief, he develops insomnia and takes up a night-shift job at a local supermarket. It is here where 'Ben's artistic imagination blossoms, giving us a creative view-point of 'Ben's world.First impressions are quite possibly what make this film so surprising. I knew nothing of this film other than a brief synopsis and seeing the DVD cover before watching it. On first thought, due to the poster and the DVD cover, one would assume that this is going to be something along the lines of 'American Pie', filled with crude jokes and gratuitous nudity making it an entertaining comedy to watch every once in a while. Though in the case of 'Cashback', the impressions are thwarted and this becomes a fairly mould bending take on the 'Romantic-Comedy' genre.The romance aspect to this is fairly subtle; it is more of a consistent underlying theme than something in the foreground. Though relationships play a fairly large part in 'Ben's psyche, it cunningly avoids being cheesy or stomach churning by building humour or art on top of it. For example; 'Ben's development into his current mental state is chronicled by a series of cleverly intertwined flashback sequences, which were brilliantly transitioned between past and present. During these sequences we have a nicely incorporated aspect of early exposure to certain life experiences, which are shown to influence the path of fate. Despite the content of the sequences feeling somewhat anachronistic, it painted a great portrait as to the reasoning behind 'Ben's persona, as well as his best friend 'Sean' who happens to be the complete opposite.Surrounding 'Ben' are a series of misogynistic characters, and this makes the use of nudity come across as a much more clever aspect than it would do if misogyny wasn't surrounding the protagonist. Being that 'Ben' is an artist; we see through his eyes how he perceives the female form. Full nudity is shown in various parts of the film, but is never displayed in a sexually stimulating manner; it is only ever shown as an art form and becomes a very justified and important section of the film.Cinematographically this film is directly reflective of 'Ben's personality, aiding in developing a connection between the audience and the character. Whilst some of the imagery felt a little cliché, it fits in well being that it is proved artistic formulae. However, some of the few clichéd moments are adapted in experimental ways. The use of time manipulation for example; in 'Ben's imagination he can stop time, displaying a visual metaphor for the appreciation of every moment of life. During these moments, 'Ben' engages his creative mindset to draw some of these frozen moments. This is a nice insight into bridging the gap between reality and imagination.'Ben' is somewhat disconnected from reality, fairly placid, and doesn't seem to physically display much emotion. It is apparent that he is a believer of fate and is thus accepting of the erroneous factors that come his way. This helps to identify with his character, as well feel for him in realising that it probably isn't the healthiest course of action. Though, this is overcome with assorted humorous goings on around the night-shift. This is a very funny film, filled with immensely colourful main characters. While the humour can often be crude or perhaps simple, it works well in keeping with the theme of the film, and due to the personalities of the characters executing such humour it becomes very enjoyable. However, a lot of the comedy is performed in a way specifically designed to be funny, carried out by characters designed to be crazy. These characters felt more like plot devices than people to care about regarding the progression of the protagonist. I feel the comedy would have had much more of an effect had these characters been a bit more natural. Despite this, the cast were well picked; each performing greatly in their roles. The most natural of the cast being Biggerstaff and Fox, the only actors whose roles were written to be taken with seriousness. Overall, the acting is one of the best elements of the film, and if nothing else across the film is personally admired by the viewer, the acting and cinematography should hopefully be enough to captivate the audience throughout.This is probably one of those films in which you will find new things each time. With many underlying themes and messages, it can be watched with various perspectives, and different aspects can be taken from it dependent on the individual. This is art, poetry, comedy, romance and drama all combined together into one subtle masterpiece.However, undeterred by its visually captivating style and overall experimentation, the film is actually none too memorable. In the end it is still only a tentative form of a 'Romantic-Comedy'. This isn't really anything more than an enjoyable piece of artistic entertainment with lots of laughs and thoughtful aspects, but is easily forgotten. Though, director Sean Ellis is to be commended here for 'Cashback' is visually impressive with an interesting story, and anyone can see he has a potentially substantial career ahead of him.

Since ""Playing by Heart"" thought us that ""Talking about love is like dancing about architecture."" this movie tries to add an extensive visual layer to the story and it does it rather successfully. Some might find this movie to be pretentious and full of ""shallow philosophizing"" and ""excessive nudity"", but these are absurd statements. The thing that comes across is that this movie never takes itself too seriously and this is it's strong point. You are there to watch and enjoy and if you pick up something ""meaningful"" out of the entire babbling of the main character, good for you.

I think almost anyone could relate to this film, because we've all been through a break up that destroyed our lives. Time is always moving too fast and too slow, and its the moments between where life is lived or missed. This film does a remarkable job of showcasing that. I've recently been through a divorce after 20 years of marriage, and I've been suffering severe insomnia for a year and a half. I stumbled across this movie by chance, and truly loved it. Some might say that it was obscene in ways because of the mental undressing or nudity (though tasteful, not counting the smut magazines), but I think both men and women have had a moment where they mentally undress someone for or because of their beauty. There is inherent beauty in anything (like spilled frozen peas), and we seldom take the time to see it. Which of us has not wished that we could stop time and walk through the world around us? If the film had a flaw, it was that at times it moved a little slowly. This was intentional, and did not detract from the movie at all. The characters were all wonderful, and the acting superb. This movie has caused me to look up everything else by the director in the hopes that this wasn't a one trick pony. Given a chance, I think most anyone can relate to this film.

Surrounded by spectacularly braindead co-workers and a narrow-visioned best friend, Ben tries to relieve his suffering with his uniquely artistic imagination, and the help of the only co-worker capable of putting him back to sleep.The film started out as a short, whose Oscar nomination gave author Sean Ellis a template to expand - the short is incorporated ""as is"" inside the feature. Ellis displays every bit of passion from a burgeoning filmmaker who can finally unleash every concept and idea stored in his mind for years. The result is somewhat flawed and clearly uneven, but injected with an absolutely breathtaking innocence and an unmistakable talent. Young Sean Biggerstaff, known to most as Harry Potter's Oliver Wood, displays a very refreshing yet contained charisma that signals the coming of a future star. The rest of the cast, mostly (and to great effect) unknowns never seem to feel out of place, each chewing their every scene with great fun and gusto. And the lovely Emilia Fox continues to make me wonder why she isn't a much better known actress.I know Ellis has barely touched the tip of his talent and can bring us much greater pieces of film making with a little kick in the arse.

He soon begins to look for ways to pass the time in his mundane existence without sleep, and discovers that imagining he can stop time helps pass the time faster. With time stopped, he begins imagining that he can undress his customers and paint them in varying degrees of nudity. When his obsession turns to a fellow checkout girl, the reasoning behind his obsession with the female form, and his real dreams in life are revealed through a series of haunting and beautiful flashbacks, alongside a growing drama among his colleagues.Cashback is one of a minority of great, contemplative movies. I think the best comparison would be something between American Beauty and The Rules of Attraction.If you want a movie that will make you think, make you question and make you feel in ways you may never have before, this is it. The only criticism I have is that it wasn't up for BAFTA's or Oscars, and that's a criticism of the judges, not the movie. My vote was only reduced to a nine since a few scenes tried to move too far in a comedic direction which I felt didn't fit well, but I'm willing to look past that since the movie as a whole was so well structured.If you are a fan of art in movies, or movies which will make you think and feel, Cashback is for you.9 out of 10",Cashback
100,jedp2,Sometimes the loveliest gems go undiscovered . . .,9,23 March 2008,"Stumbling across gems is my favorite form of movie-watching. Sure, we can watch the box office receipts rise and fall but every now and then when you don't follow the trends and venture into non-box office hits, you stumble across well-intentioned films like Cash Back. It's a fine balance of the ""American Pie"" league of films--without the excessive guffaw material--and a lyrical fantasy of a talented artist making his way through twentydom after losing his first love. The fine texture of this film in between the respectable ""juvenile humor"" drawing it all together into a quite entertaining film is a welcomed experience in this climate of ""anything that titillates makes money"" film-making. The ""American Pie"" Franchise is very entertaining on a different level. But ""Cash Back"" is a symphony of humor intertwined with a better degree of redemption.I avoided wasting my time watching this film because of the trailer which portrayed a teen comedy aura which I have to be in the mood for. But I was pleasantly surprised by the poetic license applied to this tale (I will not reveal the repeated mechanism used throughout the film) but it adequately gave dignity and a lyrical examination of one man's struggle with the most elusive emotion known to Mankind.If you're into fast-paced drama or ""a joke a minute"" belly laughs, this film is not for you. It has a distinct heart, just enough ""belly laughs,"" and a pathos that will draw you in. It's not so much a ""teen film"" as it is a fine character study well done and meaningful that affords a few moments of tension-relieving humor to take the edge off.",Cashback
101,tsangaridesi,"Very creative regarding some aspects, which made it interesting",7,6 September 2014,"Being a comedy, the movie did get points knocked off for not being very funny, but, seeing as it's a drama/romance, it had a chance to redeem itself. Putting the seldom appearing silly jokes shown in the movie aside, the movie had a very original story, using a cliché plot, which sounds confusing, but it works. The drama was heartfelt, and the romance was shown in a different and unique way, having similar scenarios to other movies, to a portrayal one would see in other movies. The story itself was pretty impressive, referring to the backstory of the protagonist mostly. I liked how it all tied up well, and the message was one that doesn't appear in a lot of movies, which was also something nice to see. One big thing that I really didn't like about it was that it got very dull at certain points, and those points were not rare. The movie became less enjoyable because of that factor, but, nonetheless, it's a piece of art (if you've watched the movie you'll get my reference).",Cashback

103,tonysx,A surprisingly elegant teen comedy,8,16 December 2008,"Sean Ellis's feature ""Cashback"" is a unique film. It blends teenage breakup drama and bits of humor without most of the usual genre dribble. I was thrown off guard and pleasantly surprised although there are a few off place scenes and cliché moments. This is perhaps since the film was directly adapted from Ellis's previous Oscar nominated short of the same name. In fact the feature includes the entire 19 minute short and added scenes were shot with the same actors to build a normal length movie.Ben is a college art student who just suffered a painful breakup from his long time girlfriend. The film opens with the breakup shot entirely in slow motion POV shots with a voice over by Ben. The whole film is seen very much from the point of view of Ben. He is so sickened by his breakup that he cannot sleep and uses a late shift job at a grocery store as a way to pass the extra hours. He envisions freezing time so he can take off women's cloths to sketch them. There is full frontal nudity in these scenes but it never seemed obscene to me. It was viewed, like the rest of the film, through the eyes of Ben and to him these women were pieces of art themselves and he respected them. Ben then gains interest in a clerk at the store named Sharron. She is a normal looking girl who for some reason as we learn more about her and see her through Ben's perspective becomes more attractive. Guy Hudson's photography of the film is beautiful. Artistic special effects and camera movements are not something I would expect in a teen comedy. But this is no ordinary teen comedy in most ways. It deals respectively with the heartache of breakups rather than glossing over it to get to the sex crazed road trip or whatever other plot elements are overused in most films of this type. The acting is great all around especially the two leads. Sean Biggerstaff plays Ben with the sharpness and observation of an artist and the humor and sensitivity of a heartbroken teenager. ""Cashback"" does have its faults however. There are several scenes that are filler to the real emotion of the story including a long scene of the main characters getting ready for a party and an out of place soccer match. There is the cliché group of friends at the store a party with a striper and the typical romantic plot twist. All things considered ""Cashback"" is a surprisingly good movie and I look forward to seeing what Sean Ellis brings to the screen next.",Cashback

Plot line: Without giving it away, the story revolves around a character with a special ability that's been done before, many many times. That said, they did a fantastic job with it. Characters: Sweet, very likable. Nice job of character building and you feel for them.

106,m143386,Derivative but still a lovely film...,8,25 March 2011,"I started to watch this and kind of missed the point and found myself being quite angry that this was derivative of a book i read in the 1990's called the Fermata. I seemed to have many of the same elements. I stopped the film and checked back to see if it was based on that book, and it wasn't. I then found out that the idea for the Fermata was hardly an original concept anyway as there was a 1960's Twilight Zone and a 1980's Outer Limits episode which uses the same device. I then got over myself and watched the film from the beginning. Having done some research about the film i found out that this was originally made as a short and then expanded. Usually for me, this doesn't work but here i believe that the director used the original short and shot and Act 1 and Act 3 to bracket the original and this really does work adding depth to the characters and more time for character development.This is a wonderfully observed, gentle and charming romantic comedy, done in the best British tradition where story and character are more important than style and having a big name attached. That's why i didn't call it a Rom Com because that has negative connotations because of the endless conveyor belt of crap shovelled out by Hollywood. I haven't scored it higher because it is very derivative of the book i mentioned but i had enough fun with this to score it higher than even the best that the US puts out in this genre.",Cashback

After a break-up from his girlfriend (the equally overrated bionic woman herself Michelle Ryan) Ben's (Biggerstaff) insomnia forces him to fill his time in a night-shift at Sainsbury's (did Sainsbury's really give their consent to this film because it hardly portrays them favorably!). There he meets Emilia Fox, is instantly smitten, but being the shy-English-Hugh-Grant type, cannot make a move. In between this he discovers how to freeze time and indulge in some life-drawing by undressing the female shoppers of the store. But his main artistic gaze is for Fox. It's all very sweet, but painfully slow, with probably the worst sound-design in cinema history as basically there is no sound but for the actors voices, which isn't helped by Ben's bland put- you-to-sleep voice-over.

117,lillambie,Do not watch.,1,8 May 2011,"I watched this movie with my boyfriend, and I can honestly say this was one of the worst - if not THE worst movie I have ever had the misfortune to watch! You start off hearing Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff) drone on and on about his break up with Suzy (Michelle Ryan). The droning in itself is enough to send one to sleep - yet for him, it drives him to insomnia.With 'eight hours to spare' where he is not getting any sleep, Ben decides to get a job and ends up working in Sainsburys. There he comes into contact with Sharon Pintey (Emilia Fox).Now, this is one of the things that really angered me: Ben goes on to state how certain members of staff pass the time, such as Sharon's avoidance of anything that tells the time, i.e. her watch, which she keeps covered up with white tape. Then Ben moves on to state that he 'pretends' that time has stopped. Yet later on he goes on to have the ability to actually stop time? Someone in scripting made an error which somewhat ruined the movie! Whilst I tried my best to see this in a philosophical kind of light, of a man coming to terms with that which was obviously a traumatic break up for him, I couldn't help but see this as a lame director's excuse to go and get as many women as naked as possible for the duration of the movie.I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It was poorly scripted, made in poor taste and the 'funniest' bit was when Ben seemingly froze time and moved his boss into the way of an opened carton of sour milk before unfreezing time again.I'm a huge fan of Emilia Fox, but I can not believe she allowed herself to be put as a member of cast for this movie... if you can even call it that!",Cashback

The sequences of the time stops are really brilliant. It really takes you by how the film works and the way effects and movements of the camera take your breath away. the whole look of the main character is like so well developed that you just don't think of it as a movie but like it is playing there for real. It is a really well made movie, and means a lot to art also. Nudity plays a very major role in the film, but as used, it is a very strong force for the development of the film. The calmness of the whole film, really took me by. As it should be stated, it created a whole new world for me, and I could actually imagine, what would be going on at the back of Ben's mind. The small transitions(flashbacks) in the movie, really tried to underline a lot about the character.

I guess I was initially interested by the promise of the much-vaunted female nudity, but found that there was a lot more to admire in the film.It was oddly labeled ""drama"" in my local Blockbuster, but in fact it's a romantic comedy. I won't go over the plot, as it's been well covered by other users. I watched it a second time with my girlfriend, who was not at all perturbed by the nudity (probably because it's not gratuitous). She enjoyed it and I think I could safely recommend it as a ""date movie"".It's not perfect. While the director has done a great job of (seamlessly) expanding the original short film into a feature there are a couple of scenes that feel like ""filler"" especially the second time around.The performances are generally very good, especially Emilia Fox.One thing that hasn't been mentioned much is that the music is particularly good.",Cashback
124,spyglassnayak,Mediocre Erotica,5,8 March 2017,"At first I had expected to a greater extent a roar with laughter comic drama from this motion picture, yet got myself not chuckling once all through the whole film. Presently, that doesn't imply that the motion picture was terrible or crappy, a long way from it. ""Cashback"" was really a somewhat pleasant film and a crisp thought on the lighthearted comedy class. The story in ""Cashback"" is about Ben Willis (played via Sean Biggerstaff) who gets dumped by Suzy (played by Michelle Ryan) and for reasons unknown he can't rest after that occurrence. So he have 8 additional hours consistently. He takes up working at a store amid the night move to take a break, and discovers he can solidify time. Ben is a craftsman and begins painting the ladies in the grocery store, taking off their garments while time is solidified. Likewise working at the store is Sharon Pintey (played by Emilia Fox). Ben becomes hopelessly enamored with her and a relationship begins to blossom. ""Cashback"" is driven by a decent story, despite the fact that it is not a storyline that pushes forward at a high pace. The story, be that as it may, is all around complimented by great acting exhibitions. Also, the score that is utilized as a part of the film truly works so well with the story. The music was flawlessly utilized and very much chose. The movie is not at all like other lighthearted comedies I have seen, on the grounds that ""Cashback"" is not by any stretch of the imagination an upbeat story, it is increasingly the account of a broken heart, the way to patching it and figuring out how to discover love again when everything appear to be dim and sad. On the off chance that you are expecting an average lighthearted comedy that is straight off the author's work area in Hollywood, then you may be in an ideal situation with another movie, in light of the fact that ""Cashback"" is not one of those standard movies. ""Cashback"" is an excellent movie, both story-wise and cinematography-wise, however by and by I found the film to take fairly long to get no place, and it delayed for a really long time. I could have utilized something more perky to speed the movie along, and thus I give it just a 5/10 rating.",Cashback

What I don't understand is when this movie set, i.e. which decade? Why, because there are NO mobile phones anywhere. The lead character is shown to be using a public phone. Now who doesn't own a mobile phone these days? But I suppose that is one of idiosyncrasy of the movie.

129,greenknight-2,Thoroughly entertaining,10,24 September 2008,"The basic storyline: an art college student ineptly (as do we all) loses his girlfriend and suffers acute insomnia as a result. In order to make use of the endless hours, he takes a night job at a supermarket and discovers that he can stop time whilst trying to deal with the interminable boredom, the distractions of his fascination with art and the female form, the juvenile antics of his workmates and just the perception-altering effects of lack of sleep.What results is a highly entertaining movie. The nearest similarity I can describe is The Full Monty, or The Commitments. It's very engaging, GENUINELY funny in parts (I actually laughed, which I rarely do to full-on, so-called comedies), thought-provoking (or at least, day-dream-provoking) and very true to life (despite...or maybe because of...the time-stopping events).I can't fault this film except for one very minor flaw - the nudity. Now I'm not against nudity in any way, shape or form, but I would be remiss to ignore it. There is a fair wedge of it in this film, and it is all young, attractive women (except brief shots of a male life-study model's bum). That's my only (very minor, as I've said) gripe.The justification for the nudity in the film rests on the main character's artistic fascination with the female form and his ability to ""see beauty in every crease and fold"", but it seems he can only see the beauty in young, slim, attractive women. Odd, that. Maybe I'm an artist and don't realise it. Or not. Give me a cuddly, older woman any day.Despite that minor criticism, this is a film you won't be disappointed in watching, and I would further say that the nudity in the film is tastefully (if graphically) portrayed enough for a 15+ audience in my opinion (that's for boys, obviously - probably 12+ for girls who won't get excited by the sight of what's natural).Thoroughly entertaining, possibly even a good DVD to rent for a first date (if you're too stingy to spring for a meal and flowers) 8)",Cashback

Now if you do and you are writing a review about how this movie is degrading, why don't you look in the mirror.

Every little detail down to the freezing of time are all things that while not real, can happen in your imagination, especially during stressful moments. He even captured such things as that first true kiss being able to break the spell. Very well done and captivating. At first I was very judgmental at the plot and idea of the movie.

I wont explain how the story goes as there are many other comments that have already explained.There is plenty of comedy moments and is a smooth ride from beginning to end. This film is a gem,just simple lines like ""The clock is the enemy,the more times you look at the clock the slower time will go"" will ring true to many people who know what its like working in a boring job constantly trying not to clock watch.Also i can sympathize with the daydreaming part,insomnia,breaking up etc and i'm sure other people will too.Go out and see this masterpiece,its one of those films that you will watch more than once and share with your friends who probably have never heard of this film.I give this a 10/10.",Cashback

It's about large breasted bimbos as seen through the eyes of pretentious idiot who thinks he's an artist. It's basically a titty-flick masquerading as art-house. It objectifies women in the usual way, presents male characters who are uninteresting, puerile morons, and even resorts to poorly scripted fart jokes. I only sat through the whole thing to see if the piece of classical music they used was Mozart. Avoid it at all costs.",Cashback
136,candypants42,"I want my cash back.. Unfunny, unoriginal and just plain bad.",1,17 July 2011,"I'm sorry to say that this movie sucked. The characters motivations are either shallow or unconvincing and the unfunny jokes are made worse by horrible timing. The acting isn't great, and the dialouge is often just weird, but the worst thing about Cashback is the lack of originality. The whole movie relies far too heavily on alternating slow-motion sequences with fast-forwarding to illustrate the main characters insomnia, which, by the way, is thoroughly unconvincing. While that could've been OK if they at least were the first to do it, it sadly seems that all of the potentially interesting aspects of the plot and aesthetics of this movie are copied. If someone made a movie with footage from Go!, Fight Club and Art School Confidential, and edited it into a love-story completely devoid of chemistry, with no redeeming features, this would be it.And don't buy into the crap about ""breathtaking beauty"" either; some of the scenes look OK, but nothing spectacular.

To be frozen if you will in time unable to move forward or let go. The numbness of a broken heart.Most if not all of us have been here. The story and characters are fairly simple and they don't need to really be complex in order to tell the story. The setting is a personal favorite of mine a grocery store. There is a fair bit of nudity in this movie but it isn't sexualized and that's the point. It's also a bit ambiguous on certain aspects to the point that we begin to question what is real and what isn't.It's a semi-poignant look at the heights and the doldrums that come with being in your twenties, or just getting through a boring shift at work.I won't spoil the ending but I adored it.

138,adnatan,The current rating of the film (7.4) made me stop trusting IMDb,1,20 January 2012,"The film is an utter waste of time, shallower than graphene. One of the many problems of this film is the gap between what it pretends to be, and what you actually get. There's an inconsistency in the flow, sometimes the film tries to be poetic (and fails), and a minute later it'll be a crude sex comedy similar to American pie. As a result, the two styles destructively interfere and you can't help but feel cheated. The script is just horrific. Uninteresting scenes get a lot of screen time, the level of depth is as mentioned before: shallower than the thinnest material known to mankind. If you are a teenager, you may not mind because of the multitude of silent beautiful nudes that appear there (with questionable justification). It made me feel that a random guy with a camera shot some nude models just because he could, and then he called it ""art"" to get away with it. I'd expect a rating below 6 for this one. The current rating of the film (7.4) made me stop trusting IMDb ratings...",Cashback

If you don't stop for a minute, you might miss it""",10,28 May 2007,"You find the most beautiful films when you least expect it. Yesterday I went to the Sneak Preview in the local cinema and I came out happier then I've been in weeks. Cashback is an odd combination of teen comedy and romance and the best thing is that it works! The story involves around Ben, an art student. He just had a rough (literally and figurative) break-up with Suzy. Ben has problems to forget Suzy. He can't sleep anymore and is emotionally broken. To speed up the eight hours he used to sleep, he starts working night shifts at Sainsbury's. The film follows Ben's process of dealing with his broken heart, while he is working with his silly colleagues.Effectively the film also tells the story about Ben's past which shows how his fascination with the female body began and how those things formed the way he thinks about things now. While working in the supermarket he likes to freeze time, to capture the beauty of little things, and to draw pictures of the (naked) female customers.This film is not about sex and teen jokes as some people probably will say. It is about having a broken heart, finding new love, finding someone that is the perfect other half of you. It is about beauty. The scenes where everything but Ben is frozen and he walks around the store drawing the portraits of the women just strike the right chord. Sean Ellis did a great job to make those scenes look that perfect. It's his ode to the female body.All I can say is that everybody should go and see this film.

Why, when he undresses them, is it only the chest and vagina he reveals? Why, in his fantasy, does every woman have the same perky boobs and cleanly shaved body? Even in the scene with the exchange student who was his ""trigger"" we're given shot upon shot of only her boobs and genitals. The rest of the body, even her face, is cut out. And even then, all the women are conventionally attractive, ripped straight from a bikini model mag. This man doesn't ""love the female form,"" he's a fake deep horny art student who, despite all his talk, has never had a single original thought in his life; much less one that wasn't just ""haha boobies."" He 'loves the female form' at the most base level possible, there's nothing new, these are the same women you see on billboards and in razor ads where they shave over their already hairless legs.

143,MilikM,A disappointing debut feature,1,4 November 2006,"Sean Ellis's work as a highly successful fashion photographer is stunning and unique; famous for his flair and talent for creating arresting images that are crafted, achingly beautiful, iconic, disquieting, slick and memorable. Unfortunately none of Ellis's image making ability is displayed in his directorial debut. Originally a successful short film 'Cashback' has now been extended into a feature length version. The idea of developing characters and back stories elaborating around an original premise which was originally conceived as a short is a tricky and perhaps ill advised choice; as the result seems to be a slow paced, immature, nonsensical and soulless two hour version of the eponymous original.The film's thematic and visual effect relies heavily on the time slice effect made so popular in music videos and commercials of the mid/late nineties. An over reliance on the 'magic effect' of freezing live action motion - which may be arrestingly powerful in a 30 second ad or three minute promo - makes for dull viewing when employed repeatedly over the course of a feature film.It would not matter that cinematography was incredibly underwhelming if the characters displayed any charm or interest. The actors appear to have their work cut out struggling to make any of the scenes ring true. The dialogue is trite and obvious. The male characters  mostly furnished with wise-crack one liners and bad boy banter - have no depth. The female characters too lack any substance - objectified and seen as clichés and/or male fantasies for the most part. In what appears to be an effort to make this film feel cinematic an epic classical score is employed at pivotal moments and sequences, however, this only serves to draw further attention to the shallow emotion of unfolding events. What really makes this film so terrible is that you simply do not care about any of the characters or what is going to happen next, making 'Cashback' a depressingly disappointing watch on so many levels.",Cashback

When a relationship doesn't work, get on with life. The movie moved along at a painfully slow pace, the plot wasn't that great and nothing held my interest. If there was something redeeming in this movie I never saw it. I have a hard time figuring what genre this movie belongs in. I'd sure like to hear that someone feels the same as I do about this movie. What might have made it better is if the main character had committed suicide after 20 minutes and the movie ended.",Cashback

This is so different from most of the garbage you see these days, all these ""american pie"" wannabees and same collage formulas again and again. The only comment I might have on this film is that for me it had a slow beginning. The short movie which came out two years before was nominated for an Oscar as ""best short film"", that should say a lot about how good this movie really is. Go and rent this movie, you wont regret it! Unless you saw ""The Weekend"" and thought that was an awesome movie, then you should look else were and get help.I'm looking forward to see more movies after Sean Ellis.

149,jamie_windsor,Pseudo-academic misogyny,1,14 July 2009,"When I first saw the short, I wondered if it was a subtle political statement about dominant/passive relationship of post-modern patriarchal culture in pseudo-academic circles. My optimism soon dispersed. Some argue that the protagonist is flawed as most people are, but he is presented as the hero and not as a flawed character. I would guess he is a projection of the filmmaker's own view of women. He fixates on a shallow view of ""beauty"" represented in what appears to be fashion-model happy hour at the local supermarket — classic lad's mag fodder. As if this wasn't enough, we are taken into his fantasy world where he undresses (I say ""undresses"" — what actually happens is he pulls up their tops and down their underwear to reveal breasts and genitals) these women in secret and without consent. He furthers this by becoming obsessed with the checkout girl whom he then proceed to secretly draw in various states of undress and then exhibits the picture (again, without her consent) in a public exhibition. In any normal scenario, we would label this character a sex-offender but apparently this is all hopelessly deep and romantic. We have a short section with a nude man in a life class, but this is ridiculed as the man keeps passing wind (yes — this is the level of sophistication this film offers). Our protagonist instead draws the stereotypically ""lad's-mag"" attractive girl across the room. Beyond all the sexism, the film is badly made. The characters are one- dimensional and the script is disjointed. There's some nice cinematography but that's about all I can say in its favour. This film is an appalling piece of cinema that reinforces the outdated and sexist notion that women are primarily about body and that beauty is defined by nubile, young women in states of undress.",Cashback
150,poundpig,Very well done with an interesting concept,9,21 May 2015,"At first glance, Cashback would appear to be a shameless excuse to show skin. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there was a reason for the nudity - for the most part. This is not the case for most films.The story was well thought-out, it seems, and I was thoroughly engaged. I was also pleasantly surprised with the acting and the cast. I did not expect much so Cashback far exceeded my expectations. There was good character development and I was intrigued by the main character's ability to pause time in his head and appreciate the beauty around him.One of my favorite scenes was the main character staring at spilled peas on the floor and describing its beauty.I usually release an exasperated sigh when I see a live story in a film because it always seems take on. ""Every film needs a love story."" I hate film formulae. In Cashback, however, the love story did not seem take on, which was another pleasant surprise.I did not like that some of the nudity was presented in a sexual manner, nor did I like the sexual references because I thought it spoiled the artistic value of the rest of the movie. However, it went with the story. Where other characters found it sexual, the main character found beauty in it so there was a stark contrast.I definitely recommend this film. It was a pure delight.",Cashback
151,jtomczak-88866,"Decent idea, great cinematography, truly horrific execution",1,26 January 2017,"Cashback takes a very enjoyable if somewhat unoriginal idea, dresses it up with a ton of skilled cinematography, and turns it into an hour-and-a-half long misogynistic piece that feels like it came out of a pretentious 18-year-old film student's notebook from a Themes in Cinema 101 class. That this movie has a decent score is beyond me.The film stars an obvious self-insert college student and focuses around his ability to stop time, which he uses to pass his time at his awful job at Sainsbury's by stripping the female customers and painting their nude forms. Not only is this vile act depicted as sympathetic, the film seems to argue that it's making some sort of deep and meaningful statement on the beauty of the female body. The main character is treated as a deep and misunderstood man who truly ""gets it,"" like he understands that undressing women and appreciating their beauty is better than the middle school antics of his coworkers and best friend. Much of the film is, as the premise would indicate, devoted to describing the passage of time. The best moments come early on, when we find our main character contemplating the slowness of retail hell while still finding beauty in still images, even as simple as frozen peas spilled on the floor. But it also veers into the pretentious, with the monologues describing how ""time just keeps passing, man"" becoming increasingly unbearable. And, of course, when time does actually stop, it very often goes right back into treating non-consensual female nudity as the highest form of art.If there is one thing to praise Cashback for, it's the cinematography. Most of the scenes are framed and shot well, showing that a considerable amount of skill went into this. The best part comes during many of the flashbacks, as the transitions between them are carefully constructed into the present, done so in a way that is not only creative but is a lot of fun to watch. The film's message might be terrible, but hey at least it's shot well.If I were to pin down the principle problem of Cashback, it's that it reeks of self-importance. The film boldly declares that it's saying something deep and giving something to the medium when it's saying little more than ""female nudity is deep and artsy, maaaan."" I can respect enjoying this film for the cinematography, but honestly, it made me feel too disgusted to enjoy almost anything about it.",Cashback
152,zerosnake,Beautifully done film.,8,25 July 2009,"This is going in my ""top favorites"" list. I loved this movie throughout. The beauty of a woman comes in many forms, and this is what this movie is about. Things started off very slow, but started to pick up pace at the end. It started to give slightly a ""rushed"" feeling. Then again, by that point, the film has almost reached its plot climax, so that's understandable. The main ""downside"" is that it has lots of nudity. Sometimes nudity causes things to be less approachable to some, so that is the only ""fault"" I can see with the movie. I honestly have few words to say about this film other than ""watch it."" If it happens to offend you during the movie, give it a chance, and hold off opinion until the end.

I remember constantly walking through the video store and always seeing a single copy of the movie in the new release section. The cover intrigued me for obvious reasons, but when I finally read that it was based on the Academy Award short of the same name, I grabbed it. The story has been reviewed on here over and over. I was a film graduate but still loved a good popcorn movie,meaning I'm not a snob. This film perfectly straddled the line of indecent film, straight forward comedy, and a surprisingly touching love story. This film will amuse any indie lover yet satisfy the film nerds as well, especially when you watch the short before or after (won't affect your viewing of the feature length). It's a great study on how to turn a great, 20-minute short into a 90 minute feature film without losing the spirit and humor of the original, especially by not recasting, retouching, but rather expanding on a universe that for once needed expanding upon. And for any insomniac like myself, this film may help you sleep a little bit better, seriously. I didn't feel so bad being up at all hours, especially in college! A great, quick watch.

Ben has been pursuing his dream by doing what he wants to do everyday and its a great remind to all the people with great thoughts in their minds but not executing it. It's such a great movie with plain and easy going presentation while showing important messages. It's a must-watch movie. Enjoy! The movie was presented with a lot of nude scenes and to certain extent i think it was over emphasized but please the viewers focus on the message!,Cashback
169,scottyjmp3,Cash Back,9,25 May 2008,"I am a huge fan of deep meaningful films. The main theme of this film is about an experience that is generally ordinary for us males. Sean Ellis, through story telling and incredible cinematography turns it into a work of art. The observations that are broken down about relationships between men and women and the beauty of the male perception here is as close to the truth as it comes. Ellis did an excellent job of describing what is hard to say using words through film. This film is not only deep but it is extremely funny as well. The transitions between the moods of comic and philosophical are flawless. I love this film!",Cashback
170,guytribo,"A completely unexpected, pleasant surprise",10,27 May 2010,"If you told me before I saw this movie that it was about an insomniac art student who goes to work on the night shift at a grocery store, I would have thought it impossible to achieve an excellent rating from me.I watch a lot of movies, and am always looking for that diamond in the rough. Anyone who has ever taken a job like this will find it easy to identify with the characters. The music, anything from opera to modern-day rock, always compliments the scene appropriately. And the concept of the passage of time, and how it relates to our daily lives works well in conjunction with Ben's fantasy world. No heavy mind games, just good fun and a charming presentation...one of my all-time favorites.",Cashback
171,don-261,In defense of this film,8,9 September 2008,"I've been an IMDb member for some time, and I've never commented on a film before. I'm a movie snob, for the most part. I own (and actually read) books about Tarkovsky and Fellini (two filmmakers cited during someones critique of this film) because I want to know how their minds work.That said...It isn't fair to compare this movie to a Tarkovsky film or a Fellini film or one by the Coen Brothers or PT Anderson or whoever else you want to throw out there. Look at it by itself... you may see a brilliant and beautiful story that is shot and edited wonderfully and manipulates emotions quite effectively. Everything from coloring to soundtrack is done brilliantly.If anything here is a little thin, perhaps it's story, and perhaps this should have been left a short film. But then, of you're looking at it as a film about a guy who can stop time, you're hopelessly missing the point anyway. (Yes, I know the point that Sean Ellis was trying to make, so there!) Stop. Watch. Let the movie come to life in your mind and don't look for reasons to dislike it. If you want to watch Tarkovsky, go watch Tarkovsky. You won't find him anywhere else, least of all here. But if you pay attention, you may just fall in love with this movie.",Cashback
172,mikegasson,With out a doubt the worst film ever made,1,6 August 2009,"Hahahahahahaaaa... Reading other peoples comments and seeing a score of 7.5 out of almost 20'000 votes for this film, almost makes me want to vomit/cry/cry with laughter/go out and kill!!! This film is so bad, so predictable, so ""up it's own ass"" it's ridiculous. The one saving grace, that enabled us to stay awake for the 2nd half of this movie was switching on the English subtitles - Sharon apparently translates to ""a kind of insect lun""!? Which naturally is a billion times funnier than every one of the strained attempts at humour by the worlds most wooden actors. The true irony lies in the fact a film about insomnia makes you want to fall asleep.",Cashback
173,thefreestove,"Clever, rich and refreshing - loved it!",10,17 April 2010,"Brilliant cinematography, wonderful use of imagery with music being a key accent to convey emotions and ambiance.There are clever scenes of moments frozen in time - visually articulating what Ben, the central character, felt.Ben is a an artist, recently separated from his girlfriend. We learn how he was introduced to girls, and the female form, love and beauty from his childhood. There is a simplicity and tenderness they way he recounts his tales. A lovesick Ben fights weeks of sleeplessness, yet continues to see beauty in the female form. His work colleague Sharon seems almost plain in contrast to the staggering number of beautiful women we see in Ben's frozen moments. Yet there is something about her that reveals true beauty, which is just waiting to be captured and depicted by an artist.I found this film beautiful and completely refreshing, almost magical. Loved it.",Cashback
174,valedavila,Totally recommendable,7,25 July 2016,"It has that kind of magic that not every movie seem to achieve.I loved the appreciating beauty aspect. I think Cashback is beautiful, at least aesthetically, the film's photography, the scenery are beautiful, kid of magical sometimes. I loved the ending scene, it was so lovely. Another great thing is that this movie always keeps you in touch with the characters and their thoughts. And yes, it has lots of nudity, but it was always in context, sometimes non-sexual & cleverly done, so beautifully done, it has class. This movie is even fun sometimes but it even moved me a few times, I would totally recommend it. The story is simple but in a good way, the writing is also very good. It also has a great soundtrack. The sequences of the time stops are really brilliant. I wouldn't say it's one of the greatest movies I've ever watched, but it sure is one of the most artsy movies I have ever watched.",Cashback
175,vision2030,a very different poetic expression of Love,6,1 May 2012,A must watch for movie lovers if you can handle the nudity and some cheap comedy in between. The narrative sometime attains highest level of poetic expression especially when Ben talks about beauty of the female body (e.g the girl walking on the staircase while little Ben watching her) never ever gets even erotic the scene seems highly poetic. All the time freeze scene worth a repeat watch. I would have rate this movie 8 if the comic scene like the football match were controlled on. In the middle the movie drag toward a teen comedy but excellently takes a lift after that. with a excellent ending. A must watch for art lovers.,Cashback
176,venilandia,The director's ambition of depth is just insulting to the viewer,1,14 January 2012,"I really liked the first minute, the movie had a good start and I was expecting a good time. Honestly. But the melodramatic repetition of sadness, abusive voice over, unlikely characters, forced plot twists (the girl coincidentally at the party? that nice curator at the gallery? MY GOD!!) offended me. Every reaction seemed so unrealistic, nothing was coherent or felt believable. And I am not talking about the Let's-stop-the-time thing!I liked the soundtrack though, it boosted up the film. But still, the movie was not a unit, there was no tempo or rhythm control and the characters were so badly constructed. What a mess. The director's ambition of depth is just insulting to the viewer.",Cashback
177,ryanlassler,Of the most exquisite aroma; purely beautiful,10,15 January 2012,"Never before have I seen the pure essence of love painted in such a beautiful way through a camera lens. It was a pure stoke of brilliance for the director and actors. This is Truly something every single person on the Planet should see above all movies.I have a daughter and i felt a profound love for her and all people when it was over. It was an excellent reminder of the littlest of things that bear the most definition and beauty to mankind.I am a Buddhist and now have a new understanding to add onto the everlasting compassion that can be found in everyone, everywhere no matter; and my life will be more fulfilling, loving and wholesome than before..Namaste~",Cashback
178,def92,Amazing and charming movie,8,12 July 2013,"I can really say: 'I don't think there is a person out there who wouldn't enjoy watching this great piece. It's a formula that works beautifully. It is cool - without being pretentious. It is beautiful and sexy - without being cheesy. Very few films touch a chord in you. This film certainly does that. I think, those individuals who express a lot of negativity towards the film - have issues. Deal with them first - then watch the film. Being a regular cinema visitor and very familiar with the standard of films we get fed, I can happily and confidently confirm that this film is a gem that really shines! The film has only two faults as far as I can see it: its wildly unfocused story and its slightly cheesy ending. The former did not prove a problem or a distraction, but rather made it feel like 'Cashback' attempted a lot of different story lines and detours and diversions. That said, I can see how it could be considered a problem. The ending discards some of the unpredictable magic by tipping into saccharine but it is nothing fatal. The fact is that Cashback is a remarkable film in both comedy and drama aspects and I urge you to watch it if you are even a slight fan of Biggerstaff.",Cashback
179,lakritscaten,Crap,1,8 October 2014,"Horrible movie. It's not poetic, it's cheesy. Like so, so cheesy. I can't even describe. Also, what the is the deal with giving me complexes about my body and my face! I hate movies that gives me complexes. ""Look at meee, i'm an artist who can draw boobs really well, with the shaaades and the nipples. By the way, i love nipples, they're soooo pretty, i could just look at them all dayyyyy. "" We get it, shut up and go to sleep. i don't have anything more to complain about, but it's fun to complain. seriously though, this movie just made me angry. mainly because the plot sucked, the characters overacted and the girls were objectified.",Cashback
180,louperez,I never saw the short...,10,28 March 2015,"and I'm glad I didn't. This film is too deep to take away any true meaning from it in a short.At first glance of the Cover Art, I almost turned away because gratuitous nudity was not what I was seeking. I'm just happy that I did not judge the film itself solely on the Cover.Even though I am a Man... I am a Romantic and have always been. I appreciate films that explore the intricacies of the relationships between Men and Women, especially those which delve into the emotions, pain, sorry and happiness experienced by each.While I was initially put off by his undressing the women in the store unknowingly, I had to remind myself that this was merely a fantasy and had more to do with his boredom and Artistic side.The Childish antics of his fellow employees weren't amusing to me however, they also had their purpose in the story and did not take away from it for me.His love for Sharon and how he expressed it through his art was quite touching and a fitting direction for the film to it's conclusion, which was quite touching.Yes, I enjoyed the film... so much so, that I watched it two evenings in a row.",Cashback
181,steve_saviola,Brilliant and beautifully produced,9,13 January 2008,"I loved every minute of this film. Its incredibly artistic and very well acted, particularly Emilia Fox.I loved the scene with the snowflakes frozen in time. I particularly liked the heart wrenching story line of young angst; that first kiss; The idea of the Natalie's; and i wonder if some or all of the ideas came from the director's own upbringing? Perhaps some of the nudity was a little over the top, but it was always in context.The film has a lovely quirky feel that only English films seem to achieve. I am already looking forward to Sean Ellis' next film The Broken.",Cashback

183,freestylercat,Really nice movie but disappointing ending,7,7 November 2008,"I really liked the idea of the artist ""travelling"" in the frozen seconds and capturing its beauty. Also the way time and its passing was described in the supermarket scenes was unique. I really took it as a metaphor for what artists actually feel when they create and paint, capturing a moment in time, being able to freeze time and see the beauty in it.All was well and the story was coming together to a nice finish, when... surprise! The beautiful metaphor of being able to freeze time was suddenly transformed into reality, with a bit of not-so-good acting, like the actors knew they were doing something bad to the movie and they didn't really want to do it. That scene in the end spoiled that feeling that it was a metaphor, it all went down to concrete and that ruined the effect of the entire movie... Did the producers really think we cannot understand an abstract concept? Was it so hard to leave it in the state of an idea, to leave us imagine things, just like in a good book? This is the most unfortunate compromise this film could have made.",Cashback
