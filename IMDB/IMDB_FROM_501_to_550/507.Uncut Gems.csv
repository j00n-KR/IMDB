0,MartinHafer,You'll probably either love it or hate it...I hated it.,3,31 March 2021,"When ""Uncut Gems"" debuted on Netflix, the film caused a lot of buzz...particularly about Adam Sandler's performance in the lead. And, some were apparently upset that he did not receive an Oscar nomination for this. As for me, I think I can understand why he didn't. While it was a nice departure for Sandler, the film was so thoroughly unpleasant and awful experience I had a hard time even finishing the movie. It's simply hard to enjoy a film about folks as awful and despicable as the ones you see in the movie.Howard is the owner of a jewelry store in New York and in many ways he's a stereotype of a Jewish jewelry guru. However, he's also a very flawed one...a man who is deeply in debt and possibly about to be killed because he owes bookies a fortune despite selling millions in jewelry. He hopes that a smuggled opal will somehow help him out of his predicament but he ends up losing it...and the men he owes are NOT happy!Howard is a thoroughly despicable person who cheats on his wife, treats folks like garbage and he's a real sociopath. Because of this, I just wanted the bookies to shoot him and end the film....after about 15 minutes! Sure, the portrayal by Sandler is vivid...but the man and folks around him are so despicable that I really saw the film as more of an endurance contest than anything else. A thoroughly unpleasant film about thoroughly unpleasant people. If that's your thing, by all means watch it....but my time is too valuable to consider ever seeing it again.",Uncut Gems
1,SnoopyStyle,horrible character,6,7 February 2020,"It's 2012 New York City. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a greedy jeweler and a degenerate gambler. He is hounded by creditors especially those sent by his brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian). He is married to Dinah (Idina Menzel) with kids. He also has his employee girlfriend set up in a love nest. Hustler Demany (Lakeith Stanfield) brings over NBA star Kevin Garnett to his store. Garnett is playing in the finals and is taken with Ratner's uncut stone. Events spiral out of control as Ratner's greed and gambling takes over.Ratner is a really annoying character. There is simply no rooting interest. Without that, I don't care about what happens to him. It still could be great if he goes on an interesting adventure. That's the case for the most part in this movie. Sadly, it is entirely self-inflicted and that is also frustrating. Adam Sandler delivers a quality performance and he has one terrific monologue with Kevin Garnett. When the story is first laid out, I hoped for a series of hurdles to retrieve the stone. It would have been a fun scavenger hunt where hopefully he finds some redemption. That's not this movie. There is no redemption for this character. He is unrepentant and unable to grow. I also don't like this ending which is often a cheat in this type of movie. The darker way to end the movie would be to have him live with the consequences of his action. As a final note, the non-stop yelling cross-talk gets very annoying and tiresome. It's not surprising that I love his monologue more than anything.",Uncut Gems
2,boblipton,An Insider's Perspective,4,19 January 2020,"Adam Sandler plays a 47th Street jeweler whose life is out of control. He's shacked up with his girlfriend, Julia Fox. His wife, naturally, wants a divorce. He owes huge sums of money to his bookie, Eric Bogosian, who sends his legbreakers around to encourage him to a more prudent program of debt repayments. He thinks things are turning around when a rock arrives. It contains hundreds of carats of 'black opals', valued at up to $3000 a carat at auction.Having spent the first half century of my life in the Diamond District - and twenty years before then - I was impressed by the setting; clearly, the ground floor of 35 West 47th Street has not been cleaned since they took out the diner in the late 1980s. Sandler's character is a schnorer and a momzer, and I am uncertain as to his viability in the everyone-knows-everyone society of the jewelry industry; it was changing to something far less collegial by the late 1990s. Even before then, we had problem children. One tenant was a particular problem, but we didn't throw him out because he was the best gold smith on the street.Even so, it's not a story of much interest to me. Sandler's character is marked for destruction from the start. Once his current lease was up, he would have been gone. The only question is whether this core of opals can delay his end, and by how long. Nor did I really care.There's been talk about how brilliant Sandler is in a serious role. Every time a comic actor gives a performance that is serious, people are astonished. I am not. An actor is an actor, and a good comic actor needs to be a good actor with something extra. Sandler has shown himself more than competent in serious roles, like in ANGER MANAGEMENT. It's his charms as a comic actor that have eluded me.",Uncut Gems
3,nogodnomasters,Where's my opal?,4,31 December 2019,"Howard (Adam Sandler) operates an NYC jewelry store from an office building. He has guys in the street bring in customers. He loves basketball and players who buy his no paperwork items. He bets on the games and owes money. He is dishonest and unlikable. He is not a character I would display in an era of renewed antisemitism. During the whole film, I cheered when he got punched and groaned when they didn't drop him on his head out of a window. The title of the film comes from an uncut gem he acquired that he expected to make a killing on.I either love or hate Sandler films. Put this in the hate column. This feature has a confusing beginning and is too hectic to try to keep up with the plot.Guide: F-word. No sex. Near nudity.",Uncut Gems
4,kosmasp,You think I'm funny?,9,23 March 2020,"It took a couple of minutes to take the schtick Adam Sandler was doing here for real. I've seen him in serious movies before, but he is almost playing any of his comedic characters here. At least it seems like that in the beginning. He is all fired up, talking fast, looking funny and all that.But once you get that out of the way - the movie takes off. Adam Sandler is still all over the place, but I get that some would have liked to see him getting more recognition for his role. Or the movie itself get more recognition. Even Kevin Garnett, who's also essentially ""only"" playing himself (no pun intended): Awesome! Everyone involved is really good and the story is quite amazing ... rollercoaster and all that. Drama/Thriller edge of your seat style ...",Uncut Gems
5,classicsoncall,"""I just hit big, very big!""",7,20 June 2020,"I'm sure this film had a script and a screenplay, but it plays out more like the stream of consciousness ravings of an inveterate and compulsive gambler in the guise of jewel merchant Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler). I mean really, you have to ratchet up your concentration to a whole new level to follow the musings of Howard as he traverses the city streets of New York to ply his trade and make the one big score that will get him out of hock with an array of dangerous debt holders. Add to the mix the presence of NBA star Kevin Garnett, whose obsession with a hunk of unrefined black opal leads the principals on a frantic chase across the Big Apple. It almost sounds like a comedy, though it's anything but, as Howard and his cohorts play for high stakes in a game in which the highest one might be a matter of life and death. This is an uncharacteristic role for Sandler, allowing for a range of acting ability not in evidence in the types of lightweight comedies he generally appears in. Here he's living on the edge every minute of the day, in a high stakes world that threatens to blow up any minute. Eventually it does, but probably in a way you won't expect. Contrast this film with 2014's ""The Gambler"" with Mark Wahlberg, and they'll both convince you that there's no such thing as a safe bet.",Uncut Gems
6,Quinoa1984,"""You're the most annoying person I've ever known""",8,28 December 2019,"They should hand out high-grade blood pressure meds to people going to see this after it ends. The major strength and in a way the slight weakness of Uncut Gems is how laser-focused the Safdies are in conveying total anxiety, stress and mania through this extreme act of full cinema SOUND (levels of acting and over-lapping dialog, that Vangelis-Blade-Runner-on-Steroids/Crystal Meth score, some of the cinematography and the tracking of the camera).I do wish there was a little more than just flourishes of relief, though I'd be lying if I said Sandler was anything but exceptional and riveting playing degenerate crumbling right before our eyes. While Eric Bogosian, Lakeith Stanfield and Kevin Garnett and many others here are natural solid, it's Sandler's show, and it's soulful and tense and harrowing and ultimately (as terrible as Howard can be) tragic. The filmmakers's greatest achievement from the looks of this and Good Time is finding star-actors who aren't known for their wide range and getting career-triumph work from them. If the movie isn't all that complex, I do think Howard is and that helps make this pretty special as a depiction of addiction, more than anything else. It's got grit and style to burn, which is mostly fine by me.",Uncut Gems
7,searchanddestroy-1,Adam Sandler looks like a kind of Jewish Al Pacino,8,22 March 2020,"Some folks wrote that this movie was a mix-up of Marty Scorcese and Abel Ferrarra style and I think that's right. And Adam Sandler speaks, looks like, borrows every expression on the face from Al Pacino. I Don't know if the audiences have also noticed this but that's so obvious. Anyway, that's the kind of role, character that would have perfectly fit to Robert De Niro's co star in HEAT and the IRISHMAN. I like this uncut gem very much.",Uncut Gems

9,CinemaSerf,Fast and frenetic but lacks any finesse...,6,10 January 2020,"I'm not sure which bit of the manual I've missed that says it is ok to just substitute a whole load of effing and blinding for any meaningful script! That really did spoil this a bit for me - it's just a relentless tirade of swearing that really does detract from a pretty good performance from a charismatic but completely unsubtle Adam Sandler as the jeweller on the brink of the deal of his life. On occasion it is laugh out loud and it doesn't hang about, it certainly isn't dull. Luckily for us, Idina Menzel doesn't break into song playing his much cheated-upon wife; the rest of the supporting cast contribute well but don't really stand out.",Uncut Gems
10,Calicodreamin,What?,2,1 June 2020,"Good luck trying to figure out what's going on. Between the f bombs and constant talking over people, I think there is a thin thread of a plot. There's too much going on, there's no purpose, and the ending is unfinished. Skip this unless you like profanity laced garbage.",Uncut Gems

12,evanston_dad,One of 2019's Best,10,10 January 2020,"If you've ever wondered what might happen to you if you keep a hitman locked in a jewelry store vestibule while you wait out the result of a basketball game on which you've bet big money.....""Uncut Gems"" will give you one possible outcome.Let me be clear that I have never liked Adam Sandler. Not in one single thing. In fact, I've quite reviled him for most of his career. He's easily one of the top five actors who I would like to see punched in the face. But I'd like to think I can approach movies and performances with an open mind and give credit where credit is due. And holy moly, please nominate Sandler for an Oscar!He plays Howard, proprietor of a jewelry store in the Diamond District of New York City, who has a problem. Or rather, several problems. Namely that he makes terrible decisions and gets himself in way over his head with loan sharks, women, auction houses, and just about every conceivable person or thing you can get in over your head with. He's the kind of guy who owes money to criminals, finds a way to actually make the money he needs to pay them off, but then instead of paying them off decides to bet that money on a ""sure thing"" in order to make even more money, thinking this will somehow make the criminals happy, when really all they wanted was the money they were owed in the first place, but who then end up getting nothing because Howard finds some way to mess up his ""sure thing."" The movie is one sweaty clenched muscle of suspense, moving at a breathtaking pace. If you've seen a Safdie Brothers movie in the past you know what you're in for, but if you haven't, think of a scene from a Robert Altman movie -- the frame stuffed with tons of people all doing something separate from each other and all talking at the same time -- and then stab it with the adrenaline shot John Travolta sticks into Uma Thurman's heart in ""Pulp Fiction."" That will give you some idea what to expect.In addition to Sandler, Idina Menzel and Julia Fox deliver terrific work as Howard's wife and mistress, respectively, and can I just give a shout out to Lakeith Stanfield, who, like Robert Pattinson, seems contractually obligated to appear in literally every movie released in 2019 and is really good in all of them.""Uncut Gems"" is actually a total downer of a movie, but then why did I leave the theater on such a high? As the lady behind me said, ""It was gnarly good."" I'm with you, sister.Grade: A+",Uncut Gems
13,ferguson-6,faster faster,8,24 December 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's debatable whether this movie should be labeled an indie crime thriller or a 'Scared Straight' session for gambling addicts. Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie are filmmaking brothers who seem to specialize in adding a frenetic pace to the lives of characters who consistently make bad decisions. Their excellent 2017 film GOOD TIME (starring Robert Pattinson) set the tone for their latest, featuring an Adam Sandler performance unlike anything we've previously seen from him.After a brief prologue at an Ethiopian mine, we are dropped right into Howard's world. Well, more specifically, we find ourselves on the camera end of Howard Ratner's colonoscopy, while also seeing the vibrant glow of the rare opal extracted from that opening mine. Remarkably, the colonoscopy may be Howard's (and our) most relaxing moment of the movie. The character of Howard is based on a guy the Safdie brothers' dad worked for in the Diamond District when they were growing up. He's played here by Mr. Sandler, who delivers a performance so memorable that we now can't imagine anyone else in the role.Here is what we learn about Howard: he's arrogant and foolish and energetic and hopeful. He lives life on the edge ... or perhaps he's already tipped. He's a Jewish jeweler based in inner-city Manhattan, and as the film begins, he owes a lot of money to someone who has hired goons to collect. Howard has an irascible wife Dinah (Idina Menzell, Elsa's voice in FROZEN) who is fed up with his antics ... one of which is his employee/mistress Julia (newcomer Julia Fox). Howard has an insatiable gambling addiction and he's always on the brink of a life-changing big score or a colossal failure that could cost him everything. He's a hustler who has to move faster each day to prevent the collapse of his house of cards: sports bets, pawns, loans, lies, and empty promises.So if you think you now have a feel for this, I can assure you that you are mistaken. The frenetic pace is relentless to watch. We kind of like Howard, but yet, we want nothing to do with him. His latest scheme involves the expectation that the rare opal will solve his many financial woes. In the meantime, his business associate Demany (LaKeith Stanfield) brings him a high profile client ... NBA player Kevin Garnett. The film looks and feels like a gritty 1970's flick, but it's based during the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals, and Garnett plays himself (and quite well). Garnett borrows the opal for good luck and that's when all 'heck' breaks loose. Also in play here is Howard's rotten brother-in-law (Eric Begosian), to whom he also owes money. Adding even more NYC flavor are Judd Hirsch, John Amos, and sports radio host Mike Francesca, as Howard's bookie.Daniel Lopatin (aka Oneohtrix Point Never) provides an electronic score that helps ensure we are never comfortable watching what is unfolding, and cinematographer Darius Khondji (EVITA) keeps his camera in constant motion - just like the characters. Production Designer Sam Lisenco creates Howard's world through the jewelry shop, the house, the apartment, and especially that back office. Set Decorator Kendall Anderson wins a place in my heart for the Pete Maravich poster.The Safdie brothers co-wrote the script with their editor Ronald Bronstein (who also worked on GOOD TIME), and afterwards you'll find yourself going back through all the poor choices made by most every character. The brilliantly sustained level of uneasiness includes a segment featuring The Weeknd, and one revolving around a school play for Howard's daughter. The Safdie style is present throughout, and most conversations are loud and heated and threatening. If you are the type that needs at least one likable character, or a serene environment, or respectful adult conversation, you are out of luck here. Howard is an exhausting character in an exhausting story within an exhausting movie ... just as it was intended.",Uncut Gems
14,bombersflyup,"Sandler cashes in ""The Big Ticket.""",7,1 January 2020,"Uncut Gems is loud chaotic hysteria, matching the New Years Eve party hostility that was breaking out into my street.However, it comes home strong providing joy in the madness.

15,deloudelouvain,"This genre is better for Adam Sandler, he should just abandon comedies.",8,17 March 2020,"First of all let me say this, I've never been a big fan of Adam Sandler at all, at the point of avoiding any movie where he's in. Those movies, mostly comedies, just bugged me as I find him annoying to watch. Maybe it's his nasal voice or his dumb look, I don't know, he just bugs me. But this story looked entertaining and it's not a comedy so I gave it a shot, and to be honest I did enjoy it. For once Adam Sandler delivered, he did a good job playing his character. The story is fast paced, with a lot of things going on, mostly yelling and being nervous, but it fits the character. It's a long movie but it doesn't seem long when you watch it, and that's always positive. I have to admit it was much better than I expected, maybe I'll watch other Adam Sandler movies from now on, at least if they're not comedies.",Uncut Gems
16,blanbrn,Not typical Adam a dark twisted turn from Sandler who shines in an intense down the drain picture.,6,28 December 2019,"Most all of us know Adam Sandler for his romantic comedy and very funny movies, however he steps outside his comfort zone with this work in the very dark drama ""Uncut Gems"". It's the story of Howard Ratner a New York City jeweler who lives life on the edge walking on the very cracked side of society. His passion in life is making money anyway he can, no matter if it's legal or not as long as the cash flows his way.However many of his sports bets and deals with shady characters have him drowning in a pool of debt and in the red as he lives for the next score to payoff the big boys of the shady slick underworld. On the side he enjoys sex and pleasure from his sexy mistress as his home life with his kids and wife Dinah(Idina Menzel) are on rocky grounds and about to be buried under. Overall very dark intense film showing that when living in discomfort and doubt one will go to desperate measures and means to survive. Still pretty good direct anti hero performance from Adam Sandler.",Uncut Gems
17,lasttimeisaw,Film Review - Uncut Gem (2019) 6.1/10,6,16 November 2020,"""The obvious difference between the Safdies and the Coens is that while both tend to champion cynical, unsympathetic characters in their films, the former is critically short of the latter's black humor, and UNCUT GEMS, is a case in point. Even Safdie's chromatic flair is muted here (it is remarkably shot in film though, boasting a rich texture), and the whole enchilada is too exhausting to invest one's uninterrupted attention, nothing is remotely lapidary in this brazen, humility-wanting cautionary tale.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Uncut Gems
18,thesar-2,Uncut Sandler,8,15 September 2020,"Probably one of the toughest movies I've seen in a decade, maybe longer and this time, it's not JUST because Adam Sandler was in it.Yes, usually his movies are ENORMOUSLY tough to get through since they're painfully and outrageously unfunny and embarrassing. But, in this case, while I knew it was about a degenerate gambler, he not only made you feel every bit of his addiction, he made you cringe and sometimes turn away from the screen with how loud and unsettling he acted.Being a gambling addict myself, it's always hard watching other ill people suffer on screen because you know...this can hardly ever end well. For the most part, it doesn't. I can think of one gambler movie (no spoiler) that it worked out (hint: best poker movie ever!) But, for the majority, movies just show the slow-at-first, progressively-faster-downfall of the gambler.Sandler plays a jeweler but there's little time to show that. Let's follow him around like a human chihuahua for two plus hours from one bet to one bookie looking for him and their money to another scam, and back. It almost seems never-ending and each time you see what's he's doing to feed his gambling addiction as the stakes keep skyrocketing.Probably Sandler's best work ever, but that's just because he finally showed himself as human and not the same louse on holiday in disguise as a movie. But, boy, he doesn't play a good person and since we're seeing him in his many ""normal"" habitats, friends, lovers, family, employees, for 98% of the film (if not the whole deal) you want to like him, but he is, in fact, a monster.Not the first time the main character was the antagonist, but this one was especially hard to like, and sympathy can only go so far. That said, this a well-shot, face paced, heart-pounding thriller, albeit a sad tale of an ill man. Highly recommended.***Final thoughts: Never thought I'd say that about a Sandler film. I have hated a good 90% of his IMDb listings, but he has, admittedly, a few other gems: The Wedding Singer, Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish. Those were the only ones I really liked before this one, but they really don't make up for the incredibly poor choices he's made with picking films and acting in them. Again, 90% painful to all of my senses, but mercifully, he takes some time to make real movies. Probably just once a decade, but still.",Uncut Gems

20,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Will either be to your taste, or two and a quarter hours of torture",4,6 February 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningHoward Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a small time New York hustler, caught up in a whirlwind of small time hoodlums, wannabe gangstas and a mountain of debt. Some glimmer of hope appears to surface in the shape of some diamonds from Ethiopia he has got his hands on, which he appears to have a buyer for. While he navigates his personal life, including his volatile wife, slightly more understanding mistress, and his teenage son, when his deal with the diamonds appears to go sideways, he finds himself plunged headlong into an escalating crisis that won't end well.Adam Sandler is something of a Marmite comedic actor, who has a pretty love or hate effect with audiences. Personally, he's always gone over my head, and I can't even recall seeing one of his films (even arguably his most popular and well known, The Wedding Singer) with him in the lead. Indeed, the only one that springs to mind is Anger Management, where he co starred opposite the legendary Jack Nicholson (on whose part much more of the laughs were generated than Sandler!) But here he is, cast against type and reinvented, in this unconventional crime drama from the Safdie Brothers.In one long, continuous take, we are thrust into the world of Howard Ratner, with the Safdies aiming to create the impression of being in his skin as he navigates this world of outwardly friendly people, who constantly turn hostile at the merest perceived provocation, trapping us in a vortex of relentless aggressiveness and excessive bad language, that becomes a bit overwhelming. Sandler has to convey this persona, because his character either himself naturally has this temperament or has to adopt it to survive, but there's a goofiness about him that really makes it hard to take him seriously, however hard he tries. Add to this a thin, sketchy plot that doesn't have enough about it to sustain a two hour fifteen minute running time, and the result is quite a heavy misfire.The Safdie Brothers have attempted an early Tarantino style unique approach to the crime genre, albeit with a much bigger budget and a bigger name star. Maybe it went over my head, maybe I need to see it again, but for me, it just didn't really work. Although, unlike with other mediocre efforts, I can see why others might disagree with me. **",Uncut Gems
21,MOscarbradley,An uncut gem of a movie and the best film of the year.,10,19 December 2019,"The Safdie Brothers have made the best film of the year though you probably won't feel comfortable watching it. Not since the heyday of Robert Altman have so many characters moved so swiftly across the screen, not just talking, but shouting over each other. ""Uncut Gems"" is an uncut gem of a movie about one of life, and cinema's, greatest losers and it gives Adam Sandler the role of a lifetime. Of course, his performance in ""Punch Drunk Love"" hinted at just how good Sandler could be but I don't think anyone was quite prepared for this. This is his De Niro/Pacino/Brando moment, you might say all rolled into one and in a year of great performances by male actors, (Driver, Phoenix, Banderas), surely makes him the front runner in the Oscar race.In this movie Sandler is Howard Ratner, a scummy New York gems dealer with a gambling addiction, a mistress and up to his oxters in debt to some very unsavoury and violent characters but who still believes his fortune is to be made from a rare, African opal that comes his way and which he hopes to sell to the NBA player Kevin Garnett, playing himself. Of course, he may as well believe in fairies for Howard is the kind of man whose days never go right and whose very existence seems as precarious as walking down the middle of a freeway in heavy traffic.With this film the Safdie Brothers don't deviate too much from the smaller, independent films they've been making up to now. The milieu is the same and so are the characters but this feels more fully formed. This is the mother-lode; this time they've hit paydirt. With a pulsating Daniel Lopatin score that propels the film along you sweat and squirm with Howard through every terrible, beautiful moment. As well as the agony of watching a man implode before your eyes there's the pleasure of seeing an actor at the very top of his game. The last twenty minutes or so of the film are almost unbearable as Howard puts everything on hold for the gamble of a lifetime. I came away from this movie totally shattered. The Safdies and Sandler have finally arrived.",Uncut Gems
22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Diamonds are forever.,8,12 January 2020,"'Uncut Gems (2019)' is stressful. Not only does it achieve a kind of unrelenting, anxiety-inducing realism, but it's also incredibly chaotic. Its default state involves people shouting over one another, scrambling to be heard in a world impartial to their struggles. It's never heightened but it's always dramatic, making the mundane cinematic at every turn. Often, it's unbearably tense. An auction and a basketball game stand out as the movie's most suspenseful sequences, which is a feat to say the least. I mean, it makes you care more about its climactic sports match than most sports movies do. It's full-on, for sure; sometimes nail-bitingly edge-of-your-seat. It's also amazingly compelling. Seriously, it's downright riveting. Sandler is brilliant in the lead role, somehow making his very flawed character quite likeable. He makes some more-than-questionable decisions, usually provoking his own downfall. Yet, you're with him every step of the way. You want everything to be okay, even though you know deep down that it won't be. The affair is engaging, entertaining, gripping, affecting and shocking in equal measure. It leaves you with an elevated heart rate and a lump in your throat. It's genuinely fantastic. 8/10",Uncut Gems

And while I don't believe I've ever experienced something close that in real life, that description feels very accurate. Consistently riveting, stylish, violent, and most of all unique, Uncut Gems is a very good film that feels like it wants to be great. However, all the credit goes to Sandler and the Safdie Brothers who are notably trying something different with this film and all 3 of them kill it here. It's not for everyone, but it's worth seeing.7.8/10",Uncut Gems
24,Edvis-1997,8,8,26 May 2020,"LOL. Adam Sandler did amazing job, maybe the best job he've done in whole his career. Movie was very interesting,plot wasn't too difficult to fallow. Not a fan of ending but still film amazed me. One of the good gem of 2020.",Uncut Gems
25,Cineanalyst,Momentum,8,18 March 2020,"The opening title sequence, complemented by ""The Ballad of Howie Bling"" from Daniel Lopatin's electronic musical score, that begins as peering into the uncut gems in question, with its cosmic particles, and that turns into a colonoscopy video is an apt summation of the picture's proceeding, relentless momentum as filled with a-holes amid shiny objects. ""Uncut Gems"" is a visceral experience of frantic tension, and I appreciate that it was filmed on actual film, for which I wish I would've seen on the big screen without digital mediation to fully appreciate. Even if, like me, you don't find yourself easily excited and stimulated by the plotting, the experience of following a figure who continuously makes dangerous and poor decisions--nonetheless, reacting and directing his own fate--may have an uneasy allure, and the cinematography and editing aid in this freneticism. Adam Sandler really is terrific, too; it's easily the best thing I've ever seen from him, including his earlier dramatic efforts that others seem to find more interesting than I ever did. His star power also helps make the character more likable (or, at least, less unlikable). This isn't a film that I'll ponder for long or even write a lengthy review regarding, but it's striking in the moment--like the high experienced by a junkie gambling on basketball and the luster of pretty rocks sold by a jeweler.(P.S. I wonder whether the character's being a ""jew"" and a ""jeweler"" is some sort of pun along the lines of the cameo casting of ""Good Times"" John Amos referencing the Safdie brothers' earlier movie, ""Good Time"" (2017), or the colonoscopy bit, although I don't know what to make of it if it were.)",Uncut Gems

This New York City jeweler lives so spur of the moment, runs so many scams, and burns the candle at every possible end that it's a little exhausting to watch. He thrives on gambling, high stress, and general chaos, and there is a tension that runs through the entire film. There are some little bits like a Passover dinner and a scene with his disrespectful teenage daughter that helped me identify with him a little more, but overall he's kind of an idiot and hard to like. That makes it tough when the film is 135 minutes long, and it does seem to spiral on for a little longer than it needed to. However the film kept me engaged and wondering how it would turn out, and I loved how former NBA star Kevin Garnet had more than just a cameo role in what is a fine supporting cast.",Uncut Gems

The direction which was made by Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie was simply amazing and they succeeded on transfer every feeling of the main character into the audience, something that is very difficult to happen. Regarding the interpretations of the cast I have to admit that Adam Sandler who played as Howard Ratner was simply outstanding at his role and I couldn't believe that he is actually the Adam Sandler I have watched in other movies. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Julia Fox's who played as Julia De Fiore and she was very good too.I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because it's simply amazing, it has an intense and interesting plot and an unbelievable interpretation by Adam Sandler that everybody has to watch.

35,eddie_baggins,"An unrelenting adrenaline rush of a film, Sandler's finest hour",9,3 February 2020,"Breaking out with 2017 effort Good Time, directing duo Benny and Josh Safdie quickly became one of the most talked about up and coming filmmaking prospects in Hollywood, with their Robert Pattinson starring thriller showcasing a knack the brothers had for crafting a frenetic thriller filled with abundant energy and visuals, that if refined further, could create something truly special.Fast forward to the now and that promise has indeed come to fruition with Uncut Gems, one of the most insanely tense and energetic offerings to come our way in the last few years, as the brothers employment of the perhaps never better Adam Sandler as Jewish New York based jeweler Howard Ratner takes us on a unique and inspired ride through the Big Apple's diamond district, in what is an unpredictable and gripping affair that is deserving of the hype it has generated.It's hard to put into words just how sweat inducing and hold your breath like Uncut Gems is to the uninitiated, as scenes such as Ratner yelling at a basketball game or fixing a broken automatic door don't sound like the staples of thrilling movie viewing but under the guidance of the Safdie brothers and delivered by Sandler, these such scenarios all combine to ensure that this dialogue heavy offering refuses to let us catch a break across its two hour plus runtime.Built around some brilliantly realised sound design, often creating the feeling that we are listen to two or three conversations at once but never confused as to what we are hearing, some breakneck editing courtesy of Ronald Bronstein and Benny Safdie, in your face cinematography by famed D.O.P Darius Khondji and one of the previous year's best musical scores by Daniel Lopatin, Uncut Gems is the full package that has been conjured up by the clear and singular vision of its talented creators.All this magic behind the scenes would've mattered for little had the Safdie siblings not been able to get the right people involved to enact out their vision in front of the camera but alongside side players like Lakeith Stanfield, Idina Menzel, NBA legend Kevin Garnett (playing himself!) newcomer Julia Fox, the Safdie brothers struck gold when they secured Sandler as Howard, a role it feels as though he was born to play.Ratner is one of the most fascinating cinematic creations of recent memories, a not very likable self-serving businessman who is at all times placing himself first above all others including friends, family and mistress, he feels both entirely different to the persona Sandler has developed over decades in Hollywood but also one that perfectly suits his loud-mouth and quick talking repertoire, that see's the often misunderstood and lazy comedian/actor finally stretching his ability to what has now become universally praised results.In almost every scene of this expletive-laden exercise, Sandler is utterly convincing throughout the Safdie brothers exercise, managing in the process too get us to root for Howard as his life threatens to de-rail around building financial debts and the recent possession of a potentially magical rock filled with Ethiopian gems.It's unlikely we will ever see Sandler again find a role that fits him so perfectly, with it a shame the Academy Award members overlooked his impressive turn in the Best Acting category at the 2020 Oscars, a field he well and truly deserved to be a part of.Final Say -While there's certain plot developments and occurrences that might not stand up to intense scrutiny, Uncut Gems is a undeniable energy rush of a feature film, that is both a thrilling exercise in extended tension building and a stunning showcase for the rarely seen ability of Sandler, who has never been better than he is here.4 ½ Furby necklaces out of 5",Uncut Gems

41,southdavid,Howard The Schmuck,8,28 February 2020,"I've, so far, missed the Safdie brother's previous films and only picked up on this one due to the buzz surrounding Adam Sandler's performance (and its easy access on Netflix).Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a Jewish Diamond dealer in New York City. His marriage has failed (though they're still living together for the kids), his girlfriend is much younger and interested in the nightlife but most seriously, he's in the hole for a lot of money to a man with mob connections. He has a plan though, an uncut Opal that he's bought direct from Ethiopia has just arrived and is valued at enough to clear all his problems. However, he shows the stone to NBA Star Kevin Garnett (himself) who has an almost religious reaction to it and simply must have it.The performances in the film are indeed great. Sandler has been capable of turning his schtick into something more meaningful before, with ""Punch Drunk Love"" and ""Funny People"" and good as he is in this, I'm not sure that Howard is as much of a stretch for him as the other performances were. Anger and shouting is still very much his wheelhouse. Kevin Garnett is good though, as is Lakeith Stansfield. Everyone else is really a supporting character though, as the whole film is about Howard and I'm not sure that there's more than two scenes in the whole movie that he's not in.What's fascinating about the film, and what's stayed with me, is the way the film uses sound to make you match emotions with its protagonist. It literally induces stress in you, with its overlaid and often off screen dialogue, shouting and the electro soundtrack blasting over the lot in key moment. The film really should have been Oscar nominated for Sound Mixing - I don't think I've ever been struck by the effectiveness of a score as much as I have with this one. Note that I said effectiveness and not quality, I couldn't tell you how one of the tunes went, I can only remember how they made me feel.The film engenders frustration rather than ""is"" frustrating, if that makes sense. Apart from the sound use, the Howard makes the worst choices throughout, constantly risking and rerisking his future for some more money to gamble on Basketball. You cringe along in exasperation as he does it.If you're looking to unwind after a hard day, ""Uncut Gems"" is not the film for you, but as a technical experience, if nothing else, it's unlike anything else.",Uncut Gems

43,paul-allaer,Adam Sandler shines in loan shark drama on steroids,7,2 January 2020,"""Uncut Gems"" (2019 release; 135 min.) brings the story of Howard Ratner. As the movie opens, it is ""Welo Mine, Ethiopia, Fall 2010"", where a miner is hurt but along the way a massive uncut gem is unearthed. We then go to ""New York City, Spring 2012"", and we get to know Howard, a questionable wheeler and dealer with a gambling problem. He is confronted by loan sharks who are demanding their money. Then Howard's luck may turn, as a mysterious package arrives while he is hosting Kevin Garnett in his showroom... at this point we are less than 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from co-writers/co-directors (and brothers) Josh and Benny Safdie, whose precious film was the excellent ""Good Time"" (starring Robert Pattinson). As in that film, ""Uncut Gems"" is art in the shady world of gritty urban crime. The character of Howard Ratner is an in your face, talk 100 mile a minute, dubious guy who is frankly not very likable. This actually goes for many of the movie' characters. From the get go, there is yelling and screaming which never lets up, and the frequent up-close handheld camera work only reinforces that this is a loan shark drama on steroids. Frankly this makes for an exhausting movie experience That said, Adam Sandler, in a rare non-comedy leading role, shines throughout. Kevin Garnett, now retired from the NBA, plays himself as a 36-year-old aging Celtics veteran. Kudos also to composer Daniel Lopatin for bringing us a dark and at times pulsating electronic score.""Uncut Gems"" premiered to nice acclaim last summer at the Telluride film festival. It is now going wide in theaters. The New Year's Eve matinee screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 10 people).

44,jtindahouse,A bold film unlike any you've seen before with an amazing ending,8,17 January 2020,"I'm a reasonably expansive sports punter myself. I'm lucky to be very good at it so I rarely get myself anywhere near a situation like the character of 'Howard' finds himself in this film. However I have laid some hefty and risky bets in my time. Even I was watching 'Uncut Gems' and getting quite an uncomfortable feeling wondering what the hell he was thinking. For people who don't gamble or find $10 a reasonable sized bet this film is going to seem absolutely bonkers. It's scary to think that there are actually people like this in the world.This is such a unique movie. From the word go it absolutely chaotic. We follow 'Howard' the entire movie, who is this incredible character who is equal parts lovable oaf and despicable scum. Adam Sandler absolutely nailed it in this role. To make a character this awful seem likeable is a really hard thing to do and something audiences just take for granted. The movie also never slows down for a second. It is full on chaos for the entire 135 minute run time.I love a film that is willing to be daring and bold and not follow the formula. This film is certainly that. As it was nearing the end I kept thinking to myself that there was no right way to end this film. Every possibility I ran through my head didn't fit or make sense. The one they settled on though was utterly perfect. It was one of the best endings to a film I have ever seen. I was stunned. 'Uncut Gems' is a film that has to be seen to be believed.

46,Turfseer,Sandler's frenetic caricature of a compulsive gambler becomes repetitious despite occasional moments of raw entertainment,5,14 November 2019,"Adam Sandler finally gets to play a role different than the usual goody two shoes characters we've come to expect and some critics have already declared this is his ""breakout"" role. Sandler is Howard Ratner, basically a caricature of Jewish entrepreneur who runs a jewelry showroom in the Diamond District in New York City. The Safdie brothers (Joshua and Benjamin) are responsible for both the direction and the screenplay.
Uncut Gems plays out much like an early Scorsese film; and guess what? Scorsese is one of the producers. It's marked by its frenetic style, with the characters' dialogue overlapping one another, and Sandler's manic performance. It's supposed to be ""realistic"" but has an improvised quality that distracts from the overall verisimilitude.
Sandler as Ratner is cast as not only a businessman, but a compulsive gambler. I say he's a caricature because even some of the worst compulsive gamblers appear to express some fear of people to whom they owe money -in this case, Ratner does not. Even with a gun to his head or scenes in which the threat of imminent harm is clear, Ratner, in his hyper-narcissism, doesn't seem to care. He pushes back against everyone who seeks to do him in.
The Safdies will probably argue, ""that's the point."" They've exaggerated their protagonist's character in order to highlight his cluelessness. In some respects, Ratner's outrageousness is supposed to be satirical-his behavior is so over the top that it represents what compulsive gambling is all about in high relief. It exposes Ratner's love of money as one might term an ""emptiness to the core."" Yes we get what the Safdies are trying to say here very early on-and then their Ratner character doubles, triples, quadruples down on it, ad infinitum.
I suppose that one ends up asking is, how far will this ridiculous caricature of a character go? So if we strip away the padding (including all the unclear machinations of the loan sharks who are after Ratner from the start), we're left with a plot that is only mildly interesting.
Indeed the plot concerns some black opal gems (encased in one rock) that Ratner illegally imports from Ethiopia and expects to make a killing of over a million dollars at auction. But before he puts it up for auction, he figures out how to make some additional cash from the stone. When famed NBA superstar Kevin Garnett (well played by himself) walks into Ratner's showroom, he's so enamored with the piece, that he offers to buy it on the spot. Ratner says he'll have to wait for the auction but Garnett wants to walk around with it (why I'm not sure), and then agrees to give Ratner one of his championship rings as collateral and return the next day.
Ratner promptly pawns the ring and uses the cash to bet on the number of shots Garnett makes in a game that night. Although Ratner wins the bet and makes a great deal of money, we later find out that the bet was canceled by the loan sharks who feared Ratner would lose the bet (which he's done many times in the past) and not able to pony up the cash to cover his debts.
There are some sub-plots here involving Ratner's wife Dinah (played by Broadway superstar Idina Menzell) as well as his mistress, Julia (Julia Fox), who works in the showroom. The female actors here have little to do until the end, when Julia is entrusted with making Ratner's last bet at the Mohegan Sun casino.
The other twist is that much to Ratner's chagrin, the opal is undervalued by an appraiser at the auction house and he's forced to ask an associate to bid up the price against Garnett, who eventually declines to make the purchase, and leaves the associate holding the bag.
Ratner is seemingly saved when another one of his large basketball bets comes through (placed by Julia at the casino), only to have one of the loan sharks end up murdering the debt-ridden jewelry owner, after he and his confederates are temporarily locked in by Ratner, inside the vestibule at the showroom.
After all the aforementioned frenetic machinations, the Safdies leave us with a cautionary conclusion: compulsive gambling is not a good thing! Their final shot focuses on the blood pouring out of the now deceased Ratner's eye-and the camera then travels deep into the darkness of that eye-only to find those opals floating in the darkness. Indeed Ratner's fatal quest is clearly classified as useless and meaningless.
If you can ignore the rather obvious premise and the fact that the Safdies have crafted a rather one-note character for Mr. Sandler, Uncut Gems still is occasionally entertaining, with enough twists and turns in the plot, to prevent the discerning viewer from dismissing this effort outright.",Uncut Gems
47,jadavix,Admirable attempt,6,16 January 2020,"""Uncut Gems"" is a similar movie to the directors' previous ""Good Time"". It features a streetwise hustler type trying to keep several balls in the air and using his natural charisma and insouciance to stay out of trouble long enough to make it all work. The pleasure in watching is wondering if he'll be able to succeed.I didn't like this one as much as ""Good Time"", though. Reviews suggest that the movie is extremely stressful and should come with an anxiety warning. I didn't think so at all. I wasn't on board for most of it, and couldn't be bothered keeping up with the minor plot details. A lot of stuff to do with the guy's family wasn't all that interesting to me.Sandler does give a great performance. He is almost too convincing as a ratlike smooth talking hustler type who is addicted to gambling and of course keeps a mistress. It seems like if you met someone like him, it might turn out to BE him. So what's the problem? He's so convincing he's impossible to like. You like Robert Pattinson in ""Good Time"", who also gave a brilliant performance, possibly because he's younger and might still turn into a decent human being. Plus, he's doing what he's doing for his disabled brother. Sandler's Howard, even if he does win in the end, will be broke again soon enough afterward. So who cares if he wins at all?I admire the Safdie's attempt to bring thrillers back to the forefront of Hollywood, and especially in taking a different approach to all the standard suspensers we got tired of in the '80s and '90s. It worked with ""Good Time"", but I don't think it worked here.",Uncut Gems

First off, this is not a comedy. Most people would think it was with Adam Sandler in it but he has done a few other dramas. Here, he plays a New York City jeweler-he has his own store-and he is a bit of a hustler. He is always looking for a big score and when he sees a special on tv about some mining in South Africa, he has a brainstorm. He buys a raw opal-still in a chunk of rock-and sees huge dollar signs. There are a few cameos-The Weeknd, Judd Hirsch, John Amos-and one of them is a basketball player named Kevin Garnett. LaKeith is an employee of Adam's that introduces Kevin to Adam. Kevin is interested in the opal but Adam wants to put it up for auction-he sees bigger dollar signs if people are bidding on it. Adam is always placing bets-and loosing most of the time-so he has lots of people wanting their money from him and he thinks this is the big score to get him out of debt. Idina plays Adams' wife, who has just about had it with his gambling and Julia is one of Adam's employees/mistress. If you are interested in seeing Adam stretch his acting chops, you might like this one.

51,alindsay-al,A good film with a truly memorable lead performance,7,2 February 2020,"This film has been gaining quite a bit of buzz recently and on Friday Netflix released this film and now I have seen it and this is my review for this film. The premise for the film shows the life of a charismatic Jewel dealer and how he can try and make a large score to pay off people he owes money too.
Main Character
Now I have to admit Adam Sandler for me was seen as pretty washed up and you would only see him in pretty awful comedy but my opinion has now changed, this is probably the best performance of his career and can stretch his career out for years to come. He is so charismatic in this role but not in the annoying way you expect, he clearly knows what he is doing in the role and you can't take your eyes off of him when he is on screen. His dramatic performance is also great, he really goes through the emotional ringer in this film and I just couldn't believe it was Adam Sandler giving this excellent performance and I really hope we see him do more dramatic roles in the future.
Supporting Characters
Julia Fox plays Sandler's girlfriend in the film and she hasn't done much before this but I thought she did a good job in the film,, there chemistry together was there in the film and I thought she did a decent in the film. However, the rest of the people in this film aren't intreresting at all in the film, plenty of people come in and leave the film but there isn't much context to them and because Sandler completely owns the film these other people are mostly just there.
Story
It is really interesting seeing the life of this guy as he deals with all these different things going on and showing just how chaotic this world gets to. The film does a great job of building the tension because of how this story builds and builds throughout, I also really liked the end of the film and felt it was appropriate for the story that has been told. However, as mentioned with the supporting characters I felt that especially in the first 20 mins the film could have done with a bit more explanation as to why certain characters are after Sandler as it is never really explained.
Script
The script is really good, a great mix of humour and drama to it, especially when Sandler is delivering the lines you believe everything that he is saying. Though I noticed that during the film that characters talk over each other lots in this film, I am fine with it for a bit because it is natural and like real life but it becomes a bit too much throughout the film and it feels like people are just trying to get there lines in over the other people.
Style
This film has a great style to it, you feel the same way as Sandler's character in the film and you go on the journey with him and start to break down as he does. As the film goes on it just gets more and more intense and you feel the tension building that it keeps you watching and really makes you wonder exactly what is going to happen.
Overall
Overall this is a good film that is led by a truly brilliant performance by Adam Sandler. This film was good but nothing groundbreaking and will pretty much only be remembered for Sandler's performance.",Uncut Gems
52,iquine,A Taxing Viewing,7,19 June 2020,"(Flash Review)The viewer is thrust right into a tornado of stressful and hectic situations, yelling and cursing all because of a gambling bet, a pawned NBA Championship ring and some dazzling, rare, uncut jewel from Ethiopia. Sandler owns a jewelry store and one of his key clientele is the NBA star Kevin Garnett (current player in the story), who when catches a glimpse of this strange gemstone, is mesmerized by it. He even had a career game the same day he set eyes on it. Sandler spends the film trying to get a big payday from this gemstone betting on Garnett. There are several intertwined deals all in play simultaneously. Can Sandler hit it big and Garnett hit the big jumper before patience run out with the men he owes money too? This was a better than I expected and well-done yet I must say, it was not an enjoyable viewing.",Uncut Gems

I really bought his character in that film. But in this film, he scales heights I never thought he could achieve. He should be nominated for Best Actor (and win). Comedians often make good actors (Tom Hanks, Jackie Gleason, etc.). But Sandler is on overdrive in this one as a gems dealer who cannot control his life or environment. He overplays his hand.
This is a realistic film that is shot in a frantic style that matches the demands of New York business. I knew guys like this (Mr. Mint comes to mind). I think Sandler has a good chance at the oscar.",Uncut Gems
57,yusufpiskin,Adam Sandler does a predictably incredible job,8,24 December 2019,"Jesus .....n christ, what a picture. Goddamn. Major in every aspect, and an effortless evolution from Good Time's parasitic acid-trip of grime and privilege, especially as this strips away much of Good Time's chase-movie energy for something far more fruitless and sad. Uncut Gems plays to the tune of an exasperated study in commodity, running around until it passes out on the concrete, its specificity in the early-2010s giving way to a cosmic pain, a neon-glow of worthless lives and unending transactions. Yes, it's a very funny work, given substantial gravitas by Adam Sandler's god-tier performance, but only to heighten how sickly each frame and movement is, like a rabid dog on its last day, crawling under the porch with a snarl. The interior locations are often separated, buzzers and closed-circuit security and locked doors keeping characters whirling, dancing within the energy of their lives, in every direction, the camera barely keeping up. It's only when the film slows down, sometimes merely to catch a breath, that it's clear that our environment allows for no self-reflection or understanding of ourselves. ""All I am, is what I'm going after"" and all that jazz. The rest of the time, it's too busy to think of anything other than the flow of experience, big scores, the tension of language and deals. I don't think I've ever seen a film as well-paced and as strategic in its rhythms as this one. The banger OPN soundtrack helps, once again with a rabid, fiending mind of its own, flowing like an angelic stream and imbuing a few moments with a feeling of a higher power. For a social thriller to be as clammy, as edge-of-the-world as Uncut Gems feels, it still dreams of a place away from capital, and distanced from the fiery conniptions of these characters. Alas, I'm having too good of a time.",Uncut Gems

63,masonfisk,UNCUT PERFORMANCE BY SANDLER...!,10,21 January 2020,"The Safdie Brothers (Josh & Benny) follow-up to their breakthrough, Good Time, is a great showcase for Adam Sandler who shines (sorry!) as the great actor he can be when he's not pandering to the proletariat w/the dross he usually is involved in. Sandler plays a merchant in the heart of the diamond district who's the consummate mover & shaker having one deal going while not having the previous one quite done & he seems to be good at it but what holds him back from the whole happiness package is that he's cheated on his wife (he's got an apartment set up w/the other woman who happens to be his employee), his kids for the most part loathe him & oh yeah he has a dangerous gambling addiction where money is lost almost as soon as it enters his hand. He has a hip hop partner, Lakeith Stansfield, who brings him high end clientele from the world of music et al & his latest is none other Kevin Garnett (playing himself) who has become mesmerized by Sandler's latest acquisition, a large black opal mined by Ethiopian Jews (we see the excavation of the gem in the film's opening) for the purposes of an auction but KG wants the jewel so much so he trades his championship ring (as collateral) to hold the opal for his next ballgame. What follows is a mesmeric fever dream punctuated by violence, profanity, lies & one last bet which will clear his debts. As evidenced by their last effort, the Safdie brothers have a tight grip on the cinematic medium (we see shades of Scorsese, James Toback & even early Paul Thomas Anderson) as this world (supposedly a family member worked in the diamond industry whose stories birthed the tale we're seeing) is presented in all its shallow transitory glory. Special mention should go to their composer Daniel Lopatin (previously going by the name Oneohtrix Point Never) who scored this film (as well as their previous) w/a propulsive electronic score almost commenting on the cacophony of the dialogue. Also starring Idina Menzel as his ex-wife, Eric Bogosian as his brother-in-law, Judd Hirsch as his father-in-law & R & B singer the Weekend playing himself.",Uncut Gems
64,peterp-450-298716,Adam Sandler nails it in this nerve-wracking thriller.,7,17 February 2020,"That's a million dollar opal you are holding.
Straight from the Ethiopian Jewish tribe.Are you in the middle of a nasty divorce? Or are you at home on sick leave because of burnout due to your stressful job that demands too much from you? Or are those two revolting teenagers at home, who go through puberty right now, making you so much upset that you almost have no fingernails anymore? Good advice! Ignore this movie and look for another soothing movie. Because ""Uncut Gems"" will certainly not be ideal for your peace of mind. I'm afraid that after 20 minutes you'll be throwing snacks at the screen out of frustration while pulling your hair out of sheer desperation. Because it's the most stressful film ever. It drives up the tension throughout the whole movie in a merciless way to an extreme level. Believe me, at the end of the film my heart rhythm was proportional to that of the exhilarating rhythm of this tragicomic film.Not only is it a nerve-wracking film. The pace of the film is also absurdly high. A movie like an out of control high-speed train. It seemed as if everyone is running from pillar to post at an inhuman pace. From the beginning of the film, it looks like you are being thrown into a centrifuge that's spinning at a dizzying speed and where the speed never diminishes. Up to and including the denouement. Then the emergency brake is pulled swiftly and the tumultuous life of jeweler Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) abruptly comes to a halt. And if you are annoyed by the use of the ""f"" word, I warn you already. There are a few hidden in every dialogue.I'm not at all an Adam Sandler fan. The few films I saw with him (""Click"", ""Blended"" and ""The Cobbler"") were disappointing in my eyes. Maybe it's the humor used by Sandler. Maybe it's the person Sandler himself I have a problem with. And to be honest, I always avoid movies with his name on the film poster. It surprised me when I read somewhere that he's the best-paid actor in Hollywood. But after seeing ""Uncut Gems"" I have to drastically adjust my opinion about the actor Sandler. It's not a real comedy (in a reasonably morbid way you could see some kind of humor in it) although you could say that the character Sandler is playing here, is kind of a caricature. Howard, a Jewish jeweler in the metropolis of New York, tries to get his chaotic life back on track. An Ethiopian opal should take care of that. An uncut diamond that according to Howard could muster a fortune at an auction. A fortune with which he can pay off his debts to pawnbrokers and underworld figures. Debts incurred due to his uncontrollable gambling addiction. Until the famous basketball star Kevin Garnett (Kevin Garnett himself) steps in his diamond shop and asks if he could borrow the precious thing because he feels it exudes a primal power. A power that could bring his performance to an unprecedented height during the upcoming important match.Well, and when KG doesn't return the precious good to Howard at the agreed time, it's the start of a nerve-racking race. A race in which Howard's life is turned into a hell by nasty people, debt collectors, his wife (Idina Menzel who hates him wholeheartedly and calls him the most annoying person in the world) and his mistress Julia (Julia Fox). Even though Howard is indeed a highly annoying person without scruples or any kind of courtesy, you still feel sorry for this man whose life is collapsing like a house of cards. And even though I got nervous because of the Mr. Bean-like character of the film where Howard screws up every time he makes a decision over and over again, this film still managed to entertain me. I could never have imagined that I would ever say this, but Adam Sandler is simply playing his role in an exceptionally excellent way. This was actually worthy of an Oscar nomination. Hopefully, Sandler developed a taste for serious movies now and will make another attempt with a serious role (in a hopefully less hectic setting) in the future. However, I'm afraid that we'll be seeing a load of comedies (filled with offbeat, childish humor) before that'll happen.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Uncut Gems
65,aidanratesmovies,"Not great, but certainly impressive",9,10 January 2020,"A harsh, honest, and tension filled work that doesn't always land on its feet- but is certainly something to be looked upon. Adam Sandler stars as Howard Ratner, and brings his total A-game to the mix, something we very rarely see from Sandler. His performance is easily the best one since his role in The Meyerowitz Stories, and quite possibly his best. The movie deeply relies on him and his take on the character, and as the film goes on, you can clearly see no one is truly more fit for the role than him. Julia Fox and Kevin Garnett also provide great debut performances, as well as yet another great performance from LaKeith Stanfield. The film is masterfully crafted, and thought the plot can seem a bit repetitive and or pointless at times, for the most part it does tend to pay off. The film is an easily honest portrayal of Adam Sandler's character's life, who may seem fictional, but by the way they delve in, makes him feel incredibly real, making it seem all the more unfortunate. The film can seem a bit gray, but it feels natural, and the way it is crafted around that gray atmosphere is extremely impressive. In the end, Uncut Gems is far from a perfect film, but it does provide yet another master-filled work from the Safdie brothers, and a film to be talked about and debated in thought for quite some time.

66,questl-18592,Sandler's Gem,7,16 March 2020,"A movie like this is immensely frustrating. To see Sandler step so wonderfully into this role and give such an excellent performance after all the other absolute trash he's made... Why can't we get more of this?Unfortunately, I find myself in the precarious position of knowing that I watched something great but it just didn't click with me. Sandler embodies the role, the character study is fascinating, the people playing themselves are solid, the screenplay is strong.The big problem here is that there's not a likable character to be found anywhere. Not every movie needs likable characters, but that usually gets offset by something and this movie does try to endear Sandler's character to us, but if it never quite works then that leaves things feeling a bit hollow and makes the movie feel like it's dragging. Since I never got enveloped in the character I never just lost myself in it.That is until the last half hour or so when this thing shifts into high gear and left me stunned. I predicted what would happen and was still blown away by it, which is very impressive.It's absolutely worth watching, especially since I seem to be on the low side. Even though I don't personally love it, I can absolutely acknowledge that this is an excellent film.",Uncut Gems
67,I_Ailurophile,"Great performances, unexpectedly riveting story",8,30 July 2021,"Strong word of mouth piqued my curiosity but still left me skeptical. I've seen other films starring, but not made by, this often juvenile star, and been impressed, but the very premise of 'Uncut gems' felt like a substantial step further. I'm so very pleased that, having finally watched it - I think this is a pretty great movie.Much has been made of Adam Sandler's dramatic turn here, and the hype isn't wrong: this is possibly the single best performance of his career. Howard Ratner is a fast-talking, dubious, dishonest, manipulative, irresponsible, instantly unlikable, and unsympathetic character. Sandler, against all odds, portrays Howard with astounding appropriate levels of pompous, arrogant bluster, and spite. He superbly captures the nuances of a man so myopic and single-minded that to watch him genuinely feel something is like witnessing a unicorn run in a field. Granted, given that Sandler's career otherwise broadly consists of a lot of unfunny pablum with a small scattering of real intelligence, comparing 'Uncut gems' against the rest of his credits would make this shine impossibly brighter by any measure - yet there's no denying the strength of his acting here.Truthfully, the rest of the cast is just as marvelous. Idina Menzel and Julia Fox quite deservedly get the most time on screen outside of Sandler, and both are magnificent in their roles. Menzel's portrayal of Dinah's tired anger is full of the same force of personality that characterizes her singing in other features, while Fox's depiction of complicated ""Julia"" feels so masterfully real that some of her scenes feel like a moment playing out in real life. Even the young performers that portray Howard's children, in their small supporting roles, match the skillful acting of the very experienced cast members portraying the most antagonistic characters. Kevin Garnett, starring as a fictionalized version of himself, surprises in the adeptness he brings to the film. The Safdie brothers have written excellent, complex characters that are wonderfully vivid and believable, and to watch them be brought to life is a great joy as a moviegoer.Of course the best performances only count for so much if a feature isn't worthy otherwise, but the story in 'Uncut gems' is peculiarly captivating. It takes a little bit to really start to feel invested, yet once we begin to see how significantly and widely Howard's web of lies, misdirection, and recklessness spins out, we're hooked. As tension escalates immensely at the climax, there's ponderous suspense for both characters and viewer alike as we wait to see how everything will unfold; I may actually have been holding my breath. Despite loud, jolting moments of violence or emotional outbursts, the tale is rather straightforward in its telling - there are no twists, no hooks, no particular plot devices thrown in to snag our attention. The movie does that all by itself with the engrossing story being told - especially as Howard makes one dumbfounding, egocentric decision after another - and the outstanding performances of its cast. And while we should see the ending coming, it's aptly jarring nonetheless.I wouldn't claim the movie is perfect, but the only criticism that immediately comes to mind is how the screenplay and direction allows some scenes to become an unwelcome cacophony of noise. Sounds, overlapping dialogue, and heated expressions of emotions converge into a grating morass of harsh clamor to the point that it threatens our enjoyment. This occurs throughout the movie, but it's particularly noticeable in early scenes that are more exposition than anything else - which makes that clatter all the more unfortunate.Still, otherwise, from a technical standpoint everything basically looks and sounds good here. I could discuss various such elements at greater length, but the heart of 'Uncut gems' is plainly in the strength of its cast and the unforeseen electricity of the narrative. And with these assets, it excels.Art is subjective, and everyone has their own preferences when it comes to cinema. But I entered 'Uncut gems' with somewhat mixed expectations, and walk away decidedly impressed. As far as I'm concerned, this is well worth watching.",Uncut Gems

69,valleyjohn,Absolutely chaotic,6,6 February 2020,"There has been a lot of love for Uncut Gems since it's release on Netflix. Perhaps it's because it's Adam Sandler playing a serious role for once and not another terrible comedy for which he's so famous for? . Although this slightly raised my respect for Sandler ( it's not hard ) it raised my blood pressure much more because this movie is absolutely manic and not in a particularly good way .
Sandler plays Howard Ratner , a New York City jeweler always on the lookout to make big money . Ratner makes a series of confusing ( in my mind ) basketball bets that could lead to big winnings but he has to tackle business, family, and encroaching adversaries on all sides, in his relentless pursuit of the ultimate win.This movie is pure chaos . It's relentless from the very first minute . The dialogue is fired out like machine gun bullets and is accompanied by a head ache inducing score but it's not all bad .Sandler puts in his best performance for many years and is accompanied by the beautiful Julia Fox , who I was really impressed with but it's not enough for me to buy into the admiration this film has been getting .There have also been plenty of people complaining that this wasn't nominated for an Oscar but in my opinion the Academy got that decision spot on.Now excuse me as I feel like I need a lie down !",Uncut Gems

71,a_chinn,Wonderfully anxiety inducing crime thriller,9,10 July 2021,"Adam Sandler gives the performance of a lifetime as a sleazy NYC jeweler/gambling addict with virtually no redeeming qualities (this is not the type of film that ends with hugs and life lessons). He's overextended on his finances, he's cheating on his wife, and his life is about to implode when debt collectors give him a 24 hour deadline to pay up. His glimmer of hope to fix this situations is if he can sell the titular gems to basketball star player Kevin Garnett (played by Garnett himself), but in between that is bookies, goons, drugs, mistresses, basketball games, and other obstacles to Sandler setting everything right. What makes ""Uncut Gems"" so unique of a film experience is how anxiety inducing it was. Sandler's predicament doesn't so much create suspense for the audience as it creates stress and anxiety. From a character standpoint, Sandler bounces from one crisis to another (mostly of his own creating) with breakneck rapidity, which give you get the feeling that his present situation with isn't anything new and that this is simply how he lives his life, conning his way from one situation to the next. Without spoiling anything, I came to the realization at one point that Sandler would either get killed by the end or would live out his post credits film life continuing to do the same. The only film I can think to compare the tone and sensibility of ""Uncut Gems"" to is Frédéric Jardin's French crime thriller ""Sleepless Night"" which also takes place in span the span of 24 hours and has the characters quickly move from one crisis to the next. The Safdie Brothers, who wrote and directed the film, have created a visually striking film, where the camera stylistics are always engaging and interesting, but are not distracting from the character drama happening on screen. With a muted color scheme, often out of focus backgrounds, and strong visuals they manage to make New York City look gritty again, much like 70s crime films such as ""The French Connection"" ""Serpico"" or ""The Warriors,"" which is my favorite film representation of the city that never sleeps. The movie also has a terrific synthesizer heavy soundtrack by Daniel Lopatin that's more ambient than orchestral. It's not a soundtrack I'd want to listen to on it's own, but it's highly effective in supporting the film's mounting tension. Overall, ""Uncut Gems"" is not for all tastes, but for those who want a gritty stress inducing film populated with almost exclusively with unpleasant characters, it's a while rollercoaster ride of a film that's hard to predict what's going to happen next. A must see!",Uncut Gems
72,jadepietro,Pure Rhinestone,5,8 January 2020,"GRADE: CTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Fine acting in need of better storytelling.JIM'S REVIEW: Howard Ratner is a lowlife and gambling addict. He doesn't see himself as a loser, a man in search of the almighty dollar and the next big scam. Nor does he value his family, his mistress, or anyone else. In Uncut Gems, Howard is in over his head as he gambles away his life, even though the odds are always against him. An expensive opal gem becomes his latest obsession, and everyone wants in on the action.Critics have unexpectedly raved about this indie darling, a crime thriller with an overabundance of atmosphere and colorful characters. But the story is in need of some judicious cutting as the plot is underdeveloped and redundant. Directed by Josh and Benny Safdie, who also co-wrote the meandering and predictable screenplay with Ronald Bronstein, Uncut Gems shows all the wealth, sleaze, and crassness in this world of high finance set in the Jewish Diamond District in Manhattan. The thugs, loan sharks and henchmen populate this business area, although everyone in the film is repugnant or borderline stereotypes, along with the jewelers and their workers.Adam Sandler plays the debt-ridden Howard, and he gives a very strong performance. (I have previously stated that Mr. Sandler is a far better dramatic actor than a comedy star and I concur with that previous assessment.) The cast is solid, even if the material is not. Fine work is on view by Lakeith Stanfield, Julie Fox, Idina Menzel (looking very witchy and sounding like she's auditioning for a role in The Real Housewives of New Yawk), Eric Bogosian, Judd Hirsch, Keith Williams Richards, and athlete Kevin Garnett as himself.The filmmakers share a raw and passionate vision, but the plotting is unnecessarily slow-paced and continually overstates the obvious. A few more rewrites could have helped to give the film some gravitas and its characters greater depth. The dialog consists of banal conversations set in a gritty world that are just too improvisatory and self-conscious, with non-stop profanity and very little wit or characters to care about Yes, it all feels quite real, but it also feels quite dull.Uncut Gems may be worthy of your attention, mostly due to its ensemble, but its true valued worth is questionable. As with the ""Four Cs"" of gem grading, the film certainly definitely has color and (dramatic) weight, but its clarity and cut are less than satisfactory.

74,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Uncut Gems,8,26 December 2019,"Howard Ratner (played by improv over-loader and live-in caricature Adam Sandler) is a bungling jeweler, a trying BS-er, and an addictive gambler. He gets in way over his head making risky bets in order to finally get that big score. That's the gist of the inflamed and black-eyed Uncut Gems. It's my latest review.Yup, I am announcing ""Gems"" as one of 2019's best and most exhaustive films. After seeing it on Xmas day, I am sure I will never view anything quite like it again. Remember Mark Wahlberg's Jim Bennett from The Gambler or Matthew McConaughey's Brandon Lang from Two for the Money? Well Sandler's Howard makes these dudes look like Romper Room in comparison.Directed by two thirty-year-old brothers (Josh Safdie, Benny Safdie), filmed chiefly in close-ups, featuring some weird colonoscopy imagery, and co-starring former NBA great Kevin Garnett (that's some brilliant casting there), Uncut Gems is the cinematic equivalent of pure cocaine mixed with high-grade angel dust.Josh and Benny Safdie fashion ""Gems"" as a sloppy character study and New York minute minutia that still seems to work. The dialogue is raw and massively ad-libitum, there are enough F-words to make Tarantino blush, the camerawork is whizzing, and Sandler lets you know that he's light years away from his blundering, Bobby Boucher shtick.So yeah, Sandler's Ratner is an unlikable and turgidly reckless persona. And yes, ""Gems"" is so mean-spirited, so 80's synth happy, and so insouciant it dares you to despise it. Still, Uncut Gems enthralls you provided you dig a little Martin Scorsese or Oliver Stone on steroids. This thing is a live by the bet, die by the bet train wreck of a movie.

75,justin-fencsak,Good movie with an unpleasant ending,7,29 December 2019,"After seeing Uncut Gems in a very full house with my companion, I thought that this Adam Sandler movie was more like Punch Drunk Love than one of his hit comedies. The title of the movie refers to a jewelry auction of the uncut gems upon which Kevin Garnett plays the role of in his first movie debut. Also making a movie debut is Mike Francesa as Mike Francesa and he's a hoot. The climax of the film finds the main character's girlfriend, played by Julia Fox in a foxy performance, successfully wins the bet on Garnett's performance in the 2012 ECF NBA finals while Adam Sandler's character gets shot to death. I think this movie is one of A24's best films in awhile and it will be a huge contender in the awards race for weeks to come. See it in a theater soon.",Uncut Gems
76,larrys3,Sandler is Terrific Here,9,8 August 2020,"Adam Sandler's portrayal of a compulsive gambler is a masterwork, and the movie is the best focus on that subject since the classic 1974 film ""The Gambler"", starring James Caan.But don't expect any let-up from the continuous dark and frenetic storyline.",Uncut Gems

80,arungeorge13,Great stuff from Sandler and the Safdies! [+74%],7,7 February 2020,"Howard Ratner is a gambler in everything - his business, his bets, his relationships. He's a risk-taker; one with a scoreboard featuring more losses than wins. How do you expect Sandler to pull off such a layered character? We haven't seen him do solid work in a good while. His memorable films include Punch Drunk Love (2002) and Reign Over Me (2007), both of which came out more than a decade ago. But surprise! Not only does Sandler come off with flying colors in portraying Howard, he even manages to make viewers empathize with a cheating husband, a gambling addict, and a risk-taking businessman.A good amount of credit inevitably goes to the Safdie Brothers as well - the screenplay is a slow-burn (yet a-mile-a-minute) in the sense that it wants viewers to understand the different nuances of Howard's life. On one hand, he is a jeweler trying to make it big, there are loan sharks after him (including his own brother-in-law Arno), his equation with his wife is a total mess due to obvious reasons, and the only one who offers him an iota of respect in his own household is his older son Eddie owing to their mutual love for the NBA.The Safdies also offer interesting insights into the professional and personal lives of Jewish businessmen in New York. There are a few tense, anxiety-inducing scenes but the best thing about them is that they feel organic and situational. Uncut Gems barely goes over-the-top in its proceedings even when the storyline-stakes are high and somewhat superficial. It wouldn't be hard to say that this is a Sandler performance that you'll remember for a long while, considering how repetitive and boring all his recent 'comedies' turned out to be. He gives Howard his all, and then some!Kevin Garnett is in the movie a lot more than you'd expect, and how he gets embroiled in Howard's chaotic life is very interestingly written. The cinematography work by Darius Khondji (The Lost City of Z) is excellent; he attributes a 35mm color palette and a grainy texture to the film's 2012 New York setting. The film serves a rollercoaster of emotions and therefore its leading man, its fiery screenplay, and the cinematography.. all of it is best served uncut.",Uncut Gems
81,Abdulxoxo,"Loud, Over-the-top, anxious-inducing but I liked it",9,1 August 2021,"Howard Hatner, a jewellery seller in New York's jewellery market, is always looking for huge bets instead of paying off his debts, and after losing his most expensive displays, a rare Ethiopian stone he was set to put on auction, events went bad with him and started a series of situations and chases. Howard is simply the perfect model for embodying greed with kindness of heart. We sympathize here with Howard when he feels that his life is falling apart despite his consistency to fix it and correct it or so he thought, between his perspective on things and your perspective as a viewer there's a big differences, so what if our quest to change reality and improve conditions is a quest of wrong and bad choices? What if we're swimming In reverse stream trying to survive? Howard is a block of flaws, but he has many advantages, he is passionate, peaceful, brave and intelligent, he improves betting and sees profit where not everyone sees, a good gambler but he is a bad trader, a bad husband and a bad father. Adam Sandler embodied the character in a crazy performance worthy of an Oscar, as I think, and a distinctive directing by The Savdi Brothers especially by putting the main character of the film in every frame and in every snapshot of the film moment with a flexible movement of the camera and well
dealing with the hustle of events and the sudden complications in it and its terrible acceleration that led us to a conclusion of suspense and constant nervousness, tension and a more shocking end.Uncut Gems is simply a crime and black comedy movie, fun and exciting with a shocking albeit satisfying ending.",Uncut Gems

84,Jeremy_Urquhart,One of the best (and most intense) films of 2019,9,1 February 2020,"Uncut Gems arrived here in Australia somewhat unceremoniously last night, coming straight to Netflix without any sort of cinema release. Theatres over here aren't a fan of Netflix making their films available for streaming in a number of weeks (instead of months) after the theatrical debut. Based on the strength of the Safdie Brothers' filmography, as well as the high amount of critical acclaim Uncut Gems has received, I was happy to see it at a cinema, but unfortunately I had to watch it home. It's hard to imagine much of the impact was lost, however. The screen may not have been as big nor the chaotic sound mix quite as booming, but Uncut Gems still proved to be a frantic, highly entertaining, utterly squirm-inducing (in a good way) film that ranks up there among my personal favourites of 2019 (one of the strongest years for movies in recent memory).Heaven Knows What (2014) was a Safdie Brothers film I watched recently, and it was really solid. Good Time (2017) was a significant step up, and it's stuck with me immensely since I saw it a couple of years ago. Uncut Gems is yet another step up the previous film in terms of quality. The Safdie Brothers seem to be on a roll, not only churning out good films reliably every 2-3 years, but improving their craft and skill as filmmakers with each and every one. I am beyond excited to see what they do next, and am glad movies like this one and Good Time are so dense and packed full of things to be enthralled by, so should prove plenty rewatchable to tide me over while waiting for their next film.Their stunning screenplay and direction has made Uncut Gems one of the most compelling and well-paced movies of the year. And this is to say nothing of the talented cast all doing great work, with lead actor Adam Sandler impressing the most, and giving the best performance of his career up until this point. This isn't a comedy, now would I quite call it a dramedy- this is his most serious role to date and he excels in it, although I won't say it's a movie without humour. I found myself laughing a fair amount because of how intense it got at times, so honestly maybe that was something of a mechanism to deal with the stress of it all.Because make no mistake: this is a stressful movie. Take a look at some of the other 700-something reviews posted to this website prior to mine, if you haven't already. Most will mention how intense, relentless, and even anxiety-provoking this movie is. Last year's excellent Parasite was similarly tense at times, but it wasn't as consistently tense as Uncut Gems proved to be. The plot starts almost straight away, and as soon as it does, it's already uncomfortable (in the best way possible), and as it goes on and various things spiral out of Sandler's character's control, it only gets worse. I was torn between squirming/ being on the edge of my seat, and being delighted that a movie was actually making me feel such visceral emotions. It doesn't happen very often, and for a bit over two hours I thoroughly loved giving myself over to the movie, letting it skill-fully manipulate and play with my emotions, releasing a surprising amount of adrenaline in the process. I watched it very late and still couldn't sleep for at least two hours after finishing it.In time I could see this becoming a 10/10 in my eyes. It's almost flawless, and there's barely a dull moment. So consider my 9 rating something more like a 9.5/10, and given how stingy I am with 10/10 ratings, this is one that I highly recommend to anyone willing to put up with a breathless, very intense movie. I know not everyone wants to feel those things when they sit down and watch a film, so I'd advise those sorts of viewers to stay away (or make sure they're in the right mood for a movie like this before watching).Uncut Gems is a movie that's going to stick with me, and now that it's easily available on Netflix, I can see myself rewatching it again very soon. Both the Safdie Brothers and Adam Sandler have never been better. If you go in knowing as little as possible and ready yourself for an insane ride, I can almost guarantee that a phenomenal experience awaits.",Uncut Gems
85,areatw,"Messy and confusing, don't believe the hype",4,29 March 2020,"'Uncut Gems' seems to have been generally well received by audiences and critics alike but I'm struggling to understand its appeal. This is a frantic and breathless two and a quarter hours that left me feeling more confused and frustrated than entertained.The plot in 'Uncut Gems' is convoluted and it can be very difficult to follow exactly what is happening because it moves at such a relentless pace. Unless you are fully invested in the plot, which I wasn't, it's hard to care about what's happening anyway. The annoying soundtrack doesn't help and the constant shouting and just noise in general really started to grate on me.The only part of this film I enjoyed was Adam Sandler's performance. I know I'm in a minority here, but I like Sandler as an actor and it was nice to see him in a role that allowed him to really shine, even if I hated the film. He's a good actor and if there's anything I enjoyed about 'Uncut Gems' it was his fine performance.",Uncut Gems

He's married with there kids and on the verge of getting a divorce because he's cheating on his wife with the woman she's working with. Kevin the NBA player came and wanted to have the rock with diamond from Ethiopia and it worked miracles during the game. Howard'd also make money by giving people's belongings to a pawn shop like Kevin's ring which he took as a warrant for his invaluable rock. They got him naked and put in his trunk at the theater play in which his daughter has a role because he's unable to pay back his loans to Arno and his men. They got together with the family along with Arno at the Passover dinner. They met with the finder man to get back the rock at The Weeknd's concert. He didn't have the rock and his girlfriend was making out with The Weeknd at the bathroom. He finally got the ring back from the pawn shop and got the rock back to put it on the auction. Kevin joined the auction but his father in law bought it because he wanted so to rise the bets. He sold it to Kevin at his store and gave the money to his girlfriend secretly to make her go bet it all on the game. He then buzz in the first door the men and other demanders and locked them up between the two doors. They couldn't get out because the glass was bulletproof. He won more than a million while his girlfriend cashes it in and coming back. He let them out and the old man shot him in the head and they looted the store. Arno disagreed and they confronted and he shot him too. I liked the movie but at times it was too loud and I felt like I'm watching some bizarre cacophony although in real life people always talk over each other and make scenes all the time so it's realistic but a bit too overwhelming. The character Howard and everyone around him was very real-life people. His crumbling marriage, his relationship with the young women and him being so uninterested in his own children and their lives while trying to make things right financially and failing at the very moment he hit the jackpot made everything feel so real.",Uncut Gems
87,vithiet,Great highs and terrible lows.,6,23 June 2020,"With some rare exceptions, I loathe Adam Sandler's movies, and by extension I dislike him/his shtick. Thankfully this is a very different role he's playing; it's kind of like when funny people like Jim Carrey do serious roles and absolutely kill it, except Sandler is not funny. This movie came highly recommended by friends as a thrilling ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat. However, while that applies to a (too) few good moments in the movie (basically the second half), most of the time it's just a boring, noisy mess that's painful to watch. I think I understand the obnoxious score and editing was the desired outcome to convey a sense of the protagonist's life but it just didn't work in my opinion. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone.",Uncut Gems

He's plays with us - empathy, disgust and pity in the breakneck tale.Uncut Gems follows a downward spiral of self-made disaster. The plot is almost laughable. An arrogant belief that there's no situation he can't talk himself out of (or into) is the driver.The movie paints modern life as illusionary, where a busy life is a successful one and the gamble always pays off. It's an almost punishingly chaotic film, though each line of overlapping dialogue and jittery camera move is carefully orchestrated.

90,proud_luddite,"I should have disliked this movie. Instead, I thought it was terrific.",8,8 March 2020,"Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a New York jeweler and a gambling addict. After obtaining rare opal gems from an Ethiopian mine, his multiple attempts to profit from them bring more trouble to his life.Potentially, there are valid reasons to dislike this movie. Firstly, it is difficult to watch a main character go downhill with gambling addiction. Secondly, the main character is repulsive, duplicitous, despicable, profane, untrustworthy, adulterous, self-destructive, inconsiderate, and criminal. To borrow the language of the movie, the man is a total schmuck. So how can a movie overcome all of these setbacks?To begin with, there is the frenetic, lively energy greatly orchestrated by directors Josh and Benny Safdie. And in the anti-hero role, Sandler is animated, buoyant, and hilarious. Further, there is a thrilling climax with many surprises and twists to add further impact to this movie.So, the pluses of the movie do more than just make up for its minuses. They go even further and make ""Uncut Gems"" one of the most entertaining movies released in 2019. The tumultuous roller-coaster ride was worth the price of admission. - dbamateurcritic",Uncut Gems

92,blott2319-1,Tedious journey as an unpleasant person has unpleasant things happen to him,3,29 May 2020,"Uncut Gems has been highly-praised by many, and even though I had a sneaking suspicion I wouldn't enjoy the film, I gave it a chance since it's streaming on Netflix. First and foremost, this movie was headache-inducing. There are so many scenes where people are all yelling at once, and talking over each other, it drove me crazy. I was struggling to follow anything that was going on, or who any of the characters were because they wouldn't shut up for even 2 seconds so I could make out a single line of dialogue. Almost every scene in the jewelry store was like this, and I'd frequently take a break from the film after one of these scenes just to decompress from the overstimulation of that chaos. Once they took a little time and started establishing an actual plot, I was at least glad that there was something I could follow. That's not to say I enjoyed the plot, though, because this isn't the kind of story that does much for me. Also, it wasn't just the chaotic dialogue that made the plot confusing, but the series of deals that the main character gets involved in started to overlap so much that it became impossible to track how much money he owed and to how many different people.Therein lies the biggest problem I have with Uncut Gems. The entire plot structure is built around a guy who is entirely unlikeable (and fairly stupid) that constantly makes horrible decisions and digs himself into a deeper and deeper hole. The fact that he is so unpleasant sucks all tension and excitement from the film. It's obvious that the filmmakers want the audience to feel some type of stress as things come to a head in Uncut Gems, but I couldn't muster even an ounce of emotion since this is a guy who deserves to be beaten up or even killed. He cares about no one but himself, and hurts everyone around him. I've heard many say that Adam Sandler deserved some awards recognition for his performance in Uncut Gems, but I was struggling not to laugh as I kept hearing his other characters leak out in this performance. Sometimes he had a bit of Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore, and at one point I swear I heard The Waterboy and Opera Man coming out. There were many times that I was laughing during Uncut Gems, and I don't think they were intended to be comedic moments, particularly at the end. That conclusion was so fitting that I had a hearty laugh, and I almost turned a corner and thought it was a halfway decent film. Then I remembered all the things I hated before that and I don't think the end won me over enough. I can at least get a sense what others like about the movie, though.",Uncut Gems

This is the level of a ""really good and artistic, different from the comedies"" Adam Sandler movie?The story is fine, with elaborated and tied plot threads, but there is nothing about it besides that.

95,aciessi,24 Karat Gold,10,29 December 2019,"Josh and Benny Safdie. If you don't know their names already, you better start knowing them now. Their catalogue of films at this moment seem on paper to be typical of arthouse cinema, but are so kinetic, intense, gritty, rugged and down-to-earth that they transcend into pure crowd pleasing theater-going experiences. When people talk about their films, they get excited. If the rest of them are anything like Uncut Gems, they should be. 2019 has arguably been the best year for movies in more than a decade and I have a lot of favorites to choose from, but when I look back, Uncut Gems will stick straight out in my mind at the very top of my list. I knew as I left that this was an experience I'd never forget. A 2-hour coke-fueled, heart attack of a motion picture that leaves you horrified, confused and thrilled. Uncut Gems, simply put, is a street masterpiece.Adam Sandler is Howard Ratner. A New York City diamond merchant, and a putrid degenerate gambler. Immediately as we're introduced to him, he makes you incredibly uncomfortable. He's a man devoured by the prospect of winning big money. He's compromised his entire family life for sports betting and hookers. He's up to his eyeballs in debt, constantly being chased around by scumbag loan-sharks. He speaks a million miles per minute, preening in fake confidence, yet his facial expressions throughout scream of ""kill me now"". But Howard's luck makes a major turn around, so we think, when he receives a special delivery from Ethiopia. That being, a large, sparkling uncut opal worth no less than a million dollars. Howard has hit the jackpot. It just so happens that on the same day, NBA Superstar Kevin Garnett stops by the store to buy some rocks for the big game. Kevin sets his eye on the opal, and much to Howards chegrin, he wants to borrow it for good luck. Howard agrees, so long as Kevin allows him to borrow his championship ring in return. An exchange is made, and instead of leaving it alone from there, Howard pawns off the championship ring in order to pay the loan sharks his gambling debts.From there on out, it's a cluster bomb of chaos. Howard's degeneracy is on full display and seems never ending. You sit back in your chair and watch a man dig himself into a hole. Just when you think he's hit bottom, he continues digging himself even deeper. Howard keeps narrowly escaping bankruptcy and certain death, only to make another stupid bet, which ultimately screws him up even more than before. What's fascinating is how some people who've seen this film feel bad for Howard, as if he's just sick. God help me, I couldn't. He's an unlikeable moron and a terrible person. Does that make the film unwatchable? Hell no. The exact opposite. This is a descent into a morbid abyss that is exhilarating. I can sleep like a baby after having watched this. Whatever daily stress you have in your life, you can be sure it can't be as bad as a day in the life of Howard Ratner. Call it schadenfreude if you want. I call it a damn good movie.The direction at the hands of the Safdie Bros. is the key component of what makes Uncut Gems such an incredible watch. It has the nerve smashing intensity of Grand Theft Auto and the kinetic energy of a music video, with few winks to the cinematic structure and themes of 70's classics like Mean Streets and The Gambler. It all engrosses the audience into their world, as nasty as it can get, and boy is it nasty here. Not to mention, incredibly stressful. Think of Requiem for a Dream, and how it felt the first time you watched it. Uncut Gems has that same magic. The second component, not be forgotten, is Adam Sandler. Could it be his best role to date? Not sure, but I'm afraid Barry Egan has some serious competition. Once again, when Sandler takes a break from dumb-guy humor and hunkers down with a good script and a great character to explore, he is truly one of the finest actors out there. He's simply unstoppable as Howard. You can't keep your eyes off of him. You could certainly credit his comedic chops as to how well Sandler can play a psychopath. Be careful how badly you try running him down. Please, don't underestimate him.",Uncut Gems
96,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An artsy Adam Sandler film that was more annoying than thoughtful.,6,12 October 2021,"Much like The Lighthouse (2019), Uncut Gems (2019) was one of those films that gained a lot of buzz around the award season for the performances of their lead actors. However, neither of these films was nominated for Best Picture, and now I understand why. It's nice to see Sandler branch out from his standard comedy niche, but ultimately it didn't feel like he was ""acting"" that much by being a Jewish jeweler with a gambling problem since being Jewish is often a part of his schtick.I wanted to like this film more, but many things just annoyed me about it. I can understand the desire to create ""realism"" in the dialogue by having twenty people yell over each other. Still, it mostly just made it hard to understand anything that any individual said. It's the same reason I don't care for the films of John Cassavetes. On top of this, Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) had few redeeming qualities and was just kind of a scumbag throughout the whole film. Maybe if he had some amount of character growth, it would have been tolerable.All this being said, I can see the artistic appeal of Uncut Gems, even if it starts by showing the audience the known universe only to end up on the wrong side of a colonoscopy camera. Unfortunately, Uncut Gems also follows many of those ""artsy"" tropes that gain awards buzz but don't have much substance past their cultural zeitgeist. This includes (but is not limited to) its sudden and somewhat unsatisfying ending. In the end, I get why Uncut Gems has its fans, but it's just not for me.An artsy Adam Sandler film that was more annoying than thoughtful, I give Uncut Gems 3.0 stars out of 5.",Uncut Gems
97,RforFilm,Uncut Gems is tense and gritty look at gambling addiction that is without a doubt a masterpiece,10,15 January 2020,"I live near an Indian casino in California where it remains a top draw of the town, even on weekdays. There's something to be said for those who frequent casinos and gamble away on slot machines and cards. These are the people that want to strike it rich. That's no different then a lot of people, but the difference here is that these gambling addicts consistently either have a slow method that's effective or go with an ""all in"" method that's more dangerous. This is why I'm not much of a gambler; I would hate to go in at a high risk and lose everything.Today's movie focuses on a character who has such a gambling addiction, that it's taken over his personality and put himself in danger several times. These are the kind of guys that defend to the death that there is such a thing as luck and that certain mythical elements can change it. It could be a lucky rock or even a lucky pair of underwear, but it's all on the faith that everything will come out good. You could even call it another form of religion. That's certainly what I got out of Uncut Gems.In 2012, a scuzzy jeweler Howard (played by Adam Sandler) is at a crossroads as he tries to maintain his business, deal with his impending divorce from his wife Dinah (played by Idina Menzel), and pay off a huge $100,000 gambling debt he owes to a loan shark who also happens to be his brother-in-law. His luck might be finally changing as he receives a long awaited rock with diamonds from the black market of Ethiopia which he's relying on a large payout as he thinks it's worth over a million. But he also tries to maintain his relationships with his clients even if they don't see him in the same light.One day, a basketball player Kevin Garnett visits Howards store and is mystified by the stone. Garnett insists on holding onto the rock temporarily while buying a large amount of jewelry. Howard takes this as a sign of good luck, agrees, and bets a large sum of money on it. Not only does the deal fall through later on, but the rock isn't returned after the game. This put's Howard on a lot of pressure as his life is on the rock's line and is willing to go through even scummier people to get it back.If there's anything I can say about Uncut Gems, is that it's a really intense thriller I wouldn't have expected Adam Sandler a part of. Having seem him act well in Reign on Me, Funny People, and even Happy Gilmore, I had always hoped that Adam Sandler would find the right project to be a part of and this seems to be it. What works with Sandler is that he isn't the traditional Hollywood actor with the good looks. He's always been a draw because he's had more of a goofy everyman look that makes his character more desperate looking which ironically makes him the perfect actor to portray this character. Kudos to the production company for having confidence in this casting choice.Adding on to the great casting is a story about a desperate person who only digs their own grave deeper and deeper. From the start of the movie, you get a sense that this character is going make mistakes and only make worse ones. Part of it is driven by other characters, but much of it is on the flaws of Howard. In a way, you see why you might like this guy if you met up with him at a bar, but your also would never be sure to be on his side or even trust him.This movie was written and directed by the Safdie brothers who seem to have a passion for those really grainy grindhouse movies of the seventies. Uncut Gems has a similar look and tone that surrounds the movie is great atmosphere. New York, even modern New York can still look ugly from another perspective and this movie new how to capture that city's side.I'll give this ten uncut gem rocks out of ten. It may not be a pleasant movie to see, but it's one that's bound to keep you engaged the entire time as you'll be curious to see where everything is going to lead. Its definitely a favorite of 2019 (shame on the academy Awards for not giving this one more credit). Come for a tense ride and stay for an interesting character study on gambling.",Uncut Gems
98,bankofmarquis,Sandler deserves an Oscar Nomination,8,5 January 2020,"Adam Sandler deserves and Oscar nomination.I never thought I'd ever write that sentence, but after seeing his performance in the Safdie brothers film, UNCUT GEMS, I can make that statement with solid confidence.Following the constant hustle of NYC jewelry dealer (and degenerate gambler), Howard Ratner (Sandler), UNCUT GEMS is an unrelenting look at a person who is never satisfied with where he is - he's always looking for the next ""big score"".As portrayed by Sandler, Ratner is charming, charismatic, a BS artist of the highest order and quick with a joke and a scheme in every situation. This is a tour-de-force performance by Sandler who is in virtually every moment of this film. His character is ruthless and relentless - never giving up or losing energy - and it was the constant rat-a-tat-tat of this character/performance that caused great angst in me - as well as great appreciation for the fine performance I was witnessing.The film was written and directed by the Safdie Brothers (Benny and Josh) who are known in the Independent film world, but who are new to me. I was intrigued by the story, the world and the logistics of this film. It is a smart - and fast paced - film that doesn't try to ""dumb it down"" for the audience. I applaud them for their work here - and I look forward to what they do next.A performance like Sandler's is only good if he has good actors to play off of - and he does (in spades) here. From veteran actor Judd Hirsch, to Broadway Superstar Idina Menzel to the great (and underused, in my opinion) Eric Brogosian to the always watchable Lakeith Stanfield, Sandler was able to spar and parry with these performers at a breakneck pace that was intriguing, fascinating and hard to watch.But the biggest surprise (besides Sandler's dramatic acting chops) was the performance of NBA Superstar Kevin Garnett. Playing a fictionalized and younger (this film is set in 2011) version of himself, Garnett brought the same authority to the screen that he brought to the court.This is a VERY adult film (according to reports, this film has the 7th most ""F-Bombs"" of any film in history) with adult subjects and adult situations - all swirling around Sandler's character at a breakneck pace that will be simultaneously satisfying - and hard to watch. Are you watching a person spiraling out of control - or are you watching a very smart person weaving his way in and out of precarious situations?Watch UNCUT GEMS - and you be the judge.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Uncut Gems
99,Danusha_Goska,Obnoxious Character v Obnoxious Movie,2,12 January 2020,"Spoiler alert. This review reveals the end of ""Uncut Gems.""Someone needs to tell the Safdie Brothers, the writers, producers, and directors of ""Uncut Gems,"" that there is a difference between an obnoxious character and an obnoxious, unwatchable movie. Case in point: ""Death of a Salesman."" Arthur Miller's classic play depicts a man who, like Howard Ratner, is a desperate, unlikable loser, but the power of the play is that it makes you care about Willy Loman and see Willy Loman in people you know in real life. In ""Uncut Gems,"" you just want Howard Ratner to meet his inevitable end quicker so that your suffering can stop.""Uncut Gems"" is all about Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a greedy, scheming, shallow, disloyal, irrational gambling addict and gem merchant. He works in Manhattan's diamond district. The movie is loud with a nonstop, intrusive soundtrack that was devised by CIA torture experts.The film begins with a grisly scene in an African gem mine. Black bodies sweat, strain, and are injured. The camera lingers on an open wound. The movie is reminding us that Howard's profits are built on the suffering of the exploited poor. In the US, Howard sells his tacky baubles to African American clientele, including a basketball player.The movie switches to Howard's colonoscopy. Yes, you get to see the inside of Howard's colon as his doctor narrates. Does it enhance your viewing experience to see the inside of another man's intestines? Your tastes differ from mine.Once the movie gets started, you see Howard struck and humiliated by loan sharks. Eventually he is stripped naked and locked in the trunk of his car. His must call his estranged wife, who regards him with complete disdain, to rescue him. I guess watching all this would be satisfying to sadists.Eventually Howard's schemes result in his being shot to death. The end. You just spent two hours of your life watching a loud, obnoxious movie about a character you can't like, respect, or care about.Howard is a living embodiment of negative stereotypes of Jews as greedy shysters. Josh Safdie said in an interview with Slate, ""Howard is the long delineation of stereotypes that were forced onto us in the Middle Ages, when the church was created, when Jews were not counted toward population, and their only way in, their only way of accruing status as an individual, as a person who was considered a human being, was through material consumption. That was the only way in. And I think what's happened over the years is it's kind of morphed and almost turned into Kabuki theater. Because as assimilation has accrued, the foundation, the DNA of the strive has become kind of cartoonized in a weird way. What you're seeing in the film is a parable. What are the ill effects of overcompensation?""",Uncut Gems

101,Rob-O-Cop,Watching a melt down for entertainment,7,25 February 2020,"That was not a pleasant experience at all, a ring side seat watching a collection of the most horrible people you wish you didn't know about play out a dark and unpleasant trip to a world you suspect has elements of real world scenarios and people in it but you really don't want to have this in your head, but you can't look away.
You need a shower and some soothing music and soft lighting to cleanse this infected wound of a story from your eyes and mind afterwards, every detail of it goes toward the repulsive impact of it from the horrible music, to the real world celebrities playing themselves to the style and seedy underworld views it presents, that you want nothing to do with, but here we are feeding it into your head.
I really didn't enjoy watching this movie and it is worrying that this is where entertainment lies now, but I can acknowledge the sheer mastery of the end result.
Sandler is revoltingly magnificent in his portrayal of a self centered Asperger's level man on the comet tail of a breakdown, completely unaware of what he's playing with and his failings, but attacks it all with confidence. The character is at once hideous and compelling, complex and confusing. Sandler makes me believe he exists, and the taste in the mouth isn't pleasant.
The music was fantastic, and awful, leaving a depressing 70s vibe and aftertaste. It worked exceptionally well in creating an unpleasant mood of ominous tension. I hated it, and respected it.
The world view. Revolting. I sincerely hope I never see it in real life. Jewel merchants and gambling con men, hired thugs and seedy clubs, The ugliest America has to offer.
This was really a 9 for cinematic movie making and a 4 or less for enjoyable entertainment experience.
I needed heart medication afterward and I'm in good health. An unpleasant 2 and a half hour stay in the ugly side of humanity which will have you wondering why you inflicted it on yourself and admiring the artistry of the creation. Polarising to say the least",Uncut Gems

105,witster18,"You didn't give Deliverance 3 stars, did you?",9,12 November 2021,"Personally, I find the more a film affects my feelings and emotions, the better(no matter the emotion). From Tobe Hooper's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", to ""Free Solo"", or even ""August Osage County""; films aren't simply bad because they make you uncomfortable. One could argue; the more uncomfortable, the more effective. This is the case with Josh and Benny Safdie's ""Uncut Gems"".Adam Sandler's comedies are hit and miss for me. Some are genuinely funny, some are not, but ""Uncut Gems"" just edged-out P. T. Anderson's ""Punch Drunk Love"" as my favorite film from this seemingly unrecognized serious actor. The Academy's omission of any nomination (especially for Sandler) is inexcusable. The film currently parks-itself behind ""Parasite"" as the second best film I have seen from 2019(36 films through an 84-film watchlist).Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a Jewish Jewell Dealer mired in a world of debt, gambling, gangsters, and real-life Superstars. The casting is exceptional! Every single character makes the film more believable, and it needs it, because the world that Howard Ratner lives-in is so chaotic that it would crumble to pieces without it. Sandler pulls-off the monumental task of creating audience empathy, for a character who is morally bankrupt. We want this guy to find his way out of this relentless hurricane.The film never lets-off the gas. One might criticize the monotony and predictability of it all, if it weren't for some interesting family and gambling dynamics thrown into the mix. The film seems to be literally dropped into the climax of Ratner's life. There is so much that led to this crescendo, but still, the film manages to completely flesh-out it's characters. By the time it's all over, the viewer feels like they've been pulverized into diamond ash.The ending is thought provoking enough make you ask questions, and the artistic value is nearly flawless. This is as uncomfortable as I've been watching a film in many years, and for that reason alone, it is a success.9/10 for me.You Might Like this if you liked: Pi, Charlie Countryman, Mississippi Grind, Sorcerer, or Leaving Las Vegas.",Uncut Gems

The unlimited gratuitous use of the dreaded racist slang 3 to 4 time's in a sentence. And all the way through. It further infuriates by SANDLER making stupid decisions throughout the film that no human being would. Cheating on his wife constantly gambling when he's about to be killed for the debts he owes. At one point he gives a million dollar gemstone to a basketball player to keep for the night and then we spent 20mins watching him all over new York trying to get it back.

Ratner isn't your usual Sandler character. He is more of a Joe Pesci in a Scorsese film.Ratner falls into the unfortunate trap that befalls many gamblers, chasing their losses.Uncut Gems has menacing henchman who threaten Ratner like bailiffs in search of their court judgments.The film is successfully directed by Benny and Josh Safdie.

It's fast, unrelenting, and keeps you at your seat most of the movie.In Uncut Gems, we follow the life of Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) as he gets beaten down left and right hoping for his big payout. We see how his gambling addiction eats away at his professional and personal life. Who would have thought that Adam Sandler would be the one to deliver this performance so well.And when you think you get moments of peace where the intensity lets up? The Safdie brothers continue to pump up the pressure even more into an unrelenting crescendo.And I've only covered the plot and acting.Visually, this is a beautiful movie. Darius Khondji's use of color and shots gives us a different, otherworldly perspective. From the moment the opal is first held to the ending scenes, this movie is beautiful.And music? Ear freaking candy. From the get-go, Daniel Lopatin composes an unconventional soundtrack that shows this film is far different from its peers.

110,kjproulx,An Intense Roller-Coaster,10,15 September 2019,"It has been a fascinating ride watching the numerous ups and downs of Adam Sandler's career. From classic comedies like Happy Gilmore to great dramatic performances like Reign Over Me, he has proven time and time again that he is a very talented guy. The problem is that he has let himself fall out of the spotlight over the last ten years, simply due to the fact that he has been choosing some of the worst films of each year, on multiple occasions. In what might be the greatest performance he has ever given, Uncut Gems is his latest role that will be released this fall. After viewing this at the Toronto International Film Festival and giving it a little time to sink in, I can confidently say that this will end up being one of my favourite films of 2019 by year's end.Following a jewelry store owner in Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) as he gets his hands on a precious gemstone from Ethiopia, he decides to lend it to an NBA star in good faith. What sadly becomes apparent is the fact that he has many issues under the surface. Being a really shady figure and having a serious gambling addiction ends up giving this movie an insane amount of tension. This is a roller coaster ride of claustrophobia and I couldn't get enough of it.Directors Benny and Josh Safdie have been quietly building a solid little career for themselves. Having worked on very small indie projects like Heaven Knows What and then one of 2017s very best movies in Good Time, they're truly a duo that this industry needs. Their creativity always leaps off the screen in a way that feels very different from other filmmakers working today. This is a movie that heavily relies on pacing, editing, and performances. With a screenplay that requires nearly every performer to constantly be in motion or talking over one another, this movie barely gives you a second to catch a breath.By the time the third act begins, you'll probably wonder why you have been so invested in Sandler's portrayal of Howard because he's really not the best person. With that said, it's the fact that he is a terrible person deep down and is so greedy that is what made it so engaging and unnerving at times. With the use of periodic psychedelic imagery, a pulse-poundingly superb score, and a slew of uberly talented performers, Uncut Gems is a movie that states from the very beginning that it's a contender for the upcoming awards season.Overall, some viewers will absolutely wonder what the point of the movie was, due to the nature of how the final few minutes play out, but it was precisely these final moments that took me off guard and had me loving it even more. Personally, I feel that audiences have become impatient with films these days and anything over an hour and a half may seem like a chore to them if they're not completely on board, so that's why I would recommend this movie. It's not short, but the way this movie is put together makes it fly by. I believe this movie can be appreciated by many viewers. Uncut Gems is easily one of the years best films.",Uncut Gems

Kind of sums it up really. (Is it meant to make you sympathise with the guy?)I think what's happened is that every mediocre screenwriter who saw 'The Sopranos' has decided that since Tony Soprano was a bad man and everybody loved him, that people will love any character who's a bad man. The difference is that Tony Soprano was suffering from his badness (and Gandolfini could act). Everyone in this movie is a shallow stereotype - they might as well be cardboard cutouts.If you are epileptic, you should be aware that this movie contains flashing images.

120,MrDHWong,"An energetic, fast paced experience that makes good use of its main star",8,29 December 2019,"Uncut Gems is a crime thriller film directed and co-written by the Safdie Brothers (Good Time). Starring Adam Sandler in the lead role, it is an energetic, fast paced experience that makes good use of its main star.In New York City, Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) runs a jewellery store while constantly feeding his gambling addiction with even larger bets, resulting in him owing large sums of money to several people. After waiting almost two years, Howard receives a rare opal from an Ethiopian mining company, which he intends to have auctioned off for what he values at over a millions dollars. Eventually things become complicated as Howard ends up reluctantly lending the opal to a famous basketball player for good luck, all while dealing with loan sharks he cannot get rid of so easily.With its rapid-fire style of editing and solid performance from its lead actor, Uncut Gems breezes through its story of addiction and greed with often fun results. There was a great deal of suspense in almost every scene as Howard dodges loan sharks, gang members, and even his own extended family, just to satisfy his selfish gambling urges. A reminder that all of this is happening over a shiny rock imported from Ethiopia, a country where people are starving to death each day.This film features one of Adam Sandler's best non-comedic roles of his entire career. He delivers his dialogue with such fiery, serious intensity that I often forgot that this is the same actor who played the titular manchild in ""Billy Madison"". As previously seen in the 2002 film ""Punch-Drunk Love"", Sandler has proven he does indeed possess the dramatic chops needed to carry a film of this type. It's a shame we don't get to see him in films like this all too often, as he prefers to act in unfunny Netflix exclusives instead. Hopefully after this, he will reconsider his future prospects.Even if you aren't a fan of Adam Sandler, this film is still worth a watch for his performance alone. At this point in Sandler's career, the legacy he has left behind will put people off his work no matter what, but anybody still willing to give him a chance may be pleasantly surprised.I rate it 8/10",Uncut Gems

Adam Sandler proved himself once again as a true actor and it is a shame he doesnt get more roles like that. A shame that we get to see the actor Adam Sandler only every 5 years or so. This is surely his best performance and he deserves all awards attention he is getting for it. The film is generally very hectic and nervous, perfectly repressing the life and state of mind of its leading character. Sandler plays him so well and absolutely loses himself in that role. The Safdie brothers did a great job presenting us this world their protagonist is living in. Julia Fox also did a nice job, and is a very interesting new talent of which we will probably see more in the future. The score was truly amazing and captured the mood and atmosphere of the film perfectly. Its fantastic portrait of a truly ""f!ck up"" character, a character that has luck and misfortune on the same side and everything seems to break down on him within 24 hours.

Plus, every cameo and supporting performance seems custom built for this story.

126,elicopperman,Outstanding Portrayal of a Deranged Diamond Gambler,9,4 January 2020,"One of the most critically acclaimed movies of 2019 has to be the crime thriller Uncut Gems, directed by Josh and Bennie Safdie. Centered around a gambling jeweler who needs to retrieve an expensive gem to pay off his debts in New York City's Diamond District, the film took the sibling duo nearly ten years to get the green light, and all their films prior were actually made so they could prepare for a project this intense. It all seemed to pay off, as the film is not only gaining massive attention, but also Adam Sandler being the leading role (this could be the best performance of his career no less).Now with a crazy premise comes the crazy main protagonist Howard Ratner, played by Sandler, who really hones his skills bringing to life Ratner's anxious and rambunctious personality to make the viewing experience all the more chaotic. The sneaky and unethical persona of Ratner is what drives the whole feature, and despite him being a horrible human being with no proper care of the people around him, everything he ends up doing just to push the limits on his schemes makes the narrative all the more fascinating. His main drive for success is trying to boost up the price range of his possessed gem opal so he can finally pay off his debts, but given the hypnotic power from those gems, it really comes from a place of deranged madness, which does not help at all given the shady situation he gets in with the goons who need the money or else the consequences will be severe. I think the best way to compare the pacing and tone of the film are like a giant house made of cards waiting to collapse: you don't want it to fall down but you know exactly what's gonna happen nonetheless.Although set in a realistic environment, the filmmaking does wondrous accomplishments with its limitations, like shooting a lot of the shots up close to create uncomfortability and fast paced cuts to create paranoia. The cinematography also allows for some scenes to be presented in a colorful albeit somber approach which establish the mood very well given how frightening the character is. All the gleam and glamour in some scenes help contrast with the more mundane and gritty approach to the more serious stakes that affect Howard's life. In addition, while the movie is riddled with humor, it's a more dry and insane type of comedy that blends in well with the film's urban atmosphere. This adds in to the discomfort from the characters, as they're always needing to either escape, get into or out of things, or just get what they're looking for. Lastly, the way they incorporated the soundtrack with the audio presents a lot of impressive sound mixing and loud tension that creates as much anxiety as what Howard faces throughout.In the words of critic Sheila O'Malley, Uncut Gems is ""not a 'cautionary tale' about the dangers of gambling. It's more like a virtual-reality game where you step into Howard's experience."" Character studies are wonderful enough in their own right if done properly, but the added layers of insanity and impatience makes the film a truly thrilling experience that never seizes to run out of steam. If you prefer Sandler's filmography as only an actor or you're a Safdie brothers fan, then this should be worth a watch, as you don't often get these types of gems playing in the mainstream.",Uncut Gems

This movie is insane.Uncut Gems follows Howard Ratner, a New York jeweler addicted to betting. However when he gets his hands on a precious gem things begin to get crazy.I loved Good Time. The Safdie Brothers managed to make a really murky character study of a very flawed person and Uncut Gems is very much like that. This film is one of the most intense films I've seen in a long time. The Safdies know how to make a scene as intense as possible. A lot of the time during the movie characters constantly talk over each other as they try to get their point heard. Not only does this feel realistic but it makes the scene feel really stressful as you try to hear what everyone is saying. The continuous yelling and arguing amplifies the intensity to the point where it becomes anxiety-inducing.I've hated Adam Sandler as he's been consistenly churning out awful comedies but there was a part of me which believed he had the capability to be a good actor. Punch-Drunk Love being a prime example. Uncut Gems is another reason to prove that Adam Sandler can do wonders on screen if he has the right director and script. He is simply outstanding in this movie. I cannot envision another actor playing this role as he does such a good job here. It's sad he got snubbed by the Oscars as I believe he deserves a nomination for his work here. This is Julia Fox's first feature film and she stood out in every scene she was in. Even Kevin Garnett did a great job in his acting debut. All the actors did well and contributed massively to the film's impact due to their intense performances.What really kept me interested was the character of Howard. Much like Connie from Good Time, you learn more and more about the kind of person Howard is and whether or not you're meant to align with him. There are points in the film where you want him to succeed and there are parts where you don't want to support him at all. You'll feel so conflicted about the way he is which I think was a great choice by the Safdies and Bronstein as it locks your full attention on the movie. The whole film has a very edgy and uneasy feel to it due to the choice of colours and soundtrack. At no point do you get a sense of relief or freedom as the film traps you into its world and keeps you there till the end credits.I've seen Uncut Gems twice now and I feel it gets better the more I think about it. Its fast paced energy and distressing nature hooks me right from the beginning and leaves me breathing a sigh of relief. The Safdies have conquered this genre of film and are directors that are up and coming. This is Adam Sandler's best yet and I hope he continues to go for more dramatic roles. This is one of the best films of 2019 and I highly recommend it.",Uncut Gems

So it's with some trepidation that I'm watching this, having heard that it's actually very good. Is it good? Well yes I guess so, but it's also bloody irritating to watch, two hours of unfolding frustration as Sandler, a larger than life New York jeweller digs himself deeper and deeper in debt with people you don't want to be in debt with. It's like a slow motion car crash, you know it's going to end badly, there's no way out, just get it over with. It's exhausting too, every, single, scene is a cacophony of voices shouting over one another, the threats get more violent, the debt more out of control. It's almost unbearable. In fact it is, I struggled to get to the end. Yes it's clearly the best thing I've seen Sandler in, but it's so unhinged, I hated it, hated him, hated everyone in it... but, that's all intentional, so can you enjoy a film you hate? Surprisingly, yes I think you can.",Uncut Gems

Overall, Uncut Gems is a good cinematic achievement and is a one time watchable experience.",Uncut Gems
132,statuskuo,Despicable Flick,6,26 December 2019,"The Safdie Brothers came to my attention with the flick ""Good Time"" in a sweaty New York story that felt like a wet sock on a radiator in the middle of winter. At the end you feel you needed a very long hot shower. ""Uncut Gems"" follows the same world of Jewish gem dealer-hustler-degenerate gambler who thinks he can outplay everyone until he can't.
A lot has been said about Adam Sandler's performance of Howard Ratner. He will always be Adam Sandler. Sorry, can't look past his mugging and his voice. Though he isn't ""The Wedding Singer"" Sandler, he is, given the material, a subdued one. Is it worthy of award attention, yes, but he won't win Oscar. He'll get Independent awards or Spirit awards, but it's just too much of a purposeful dirtbag character he presses hard to achieve. And it shows.
Cinematically, it is very original. And should get the Safdie Brothers some recognition in terms of script. It's a world we see very little of and returns to a sweaty NYC that throws money around like it were just dirty paper. Little do we really get to know Howard Ratner. He seems to be, at times, king of his domain, while others slap him around like an intern. Which is it? And more perplexing are moments when Kevin Garnett's crew would most likely beat him to a pulp in any circumstance. Hard to tell. But, the other unfortunate thing is repeatable watch. It isn't. It's grotesque in the characters it surrounds itself with. This is a Safdie Bros. special. Most of the people are REALLY real looking people. Which I appreciate. This is closer to documentary than a narrative. As the dominos begin to fall, and you are given a moment to breathe...well, as I said about ""Good Time"" they absolutely refuse to let you feel good about people. And that is unfair and ugly.
Is that real life? Most likely. Is it meant for it getting into classic world? Absolutely not.
A special nod to Julia Fox who plays...um...Julia. She's luscious and has a voluptuous woman's body and fits perfectly in this world. She's a sex kitten in constant heat and you can practically smell her Drakkar Noir permeate every time she is on screen. A moral skank, if there ever was one.",Uncut Gems

It's tense, uncomfortable, thrilling, amusing, and it must be seen",9,8 January 2020,"Uncut Gems, like the propulsive engine of the film Howard Ratner, is relentless, frenetic, and fascinating to the inevitable end, and it's a masterclass in tone definition. It's a character study of a relentless businessman always trying to find a bigger angle, and Sandler is absolutely wonderful in the role. Nearly every scene in the movie centers on his actions, and he inspires a morbid fascination analogous to an overly ambitious high-wire acrobat: you know his reckless aggression is unsustainable, but he just keeps barreling ahead that you not only are fascinated but even compelled to hope it somehow works out, whether he deserves it or not. An interesting contrasting pairing with Uncut Gems would be The Hurt Locker. The two films are character studies of a man addicted to the thrill of risk, but the way they approach that risk and the settings they encounter it in couldn't be more different. Anytime something goes well for Howard, his immediate instinct is to push that success into the biggest possible payout. His immediate pawning of KG's ring is a great early demonstration of character, and his love for parlays fits in perfectly: rather than the safer play of making several independent bets, he makes the usually lower expected value but much higher reward play of parlaying, where either everything goes perfectly or he's screwed (an apt analogy for how he lives his life). While he's remorseless and never knows when to stop, the Safdies and Sandler provide such a consistent and committed portrait of this character that he manages to be redeemable in my eyes. I love Ad Astra, and Parasite is right there, but for my money Uncut Gems had the best cinematography of the year. The vibrant, electric, artificial colors set the nervous atmosphere for the movie perfectly, and particularly in Howard's gem shop the few cuts in favor of long tracking shots emphasize the precious nature of time in the store and Howard's overwhelming multitasking. The score is great in the same synthetic, frenetic way it was in Good Time. The ending felt right, as mirroring the rises and falls that came before it in an unceremonious and sudden fashion. The tension throughout the film created by the Safdies, Sandler's wonderful performance, and the great cinematography makes this one of the best of the year.",Uncut Gems

There really was not a particularly great story and the pitch of the acting was so amped up, that it became unbelievably annoying. Within 20 minutes of starting the film. I tried to watch this film in two sittings because I just couldn't get through the first sitting and the 2nd sitting was just as bad. I thought maybe it was my mood. Maybe I'm just not in the mood for this kind of over amped nonsense, but the second time it was the same thing.

146,ethanbresnett,A relentless anxiety inducing experience,9,8 March 2020,"It's rare that a film stresses me out as much as Uncut Gems did. The Safdie brothers did an excellent job of creating constant tension in delivering the tragic unravelling of Howard's life.Given all the hype surrounding it, it seems appropriate to start with the performance of the Sandman. It was very solid, heartfelt and believable, however given all of the hype I was perhaps expecting more. There wasn't as much light and dark to the performance as I would have hoped, with a slight tendency for his dialogue to become too shouty and aggressive. That being said I suppose this was reflective of the character so maybe I am being too harsh.The characters throughout were interesting, particularly Sandler's Howard. He was utterly deplorable as a person but was a great leading character for the film, always engaging throughout. The supporting characters held their own, particularly Kevin Garnett. I haven't seen too many former athletes take to the screen, but I'd imagine KG's performance would be up there. The dynamic between Howard and Julia was fun, and I found their relationship believable, more so than Howard and his wife.Thankfully to ease my anxiety the Safdie brothers introduced a fair amount of comic relief. Obviously we know Sandler can do comedy so there was no surprise that this paid off and added another element to the film.The direction from the Safdie's was also fantastic, building a strong and constant level of tension throughout. The close quarters set and close camera angles nurtured an atmosphere of unease and stress which oozed from every facet of the film.Uncut Gems is a tense experience, but one that everyone should indulge in. A thoroughly enjoyable film, Sandler at his best, and undeservingly snubbed by the Academy.",Uncut Gems

I REALLY wanted to like this, but the music was so annoying and loud for one (I know others complained about the music in Good Time, but I didn't mind it that much).Then it was like there was no script but just ""curb your enthusiasm"" styled situations for the actors to make it feel real, but the problem is even improv (which this felt like) can be bad as bad acting, essentially yelling at each other for 2 hours.They tried to copy their success from Good Time, but it just didn't work this time. It always amazes me how a filmmaker(s) can make a great film and then make a bad one right after.The structure of the script was also a mess. They just threw in a bunch of characters without much effort to establish a solid introduction with a background. Sandler just runs around ranting and raving and others are thrown in there for chaos.You want me to believe that Sandler just lends a huge diamond rock to a basketball player for a day? Really?And a lot of the violence felt fake. There was a little bit of that fakeness in Good Time in the prison fighting scene, but here it is so prominent with actors just screaming. It was just weird. Random scenes one after the other. I found Sandler annoying.The relationship between the characters was never really explained. Pattinson's character in Good Time was a total f..k up but ti worked because of his motivations to help out his brother and get a better life. They showed zero motivations for Sandler's character that had any depth that would gain any sympathy. Even though Good Time has random characters it worked because the central story was Pattison trying to get money for his brother's bail bond. Here, there was no reason for much of anything.It's like they slapped together a script in 2 hours. It was bizarre. Did I say Sandler was annoying?All of a sudden the door doesn't open? What? It was just ridiculous.HOLY CRAP this was annoyingly bad...",Uncut Gems
149,david-meldrum,"Addictive, Exhausting And Technically Brilliant",8,25 May 2020,"A thrilling, addictive, anxiety attack of a film made with a level of technical assurance and mastery that's rarely equalled - with Adam Sandler in a career redefining performance. The often overlapping dialogue is redolent of the increasingly confused and fractured state of the central character's psyche - maybe it's just my age, but you may well need the subtitles on to hear much of what's said. In many senses, it reminded me of Trainspotting - though not as good, and unlikely to be generation-defining in the way that film was. For me, its echoes of the Danny Boyle film were in the way it seems to be structured to echo the addict's trip - in Trainspotting it's the high of the chemically addicted, here it's gambling. It's also no coincidence that this takes place over Passover, and Sandler's character's Jewishness is often referenced. As if to ram the point home, one part of the Passover rituals we see is the recitation of the plagues on Egypt; the suggestion seems to be that Ratner (Sandler) is a man experiencing his own 12 plagues, a man with nothing at his centre having his glittering surface stripped away to reveal his empty core (I also wondered if he was an impure but otherwise Job-like figure, but that seems even more of a stretch). If we take the Passover reading of the film, the question that drives the narrative is if Ratner has daubed blood on the doorframe and fulfilled all ritual righteousness. It's a question only answered in the film's final moments. However you read it, you'll need something to decompress with afterwards.",Uncut Gems

Some of my other film loving friends call me out for it on occasion. They were afraid I would go into this with a skewed perspective, or a bias if you will, but they should give me more credit. I watch things with an open mind and heart (I think? But what do I know, really?)Getting through UNCUT GEMS is a lot like getting through the full cycle of an abusive relationship. That is, if you are someone with a sadistic sense of humor, as well as a subtle taste for masochism. At first it's just fun, then you start seeing the danger in it but you're still able to laugh about it, then it stops being fun and you just really, really, really need it to die.Adam Sandler kills it as Howie. I'm telling you, this character is legendary, and that's because he one of the biggest idiots of all time, living an abominable lifestyle. It's as if the ONLY thing he knows how to do is dig himself into a deeper hole. Where the realism in all of this hits the hardest is that on occasion you start to wonder, ""maybe Howie does know what he's doing after all. Does he?"". It's an epic gamble - but what's at risk as a viewer, is your sanity, or in my case, my wellness. By the last half hour of 2 hours and 15 minutes spent caught in the whirlwind of Howie's life, I was physically ill. I was full-on nauseous, sick to my stomach. Now, I watch A LOT of movies, and I love tense, anxiety-drenched films more than almost any other type, but this is the ONLY movie that has ever managed to make me physically nauseous. I guess I should be impressed by that.The rest of the cast was great. Julia Fox was fantastically believable as an opportunistic flooze. Lakeith Stanfield played a rather despicable character which was an impressive shift from his usual chilled out, highly likeable characters. Kevin Garnett was perfect for his part. Idina Menzel was amazing as Sandler's...wife, I think? It was awesome to see Eric Bogosian's big freaky eyes again. All the gnarly henchman and pawn shop dudes were ace. The notoriously in-your-face Safdie style of cinematography, pacing, and editing is there, and it's as effective as ever.Everything is extremely well executed. The only reason I can't give it a higher rating personally is because it's SUCH A UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE. And I realize that's the point. It's an effective piece. But, it's just so painful to watch. It's wild that Good Time was around 90 minutes long and it felt like it had a lot more breathing room and a bit more dynamics. This 135 minutes is a straight stranglehold of intended redundancy for many of you, it WILL BEAT YOUR BRAIN DOWN, just as it did with myself and each of the two gals I attended with.I guess you'll all have to see it to understand, huh?

St Adam Sandler.,9,4 February 2020,"In which Adam Sandler has his second 'role of a lifetime' - his first being his remarkable 2002 performance as Barry Egan, the lovestruck pursuant of Emily Watson's Lena Leonard, in Punch Drunk Love by Paul Thomas Anderson.It's the greatest rom-com ever made.That was the film that made me believe Adam Sandler was a truly great actor.And it's taken him 17 years to live up to his potential.But in Uncut Gems he does just that, prosthetic teeth and all.I first saw a Safdie Brothers movie just a few weeks ago in anticipation of this. Their Good Time, starring Robert Pattinson, is not a million miles away from Uncut Gems stylistically but this follow up is a step up.For a start it has Sandler; and Sandler is magnificent. Reminiscent of an X rated Clockwise in which John Cleese has everything in the world go wrong for him, this is just as agonising although much, much blacker.Sandler plays hustling New York Jeweller, Howard Ratner, as he lays off one disastrous deal against another. Buying favours, selling and pawning his clients' most treasured possessions to find the cash to pay off gambling debts, loans and other unexplained debts.It makes a Wonga debt look like chickenfeed.His big life saver though is an Ethiopian Opal that he has happened upon, how legally we do not know, but certainly it's morally dubious.The opal is essentially the titular character and its possession leads to all sorts of ups and downs as the MAGNIFICENT Sandler negotiates himself between each final throw of the dice in his financial life, his business life, his sex life and his home life.it's an omnishambles of stupendous proportions. You couldn't make it up. Except the Safries do.Their style is hand held, oversaturated, jerky camera work conjoined with overdubbed, multilayered dialogue that is often so dense you can barely make out a word. The soundtrack is corn-tastic 70's lift music /musak/ blaxploitation/ C Movie - it's both breathtaking and gripping, despite its mix of unlistenable-ness and sheer beauty.But this is all about shouty, sweaty, exhausting, heart-attack imbuing Sandler. What a role - allegedly it took years to convince him to play it and, without him, the Safdie's were going to shelve the project.Scorsese is an Executive Director and there are strong sniffs of Mean Streets and Taxi Driver in this.All the better.Bring it on I say.The Safdies are a glorious new talent; Sandler an under appreciated titan of the cinema.This is his legacy and he should have won an Oscar for it.Wonderful.(My wife hated it.

Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a New York jeweller who is on an exhausting pursuit of being hugely successful and winning big. He's massively in debt and what follows is a long string of bad occurrences that leave his family and professional life dysfunctional. Josh and Benny Safdie made a highly impressive debut feature in Good Time starring Robert Pattinson and Benny himself as two brothers attempting to escape New York's underworld after a bank robbery gone wrong. What they have proven is an beautiful talent in creating a whirlwind of anxiety and desperation through their characters on screen that they create a wonderfully hyperactive and frantic atmosphere. Uncut Gems is a continuation of that cinematic legacy and is absolutely worth your attention. It's probably Sandler's best dramatic performance yet and he completely commands the screen even while portraying a slimy character. The soundtrack is sublimely great and the visuals are hypnotic made especially aware in the opening and closing sequences. You're completely sucked into Howard's world and no matter how many more bad decisions or behaviour he may indulge in, we're along for the ride and strangely can't help but feel for him occasionally when his whole world is collapsing around him; even if it is his own fault! It's a soul crushing feeling whenever he does make a bad decision; for example, he's an addicted gambler and just when there's a shining light and it looks like he's going to win, he has to go and make another bigger bet whether it's financially or otherwise.

Movies starring Adam Sandler were never my cup of tea. I have watched ""Blended"" and one of his most famous hit ""Click"", but I never appreciated his acting skills. So I wanted to see how he managed with a dramatic role, and I have to say that he did a decent job. He portrays the owner of a small pawn shop full of gambling debts that is trying to pay, in his own way. He is very nervous, with no patience and for the whole movie he screams and shouts, he never really have a normal conversation for the whole duration, and this honestly annoyed me a little bit, but I understand that is part of the character personality and maybe they should have write a little bit better some scenes.The movie is full of tension, and has a little space for breathing, I felt constantly stressed out because of many issues that the main character had. He doesn't have a normal life and he cannot leave one single part of his existence in peace. They should have create more scenes that slows down a little bit the tension, giving the time to the audience to process what is happening on screen. Too much is happening, in a short span of time and it is easy to lose yourself between all the different events. Considering also that the movie is more than 2 hours long, you get to a point that you get really annoyed. Some scenes are dragged, and they actually lose the original purpose of creating tension and climax.I really liked photography and even if the interpretation could have been a little bit better, I enjoyed to see Adam Sandler out from his comfort zone. The story is well written and character for the most part are good. Plus we get a short cameo of The Weeknd.",Uncut Gems
160,DeBBss,An Anxiety Fest,8,9 May 2020,"I've never liked Adam Sandler's movies or the characters he played, as the ""comedy"" in his movies are just plain stupid. For some reason Adam Sandler never acts in dramas which is upsetting because he can act as Uncut Gems shows his potential in the drama genre. Adam Sandler limits himself with these poorly written comedies which taints his career, I just hope he moves his career in a different direction.Uncut Gems' plot is about Howard Ratner, and how everything he does just falls flat as he tries to pay back debts. The plot alone is simple, but the pacing just sells it. The Safdie brothers are masters when it comes to creating a movie that is filled with anxiety. The way they pace their movies creates a persistent atmosphere that makes it feel like a nightmare. I respect the writers so much, as I know it's difficult to create such a nightmarish pacing style.Adam Sandler's acting affects the atmosphere of the movie too, as it's so realistic. Howard Ratner tries to stay calm with his dialogue, but his body language and voice is just filled with anxiety, and it really affects the viewers experience, as you feel like Howard Ratner. The acting in general is flawless, every character is supposed to revolve around Howard Ratner and the atmosphere and pacing really compliments it. I'm impressed with Julia Fox, with her limited acting career, but she nailed it with the delivery of the lines.The Safdie brothers are known for using their unique filming style with the extremely close up cinematography. This creates an uncertain and anxious mood throughout the film. This was slightly done in Good Time, but in Uncut Gems, it's done to the max. The lighting made Uncut Gems feel like a blur, and with the cinematography, it forces you to take a break.I'm a huge fan of the Safdie brothers, and Uncut Gems is really going to boost their careers' if Good Time didn't already. Uncut Gems is a movie that will drive you insane with how persistent it is with the anxiety. You definitely need to take some deep breathes before watching, and a remote to pause every now and then.",Uncut Gems

162,x_manicure_x,Give me a break!,8,14 August 2021,"Who would have thought the day would come where Adam Sandler is in a good movie? And even kills it?""Uncut Gems"" is an excellent example of mainstream cinema that can be original and engaging without getting too pretentious or emptily philosophic.Howard Ratner is a Jewish jeweler and gambling addict, one of those men who keep pushing their luck and are the source of their own suffering. He always makes the wrong choice, is never happy with what he gets, whatever comes out of his mouth is extremely annoying, yet the Safdie brothers manage to make us understand and feel for him somehow. We hate everything he does but still wish him to succeed.Howard's chaotic and frenetic lifestyle is reflected by the energetic pacing and partly rough cinematography. We hardly get time to breathe in between scenes, and everyone keeps yelling and talking over one another. It's overwhelming at first, but at the same time, incredibly engaging. The trippy, bad taste music contributes to making everything feel even more stressful as Howard keeps walking the tightrope.It loses some of its punch on a second viewing, but is by far one of the most entertaining films I got to watch in a while.",Uncut Gems
163,thebricks,They chose this to show in theaters instead of 1917? Really?,1,25 December 2019,"Terrible movie that continues to prove my theory that Adam Sandler is forever stuck in the nineties. I haven't seen terrible film-making like this since that decade. The whole movie feels like something that is stream of consciousness, going from one scene to the next, always with some annoying song playing. It feels like some old school of thought of film-making that a song always needs to be playing during a scene, no matter what. It's grating and annoying.Sandler's character is absolutely unsympathetic. He has a wildly successful high-end jewelry business but can't stop sports gambling. I admit, I like to gamble myself, but I see nothing appealing about sports betting. The only way to win is if you have inside information. Otherwise, it's beyond stupid. The house really always wins.I just didn't care for the film. All the praise is very suspect, especially about Kevin Garnett's performance. All Garnett does is play himself and yell in the jewelry store. That's it. He really should stick to sports, acting ain't for him.This is probably one of the worst movies I've seen all year. Nice try Adam.",Uncut Gems

165,Brooklynsmagicmike,Great acting and great cast but nonetheless I diddn't enjoy this movie.,4,13 July 2020,I'm a big Adam Sandler fan and I enjoy alot of his movies even the none comedic ones hes done. This movie received an intense amount of praise and I therefore was pretty excited to see it. But no matter how hard I tried to really get into this film I just couldn't.The premise was alright but nothing special. I found this movie also to be incredibly slow and overly long. When the soundtrack would play it was way to loud and took over the volume of the movie. When it wasn't I'd get headache because of the amount of yelling and non-stop curse words.Wasnt very enthralled by any of the characters either. The only reason I even gave 4 stars instead 1 had to do with the ending. Which I did find kind of sad to be honest. Overall I personally wouldn't recommend it but maybe its just because it wasn't my cup of tea.,Uncut Gems

However, I watched this hoping Adam Sandler could pull it off, and he just fell flat on his face! Even if he could, the story is written so horribly, it doesn't adhere to one genre, and it's just confusing with how much he owes who(if you follow what he says he owes, he should be plaid off, ) and all the peripherals are annoying and unnecessary, like the fakes being sold in the shop, the thing with getting the opal back. I think the story would have been enriched by far had they spent more time talking about what goes on in the shop! It was a hot mess... high on the snooze scale.",Uncut Gems

169,ritera1,Very loud but very int'resting,8,29 January 2020,"Wasn't annoying.Even though there was no ebb and flow to Sandler's character, I was very attentive to the realistic conflicts and conditions. The cast of first timers were a visual grabber from the mobsters, the pawn shop guys, guys trying to collect on their debts, to the 'copter pilot, etc. They very much had the feel of very good improv.Except running from the bad guys in the parking lot, I really didn't seem to think that Sandler's character was in fear. That was just a part of doing business. Hard to think that he had a gambling problem if he won so big the first and second time. Would have liked more figures he was in debt for that would have heightened the peril. And some history of him losing at gambling and how much that was.There were nuances in the basketball betting and subsequent games that were hard to follow. I'm not a sports guy.Very puzzled by Sandler's character insisting that the opal was worth a million vs. what it went for. The character was very good at what he did and wouldn't have been that wrong. And loaning it to Kevin Garnett (who was also very good) was manufactured but needed to launch the peril.I'd be curious how Sandler approached this. Being that there wasn't any real dimension to the guy, I would assume that he was just imitating a very annoying person he knew but it worked out far better than expected.Not sure if it was the intent, but I came away from it with a strong impression that it was portraying the most agitating of Jewish cliches and some black cliches with no counters to them. Odd as I know the directors/brothers are also Jewish. Really didn't make the family life and those people appealing or likeable. (Don't you Trumpers start feeling a kinship with my observation.)Had seen the directors' previous film Good Times. The actual shooting looked very rough (like this one) and was very self-indulgent but worked when it shouldn't have. Has a very 70s/80s feel to it. And the soundtrack was Tangerine Dream leftovers? But both films very much a wealth of opportunities for actors.I'd like to see more from them.",Uncut Gems

172,williampsamuel,A True Diamond in Rough,9,4 January 2020,"An Oscar Worthy performance from Adam Sandler. The very idea seems utterly ludicrous, like a kind, caring Nazi, or Trump and Hillary having a friendly dinner together. If you had told me a year ago that there would be serious awards show buzz around Adam freaking Sandler, I would have told you that you were out of your damned mind. And yet this is exactly what Uncut Gems delivers.The performance in question is Sandler's portrayal of high-strung, freewheeling Jewish jewelry dealer Howard Ratner. By all reasoning Howard should be on top of the world. He runs one of the most exclusive jewelry stores in New York, selling bling to rappers and pro athletes. He's got a fancy house on Long Island with a beautiful wife and three kids, plus a swanky apartment with an even prettier young mistress. And he's right on the brink of the biggest deal of his career; auctioning a rock full of uncut Ethiopian black opals. Life should be good.Except that none of his employees or business partners can stand him, his wife is filing for divorce, and he's up to his ears in gambling debts that are long past due and he can't pay off. Which is why all of his hopes and dreams are riding on this set of opals. Which makes it all the more inexplicable that he chooses to loan it out to Celtics power forward Kevin Garnett- who promptly drops off the radar, leaving Howard to desperately search for his gems while fending off loan sharks and juggling irate family members, impatient clients, and all the other drama in his life. The result is a frantic, chaotic, frequently nail-biting, sometimes claustrophobic, but always fascinating mashup of a movie.Now it's no wonder that almost no-one in Howard's life can stand him. He is so abrasive; so loud and shrill and short tempered. He has no filter, no chill, no good judgement. He just can't stop mouthing off, getting people's faces, pushing away and pissing off everyone around him. And above all, no matter how deeply in debt he is, he just cannot stop making bets with other people's money. He's hurtling to his doom, pushing pedal to the metal the whole time, and he's the only one who can't see it.Sandler plays all of this perfectly. He makes Howard utterly pathetic yet deeply sympathetic, unlikeable yet somehow endearing, and always relatable. And yes, as with most of Sandler's roles, he can be very annoying. But this time he's annoying on purpose, and in all the right ways. Watching the utter mess that is his life playing out, you find yourself rooting for him in spite of yourself. You desperately want for his luck to turn around, and for him to break free of his self-destructive cycle, even as you know deep down that it will never happen.I deeply hope that this marks the beginning of a new chapter in Sandler's career. I pray that we will see him in more productions like this. This movie is proof positive that given the right material and a serious director who won't let him phone it in or pull any of his usual BS, Adam Sandler can do brilliant work, so here's to more of it.It really is amazing that a movie about such a BS spewing phony can be so authentic. Harold is living in an utter fantasy world of his own making, yet every minute of this movie is so raw and unfiltered. The cutthroat world of the diamond trade, the sleazy, drug fueled club scene, the bookies, loan sharks, and collections men, even the human cost of the mining industry are all shown in unflinching detail. It can be hard to watch, but boy is it ever real.That's not to say that parts of this movie aren't incredibly stylized. This is a movie that knows how to do montages and quick cuts, showing us dazzling gems from every possible angle. The nightclub scenes are a swirling, vertigo inducing kaleidoscope of light and sound, and the opening sequence of the camera zooming in ever closer on the opal is like a cross between a motion simulator ride and an acid trip.As much as Sandler's performance, it's suspense that drives this production, and oh how the Safdie brothers know how to pile it on. The entire movie is laced with increasing tension as time runs ever shorter for Howard to find his opal, and the threats from the collection men get more frequent and less veiled. Then the final act ratchets it up to pure, edge of your seat suspense- and turns Uncut Gems into a full-on sports movie.And that's where things really get brilliant. Every play, every basket will have you on the edge of your seat. With so much riding on the outcome, you'll be invested in every moment of gameplay, which is all the better for being actual NBA game footage. And my goodness, this ending. I thought that after everything I'd seen so far, nothing would shock me, but man was I wrong. When it comes, it feels inevitable and yet truly surprising, which is no mean feat.This movie is a huge achievement, both for Sandler and the Safdie brothers. It's not a movie for the squeamish or easily offended. It isn't always pleasant or even comfortable to watch. But it is absolutely spellbinding and brilliant on so many levels. It's one of the year's best movies, and hopefully a sign of things to come.",Uncut Gems

The tension is unbearable at times, and I say this in a positive way of course, meaning the movie achieved it's primary intentions, as I see it. The ending was a bit surprising, or I rather say, it came fast like a storm, but yet, it deserves all of its praise and I think that it should have been listed at the Oscars.",Uncut Gems

People are either going to love it or hate it (same goes for Good Time). Uncut Gems (as well Good Time) is a masterpiece of anxiety and utter chaos in a fast paced-real time-high stakes-panic attack-wonder wheel of excitement and pleasurable pain.With Both Uncut Gems and Good Time, The Safdie Brothers write about down and out low life's who you find yourself rooting for. The directors truly show how money is a root to evil. Uncut Gems is one of Adam Sandler's top five best performances. Kevin G is fantastic and the new Julia Fox is amazing and absolutely stunning!A must see! I can't wait to see what The Safdie Brothers do next. And I have to point out their Cinematographer,Darius Khondji is brillliant with 3 L's!! Just as Brilliant as Sean Price Williams was on Good Time! The Safdie Brothers should stay with Darius Khondji or Sean Price Williams. They're both amazing.My only disappointment was that Benny Safdie wasn't in this film.

187,TheVictoriousV,Escalatingly intense; pure Safdie madness,9,17 December 2019,"Adam Sandler is a blessing in a very, very good disguise. We know him for his lower-than-low-brow comedy dreck and super funny lisping, forgetting that a gifted dramatic actor hides behind the clown face (don't be fooled by the fact that his latest film starts with a colonoscopy, which at first glance feels very Sandler indeed).He was given a chance at reinventing himself as an ""actor for grown-ups"" with Punch-Drunk Love, I suppose, but that was still a take on his familiar idiot-character (albeit a much better, more sympathetic, and more three-dimensional take) and he still found his way back to Happy Madison potty humor. After the Safdie brothers' Uncut Gems, however, he might just get to play with the big boys full-time and even score his first Oscar.This is the latest stress-inducing and highly immersive crime thriller from the fellas behind Good Time (one of my favorite films of 2017, although a retroactive addition to my 2017 listicle). Just as Good Time proved that R-Patz can act superbly, although his performance in Twilight insisted on quite the contrary, the Safdie brothers want us to reconsider Sandler next.The year is 2012. Howard Ratner (Sandler) is a Jewish Diamond District jeweler struggling to pay off gambling debts to his loan shark brother-in-law (Eric Bogosian), and his addiction worsens the situation at several points in the film. There are many twists, turns, and gruesome backfirings that never make the 2 and a half-hour film feel boring even once. Howard's decisions are at points irrational, but it works within the story as his incessant addiction problems are so believable - and, dare I say, relevant.Much of the story revolves around an Ethiopian gemstone that Howard lends to NBA player Kevin Garnett, played by himself, but we're also made to understand Howard's domestic situation. He is not yet fully divorced from his wife (Idina Menzel) but nonetheless dates a much younger woman (Julia Fox), which he's about as transparent with as his shady history with the brother-in-law. The latter woman also knows The Weeknd, played also by himself, who she thinks is gonna be really big one day.But back to Howard, who is scarcely the year's most loveable character. Mind you, this isn't a flaw of the film, which never expects us to love him anyway, when it succeeds at something paramount: creating a wholly believable human being and making us forget that he is a performer reading scripted lines. Every location in the film feels similarly real, with endlessly chattering side characters who never come off as obvious extras or supporting actors. Still, we know who the real star is here.This may be Adam Sandler's all-time finest performance and he perfectly communicates the anxiety and chaos of the Safdie brothers' crime-thriller style. Adding to that distinct ""Safdie brothers"" personality is a constant ""closeness"" to the messy world we've entered (thanks to the often intimate photography), an avant-garde electronic score by Oneohtrix Point Never, and kaleidoscopic visuals made all the more gleaming from being shot on 33-millimeter film. The prismatic colors may be thematically appropriate; think of how light refracts through a gemstone. Even the fashion and set designers are being extra immaculate with the color schemes here.Finally, much like Good Time, this is one of the most thoroughly unpredictable and original additions to the yearly catalog. The Safdies seem experts at having things go from bad to worse in stressful but riveting ways. I already want to see their next film! Let's see which other actors they'll rescue from being eternally lumped in with the shlockbusters. If one can go from Little Nicky to this, much is possible.",Uncut Gems

190,quaseprovisorio,"exhausting frenetic, sweating and very well crafted",8,5 April 2020,"I wonder why my grade isn't bigger than this. Probably because i'm tired and the movie doesn't allow you to breathe even when you only have 2 characters in a scene inside a room - sometimes i need that space in order to build tension. this movie does built it, but the tension is pretty high right at the beggining of it. It's the first safdie brothers film i watch and i guess the rest of their work is not very derivative from this.sandler's character is really well crafted, like some of the characters around them - even though most of them are pawns that gravitate towards him. The movie is an insane run that doesn't let you breathe for a second - a lot of people won't see it because of that. because there's one thing that this movie does really well - it presents the characters while they're in action and it doesn't try to explain everything. You will know as you watch it. they won't give ""inception architects"" in order to someone explain the movie to them. that's what i liked the most, was how the script was crafted.really good cinematography and the direction is very solid. adam sandler does an excellent job - to the point you don't see anyone else doing this part. no, really - i can't se any actor out there that could do this better than sandler. Sandler his an histerycal actor even in the bad movies he does. he never stops to the point where he's just annoying. On this one it is asked for the actor to be completely histerycal, with high blood pressure with no stoppings, always on the run, doing bad decisions after bad decisions, always thinking all it will be well - savage capitalism is pretty much this ain't it? crisis of 2008 was a gamble after all. that's the core of this movie. sandler is a good actor when he wants to be, and i'm glad the brothers were able to gather enough money to get the perfect actor for this. It's a tour de force and it's probably the best acting job of the year - i didn't see the joker yet but highly doubt it reaches this excellence.so yeah this is a movie about an addicted guy that can't stop, because he always thinks he can do better. he lives in a forged reality where the problems will be past if he runs faster. this movie is about one guy that can't stop to breathe for a second and realize all the bad movements he did. it compensates but you need to be patient for the rewards. a lot of people aren't that patient. i really liked it, even though i don't think it's a masterpiece - i need to understand why still, maybe in the future i'll upgrade the stars.""uncut gems"" has the potential to become a movie classic. let's see what the future holds for it.",Uncut Gems
191,harrylosborne,If white noise was a film,6,12 February 2020,"People won't stop talking about how amazing Uncut Gems is, how amazing Adam Sandler is, and how amazing diamond-encrusted Furbys are. Really, this is 2 hours of light and noise to give you a headache if nothing else, and I didn't see a lot else to impress beneath that.Howard Ratner (Sandler) is the loudest jeweller on the planet, trying to juggle elite clients, gambling debts and his family whilst auctioning off the biggest gem he's ever owned. It's a clenched-fist sort of film: nobody ever keeps their word, everyone is trying to undercut one another, and people avoid questions like they are running for political leadership. I wouldn't describe this as a fun watch, but it does pick up speed as the storyline develops.I began to zone out during the first half of Uncut Gems - it was people talking over one another constantly, which gets tiresome very quickly. Yes, Sandler is better than he has been for a few years, but that isn't saying much when you were best known for Grown Ups. The end is exciting and does actually live up to the pace of the film, but I don't see this as rectifying the pain you have to endure for the first 90 minutes.A24 cannot stop pumping out these ""indie-hit"" films that critics pore over, but from what I'm seeing there isn't a lot to be impressed with. This was probably one of the better films from the studio I've seen, and the Safdie Brothers can take some credit for that too. Uncut Gems is novel is nothing else - but there were no Oscar snubs here.",Uncut Gems
192,Bertaut,"Watching a guy screw up for two frantic hours may not sound very compelling, but this is a fine piece of work",8,25 January 2020,"Written by Ronald Bronstein, Josh Safdie, and Benny Safdie, and directed by the Safdies, Uncut Gems is essentially two hours and fifteen minutes of watching a guy screw up in increasingly spectacular and catastrophic ways. It's a film where you know from the first ten minutes that sooner or later, he won't be able to worm his way out of one of his mistakes, and at that point, his seemingly unshakable optimism and belief in his own delusions will prove ill-equipped to deal with the reckoning. So from the first act, you're on edge, and you remain there for the duration. It's a film that never stops moving at the chaotic breakneck speed with which it begins, a film possessed of energy nearly queasy in nature. It has also been made with such craft, the mise en scène is so good, the dialogue so sharp, and the acting so intense, that you may as well be watching a fly-on-the-wall documentary. It's a film made of pure sweat and anxiety, and I'd highly recommend it.New York, 2012. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a charismatic jeweller who lives his life on the principle of robbing Peter to pay Paul. A serious gambling addict, he always has at least one hustle going, and he always owes somebody something. Soon after we meet him, it's revealed that he's currently in debt to his loan-shark brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian) to the tune of $100,000. Meanwhile, his jewellery business is doing well, not the least reason for which is his colleague Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), who helps bring in high-profile clients. The latest example of such is Boston Celtics' basketballer Kevin Garnett (a surprisingly strong performance by Garnett himself). As Garnett is browsing the store, it's revealed that Howard has smuggled an ultra-rare black opal of extraordinary translucence into the country for an auction the following day, where he expects it will sell for up to $1 million. However, when Garnett sees the stone, he insists he is allowed to have it as a lucky charm, just for the match he's playing that night. Howard is reluctant but agrees to part with it when Garnett offers to leave his All-Star ring as collateral (which Howard immediately pawns for money to place a bet on Garnett's game). And, predictably, things quickly go awry.Howard is a delusional and doomed figure who's very much the product of late capitalism; a man who genuinely believes, despite past experience to the contrary, that his big score is right around the next corner. In this respect, the film is a deconstruction of the concomitant globalised alienation; a system capable of drawing into a single self-delusional orbit such varied parties as exploited Ethiopian manual labourers, small business owners in New York, under-pressure athletes, loan-sharks, and bookies - all operating with the unshakable belief that a huge win is just within their grasp. Howard, of course, is the worst example, and is essentially a fantasist who's utterly divorced from reality, a man who believes completely that if people would get out of his way and let him turn that fabled corner, all of his worries will disappear. It's the gambling addict's fallacy - no matter how much or how often you lose, the next bet will be the big winner. The problem Howard faces is that he has made promises based on that fallacy - he owes money which he can only pay if his latest scheme works out exactly as intended; such is the precarious house of cards that is his life.In this sense, the film is an especially astute study of addiction, although this theme is never foregrounded - no one accuses Howard of being a gambling addict, and he certainly doesn't seem to think of himself as one. This is not a cautionary tale. However, if you're paying even the slightest bit of attention, you can't help but see just how hopelessly consumed Howard is by his addiction (never once does he give the impression that he wants to stop gambling). It has wormed its way into every facet of his life, to the point where it has become his life, or certainly a hugely important part of that life. This is why delusion is such a major component in his psychological make-up - addiction and delusion form an ever-tightening feedback loop that becomes more difficult from which to escape, the more self-sustaining they become.In terms of aesthetics, it's worth noting that two of the three writers (Bronstein and Benny Safdie) are also credited as the editors, and this is crucial insofar as the frenetic pace of the narrative isn't achieved only by the cutting, but by the script as well - this is a film written by people with at least one eye on the editing rhythms. The first scenes in New York, for example, immediately establish the chaotic energy - Howard speaking rapidly into his mobile, dialogue overlapping almost unintelligibly as multiple characters interact and talk over one another, at least three things always happening, each one of which would occupy our complete attention in a more conventional film. Here, it's almost like everything is a background to everything else, with nothing ever given a sustained sole focus. The opening scenes establish the pace as blistering, and that never really changes. It's the kind of film where there's perpetual propulsive momentum - because the characters never stop moving, neither does the story, even if the characters never actually manage to get anywhere. The score, by Daniel Lopatin, is also excellent. Obviously inspired by Tangerine Dream's electronic scores for Michael Mann's early films, most notably Thief (1981), it's a crucial element of the film, adding to the overlapping cacophony of sounds and enhancing the general sense of twitchy chaos.As for the acting, everything you've heard about Sandler is true; he's incredible. Sure, he's playing the same kind of volatile delusional loser that he's played in a million-and-one subpar comedies. But it's the tone of the performance, the key in which he plays Howard that makes it stand out. You could make the argument that Howard is simply Sandler dialled up to 11, and you wouldn't be wrong, but the inherent tragedy of the man, his self-delusion, his seemingly unquenchable optimism and belief in himself - Sandler draws these elements out every second he's on-screen, finding pathos in virtually everything he does. Elsewhere, Bogosian is his usual stoically intimidating self; as Howard's wife Dinah, who has grown to loathe her husband, Idina Menzel manages some of the most withering looks ever captured on film; and as Howard's naive but sweet mistress Julia, debutant Julia Fox imbues what could have been a clichéd bimbo-type role with real emotional nuance.As for problems, the pace of the film will certainly put some people off. There are no down-moments here, no scenes designed to let the audience breath. This is as anxiety-inducing a film as you're likely to see, and that simply won't be to everyone's taste. Partly because of this, the tone never really varies. There are some comic beats (Howard getting dumped naked into a car trunk during his daughter's school play is particularly funny), but by and large, the tone is perpetually dark, ominous, and exhausting. Which, again, won't be for everyone. And there will, of course, be people who just can't get past the presence of Adam Sandler, which I can understand. Personally though, I loved Uncut Gems. It's certainly not the subtlest of films, nor the most thematically complex, but as character studies go, this is exceptionally good work from everyone involved and a genuinely unique piece of cinema.",Uncut Gems
193,MrPupkin,"Adam Sandler doing the absolute best work of his career. Really, truly when given the challenge, he more than rises to it.",8,2 February 2020,"Uncut Gems is like having a panic attack. It's frantic, unpredictable, exhausting, anxious, paranoid, visceral, and I still don't know if I can say I actually enjoyed the actual movie. I can admire it and its effectiveness at putting the viewer in the world of Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a middle-aged jeweler that owes money to every shady human in New York City, though I don't know if I want to step back into this mucky world of crime, losers, and lowlifes. It's 2012, and Howard has procured a rare gemstone from Ethiopia and considers this his big score, which is important considering he keeps taking on more debts to pay off the last debts to angry, violent men. Basketball star Kevin Garnett, playing himself surprisingly well, visits the shop and is obsessed with the gem and the mythic power he feels it offers him. Howard agrees to allow the NBA star to borrow the gem, and from there Uncut Gems is a nonstop descent into chaos, with creditors, auction houses, family members, mistresses, and every goon in the tri-state area colliding with Howard as he spins desperate deals, escapes, and anything he can to attain that big score. The Safdie brothers, a writing/directing pair, made a big splash with 2017's gloriously thrilling Good Time, a movie that was as brilliantly streamlined and direct as this new one is deliberately sloppy. It feels like one plot event crashing into another, with characters speaking over one another, a throbbing score constantly in your ear, and with claustrophobic camerawork and grimy lighting. You feel like you're experiencing the constant rush of anxiety of Howard, and it's very potent, but the movie can also feel repetitive. There's so much happening all the time that it can feel less like things are escalating worse than things are just still happening. There are stellar sequences, in particular the later act with an auction and pulling off an escape leading to a very complicated high-risk-high-reward bet, but the movie's sloppiness and overlapping nature also makes it feel smothering. Sandler is superb as an adrenaline junkie seeking his next fix, a self-destructive gambler who knows he can never be satisfied. With Sandler's able assist, Howard has an offbeat charm that makes you listen when you should be punching him in the nose. Without Sandler and his live-wire performance, you probably wouldn't care what happens to this mess of a man. Julia Fox plays Howard's mistress and she's a real discovery. This is her film debut and it certainly won't be her last. She's more than a pretty face and finds a screwball sweetness to her relationship with her boss, enough so that you think she may actually love Howard for real, in her own way. Uncut Gems is also shockingly unsentimental about its characters and what befalls them. You may laugh, you may gasp, but you'll be surprised one way or another. The Safdie brothers continue to solidify themselves as some of the most exciting filmmakers working in the thriller genre. I'll still prefer Good Time and a scuzzy Robert Pattinson to a scuzzy, bruised, beaten, and always-smiling Sandler, but Uncut Gems is two hours of collective adrenaline spikes.",Uncut Gems
194,Lewis_Heather787,What a whirlwind !!!,7,21 December 2019,"I have to say that after watching ""Good Time"" I definitely looked out for whatever the Safdie brother's next project. So when I heard about and saw the trailer for ""Uncut Gems' I was immediately intrigued and excited. I must say that this film does not disappoint in terms of story, directing or acting..................but wow its a bit of a whirlwind which is a lot to follow!!!This film is directed beautifully by the Sadie brothers.................they know how to shoot such ugly/gritty surroundings in the most warm and gorgeous way. They are just both incredibly talented writers and directors. The story of following a slightly dodgy jeweller in his day to day world, how crazy that world is with gangsters, athletes and affairs. It is really fascinating seeing the story unfold, there is a lot of unpredictability with the central character of ""Howard"" , which makes the film even more gripping...............once again from these point of view they've knocked it out of the park.The main positive for me is the one performance everyone is talking about, Adam Sandler...................wow I think I might have to apologise to the man after all these years. Lets be fair he has made and been in some of the worst films ever made. Also he tends to play the same character in all of them.............to put it mildly I never thought the man could really ever act. Do I look stupid for thinking that now............I'm gonna say it............he genuinely deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance. This is career defining..........this could open the world to a new side of Sandler that we've not seen before. He has to do more dramatic serious roles in more serious films...........he is much better suited to it then slap stick comedy that was funny in the 80's and 90's. Unbelievably good.However even though I enjoyed he film and think its good...........I've given it a 7, I do have one main problem about the film. You've got to be in the mood to watch this film...........the re-watchability of the film isn't, for me, gonna be very high. Its a full on film, there is lot going on at a fast paced..........its just a lot to take in, as I mentioned this is a whirlwind of a film.Overall it 70% out of 100 its a good film again from the Safdie brothers...............so many twists and turns right up to the end, loved it........one great and career defining performance from Adam Sandler.............but it does have its problems. But definitely anyone who doubts Sandler at all should be made to watch this, hopefully you'll wake up like I have!",Uncut Gems

It's about a jeweler that owes money to all these people including gangsters that sell diamonds to him and he got this rock filled with diamonds from Africa that basketball player Kevin Garnett wants for over $175,000.

It's bling obsessed basketball players and their hangers on and it's the over the top black rap lifestyle that we've come to see in the entertainment rags.Put that all together and you have a breathless 2 hours of mayhem, .......double dealing, double crossing, foul mouthed mayhem.The lead role is played very well by Sandler, giving a pretty good version of a gambling addicted jeweller to the sports glitterati. The rest of the cast plays very well off him and it all comes together quite convincingly.Boy! You wouldn't want to get mixed up with that train wreck of a crowd, where promises are something that are used to get through 'til tomorrow and someone's word is about as reliable as a frayed rope.There's a good chance that someone is going to get hurt when you're unwinding the barbed wire I mentioned, and in this plot it's happening all the time both emotionally and physically.Sandler, as the aptly named Howard Ratner, surfs from crisis to crisis to crisis in his home and business life making it seem as real as your next door neighbour.People like this do exist and just leave a trail of debris behind them wherever they go, so this film could be seen as a lesson to steer clear of them.I can't say I liked the theme of the movie but I can say that it was a good two hours of frenetic entertainment",Uncut Gems
199,TuesdayThe17th,Your face is so stupid,10,10 March 2020,"WOW this is a phenomenal film. A powerhouse of stark realism. A reminder of who we are and how the streets truly felt. Its obvious that this part was written for Sandler as he owns his role and becomes Howard in his best performance to date, beating out his role in ""Punch Drunk Love"". His acting here is a triumph and it surely surpasses other recently skill billed projects such as Joaquin Phoenix as Joker and Brad Pitt in AD Astra(which I thought was a great movie btw). ""Uncut Gems"" marks yet another feat by the Safdie Brothers and illuminates film in a way like no other. Julia Fox is OTHERWORLDLY sexy and she fit perfect into the role and scene of the film. That brings me to my next point, which is, the movie could have benefited from a bit more sexuality or even just sensuality. More curvy hot gals with fat behinds would have been great but the film seems to shy a bit on this. There are very suspenseful moments but it is all created through situational stress and tensions. The story behind the opal rock is chilling when you think about it and the way it hynotizes KG is downright compelling and as a deep seated horror lover it was even creepy to me. There IS something unsettling about all of this. The origins of the stone. The havok it causes. The destruction that unfolds like dominos. This movie reminds me of a R rated version of ""Hardball"" with Keanu Reeves. Both fit in a similar category. I will also say that the story isn't anything new but its the way the story plays out that is great. The Safdie Brothers didnt break new ground because this is actually a much older script than many think. Instead the movie is stylized and there is palpable tension through out. It is fast paced and jarring and that is a huge part of the dead here. If this movie was not so fast paced it would have fell by the wayside, as intensity at a break neck speed was the Safdie's secret weapon here and it turned out great for them. Just when I thought ""Good Time"" was their masterpiece they grace us with ""Uncut Gems"", an even better version of new York gone man",Uncut Gems
200,kenzibit,Speechless!,7,30 December 2019,"Intense, full of suspence and just when he made it...... Best performance by Adam Sandler ever!",Uncut Gems
201,Jared_Andrews,Gripping and Intense from Beginning to End,8,30 January 2020,"Let's all agree on this: the Safdie brothers have a recognizable, signature filmmaking style.Love them or hate them, they put their stamp on their films in a way that is wholly original and undeniably them. Personally, I thoroughly enjoy the frenetic pacing and relentless tension they create in ""Good Time"" and here again in ""Uncut Gems,"" which has regrettably become 2019's biggest Oscar snub. Really, not a single Oscar nomination? It's a shame.This is the Safdie brothers' best work in their relatively young careers. They knock viewers off balance early and never give them a chance to fully regain their or footing or catch their breath. Even the ending, no spoilers, somehow doesn't provide the relief one would expect since the journey is over. It took me until a few hours after leaving the theater to finally decompress.The most impressive performance in this Safdie brother gem (I couldn't resist) is Adam Sandler. The Sandman is one of the most underappreciated dramatic actors of the last 20 years. Sure, he's known for and has become filthy rich because of his comedies, which include many, MANY atrociously unfunny movies, but Sandler more than holds his own in serious roles. ""Punch Drunk Love,"" ""Funny People,"" ""The Meyerowitz Stories,"" and others revealed that Sandler, when given the opportunity, is one of the best actors in Hollywood. And this is his best performance yet. But still no Oscar nomination.Sandler plays Howard, a sleazy jewelry store owner in the diamond district of New York City. Howard scams rich athletes into overpaying for expensive jewelry, cheats on his wife repeatedly, and moves around his gambling debt from one bookie to another. He mistreats everyone in his life, and everyone is fed up.This creates the thrill ride of the movie. Howard frantically tries to avoid bodily harm from the hired muscle who demand that he pay up, so he races around lying to everyone, including his wife, his mistress, his bookies, his children, and Kevin Garnett. KG plays a surprisingly pivotal role in the movie, and he absolutely crushes it. Perhaps it should come as no surprise that a Hall of Fame-level hooper delivers a magnetic on-screen performance.As Howard continues to disgrace himself and reveal himself to be appallingly unlikeable, Sandler somehow manages to keep viewers on the cusp of rooting for him. Things shouldn't work out for people like him. We should be rooting for his downfall. But Sandler brings an undeniable humanity to the character that, at times, somehow makes him sympathetic. Howard commits wretched acts, but we can't bring ourselves to entirely hate him because of Sandler. In no way is that a criticism - the humanity that Sandler brings is needed, otherwise viewers would check out mentally since they wouldn't care what happens to the guy. It's Sandler's beautifully nuanced, layered work that keeps everyone engaged.This is an incredible movie, and it's an incredible shame that it went unrecognized by the Oscars. Hopefully general audiences won't make that mistake. People should watch and appreciate the marvelous work being done here.",Uncut Gems

It's a suspenseful outing into the gritty lives of jewelers, bettors and loan sharks and goes places I didn't expect. I can't bring myself to sympathize with a character that constantly makes stupidly rash decisions, but the film doesn't hold back on delivering an abundant surge of anxiety-inducing thrills with a dream-like noir essence to keep you rooted.

208,foxtografo,"Too long, horrible soundtrack",3,10 February 2020,"I was interested in Sandler doing a crime / drama, but from the beginning I was highly annoyed about the non-stop-out-of-place retro soundtrack. Not only there's nothing retro in the movie, so it feels completely out of place, but it goes on for a very long time not giving you a break of silence or anything else. For me, that's the worst part of the movie and it's so poorly done it really makes the movie less appealing.
Then we have to go through 2 hours and 15 minutes of pure stressful people shouting at each other like apes, and a main character that never redeems from his pathetic mistakes, going over and over again into them.
All that only to end up in a stupid and disappointing ending that leaves all the steam you had inside from the stress right inside, really frustrating.
Overall, I could say Sandler did a good job, but the character was hateful, so I can't say I enjoyed it at all.
Photography was very average, like other movies from the same directors I've seen, they have a very particular raw style that can some times be interesting, but this movie as a whole was a total miss.

Dopey comic Sandler delivers some serious acting chops, morphing convincingly into his jewelry peddler character. This is John Turturro territory, which as it turns out, also offers a passing resemblance.As the slimy yet congenial Howard, Sandler embodies his yappy hustler with just the right mix of bravura, oblivion, and misdirected entrepreneurial charm. Always one step behind in escalating debts, Howard keeps betting on himself in a self-inflicted, perverse, inverse pyramid scheme. When things go bad, go big!Capturing the frenetic hustle and grimy bustle of New York streets, ""Uncut Gems"" is a loud talkie, shot in grainy close-ups and deep shadowy hues, pulsing with an insistent soundtrack that spars with dialogue creating a manic experience some may find confounding.There's no need for build up; the tension permeates from the get go. Even when Howard makes friendly small talk, or attempts to participate in family life, his mind is always racing on another plane. And yet it is hard not to cheer for the delusional schlumpf, who despite all his transgressions, remains a sympathetic puzzle.For a thrilling, frantic sequence of big money chaos and mayhem in an elite yet scummy underworld of wheeling and dealing few will ever sniff, this delivers the ultimate voyeur experience, which is what movies are all about.

218,lucasnochez,Film Review: Uncut Gems,8,27 February 2020,"Uncut Gems, a modern-day Roman Tragedy, situated in the fluorescent back rooms and the front showrooms of New York City's shopping underbelly, is the latest film from the Safdie Brothers. If you have no idea who the Safdie brothers are, they are two (actual) brothers who gained profuse acclaim after shocking audiences with the 2017 crime-drama Good Time starring Robert Pattinson. Not only can Pattinson thank the Safdie's for landing the coveted role of Bruce Wayne with the film, as well as allowing that film to shed his Edward Cullen/Twilight teen image, but the film was also an obtrusive reminder to the world that these brothers are not playing around when it comes to neon lit storytelling. Their documentary style type filmmaking along with their abrasive, headache induing filming style allows for their low-budget pictures to glisten, no matter how bad their VFX may be. The Safdie's are a clear and present reminder that, with the right story, passion is always reflective. With their latest film, Uncut Gems, its not secret, and reflects here.Uncut Gems stars Adam Sandler as Howard Ratner, a down-on-his luck, gambling addicted, cheating, lying, manipulative NYC jeweller who, if we've ever seen it in cinema, has a degree in crap. Although the ""gift-of-the-gab"" definition may not particularly suit Howard, since everyone, all the time, knows he is always talking out of his ass, Sandler convinces himself and audiences that no one else could have pulled off this role, other than him. Abrasive, in your face, annoying and relentless, Sandler's performance may very well be, a staple New York City character for decades to come.Yet, while Sandler may very well grace every single shot and scene in the film, the Safdie brothers are still sure and able to allow the film to evolve into what it really is, and thats an announcement. A proclamation of presence and a big shout out to the world of cinema, Uncut Gems is a film to solidify that the Safdie brothers are here, and they are here to stay. Uncut Gems isn't only a film, its an experience. Much like the first time you do cocaine, this film is the epitome of cocaine, caviar, K'vatsh and Grand Theft Auto printed onto celluloid. An unapologetic adrenaline shot to the senses.What initially drew me in about this film was sonically, how unique it sounded, narratively speaking, without knowing how loud and it is aesthetically as well. The main theme which is a series of hard hitting, resonating synths overlapped with fluorescent ambience is immediately engrained into your memory. Daniel Lopatin takes a gritty in your face film, and scores each scene with electronic chaos yet equal grace. Not only does his score tighten and heightens the cinematic movie experience, but it also broadens its effect on the senses by creating soundscapes that are transcendent, it's as if the soundtrack was created by the sounds of slot machines, casino betting, and the whaling of a screeching auctioneer in your ear at all times. The sounds of Uncut Gems are as dreamy as a nightmare could be. Drowning souls lost for the pursuit of money as if they are trapped in the notes that belt and vibrate across the screen, Uncut Gems is a documentary style take on Wayne Kramer's hyper-violent Running Scared, but instead of opting for violence and gore, the film uses dialogue as its weapon.While the narrative of Uncut Gems could be argued to expose the very simple story of just, the pursuit of money, the picture dives deep into social and economic commentary of capitalism and corporate greed as well. On the surface level, perhaps because of the value it holds in our society, the overall tone and theme of the film carries a type of mysticism behind it. Idolized and mythologized since its creation, the pursuit of wealth to bring happiness is an age-old cautionary tale that consistently makes fools out of many who chase it, including our protagonist Howard Ratner.Set in 2012 within the deep diamond district of New York, Sandler's characters faults become clear early on. His inability to being a family man adds to his persona. Ratner's addicted ultimately fuels the narrative of the film as well as the desires of all the characters around him, leading to a very flawed and uncut portrait of a man as well as society as a whole.Set at a breakneck pace, tonally ambitious and hyper-realized, the film feels so real at times, that it comes across as mega-fiction. Like a rapper on a mic, free-styling during a rap battle, the actors follow a script that was in development for almost a decade, yet sling-shot lines and emotions to one another, like they have been doing it their whole lives. Thanks to caliber actors like Lakeith Stanfield, Julia Fox, Idina Menzel, Judd Hirsch, and surprisingly enough, retired NBA player Kevin Garnett, Uncut Gems is a masterclass of coherent gibberish.Fuelled by the pursuit of a rare Opal, the Safdie brothers craft a hybrid gangster/crime film that stays consistent to their break-out film Good Time, yet has an identity of its own. Maneuvering through the streets and boroughs of NYC, leading audiences through a wild goose chase, the film's clear cut vision is shot by Darius Khondji with some nauseating yet stellar results. Shot in the same way as all their previous films, the Safdie brother's signature documentary style lens which totally invades personal space, its the modus operandi of the film; unafraid and unforgiving. Shot by shot, and almost in an idolizing sort of way, which thematically is parallel to the narrative, the film is an expose of consumerism and how it turns into a drug of sorts for people. It shows the disease of constantly striving for that proverbial next level, the inevitable status oriented conversation over coffee and dinner tables by anxious heads of families as they swiftly smoke cigarettes.In the end, the Safdie brothers hit the audience with the harsh reality that it all doesn't really mean anything, sending a punch to the face the same way too much popcorn sends a punch to the gut. There are moments when the addiction is so strong for Howard, the pursuit, that even after being heavily harassed and threatened by creditors, he's still making bets to loan sharks and flipping the bird to collectors.With Uncut Gems, the depravity is colossal, and the Safdie brothers find decadence in this, as does the audience.While it becomes clear that Joaquin Phoenix may very well be the front-runner to winning the Best Actor Oscar now that Awards Season is underway, Sandler should be considered for a close second. His perfectly timed blank stare of confusion in the copious moments of chaos throughout the film are perfectly in tune with its styling of setting and story. You hate to love him but you can't help in doing so. Addicted to the rush of it all, his addiction becomes the audiences fascination. Howard's rush of uncertainty, much like the narrative itself (you never quite know exactly what the hell is going on nor expect to see what happens next) begins to explode like a firecracker in your hand, personal yet so far from your own realities, hopefully.Viewing Uncut Gems at its International Premiere has and will always have a profound nostalgia for me. Being a young cinephile who has grown up to the 90's crime genre, a period in cinema where grit, style and flare carry a film alone, Uncut Gems brought me back to a place I once found familiar. A time where Scorsese picture flooded the screens, a time where the gangsters and mobsters in films still wore suits and carried guns in their suit jacket pockets; a time where greasy hair and smoking guns was the norm. We may not got much of that with this film, and the latter may very well be replaced by the smell of fake NYC leather, tattered diamonds and urban hip-hop culture, but the Safdie brothers provide their NYC signature to a film that may very well be, an origin film towards the future of the modern and urban mobster genre. Without question, Uncut Gems is a gem of a crime picture that glistens.",Uncut Gems
219,PotassiumMan,"High-volume, anarchy-driven morality tale that will give you a beatdown to the nitty gritty",7,27 December 2019,"Exhausting is the first word that describes this Safdie Brothers film. I was flat out dizzy when I left the theater, not the least because I was trying to hold onto the sheer amount of material at work in this hard-boiled account of a New York City jeweler who gets hold of a highly exotic super stone from Ethiopia and uses it to leverage one knee-deep debt after another that he has accumulated in his shady dealings. He is pursued by many an angry and/or violent creditor, but his own lack of scruples enable him to jump from one bold move to the next.There is so much mayhem and rage in this film, you'll sometimes feel like you're in a boiler room. The pace is sometimes so feverish, you might be grateful for the quieter, less eventful scenes. But it's not all chaos and fury. Deep down, there's a deeply tormented soul struggling to keep his life together as he manages to bottle a desperate situation. And a hypnotic soundtrack is another nice touch.Although this is a cold-blooded depiction of a protagonist devoid of any true conscience, it's done with such conviction and force, that I have to respect the craft that went into it. Although at times an ordeal, it's possible that this improves with each viewing, not the first such film I've ever seen. Recommended, but not for the faint of heart.",Uncut Gems
220,royhectorkabanlit,"A highly absorbing, highly entertaining movie",10,1 February 2020,"Just saw this on Netflix, and it is a pretty good film. There really is an uncut gem, and it serves as a Macguffin for the movie, the story revolves around it when it came to the life of Adam Sandler's character.Sandler here plays a Jewish Businessman who is always taking some sort of gamble, some sort of risk, always living on the edge, and that's what make the movie work, there always some twist or thrill just right around the corner.To me it is also about Greed, Sandler already has a good business going and yet he is still willing to bet it all to get more, much more. Sandler carried the movie most of the time, and he does it very well, no wonder all this talk about him getting an Oscars Award.But then again he's playing a role tats not him, so it seems he is just playing his natural self. Anyway, pretty entertaining and a Must See for me.",Uncut Gems

222,arishsankar,P U R E G E M,10,13 January 2020,"After watching this movie for the first time, I was honestly really confused with everything that had just happened before my eyes, but I was so bought into the film as a result of Sandler's great performance and the compelling story behind it
Best movie of 2019 period",Uncut Gems
223,torrascotia,If you hate Sandler you will love this.,7,23 January 2020,"I managed to catch this at a preview screening at the Edinburgh Filmhouse. I was very keen to see this based on positive reviews as well as with the knowledge that Oneohtrix Point Never was doing the score. I cant recall an electronic artist doing a major film score since Orbital did for the under par remake of Pusher.
This movie seems to set many people on edge, in the screening a girl next to me watched the majority of it through her fingers.
The story is of a reckless gambler who seems to intentionally put himself into dangerous situations on the hope of a big payoff as well as the emotional buzz this gives him. You are unlikely to enjoy the company of any of the characters in this movie so its best watched with a level of disengagement so you can enjoy the ride.
The movie will certainly play better in America due to the cameos involved as well as the details of how basketball rules work as well as gambling. Alot of the story line revolves around these points and while you can still get a rough idea of whats going on, it definitely helps to understand whats going on if you already know all this information.
Its definitely worth a watch and sooner rather than later as there are some major spoilers in Uncut Gems.
What is odd is the release schedule, for a Netflix movie its on a limited UK release and no set date for streaming.
Catch it at the cinema before someone ruins it for you.
If you don't like watching Sandler then you are in for a treat.",Uncut Gems
224,collectorofsorts,Absolute Garbage! It's Like Something 2 Film Students Would Make On a Shoestring Budget!,2,17 December 2019,"Where to start... I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan and wanted to like this movie. BUT, it's so convoluted that it became boring after only 20 minutes or so. Between the main characters shady deals, women, gambling and bad debts, it was just too hard to follow from segment to segment. My thoughts are that the writers tried to throw in 'everything but the kitchen sink' and that's where they messed up. And, not only that. The soundtrack was horrible. It was often so loud that you couldn't even hear what the actors were saying over it. The acting was OK'ish. It was just a poorly written mess of a film. If not for Adam Sandler being in the film, I would have thought it was made by 2 middle of the road film students with a $20k budget. It's just poorly written and edited piece of garbage. I did notice ONE odd thing though. Most of the higher Star Rating Reviews have the feel of being written by the same person. A few things are changed from review to review. But, the basics are the same. Take a look and you'll see what I mean. Most of the 9-10 star reviews are mostly 'advertisements' for the directors and their other films.",Uncut Gems
225,brandonneicke,Top notch Adam you impressed me,10,2 February 2020,"Wow i knew Adam was great but this shows an amazing side of his talent. He truly is an artist, long movie but it keeps you intense and it's an original story. It's not generic like today's stuff. Very impressed and would recommend to anyone who likes real cinema.",Uncut Gems
226,brandonneicke,Legendary,10,9 February 2020,"You have to have grew up with old cinema with things like Goodfellas and Jackie brown. This was a true gem. Unfortunately it's a lot of young people that watch netflix and look for a lot of action or comedy. They don't always appreciate gritty, realistic and deep dramas. Even if you hated this style of movie you couldn't help but appreciate Adam sandler. Outstanding performance I am shocked, I knew he was great but he just showed it once again. Amazing ending which is very real. Love the whole thing and didn't want it to end, as slow as it was it was captivating.",Uncut Gems

Sandler's character and acting were credible and on point, a real pleasure to watch .The film is well made, the story well told, nice camera work and editing, just fun, edgy entertainment .So for me it's a 6/10 - a rewachtable, solid flick .Btw., could people please stop handing out 10/10 ratings like candy ?
It really messes up the whole rating system .",Uncut Gems
228,rmmil,Highly overrated,3,27 August 2020,"I have to admit, calling this film (or any film) highly overrated is a bit ""unfair"" because Oscar nominated films are so overhyped now by the Hollywood hype machine that even the best nominated films could still be called ""overrated"".That being said, this film is much less than advertised.The biggest ""hyped"" aspect of this film is the once every 5-10 years or so ""such and such actor known for comedy is in a dramatic part"" thing that seems to instantly elevate such films in the eyes of many. Can Adam Sandler actually act, more than just his usual goofiness? Yes and no. His character in this film has some obnoxious habits that make it unlike the usual Adam Sandler part, but at its core this role is just a non-drag version of the character he played in Jack and Jill. It's that obnoxious.My biggest fault with the film though had nothing to do with Adam Sandler's acting or anything else, it was the soundtrack. I don't know that I've ever had a film with such poor sound mixing. The levels are just too high. When I actually missed dialogue because of the furiously loud background audio, that's a big problem I can't overlook. Sure, it's a style choice. Just a really bad one.The story itself of the film is okay, but tells you nothing new. Hard pass, I'm so glad I didn't pay money at the theater to see this!!",Uncut Gems
229,chevolek,Fake High Scored Reviews. Awful movie !!!,3,8 February 2020,"It´s annoying right from the start. I agree with other reviewers about the loud 80s type of sci-fi music playing pretty loud while the opening credits rolled for a looong time and lots of chaos within the movie, seems like a wall street area with lots of yelling. I could not even make it to the 30min mark. Big no no for Sandler. I like his comedies but this drama is awful and unbearable.",Uncut Gems
230,dcobbimdb,what a self induced nightmare,2,29 June 2020,"This was on Netflix and had a rating of 7.5, so I figured why not as the general story line seemed intriguing. Well it certainly wasn't my cup of tea, and I like action flicks and dramas too.I could tell from the opening credits it was different, I guess would be a nice way to put it. The music score was really weird, almost 80's synthesizer and really didn't fit the movie at all, but I just figured maybe it was just a weird opening. Nope it's like that the entire movie, and scores & music in general can make or break a movie. In this case it was certainly the latter for me. It had that Indie / foreign feel to it, as well as being a 'B' movie, but I rolled with it thinking I have seen a few indie films that were good. But after 10 minutes into the movie you start to realize this is going to be an adrenaline fueled rush coupled with yelling and cursing throughout, to the point of it feeling exhausting. Still, wanting to give it a chance I watched on...As far as the acting goes I've never seen Sandler in a role like this, but then again I haven't seen him in anything in the last 10 years. So it was refreshing to see him in a different role. However, through no fault of his I couldn't stand his character, nor could I relate to nor get behind anyone in the movie. Movies like this tend to lose my interest quickly as I have no investment or interest, basically nothing to latch onto, and couple that with a really weird score, I was fading fast...I made it about 45 minutes into it, being fascinated he wasn't killed up to that point and paused it only to realize in disappointment I wasn't even half way though it, and I was not going to sit through another hour plus of this, so I sped through the rest in about 5 minutes and watched the climax. I won't spoil the end but I didn't find it surprising, satisfying, vindicating or anything really. But again I didn't really care how it would end as my interest was far removed at this point.In the end I'm surprised at the high rating, while I gravitate more towards action & sci-fi genre, I enjoy all kinds of movies and my criteria is pretty simple, I want to be entertained, and while I can't say this movie was boring, I didn't find it to my liking and wasn't entertained at all. It seemed really over the top, loud, obnoxious, and way to unrealistic. Even if this had a good score I don't think I would have liked it any more. Since 1 is the minimum rating I give it a 2 as I thought Sandler did a good job, beyond that there was nothing at all I liked about it",Uncut Gems
231,Oktay_Tuna,Greed and Control,9,18 January 2020,"First of all, what a performance by Adam Sandler, he deserves an Oscar nom. The acting in this film is amazing even Garnett was good. Howard is addicted to more of everything. He wants more happiness, more money, more risk, more life. And his greed makes him lose control. This is one of the best movies which shows how greed makes someone lose control. The tension built on the screen by camera works and Sandler's performance is unbelievable. You really feel how Howard lose his control and even though you know that he doesn't deserve to be happy, you still root for him because of Sandler's charisma. After Howard got his work together his greed appears again. His family, his money even his co-worker is not enough for him, he wants more and the ending is fabulous. We see Howard on the floor(dead) by a half smile which means he really believed that he would feel sufficient enough after that bet but he wasn't going to and him dying there is not only what he deserved but also what he needed.",Uncut Gems

To this end, the Safdie brothers have offered us Uncut Gems, which is an artistic way to become really sweaty and nervous, a movie which should come with a hot towel scented lightly with lemon juice to clean ourselves, our hands, our eyes, our minds.Uncut Gems is a good movie, one which I never want to endure again, because it tenders a sort-of reverse escapism. If Requiem for a Dream can keep someone away from heroin, I hope Uncut Gems is a counterpart for avoiding gambling. Adam Sandler, who garnered fame for portraying obnoxiousness incarnate for laughs, stretches his acting chops far and wide by portraying obnoxiousness incarnate for pity. Kevin Garnett is perfect as Kevin Garnett, and ditto for The Weeknd.Yet it is Wayne Diamond, whose pearly whites chew up the casino scenes, maybe typecast as Handsome Older Man, who haunts us for hours after the credits roll. Is he Peter Fonda with a lot of makeup? Unlikely, for he left the planet in August. Is Wayne Diamond his real name? All signs point to yes. Should there be more of Wayne Diamond doing movie stuff? Absolutely, kid.",Uncut Gems

A descent made of excruciating screams and precious gems, of sketched smiles and nerves on the skin. A well directed film, better written and very well acted. Adam Sandler offers us one of his best performances of his career, making many, especially young people, think that this actor has a lot to offer in different contexts. His performance, with the excellent directing by the Safdie Bothers, merges in an unique and original vision of a common plot. Film that you watch in a whisper with the perception that hours that seem minutes and minutes that seem endless. A thriller-dramatic picture with a bit of comedy between the lines.

If this were a series, it'd be cancelled after one season.There's literally no point to the story. None. It's a train wreck from beginning to end accompanied by a grating, completely out of place score, and with an ending that does nothing to resolve anything that transpired.Aside from the fact that there is ZERO character arc with respect to the protagonist, he's extremely unlikeable. One could feel some sympathy or even empathy for the guy, but you can only hang in with a guy who never stops screwing up for only so long. In fact, one would have to wonder how in the world he ever managed to achieve so much in the first place.My guess is Sandler knows the director or his family and agreed to do the film as a favor since really, he doesn't need the money and it's not like making another awful film is going to hurt his reputation.",Uncut Gems

Furthermore, the trailer did not give away anything, and it did not seem that interesting. However, this movie gently pulls you into the story, and you cannot help but root for Sandler's character. You know he is not honest, but you want him to succeed, even though he lies his way through. Considering how different his character in Uncut Gems is from his goofy persona in his comedies, I would say it demonstrates his acting range. The movie is very focused on Sandler's character, and Sandler pulls it off naturally. Every minute, we worry something will happen to him, as it usually does, and we sigh with relief when we find him get to catch some breath. Unlike other thrillers, Uncut Gems provides a low key, slow burn thrill that keeps you on edge till the very final moments. A plus, it features the most riveting TV basketball match shown inside a movie; and I am not a sports fan.

And frankly - it struck me as a very unique, special film.Uncut Gems makes the viewer genuinely stressed about what is happening on the screen - which I believe to be an absolute triumph for the directors and writers.The anxiety is definitely kicked a notch up vs. Good Time. The viewer is always on edge about what this jeweller / con-artist might do next.
The character portrayed by Adam Sandler - by far the best role I have seen in him - is incredibly captivating as Howard. Who you sort of root for, but never fully understand his actions. As he aims to rise the stakes at every turn.The dialogue is of one the most realistic I have ever seen in a movie - all tense scenes are filled with several characters shouting and speaking on top of each other. To those complaining about this aspect of the movie, I say - fair, but how do you talk when you under stress and in confrontation?
I thought it was absolutely spot on. It helps build the tension and makes the film all the more realStrongly recommend this one for lovers of movies about charismatic characters in the real world with high tension (although perhaps not for the faint of heart)",Uncut Gems

249,cappiethadog,Money changes everything,10,28 February 2021,"The devil doesn't inhabit the soul of Howard Ratner(Adam Sandler), a jewelry shop owner, in The Safdie Brothers' ""Uncut Gems"", but the small-time NYC hustler is in thrall, a possession that transcends superstition. Had the late John Cassavetes remade ""The Exorcist"" in his own image, it may have looked something like this ode to the American New Wave, the cinema of the auteur-driven seventies. And who better than noted Cassavetes aficionados, Josh and Bennie Safdie to transmogrify contemporary NYC into a Martin Scorsese-inspired theme park of Travis Bickle's old stomping grounds. The Safdie Brothers' last outing, the 2017 Palm d'or nominated ""Good Time"", starring Robert Pattison, as Connie, a bank robber saddled with the baggage of looking after a developmentally disabled brother, Nick(Josh Safdie), a role that Cassavetes himself played in Elaine May's quirky ""Mickey and Nicky"", in which the independent movie maverick, as Nicky, playing a slow mobster in need of a brother's keeper, Micky(Peter Falk), his partner in crime. ""Uncut Gems"" suggests ""The Killing..."" as a human horror movie about being possessed by a devil of sorts, an ideology.""Uncut Gems"" opens in Ethiopia, the setting that recalls the Iraqi archaeological dig in ""The Exorcist"", the 1973 William Friedkin film about a possessed young girl and a mother's single-minded crusade to drive him out. Instead of artifacts, the Native Africans dig for black opals in the Welo mines. Instead of an ancient evil that follows Father Lankester Merrin(Max Von Sydow) back stateside, it's an ideology trapped inside a Fed Ex package that Howard unleashes when he opens it. The black opal is hidden in the belly of a fish. The fish symbolizes a blessing, but maybe the fish's long journey across the Atlantic caused the fish to turn. The black opal, as it turns out, is cursed. The Safdie Brothers adeptly prove the old adage that ""money is the root of all evil,"" as Howard Ratner succumbs to the almighty dollar.Josh and Bennie Safdie are post-modernist filmmakers. Like Quentin Tarantino, they employ pastiche, a recombinant of disparate old movies that creates a filmic language akin to creole. The Safdie Brothers put out all the stops, their cinematic alchemy, from the outset. There's a mining accident at the mines. Flanked by two men, the badly injured laborer is led out of the cave with a wound that exposes bone. Since ""Uncut Gems"" is set in the empirical world , the man's near-death experience isn't provoked by some supernatural entity; it's systemic greed, a prevailing evil called money that The Safdie Brothers turn into a demonic metaphor. ""The Killing..."" crashes ""The Exorcist"" party when the corporate suits arrive on the scene. Rather than play the victim in the Cassavetes film, in which a bookie(Soto Joe Hugh), half the movie title's namesake, whom Cosmo Vitelli(Ben Gazzara), a gentleman's club owner , is ordered to put a hit on as compensation for a delinquent gambling debt by the local mob, in ""Uncut Gems"", the ""other"", this time around, are the people who hold all the cards, overlords who control the black opal racket. The company foreman, in a sense, is a Merrin surrogate, a go-between for its worshippers, who believe in a quasi-religion built around black opals and other fine gemstones. Cosmo, the hired assassin, owes $23,000 to Mort Weil(Seymour Cassell). That's the filmic DNA in which The Safdie Brothers extract from ""The Killing..."" and inject into Howard Ratner. He's a gambler.""You brought this upon yourself,"" Arno Moravian(Eric Bogosian) yells at Howard, just before the crime figure's goons lock Howard in the trunk of his own car. In ""The Exorcist"", the medical professionals, in so many words, come to the same conclusion , telling Chris MacNeil(Ellen Burstyn), Regan's mother that her daughter needs to see a psychiatrist because nothing is showing up on the x-rays to help explain the girl's maladies. The medical imaging doesn't capture the evil cohabiting alongside Regan's soul. Quite pointedly, during Howard's colonoscopy, the gastroenterologist misses the precious stones as the fiber optic camera winds its way through the patient's canal. The gems are the stand-in, describing perfectly, what drives people to risk everything they own or built. A day or two later, the doctor calls Howard at work to give him the good news; a clean bill of health. Just like Regan's physicians, the doctor is a man of science; he doesn't know what ails his patient. Howard's gambling addiction imprisons the man who is a husband, father, and thoughtful business owner. The arch-capitalist takes over. At a nightclub, he punches out a singer-songwriter(The Weeknd). Demany(Lakeith Stanfield), a business associate, asks Howard: ""What the hell is wrong with you?"" At an auction house, Howard enlists Gooey(Judd Hirsch), his father-in-law, to outbid a professional basketball player(Kevin Garnett) for the black opal. At the jewelry store, he can't hear Yussi(Maksud Agdajani), a longtime employee, whose protestations against the unsavory people he regularly encounters falls on deaf ears. Like a filmic bridge to ""The Exorcist"", a bewitched Howard, staring at the jewel-encrusted rock, tells Yussi..., which would be the end result when Regan... Howard Ratner is a human horror spectacle, as he makes preposterous bet after preposterous bet. Just like Regan, who can't give or receive love from her mother, due to the usurping of her soul and its nihilistic replacement, the dead heart. Exorcisms are in order for both. Regan needs a priest, whereas Howard Ratner could use a pragmatist person, man or woman, to help drive the objectivist food for thought that feeds the beast of burden out from his insatiable body, so dependent on excess and risk.Father Merrin is an old man. Satan overpowers him. The priest's backup, Father Damien(Jason Miller) finishes the job, paying with his life. Good and evil, in the biblical sense, exists in ""The Exorcist"", a genre movie, whereas in ""Uncut Gems"", it's mano a mano, man versus Superman, duking it out inside Howard's body, and outside, as well, testing whatever good will that exists in Phil(Keith William Richards) and Nico(Tommy Kominik) when he goes on the offensive by throwing the first punch in more than one confrontation. Magic doesn't exist in an objective world. In ""Uncut Gems"", magic is relegated to the stage. In a school play, gold coins emerge from the mouth of Howard's daughter, Marcel(Noa Fisher), like the torrent of projectile vomit coming out of Regan's mouth, which incidentally is green, the same color as money. More echoes of the 1973 film, based on the William Peter Blattey novel, ensues. The fountain that Nico throws the degenerate gambler in is unconsecrated water. Even if it was, it wouldn't matter, because Howard Ratner only believes in money. And finally, there is the person who'll save his soul. In ""The Exorcist"", Regan had two people her mother could rely on. Howard has one. Nobody else to step in should the first person fail. Estranged from Dinah(Idina Menzel), the recalcitrant man is dependent on one woman, and it's the wrong woman. Julia(Julia Fox) loves money almost as much as her boss. Dinah wouldn't have taken the money earned from the auction and agree to place it on a longshot parlay in Atlantic City. Howard Ratner, ironically enough, needs a devil's advocate; his wife. Julia is possessed, too. In ""The Exorcist"", ""Help me,"" is inscribed in puffy letters on Regan's skin. The young girl wants to be saved, whereas Julia, loves her lifestyle, going so far as tattooing ""Howard"" on her thigh.Howard is shot.He dies.The final scene is one for the ages.It's money, not some ancient superstition, which is the root of all evil.The camera enters the entry wound. Howard's body is infected with all the multitudes of the black opal; the devil as metaphor.The devil in disguise.",Uncut Gems
250,Eric_Cubed,"Because of Sandler, hopeless",2,1 July 2020,"I have seen things in Heaven and in Hell and much in-between. I have not, however, ever viewed a movie of the damned, a celluloid nightmare offending and insulting the God of Film so thoroughly that this God has called upon everyone involved in the film to be condemned to a timeless void, where there is no escaping reruns of ""The View"" are pervasive and endless. Watching this movie is not purgatory. No, it is something else, something worse, an empty place where all contributing factors involved making it add up to something resembling, but far worse than, Nihilism. They will not be able to make another as soulless movie act like it, a movie believing in nothing, less than nothing that without regret or remorse happily purports to be purposeful and chalked full of meaning, so numbingly faceless trying to imitate authentic art that the reel itself instinctively recoils, as one would from a frothing, leaping rat, poisonous jumping spider or pestilence rapidly infecting the land. After watching, we see a distinct parallel process, a living hell on earth, of something produced that is nothing, creating a horrible betrayal, the insult to the injury paying to sign up for suffering. A part of us withers away and dies, trying to unsee, like the fetid aftermath of murderous uprising, the dead splattered on the street and the holes from the bullets leaking their life away. How does one intentionally and purposefully irritate and agitate? By the willfully betrayal and abandonment of inauthenticity, whatever form it may take. In the era of silent films, there was no Hell. The stifled actors, held captive by time and technology, still had the freedom of movement and passion, even as the early frames did their best to disavow social awareness with the intent of inducing a corrective emotional experience. Adam Sandler trying his best to imitate Al Pacino at his worst does not appall, it is cheered, silencing the corpse writing, direction and producing, obscuring the lord of the flies underlying it, begetting confusion atop confusion. But somehow the audience and the critics, perhaps caught up in an otherworldly spell, have convinced themselves they do not feel horrible after watching, assuming their perplexing admonishment is evidence of a masterpiece, in denial and rationalizing, giving a thumbs up, as if Sandler performance transcends Travolta's character in Pulp Fiction. That crazy making mixed messaging of arbitrary purposelessness has happened because this is a movie of the damned, and all movies of the damned, full of fire and devoid of light and characterized by confusion, deliver the devil living there with a direct line to manipulate audiences away from properly condemning evil, the truth eaten by a horde of ghastly locusts, happily accepting that timeless nothingness is meaningful and objectively undistorted, sending the small helpless collective audience brain bursting, like a fish gasping for air crushed underneath the fisherman's boot, assuming Sandler's performance must be accepted with impunity.The torture does not end here. Uncut Gems is further darkened by its dank, detestable smell, a rat-sewer stench stemming from the thousands of hideous movies before it, therefore enabling it. Consider the foul odor of celluloid hell, like a rotting worm-infested body, wasting away in a coffin under a grave in liquifying abandon. Do this, and you will better understand how ""Uncut Gems"" chokes on the ashes of Mean Streets and every other movie like it, and how its eye-clawing stench is amplified by it's bad faith intention, tricking us into believing something profound is happening when the opposite is true, that a putrescent film of carcass and death, reeking putrescence, is not beyond comprehension. No, it is hell. Knowing this, and you will properly understand. And yet, the film, in and of itself as awful as it is, is not the absolute supreme torture the viewer is subjected to. The real pain is Adam Sandler asking you to place your unscarred hand into a fire and leave it there to simmer and burn. Sometimes, such brimstone pain is required to produce a meaningful piece of art. Not so with Gemstones, a porous, pus infected scam burning with aborted rage and banal commonplace of regurgitated themes. And this celluloid devil, if forced to confess, would admit to its purposeful damnation, seeing their involvement costing them their soul because of a lie, another deepening layer of Hell, concocted to avoid deserved guilt otherwise surely nesting in the very marrow of boundless nothingness, like the furious boiling of organs and evisceration of blood, this is what Hell delivers, an anti-aliveness, a rancidity of cinema, evaporating suspenseful disbelief and subjugating and sucking the heart of the every eager moviegoer into possession, screaming from the innocence of eyes wide-open, screaming to be validated, wanting nothing more to lose themselves in the magic and mystery of the theater and experiencing the opposite.",Uncut Gems
251,stevojaxon,I had 2 hours to kill and this killed it for 2 hours 15 minutes,5,18 December 2019,"I admire what the Safdie bros have created. It is original and they stick fearlessly to their idea. Here comes the compliment ... the film reminds me of the Coen brothers or Tarantino ... but without the finesse. If you like raw, then Uncut Gems is for you. Who am I to comment? I couldn't create what they have and I am just viewing it; then I have the audacity to comment upon it. But that's the deal ... there is a custom by which people such as myself are self appointed critics and then I indulge myself by writing about such a movie. I have read a number of bona fide critic's reviews and I am amazed at how taken they are with it. Did I enjoy it? Well it filled 2 hours 15 minutes when I couldn't find anything else to watch. Is it a film that could appeal to my mentality? In theory it should. Did I find it believable? ... no. But then, that doesn't matter. Was I shocked by it? Well in a world of cartoons, I would say this is a shocking cartoonesque style of effort. Do I think that there is some latent genius lurking behind what is presented here? Sure do. Here is another compliment ... I can't slot this movie conveniently into a zone that I recognize ... but then a lot of movies are like that and originality in art is a high achievement. What can I say in closing? This movie is on the border of greatness but if I am honest about it, it will sit on the border in my mind and I will be left wondering if the Safdie brothers will create something in the future that transcends this effort? Let's hope so.p.s. am I imagining things or did I see Martin Scorcese's name in the credits?

These are my favorites.Here this film dares to go a little beyond the commercial. This is why it is unexpected and captivating. It's original. Not told in a conventional way.
The non-stop action, the long shots without detachment, the chaos filmed very well by the director keep you interested.There is no need for a deep plot here, it is the fast pace, the stressful life of the protagonist, (a man full of debts who continues to gamble to get out of it), who leads and makes the movie interesting and never obvious.An incomprehensible gem of films for many who like easy songs I fear, or for who expect a fun Sandler's comedy.9/10",Uncut Gems

255,Dello_,A descent into hell,8,23 February 2020,"""Uncut Gems"" is about Adam Sandler's character, who is into a lot of dirty business and because of that he gets in trouble and by trying to solve the situation he worsens it. The main character is very unlikable because he is an a**hole with the people around him and all he cares about is his richness and his personal pleasure. But the movie does a good job because it makes easier to root for him despite disliking him. So the movie is thrilling because you see this man who is getting in worse trouble every time he moves and you are interested in knowing if and how he will come out of the situation. The main reason this movie got this popular is the performance by Adam Sandler and I can confirm that I agree with all the praises: he was great in ""Uncut Gems"". Indeed except for the very beginning, his character is in every scene and Sandler is able to be always credible and in part. And an honourable mention to the great Kevin Garnett who gives a good performance and it isn't always the case with former athletes.
""Uncut Gems"" is a descent into hell getting deeper and deeper, but there's a chance to get out of it? I'll let you discover the answer by yourself!",Uncut Gems
256,ccamp89,Weak 4.5 // Sensory Overload,9,12 January 2020,"Overwhelming in the most positive sense of the word, Uncut Gems is top-notch experiential filmmaking. With no exposition or frame-setting to speak of, the Safdie brothers simply drop you right into the tornadic center of their protagonist's (antagonist's?) experience. Right from the get-go, you'll find yourself squinting your eyes at the sensory overload: overlapping, chaotic dialogue, bright fluorescent and neon lights, manic camera work, and a whole lot of good old fashion yelling. The entire movie has a stream-of-consciousness quality as you struggle to keep up with every increasingly awful decision Sandler's character makes. The downside of this approach is that the movie necessarily forgoes a clear narrative structure and may test the patience of some viewers who appreciate more traditional storytelling. At times the film can feel unfocused, but if you're on its wavelength this really only adds to the experience. The Safdies also manage to inject enough humanity, particularly through the family drama, to give the film the emotional core it really needed to anchor it all. If for nothing else, see it for Sandler's operatic performance.Weak 4.5/5",Uncut Gems

All I can say is that, for such a frenetic movie, it was surprisingly dull. It was just the story of one man being an aggravating idiot for 2+hours. I'm not even sure how to review the plot except to say that ""frenetic"" doesn't always mean ""interesting.""That said, Sandler pulled off the role very well. Being an aggravating idiot was exactly what he was going for, and, no snark, he hit it out of the park.

262,Michael Kenmore,"Good suspense and acting, but could be better without constant F-bomb as filler dialogue",5,9 January 2020,"If Safdie Brothers could cut the language in half or even two-third, this movie would be salvageable with a better score than the current C+ Cinemascore, which is probably in reaction to the non-stop barrage of F-bomb throughout this movie.If Safdie Brothers -- given their youthful age past age 30 -- cannot make the future movies without filling in excessive and constant language, then they are problematic in their delusional thinking that the more frequent and foul the profanity is, the better and more intense the movie is.This is one of the most foul movies I've seen, the other irredeemable lurid trash Summer of Sam.This said, I enjoyed the suspenseful structure, even though it's constantly shouting and yelling that confound me as to who's saying who, with shaky cinematography and frenetic editing. But, the insanely constant barrage of profanity is ultimately distracting that made this movie feel emotionally numb and hollow, leaving a bad and glum mood in the audience as we leave the theatre.If only Safdie Brothers simply tone down the language, then this movie would be slightly redeemable. But F-bomb is just too much even for me to the point of vexation that ""profanity as the only screenplay"" undermines the movie, regardless of good acting by the leads and supporting.If Safdie Brothers cannot make a movie without F-word as the only dialogue filler every few seconds or less, then they deserve to be called out as the hack filmmakers, because they literally do not know how to and cannot make movies without carpet bombing of the four-letter word, among other profanities and blasphemies, thus demonstrating their filmmaking talent to be much less. They simply hate the audiences and think the audiences can take excessive profanity without complaint.Profanity without point and as strictly filler only undermine the story, because overrelying on profanity to tell the story is ultimately hackneyed and insulting to the audience.

I get that this was the intention, but if your intention is to make it impossible for people to relax and watch your movie, then you're deranged. Who wants to have their senses tortured when watching a movie? Horror films produce thrills that can make for a fun watch, but having a film try to be as obnoxious and loud as possible to make you feel anxious is NOT fun.

If you doubt that such a role is immensely difficult, I invite you to watch a much-lesser-known movie that I saw earlier this year: Maxim Stoyanov in the supporting role of Dima in ""Give Me Liberty."" In that movie, the director seemed to realize a few days into principal photography that Stoyanov was much more charismatic than the lead, then he was torn between following the main character's story and Dima. Stayanov tried to maintain his frenetic charm throughout the movie, but he was severely underserved by a fairly weak script and an indecisive director. He was also not as adept and experienced as Sandler, so his performance eventually caused Dima to seem like a two dimensional cartoon character. I got bored with him.I was NEVER bored with Sandler in this movie. His performance and the supporting cast's performances always lent a realistic feeling to the production. Martin Scorsese is one of its executive producers, so I'm unsurprised that it's a great film.I have minor complaints with this film. I disliked the loud, busy musical accompaniment that played when it was following Ratner in the city during our introduction to him. People were yelling over blaring non-diegetic music. Annoying.

As I'm sure you've all heard by now, Adam Sandler is great. This was probably my most anticipated film since ""IT: Chapter 2"" this year. I loved ""Good Time"" by the Safdie Brothers and that was partially why I was so excited for this film. So, although I did enjoy the film, I was slightly disappointed. Maybe, I heard a little too much about the movie before going in, hearing mostly things like ""this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat"" and ""you keep seeing the terrible decisions he makes."" I believe these aren't great depictions of the film and I think if you hear this a lot you'll expect much more than what the film actually gives. It's a solid movie that keeps you interested and has a final sequence that does in fact keep you on the edge of your seat. Nothing spectacular and I'm not sure I'd even nominate this for a Best Picture. However, I definitely recommend seeing this movie. 7.8/10.---------------------------------------BREAKDOWN-------------------------------------DIRECTION:
I do really love the direction. You can tell the Safdie Brothers clearly have a style they stick too and you can definitely tell they have a couple inspirations. They don't hide that either as they've even said in interviews how big of fans they are of film and they've mentioned inspirations. A criticism I do have of the film is the pacing. Possibly, it's because of the fact that the first movie I've seen from them was ""Good Time"" and that Good Time is non-stop fast pace from beginning to end. I'm not too sure how much of an influence that has on my opinion, because I know this film could've succeeded being the same way, but it definitely takes a solid step back in the pace. It doesn't NEED to be very fast pace, but like I said, I really think it could've been beneficial doing so. The way it shot, however, was very impressive and is a beautiful viewing experience as far as technical and stylish direction.WRITING:
I like some of the choices the Safdie Brothers made with the writing, but the writing wasn't anything special. We've seen movies similar to this and I think there's been other films that have executed the writing better. There's a direction they take that gives the writing a reason to make certain scenarios less intense for me, but I can think of ways that creates more tension. There were a couple side stories with Howard with the mother of his children and his girlfriend, but I don't really see too much of a importance to their characters. Even more so his ex-wife or whatever Elsa from Frozen is supposed to be to him. There is an extraordinary sequence at the end of the film that really makes this movie for me. The type of writing that reminded me of Good Time and they got that perfect. Overall, it was enjoyable enough with a certain style selection that I liked, not loved.ACTING:
When you hear ""Acting"" and ""Uncut Gems"" you think Adam Sandler for sure and it's for good reason. I want to stay he steals the show, but it's his show. It's all him. Kevin Garnett was impressive, LaKeith Stanfield is simply A-List nowadays and there are multiple great performance from, Julia Fox, Eric Bogosian, Idina Menzel, Keith Williams Richards and everyone else really, but at the end of the day this is Adam Sandler's movie. Just as much as ""50 First Dates"" or any of his guilty pleasure films. Whether or not I think he should be nominated for Best Actor, I can't say. I would need to go over all of the performances and as of today, I have yet to see 1917, I still need to see Waves and Timothee Chalamet always has a shot in my eyes. He's almost automatic at this point for me.",Uncut Gems
284,filmtravel101,Solid movie w great acting and Trippy Vangelis music,7,19 December 2019,The film was a pleasant surprise as I thought it would be another silly popcorn Sandler film but it actually had some real acting from him. Not that it was a real stretch for him but it's an annoying Sandler for the entire film and it works. The directing is also solid even though the music got really trippy almost like the composer ripped off Blade Runner Vangelis which felt bizarre yet added a twisted flavor to the story. Looking forward to more films from this duet brother team. Not sure about Sandler getting an Oscar nomination but kudos for real acting. I give it a 7 as it kept me entertained the entire film and the ending was a real shocker. No spoilers,Uncut Gems
285,nagsaptarshi,Uncut Gems- Cuts Your Core,7,20 September 2021,"Uncut Gems (2019) available on Netflix is a nice, little surprise. Adam Sandler, the perennial comedian of Hollywood takes a U-Turn and turns into a gambling addict crooked businessman dealing with gems. It is not the first time you see him shedding the comedian tag and doing something meaningful though. Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Punch Drunk Love,"" or Noah Baumbach's ""The Meyerowitz Stories"" are the movies where he scored fair points for doing something meaty.Directed by Josh and Benny Safdie, this plot is spread across the time length of a couple of days wherein the protagonist is set to recover his gambling debts by placing monstrously risky bets. So, its all about the vicious cycle of greed and its consequences. The title is very much straightforward and at the same time metaphoric. The Uncut Gems are indeed dazzling at the center of the earth and at the same time burning the core of the protagonist Howard. He is a mere spectator as his life falls apart. His family life is on the ruins, his professional life has taken a bloody turn and everything is about to be torn apart. Howard tries his luck in order to rescue the sinking ship and repair the bridges he himself has burnt. And there actually you feel for Howard. Irrespective of all his vices, you get to develop a soft corner for him.Adam Sandler delivers one of the best performances of his career in this sleeper hit. He is in a state of utter confusion, absolute delusion where he fails to differentiate good and bad, what he should do and what he should not. Sandler's rock-solid performance make the character so much believable that you wonder why on earth this guy doe not get offers like this. Julia Fox as Howard's kept, Idina Menzel as Howard's wife, Lakeith Stanfield as Howard's not so trusted middleman all do fine jobs. NBA megastar Kevin Garnett playing himself was a sweet surprise. Camera works provide the necessary creepiness that the film needed every moment. The background scores are loud, cacophonous and very much in sync with Howard's delusional state of mind.Even though most of the critics were unanimous in giving thumbs up to this precious gem, the viewers were broadly divided in their opinions. Some of them even gave this a status of a cult film while so many rejected it as a trash. Indeed, if you are looking for a rosy, couch soothing film, this is not to be on your platter. But if you want something different, if you want to witness how an otherwise mediocre actor Sandler transports himself to a different level altogether this is definitely going to find a place in your watchlist.My rating- 7 out of 10.Available on Netflix.",Uncut Gems
286,noahbetancourt,Tension filled movie,8,8 January 2020,"Great film. Huge Adam Sandler fan, nice to see him do something serious. He is actually a very good actor when given good material. Not that I don't enjoy his funny films though. Lots of great supporting talent like Kevin Garnett and LaKeith Stanfield. Overall nice and interesting plot, just a little slow in the middle. Liked the very mesmerizing shots that took you through the gems. Movie was great with suspense. Really knows how to build extreme tension. One of the most suspenseful films I've seen in a while. Ending really caught me off guard.",Uncut Gems

293,eparazak,Better than your average Adam Sandler film!,7,9 January 2020,"Uncut Gems was directed by the Safdie Brothers and stars Adam Sandler as a man who runs a jewlery shop in New York City. After he comes across a rock with several gems stored inside it, he places a bidding on it and it causes some serious problems for his store, family, love-life and his own life.I'll be honest, I wish I could get more into the hype for this movie, but sadly, I felt it to be slightly too flawed for me to truly get invested into it. That's not to say Uncut Gems is bad, I still think it's a good movie admittedly. I feel like the flaws keep it from being a masterpiece in my eyes. There are certain times within the movie that feel a bit disjointed. I feel like certain plot-points, specifically with the main character's family, feel pointless by the end of the movie. Finally, I feel like the movie can get too loud and obnoxious at times.With these flaws out of the way, it is FAR superior to most of his other works. Sandler's performance, for instance is really good as this unlikable egotist that gets himself into various shenanigans. I thought the plot-points that worked had a major impact on the story in the long-run. I found the story's third act very exhilarating, gripping and especially tense. That's easily where it felt most like a thriller. Sandler's character made for a very interesting one, considering that he is an unlikable jerk. Finally, I really liked the production design and the cinematography work.7/10",Uncut Gems
294,ernestsavesxmas,Amazing despite my astronomic expectations,9,13 January 2020,"The Safdie Brothers return with another anxiety-fueled thriller. While they didn't invent the form, they're quickly rising to the top as the masters of it.This film is excellent, though on a personal level it suffered FOR ME from a rare case of astronomic expeditions that couldn't possibly met:Did I love their previous film so much that I consider it to be among the greatest of the decade? CHECKAm I an unapologetic super fan of The Sandman who feels that he still hasn't unleashed his best acting? Mighten we see it here? CHECKDo I gamble on sports + love the concepts and world of sports betting? CHECKIs Mike Francesa, who I grew up listening to on the radio, playing a bookie named Gary in this movie, his first dramatic acting role? CHECKAnd so on and so forth. That I probably loved Good Time more isn't a knock on this. It shouldn't be, even if it feels like it is. I wouldn't be shocked if this isn't the more universally loved picture by the masses in the end. It was just too close to home in a lot of ways to cut that deep FOR ME.Nitpicking aside, I still LOVED this movie. The Safdies' willingness to utilize actors with little to no experience, and in the successful way in which they do, is truly mesmerizing. Sure, I would love to see them step back from the frenetic pacing style at some point, but honestly: if this is their only mode from here on out, that would be fine. They do it extremely well.",Uncut Gems

296,MdlndeHond,Great performance... Weirdest music ever,7,22 December 2019,"Sandler is doing a great performance, one of his best since punch drunk love. The dynamics makes you feel that you're in the room with him.
A genuinely unlikeable personality makes that even more real.Having said this, the soundtrack is distracting, loud and flat out horrible. I'm sure there is a deeper meaning to it but for me it's got annoying to no end.",Uncut Gems
297,pcrprimer,Tense movie that keeps you on edge right into the ending,7,31 December 2020,"After countless recommendations, I finally watched this movie. Sandler is wonderfully punchable in this role as a fast talking conman. For most of the movie, as the viewers, we are just as confused as those in the movie. The ending is unpredictable, but understandably, the only way it could have ended",Uncut Gems
298,juliendussault,Who the H E double bendy straws is calling this movie a masterpiece,2,11 March 2020,"If you're a jeweler, are into jewlery, and know the intricate ins and outs of both gambling and being a jeweller in New York and you LOVE to hear Adam Sandler and the whole cast yelling, hooting and hollering then this is the movie for you.I feel bad that Adam Sandler actually took this role, because thus film is a chaotic mess that unless you are a jeweler, with an intricate knowledge on how to sell jewlery to Rappers and Basketball players, as well as an intricate knowledge on the jewel trade in NYC, you will be so confused from start to that flat, dull thud of an end.This movie is hooting, actually it's hollering, but maybe it's all just yelling. Adam Sandler plays Gilbert Gottfried impeccably throughout this entire film. If your eyes were closed, throughout this film you would honestly believe that Gilbert Gottfried was screaming in your ear. Overall Masterful method acting.The script is so chaotic and is just madness that is not even worthy of being called a film. It should just be an example of what happens when you live beyond your means, and why you should never ask Adam Sandler to method act Gilbert Gottfried.I cannot believe that this movie even made it past screening let alone the table that it was written on.Adam Sandler does a good job as Eiago considering how terrible this script is, but one good actor doesn't mean jack when the script sucks and the direction is on par with any D grade SYFY channel movie.So glad that I rented this and didn't pay to go see it in the movie theater, and so glad that I went to Walmart today and got myself some BC powder because you'll need it after you finish this movie.Honestly not worth your time.",Uncut Gems
299,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Get A Discount On The Uncut Gems,8,7 January 2020,"The Stream: Typical storyline and some really bad teethThe Big Screen: An intense film that depicts the dangers of gamblingThe Final Bill: A solid movie that is best watched in a loud environment and with friends-S2SThis movie stars and I do mean stars Adam Sandler in what some may say is his best performance. It's a mix of classic Sandler with terrible teeth and good acting. Sandler plays a jeweler who constantly finds himself too deep in the situations he's created. Let's see if he can dig himself out.The summary above is the most I can give you without ruining the already simple storyline. Strangely enough, the movie is predictable but not ruined by that fact. We've seen this plot in many movies before, but it's the execution and the cast that differentiates this movie. Sandler, LaKeith Stanfield, Julia Fox, others and yes even Kevin Garnett do a really great job in this movie. Sandler's performance, minus the teeth, was the perfect stereotypical portrayal of this character. When we he is high, we are high. When he is manic, we feel manic. Ultimately, I found myself saying how deep can my man go and get out of, and boy, do we find out.Here are the trouble spots of this movie, which might be controversial. This movie is ""too loud"" for some viewers. Everything in this movie is loud, over the top and in your face. While I enjoyed most of it, I do realize how this atmosphere/culture displayed could be ""annoying or offensive"" to certain viewers. I can understand how certain viewers just wouldn't appreciate the contemporary nature of things occurring in the movie. Some might say it's too ""urban"". *side eyes those people* But truthfully, the movie was on the borderline of being too in someone's face.Long story short, Uncut Gems is a film that is both super predictable but nevertheless not ruined by its predictability. The intense nature of this film ultimately lends itself to being seen. Now, I leave that up to you all. You absolutely don't need to see this in the theater, but I will note the nature of the big screen and music could amplify the viewing nature. Your best bet is watching this at home with a few betting friends and make a few drinking game wagers through the film.",Uncut Gems
300,monberger,A hell of a film!!!,10,28 December 2019,"Hell of an intense ride Thriller/Drama. This is definitely a different movie and that's why I love it. I want to start by saying that kept me in the whole time and watching it it made me feel angry and I started to hate Howard (Adam Sandler). That's the beauty of a film when watching it brings out those feelings. What a phenomenal performance by Adam Sandler. He deserves at least an Oscar nomination. I hope they don't overlook his performance. Great script, music, direction, just overall was a fantastic film. I see many people hated it and others loved it. I thought was a really great movie!!!

Yes - it is true that Sandler did a decent job playing a very unlikeable character that was very different than any character he normally plays. The problem is the story is an annoying mess and so are all the characters. The story goes nowhere and is over-long. Everyone is annoying to hear. No one is likable.

303,Mike_O_Dwyer,Sandler's Frenetic Gamble Is A Winner,9,10 January 2020,"Sandler takes a gamble dipping his toes back into a drama, one where missteps pile up with increasingly dire consequences and payoffs are always just out of reach.Sandler's Howard Ratner is a precious gem dealer who makes deals with anyone who even smells like they might have been in recent contact with cash. He also has a gambling problem. And a loan shark problem. And marital problems. Employee problems. Hangers on problems. Mistress problems. His problems have problems. Nothing is ever straight-forward. Every deal becomes compromised. Every bet needs to be bigger. Every payoff just leads to more of the same. This is a man who borrows from one shark to feed another and is always one angry debt collector away from losing it all.While everything starts promisingly with the arrival of a precious uncut black opal still encased in rock, and a celebrity client who takes a shine to it, it's not long before a loan/swap delays a deal, and from there it's a frantic race to make any kind of big bet that can pay everyone off.Sandler looks like he will explode from the crushing stress of it all at any moment. He never seems to be able to catch a break from people who want a piece of him - figuratively and literally. He is relentlessly pursued by everyone while relentlessly pursuing some hail Mary gamble that will save his neck and you just can't look away from this car crash of a life as it unfolds.Fantastic.",Uncut Gems

Because that is the main thing I'll remember about most of the dialogs. It is really very disturbing as it doesn't help the average acting and atmosphere in any way.

311,Vivkon,Find Your Egregore,10,1 January 2020,"Uncut Gems (2019) presents fantastic storytelling with outstanding screenplay and a superb cast. This movie incites an abnormal level of anxiety - sounds, camera and visual effects haunt your mind, even after leaving the theater.This is the story of a man who lives ""on the come."" The main character Adam Sandler is excited to make money from his desires and passions. His needs and goals are a priority at the expense of his family and friends. He believes in his dream and does not give up under any circumstances.The persistence of the moving camera and a loud and noisy soundtrack create an atmosphere of anxiety. Who the real satellite of Howard's universe is isn't clear - lover (Julia Fox), wife (Idina Menzel), or uncut gems. All his satellites shine in some kind of sexual, intellectual or literary meaning. But even the strong light of his satellites cannot not help to secure his equilibrium, his sense of gravity - and not spin off his axis.Meanwhile, this movie is a great art representation of the risks in human life. If somebody finds his / her egregore (""thoughtform"") an relies on this, it is not necessary to eliminate he risk of future outcomes of their business, sport and whatever else activities. The risk is in the blood of people of who play for high stakes. This movie perfectly underlines and dramatizes the real facts related to accepting the risks. And loss is the reverse side of any risk behavior. The final scenes of the movie raise the debate of the role of risks in human life.

Some of his films are pretty funny, especially his early stuff. And if there is any highlight of this film is Sandler showing he has some diversity in his acting.But that's it. Its a wall of noise. Its confusing, loud, without plot. The characters seem wholly unlikable. Its done in a semi-documentary style, which cheapens the film further. I believe the directors felt this style probably added a sense of realism to it, but the characters were not realistic anyway.Its listed as comedy/crime/drama.

I mean the conversations between the actors are very fast, causing a kind of confusion, which in other films I would not like, but which in this film gives a special touch. Adam Sandler was spectacular, I think it's one of his best 3 performances, even if he he played a role he has rarely played. Some of the scenes in the movie are surreal, like the one where KG, Demany and the other guy are locked in the lobby of Howard's shop. However, those scenes are the ones that give the film a special touch, because the most unexpected things can happen in real life, even when you need things to go well. Normal human beings, doing normal things, that sometimes get out of their control, if they were ever under their control. That's it.",Uncut Gems

Having to watch Sandler suffer misfortune after humiliating misfortune, all the while knowing he fully deserves it is not compelling viewing.Watching goons act like goons is not particularly interesting, but watching Sandler play a greasy older Billy Madison is literally a chore.

324,andrewburgereviews,The redemption of Adam Sandler,10,26 March 2020,"""Everything I do is not going right"" sobs Howard just before the climax and perpetual ending of this unrelenting movie directed by The Safdie Brothers (Benny Safdie, Josh Safdie). Howard Ratner's gambling addiction is a way of life, he lives with it and he likes it, he finds intellectual superiority in his abilities of observation. The way his bets turn out, is like he has a divine premonition--his very inheritance guarantees success from his very core.""Uncut Gems"" runs straight-through from the beginning--it exists in a constant state of emergency and presence. Most of the movie is devout of large, panoramic shots. Instead, we are mostly following Howard close-up and as his life spirals more out of control, our focus on him is in even more control. The success of such an approach relies solely on the lead actor. Adam Sandler is living proof that his questionable CV was not due to his acting skills. He is tethered to Howard on an emotional level. His performance is not a revelation as much as it is a liberation. And his nasal approach to his voice--while taking some time getting used to--is Sandler giving a personal thank you to his character--few actors can pull this off.But despite its singular focus, ""Uncut Gems"" also seems to go even deeper on multiple characters than it goes on its lead. The notion of an uncut gem is an unpolished jewelry, it is unfiltered. Like the uncut gem in question in the movie, it is both ugly and beautiful and has mystical powers of connection. When Howard show up at his jewelry store's desk with the gem, showing it off to Boston Celtics' Kevin Garnett (he plays himself), epileptic shots of his past go through his eyes--is like his life flashes before him. It is rich people coming in contact with richness itself. For Garnett, it was a theological reverence--paradoxically, the gem is pure because it is naturally ragged. ""They say you can see the entire Universe in it"" says Howard smugly. This is the mastery of this movie--it uses material things as an analog for human desires which go beyond riches--they include prestige, respect, social and moral superiority.The movie explodes in a scene in which Howard plans on putting all that he's earned up to that point in an unlikely bet--yet his excitement in his eyes shows a man who has never been more sure in his life. He explains his decision like a mastermind and this is going to be his masterpiece. The way the Safdie Brothers fill each frame with neon lights offsetting the ominous, addictive and sinful nature of the men in question is to draw attention to the outside beauty.I should've seen the ending coming--but I didn't. The last 30-something minutes of ""Uncut Gems"" are unbearable to watch. The movie gives you a taste of the natural emotional high Howard is addicted to. It is, in a way, a wake-up call. But it is also dangerous because I loved it. I loved it a lot and like Howard, I want more.",Uncut Gems

Adam Sandler has never been a serious actor and as a comedy guy he is pretty great; in this movie he is forced to do serious stuff and fails to delivers a powerful performance. No, yelling like there is no tomorrow doesn't mean you're good actor.
The rest of the cast does a pretty regular job.Moving along to camera work:

It feels like it's out of the 80s, the cars in the streets are modern. His diamond district store might as well be out of Hardcore Pawn.I think the plot has to do with Sandler playing Howard having obtained an uncut Ethiopian black opal which he is trying to make big bucks on, meanwhile his marriage seems on the rocks and he gambles. I'm pretty sure there are other movies like this done better without the frenzied screaming and F bombs.You don't feel anything for the characters because there really isn't any developed backstory.If you can sit through it it's watchable it's just not very good.",Uncut Gems

I knew exactly where this was going from the very first moment I saw Howard on the screen.It's also confusing- there are many plot holes and way too many side characters.

340,impendingdd,Sandler's best role and thus far Sadfie Bro's best film,10,8 March 2020,"Let me start off by saying I've always liked Adam Sandler. I'm aware of the recent bombs (In performance, but not quite in Box Office or streams), but I've never came to the extent of hating him. Which, let's face it, a lot of people do. They feel robbed and cheated as if Sandler has given up caring and he's solely in it for the cash. To each their own but I've always stayed true to the Sandman. His few dramatic roles were always good (Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Funny People, etc). But this, folks, this portrayal of a New York City sleeze bag, yet highly like-able jeweler is Sandler's greatest work. He's so believable. There's never a moment where you're like ah, there's that classic Sandler. Except maybe when he's yelling. But even then he's in tip top shape, really performing, really acting and giving it his all. Sandler doesn't slack and he seems to do it effortlessly. Sandler was the ideal casting choice for one of the best films I've ever seen. Safdie Brothers have yet to disappoint with their films. This film one ups Good Time and speaks at a more mature level. And that's saying a lot because Good time was a damned good film. It's anxiety ridden, as Good Time was, with a similar soundtrack but also more creative and almost 90s feeling. It's exciting, its surprising, it's realistic, it's magical. I couldn't be more happy with this film. If you love Sandler, you'll be ecstatic watching this film. If you only know Sandler for his razzie performances, you'll be pleasantly surprised. As for the film alone, it's an American spectacle you simply can't miss. Entertaining, engaging, unexpected and heart-felt.",Uncut Gems

344,sackofwhine,"Imdb ratings are a joke, people lack taste",10,27 September 2020,"Uncut Gems is a turning point for me. Its the film that will decide if we can be friends or not. Its the film that will have an ever lasting impact on my filmmaking and how I approach filmmaking. What the Safdies have done here is nothing short of a miracle. Uncut Gems is a one in a liftetime film, it only comes around every 5 years or so. The last film that managed to do that- where I felt I experienced something lifechanging- was probably Mad Max Fury Road.The film is stressful, yes. But its also beautiful. The film uses its 35mm photography to capture the dreamlike, washed out diamond district in New York to its fullest potential. The Safdies always use real locations and real people to build the authenticity of their diegetic world- while infusing it with stylized colors and atmospheric synth music to create a visually and auditory experience. The culmination of all these things lead to a film that feels tangible and real but also dreamy and exciting. That is a massive feat, that only few directors can pull off.And then there is Adam Sandler. But I can only see Howie from now on. It is unquestionably one of the greatest acting achievements I have ever seen, a transformation that tops everything I've seen at these years Oscars. I would compare the performance on the same level as Keaton in Birdman. Sandler is otherworldly, changing his voice, his mannerisms and his language to create a character that you can instantly recognize. I was simply floored by his performance. Laughing with him, crying with him, cheering with him, hating him. It got beyond just seeing a character but a human being with all his flaws. Since you follow him every step of the way, the empathy and emotional attachment that one develops towards him is inevitable.All the other Cast Members are incredibly memorable and tangible- they take form and feel embedded in this world. Nothing and nobody feels out of place. Bravo Julia Fox, Lakeith Stanfield, Kevin Garnett, Keith Williams Richards, Idina Menzel, Judd Hirsch and the others.Darius Khondji delivers shots that go right under your skin. Daniel Lupatins score sounds like neo-noirish 80s fever dream. Benny Safdie and Ronald Bornstein deliver precise and intelligent editing work. The filmmaking here is on a whole new level.Uncut Gems is another film milestone for me. Good Time was a milestone for me too, but Uncut Gems is something that I will think about for the rest of my life.",Uncut Gems
345,mc1382,Absolutely Phenomenal,10,29 December 2019,"Weirdly this film reminded of me of Marriage Story in that it uses realism and guttural emotion to immerse you in the ferocity of the film's tone. The difference here is that Uncut Gems stresses events more so than conversation. While Marriage Story alternates between different conversations and perspectives, Uncut Gems put's emphasis on multiple wheels cogging in the machine. Howard (played excellently by Adam Sandler) is the centrepiece in all of this, the guide if you will.The film doesn't explain some of the contexts behind his dealings but as the film goes on we start to learn about why he put himself in this situation or more importantly how he *feels* about it. By using a variety of events, conversations and mini climaxes within even one scene, we see the mental toll it has on Howard. The struggle, the success, the failures it all happens sometimes in the span of multiple scenes. The film masterfully allows you to feel empathy for Howard even if you disagree with a lot the actions he commits. An example of this would be towards the end of the second act where Howard breaks down and shows a moment of vulnerability. Up to this point, we have had a constant assault of him shouting, arguing and compromising so when he starts to break down it's not only a release for Howard but for the audience too. All of a sudden I started feeling the emotions Howard was experiencing and had a moment of tears welling up. The film had invested and engrossed me so much that I ended up balling my eyes out without a moments notice.That's how effective Uncut Gems is as an emotional experience, it completely invests you in Howard even if can't relate to him on any capacity. The amount of craft and precision to pull that off is remarkable. I would even go as far as to say that is more impressive than writing a character that is relatable to the audience. Despite a few bumps in the road along the way (mainly to do with the first act and a couple of scenes being less effective in its intention than others) Uncut Gems is a must-see film and is one of the defining films of the 2010s. I don't know yet if it's better than Good Time but for now, let's just call it equal.",Uncut Gems

Several friends had raved about it, but from what I knew of the film, and the Safdie brothers (recently profiled in the New Yorker), I didn't think it would be my thing. I was totally wrong. It's extremely anxiety-inducing, with an excellent and propulsive score, as I nearly held my breath the entire time, while poor Howard made one bad decision after another.

351,j-madej,"Brilliant assault on senses with very high stakes that in the end pay off, big time!",9,28 December 2019,"In my life I visited New York twice. Both times I had a different assessment of the town. First time I went to visit a girl I was in love with at the time and stayed in Manhattan hanging out with the group of trendy actors and models, club and bar hopping, having VIP treatment. Going in front of the line in clubs feeling like the whole world belong to me. Second time I came there with my ex girlfriend when I auditioned for the New York City Ballet and the American Ballet Theatre. Yes, I was a professional Ballet dancer back in a day and to safe money me and my ex responded on the advert about accommodation which end up being a squatter house in Brooklyn without windows or doors. Due to the fact that my ex got flu we had to find hotel in short notice and that fact depleted our finances which we were recovering from for months to come. This second visit show us how chaotic, rude and unforgiving the New York can be. It's a town, when you have money you feel like a king, however when you struggle it's one of the most hash environments where only strong survive.
When I heard about 'Uncut Gems' directed by brothers Josh and Benny Safdie I wasn't sure what to expect, specially considered that there is a Oscar buzz created around the dramatic performance of Adam Sandler as jeweller who is spiralling down the rabbit hole. He is trying to juggle health concerns, gambling habit, family life, super hot girlfriend on the side, on top of trying to manage jewellery shop which he is the owner, as well as going through a mental crisis, all at the same time. As the protagonist in the movie, we as the audience are being assaulted on our senses, due to the fact that most lines of dialog are overlapping, making it sound like improvisation. This fact creates in viewer sense of stress similar to what protagonist feels. People shout at one another trying to get their point across. In this environment only the strong survive and any sign of weakness is being exploited by your competitors or enemies. Adam Sandler character jeweller Howard Ratner isn't a sympathetic guy.
He is cheating on his wife with his co worker Julia (Julia Fox) who is a highlight of the movie and a newcomer to Hollywood A-list scene, considering that before 'Uncut Gems' she only acted in one other short film. Yes, she is super hot, but also brings depth and colour in their complicated relationship. As we follow Sandlers's character through the day, we can't help but hope that the gambling dramas he is intertwining himself will pull it through and finally scores big.
That's where the movies succeeds, in the set up of how high the stakes are and as we know in filmmaking the higher the stakes the better the pay off at the end.
Few things stood out for me in 'Uncut Gems', this film is a very strong contender to an Oscar for sound design and sound mix. Above mentioned chaos we feel is largely motivated by overlapping dialog as well as sounds of the city and interiors. We almost wish for the film to finish, so we can recuperate emotionally from the assault on the senses. This aspect of the movie is better handled then any other film this year.
'Uncut Gems' highlights are also the performances. Adam Sandler delivers possibly his best dramatic role to date. He was offered this role 10 years ago, but he felt he needed the age to pull it off. He shows in this performance dramatic ability, though as character he is far from perfect he make us care for his fate and due to the course of tribulation we are keeping our fingers crossed for him to succeed in the end.
Other supporting cast including above mentioned Julia Fox is very solid indeed. Actor/rapper Lakeith Stanfield has been having a very good run the last few years with his performances in 'Get Out', 'Sorry to Bother You ', 'Knives Out' and now 'Uncut Gems'. Each role gave him possibility to showcase different side to his craft and I am pretty sure we will see him in more movies based on the strength of this supporting performance.
Even basketball player Kevin Garnett who is making his acting debut on the big screen delivers believable performance, as a superstitious NBA star who is obsessed with buying an uncut diamond, which in this story becomes so called ""Chekhov's Gun"".
There is a lot to like in this film which in itself is very entertaining through it's lengthy 135 minutes running time. The speed of narration is super fast here and this is exactly what directors intended. We are close to an award season and I strongly feel this Jewish New York story will be rewarded by the Academy next year. How much? Only time will tell.",Uncut Gems

Most of his walkings and roamings take place in the central business district. This shows a busy entreprenuer in a busy enviromment justicely done by an eye catching setting. Time is not on his side but He manages to appeal to all figures in his life:from family to side girl and from job to hobby-betting. He needs to make a quick move like KG who also wants this spirited gem of Howard. A consensus can be reached if Howard makes life easy for his debtors as well as KG. But the performance of the debtors was worrying for fanatics of hardship hustling films. Their oppression and pressure was meaningless at time and did not deliver and spice into such great perfomance of Sandler. In the end they took his life and everything went dark. This film must be one of the best hustle films of the decade and I recommend to everyone out there who wants to combine love with hustle.,Uncut Gems

ONE THING -,9,4 January 2020,"The script needs periodic narration from perhaps a sympathetic friend or family member, a voice that could clarify the situations and, more importantly, give us a break from Sandler's draining energy and madness. For an audience not well versed in the subject of sports betting and the financial tricks being played, the relentless pace, while exciting, is also frequently annoying. Still, his domestic life, does contain issues that allow us to understand exactly what he is destroying in order to feed his greed and enormous ego: his family. I don't believe there's ever been anything quite like Adam Sandler's deep dive into self-destructive neurosis ever before in a movie. Perhaps the movie can best be seen as a case study of mental illness that can have no happy outcome.
UNCUT GEMS comes so close to being a great movie that you wish the screenplay had trusted their audience a bit to not lose interest if occasionally things slowed down for some unseen narrator to comment on this sad little man's life and troubles.

Ratner is in more ways than one despicable cheat; but he's also someone who can't assist but love the crowd. As his different systems become more complicated, Ratner's hole digs deeper and deeper.With the ideal combination of arrogance and nervous insecurity, Sandler portrays Ratner's reckless descent. He's the man who believes he's covered with all the corners ; but he's really hanging on by a lucky thread.The performance of Sandler fits completely into the natural and edgy filmmaking style of the Safdie brother. The siblings patiently build a narrative that is an unpleasant and riveting experience. The more turbulent the waters Ratner is swimming in, the more difficult it is for one to look away. In fact, Uncut Gems is a rare treasure, a thrilling and darkly funny film.",Uncut Gems
363,gooseshaw,Well-made but it feels like disaster porn.,7,1 April 2020,"This movie is slow. That's probably my main problem with it. It's two hours long, but feels more like three. The first half is filled with chaotic noise, ambient music that doesn't stop, and mumbling dialogue that overlaps itself. It's honestly frustratingly difficult to understand what's going on at times because there doesn't seem to be any kind of structure to any of the scenes.The second half adjusts itself, and starts to pick up plot wise. But I have to say, I found myself getting restless. I checked how long was left in the movie multiple times, and at one point was shocked to see I was only half way through.The characters are frustrating. There aren't really any likeable characters in the movie, they're all pretty garbage people. That's the point though I suppose. Still, this only made it even more frustrating to get through. It doesn't surprise me that this was directed by Benny Safdie, who also made Good Time (2017) - another movie where we just watch bad things happen to dumb people who make stupid choices. In the last 10-20 minutes or so, the plot picks up. The last bit is rather exciting and includes some very real (and expected) outcomes. I really enjoyed this part of the movie.Everyone talks about Adam Sandler's acting in this movie. It was good I suppose. I don't really watch his movies though so I don't know what to compare it to. The movie was well acted I thought. The cinematography could get claustrophobic, which was perhaps intentional and meant to compliment the general 'noisiness' of the film, but it continued to be claustrophobic even in the more calm scenes. The music was interesting. I thought it fit pretty well but there were also times where it annoyed me, mostly in those noisy scenes.I don't have much more to say really. I won't be re-watching it personally. I'm not even entirely sure it deserves a 7, but a 6 feels too low. I'd still recommend it though.",Uncut Gems
364,faroukgulsara,All for what,6,30 January 2020,"Every day we push our boundaries. We test the waters. We want to stretch our luck an extra inch, hoping that it would give better outcomes. When met with resistance, we recoil only to return to repeat the whole imbroglio all over again. We plead for clemency when our sneaky plan is discovered, knowing very well that it is not for real. Back in our minds, we are aware that it is certainly not the last, even though we say so. We tend to take things for granted.The only problem is that we realise that the threshold is breached when it is a wee bit too late. By that time, the damage is irreparable, and the point of no return has been reached.The first Monday of the new year is dubbed as the 'Divorce Monday'. After months and even years of sweeping the brewing trouble under the proverbial carpet, the events surrounding Christmas and New Year must have had burst the bubble. It is said to be the busiest day for family lawyers when they get the most enquiries regarding divorces.I discovered 'Uncut Gem' to be a difficult film to watch. I found myself very unsettled. All through the show, all I saw was the protagonist, Adam Sandler, a diamond merchant, Jewish of course, just going around shouting, cursing profanities, blabbing incessantly on his mobile, lying through his teeth and yakking. He is a poor role model for a husband and a father as his tryst with his vivacious mistress is an open secret. He tries to wrangle himself through all his deals because of the money he hopes to make for himself and his family. He rolls dough, cut deals, fixes auctions, bends the truth, dodges the mob and more just to find out that he is not the beneficiary at the end. All for what? For whom to savour the fruit or gloat in the nectar?",Uncut Gems
365,spencer-w-hensley,Sandler is outstanding but the film is a disappointment overall,5,19 February 2021,"Adam Sandler has been a screen presence that I have mostly been fond of whether his role is comedic or dramatic. His earlier films are far better than almost everything he did post-2006 so when I heard the unanimous reviews for this and that he could even get a possible Oscar nomination I knew I couldn't miss it.Well his performance certainly didn't disappoint. He was simply fantastic demonstrating a lot of range and playing a character unlike any we had ever seen him play before but I found the overall film to be disappointing.The reason is just that the story just isnt that interesting aside from a few plot twists which I will not reveal. Given the fact that the characters are mostly unlikable doesnt really bother me as this is a dark film after all but the plot seemed uninvolved, confused and just flat out slow.I do not mean to dismiss the quality of Sandler's performance in spite of the film's mediocrity. Again he gave an exceptional performance, I just would have liked to have seen this performance in a different movie. Still Sandler made the movie watchable at least until the very end due to a very emotional, broad performance.Is this the worst movie Adam Sandler has been in? Absolutely not. He has done worse before and may even do much worse in the future, but it is by no means one of his best in my book. It may be one of his better performances but a good performance can be in a so-so movie which sadly is the case here.I really wanted to like the movie and Sandler's performance together but the plot was thin and slow and in the end I could only appreciate the range and depth of Sandler's acting rather than the movie as a whole.If you're a Sandler fan and bored to death with nothing else to do I would say watch for his performance but only as a last resort if you have nothing else better to do with your time.",Uncut Gems

368,asandor,The loudest film I have ever seen; chaos and style,7,30 April 2020,"Uncut Gems, directed by the Safdie brothers, and starring Adam Sandler in one of his best roles to date, is quite the film. It follows a Jewish jeweler (Sandler) who is known for serving local gangsters, rappers, basketball players, and other on-the-edge New Yorkers. He is a total shyster, pawning loaned items to bet on basketball, cheating on his wife with one of his staff, and treating many of his employees poorly. Even so, he gets cheated himself, loaning a rare uncut black opal to a basketball star as a good luck charm, while pawning his traded one of a kind championship ring then using the money to bet on a game. Unfortunately, local moneylenders are after him for his debt, and his antics are wearing thin - the violent moneylenders hound him more and more, as his marriage falls apart, and he continues to try and strike rich in a strange fixation on basketball betting.This film has one major draw, which also makes it rather innovating and interesting; its loudness. This film is chaos, with competing sounds, yelling, ambient noise, and chaotic shots making a cacophony of visual and audio noise that raises one's hackles and induces anxiety. It is a chaotic ride, not wholly unenjoyable, but certainly stylistically charged. The music and some of the scenes in this film, including a wonderful scene where the opal is viewed and turns into a panning shot of time and space, is a huge plus. I also loved the music. Finally, Sandlers acting (as well as the supporting roles) are absolutely fantastic in many ways. This is a well made film indeed; solid direction, and production abound.However, this is film is notable for being somewhat dull in places - in my opinion. I did not always enjoy this film, even with the innovative chaos that is built in. Some scenes just feel like filler, and this, paired with the anxiety inducing style, make the film difficult to watch not just through style, but do to a lack of events, in my opinion.This is an excellent film in many ways, and it deserves its reputation, not least as a film that Adam Sandler nailed to a T. I personally loved the stylistic elements coming from the Safdie brothers innovative style as well. Even so, the anxiety of the film, and some of its duller moments, in my opinion overall detract from what I believe was close to being a big hit for me and my filmophile experiences. Still definitely worth a watch even as a film that will certainly be devisvie, and may elevate to cult status one day. This film will have a well deserved base of fanatics, and it deserves it. Not fully my cup of tea, but by no means a regret.",Uncut Gems

370,Brad_G35,Great idea. Needs better execution...,6,17 January 2020,"A good movie. It's definitely worth watching but I don't understand why folks were so upset that it was snubbed by the Oscars.While I had a good time with it, it's not really a classic and we'll all likely forget about this movie within 5 years. Had this came out any other time of the year, I doubt anyone would be talking about it.There are a few dull moments midway through where it's tough to determine where they're taking this movie. Those dull moments also made me want to give up on the movie. Adam Sandler should also try to do more movies like this and stop throwing turds at the wall.The entire movie is all over the place. I don't mean to say that in a bad way. It's more of a it's all over the place which really doesn't give you much time to know these characters and relate to them.You can immediately see why Sandler auditioned for this role. Basketball. Boston. A gambling sports man. Paranoia. This role was practically made for him. I think the idea of this film is great but the execution could've been better.When seeing Kevin Garnett and the NBA in this movie, I'm honestly surprised the NBA allowed it after the entire ref gambling ordeal a decade ago.No spoiler: Even with the payoff. Normally I would like payoffs like the one in this movie but for some reason this payoff felt hollow. I'll be interested to watch this movie again while knowing the ending to see if my opinion changes.",Uncut Gems

And the production, directing and acting were quite incredible.However, I found the script to be claustrophobic and unthinking, perhaps what the producers wanted. I found Sandler's character to be so intensely unlikeable, it was hard to see the movie as a whole. Yes, I was aware the entire movie how well-produced it was, how committed the actors were, especially Sandler. How difficult the cross dialogue and action was. It's a major achievement in those respects.And, sadly, there were places in the movie that I was just plain bored. I even began to look at my iPhone messages, etc. Not good.Sandler pulled off quite an incredible and difficult performance, Oscar-worthy, but yesterday I saw A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood, and in spite of disliking Tom Hanks for many years, I was astonished by the nuances of his performance, so I will be rooting for him as best actor, rather than Sandler.

It's frantic, unpredictable, exhausting, anxious, paranoid, visceral, and I enjoyed the hell out of it. I can admire it and it's effectiveness at putting the viewer in the world of Howard Ratner. Uncut Gems is also shockingly unsentimental about it's characters and what befalls them. You may laugh, you may gasp, but you'll be surprised one way or another.

Don't know why that description is added here.It is a fast-paced and well told story about a very compelling character. Sandler disappears more or less completely into the role and drives the movie with his wonderful performance. That he isn't nominated for an Oscar is baffling.The movie works about 80 or 90% of the time, hence the rating of 8 and ends on a reasonably satisfying note. I think most people, whether a Sandler fan or not, will like the movie.There is a fair amount of violence, so be warned about that.Also be warned that this ISN'T Sandler being an asshat clown, in an SNL skit, blown up to movie length.This a serious movie and a serious role and he's actually acting and he is very good.This is the best thing that he has EVER done.",Uncut Gems

It's probably the most tense, panic inducing, fast paced drug-adled state of a movie I've ever seen. It's got one hell of a performance from Adam Sandler, another stiff at the Oscars based on what I saw, amazing cinematography, and some of the best editing I've seen in a movie, both in terms pacing and sound. If you ever wondered what movie is the gold standard for gambling addiction, this is it. It's like living a gambling addiction live on screen, a frenzy and cacophony of noise, violence and vulgarity. It's like witnessing a drug induced fight, and it's not even about drugs. I've no idea how they managed to edit sound at parts of the movie, because everyone is constantly talking, shouting or doing something erratic, and it's one heck of an experience. I can see a lot of people not being able to sit through this one, it's like being on a simulator ride, and you don't know exactly where your head is at, down is up, right is left, and when you finally get off, everyone is sick. Some people will say that was something, some will not want to experience it again, and then some will get right back to ride it in an hour. It's one of those oddities of a movie that's worth checking out under the microscope, something to experience and talk about, and it's something quite unique and interesting.

At the beginning of this year, I saw Uncut Gems the first time and I honestly didn´t have too high expectations since I´m not a fan of Adam Sandler´s typical movies.Uncut Gems knocked my socks off, though. The movie is like a 2-hour roller coaster ride without a pause for breath. Howard is constantly under power. By his own actions and by his self-expectations, he puts himself under enormous pressure. He creates problems for himself and has a talent for getting into deeper and deeper trouble. When he is supposedly lucky, reality hits him like a hammer in the face and throws him back down to earth.It is precisely this hustle and bustle that Adam Sandler passes on directly to the viewer.I was actually afraid to watch the movie again, fearing that it wouldn´t be able to excite me like it did earlier this year.

392,michaeldoud,"First Hit: A wild ride with a Jewish, gem selling, obsessive gambler.",8,28 December 2019,"First Hit: A wild ride with a Jewish, gem selling, obsessive gambler.This film starts oddly because we move between the inside of a large black opal to the colon of gem and watch seller Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler). Eerily some of the camera images reflect the similarity between both, and I guess that was the point.We follow Howard on the streets of New York, gregariously saying ""hello"" to many individuals he comes across as he makes his way to his store. The double door security that these small gem sellers use. I want to note that these doors become part of the story. Getting buzzed in by his beautiful assistant and girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox), he heads to his office in a very anxious, nervous way.The one characteristic behavior Howard displays throughout the film is one of being chased, corralled, and almost being caught but finding a way to talk himself out of being beaten up or killed each time. This is the ride we are on with Howard throughout the film.As a gambler that owes his brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian) over $100K, and other people money from his sports gambling losses, we see him in sequences of pawning stuff, giving people watches as collateral, and making wild, complex sports bets.Arriving at his desk in an early scene, he receives a Styrofoam box, which has him very excited. Opening the box, there are two fish, he squeezes each of them looking to feel something. We know this is an illicit shipment of something. He finally cuts one open to reveal the sizeable uncut opal we saw, and were inside of, in the opening sequence.His plan is to auction the opal off for nearly a million dollars, and it will free him from the money he owes to bookies and to finalize the divorce his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) while providing for his three kids, and make his girlfriend happy.Enter Kevin Garnett, the basketball player. He's brought to Howard's store because of their mutual friend ""The Weekend"" (The Weekend). Howard shows him some of the stuff in the store and in a moment of pride, shows him the uncut opal. Kevin is mesmerized by the opal and asks to take it for a night. Reluctantly, Howard agrees if Kevin gives up his Boston Celtics championship ring as collateral. Thinking he can get away with it, Howard pawns Kevin's ring to make a quick bet hoping to capitalize a big win and pay everyone back, get the ring out of hock, auction the stone, make a bunch of money and live a happy fulfilled life with his girlfriend.However, we know compulsive gamblers rarely finish first, and so the film follows this big setup until its end.The scenes where Howard is having difficult conversations with his wife, bookies, or employees, are amazing and probably not easy to do. He seems to never hear what the other person is saying and continues the conversation as if the person whom he's speaking with understood and agreed with what he has said. This is rarely the case and so there are many scenes where people are merely talking over each other. Listening to these two different dialogues and attempting to follow both conversations during a shouting session was both amusing and challenging.I thought the scenes were very well set up in that they seemed to always have an edge that everything was going to come off the rails any minute. There was a franticness in everything on the screen that kept the film moving along at a rapid clip despite its 135-minute running time.Sandler was perfect for this role, and I could easily see why the Safdie brothers wanted him for the part. Like the film ""Punch Drunk Love,"" Sandler can bring a desperate dark edge to his characters and make it totally believable. Here the monster is his addiction to the big win. Maybe an Oscar-worthy performance. Garnett was terrific as himself. That might sound funny, but often sports stars are awkward when being filmed, but Kevin was dynamite. The Weekend was perfect as the sly, trying to make a buck, go-between. Two scenes stood out; one in Howard's office when he discovers Howard has been selling, hawking, or giving away the watches that he's stored in Howards safe. The other scene that stood out was in the nightclub when Howard confronts him about the opal. Fox was excellent as Howard's lover. The scenes in the apartment and in the Vegas betting room were well done and it's the latter where she stood out. Menzel as Howard's wife was utterly sarcastic and disengaged from their relationship. The look on her face when she opened their Mercedes trunk with Howard inside was priceless. Bogosian was outstanding as Howard's brother-in-law and bank. Ronald Bronstein, Benny Safdie, and Josh Safdie wrote an engaging script. But it was the directing and acting of Sandler and the rest of the team that made this film work.Overall: This film left me with mixed feelings, but I loved the story and the wild ride.",Uncut Gems

And then I saw the movie when I had the time to do so. And it was awesome. Adam Sandler has the performance of his career, he really captures the essence of a gambling addict and a very good liar. This movie is about a ""uncut gem"" that he gets his hands on from An African village. It's up for auction and pro basketball player Kevin Garnett wants it badly. And the whole story is about selfishness and how people will not stop at anything to get what they want. And I won't get into spoilers, but it gets intense near the end of the film. The one problem I have with the film is that it was overly long for the story and was not as intense throughout the whole story as I wanted it to be and how the trailer made it seem that way. But over all this film was amazing in every way.",Uncut Gems
395,Ryan_9,Snubbed by the Oscars,10,14 June 2020,"""Uncut Gems"" was amazing! I loved it! Adam Sandler was excellent, and this was his best performance in a long time. I know some people didn't like Howard because of how much he yelled, but to me he was funny and an interesting character. His appearance also made him seem like he was a real jeweler. Kevin Garnett impressed me as he should consider acting more. I liked Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), Julia (Julia Fox) and Dinah (Idina Menzel) too. I wasn't expecting to see The Weeknd appear, so that was a pleasant surprise. At first, I was skeptical about the opals being the whole premise of this, but it played off very well.Man, there was a lot of intensity throughout this. Every scene you wouldn't know what would happen or what Howard would do next. They did a good job of making it seem like it was the year 2012 with the basketball games and iPhone settings. I forgot how the NBA playoffs went in 2012, so that last game really had me on the edge of my seat and hoping that Howard's bet would be a success.The ending shocked me as I didn't expect Howard to die but I guess with the life he was living he would've met his end, eventually. I didn't have a good feeling about Arnold's men but definitely didn't see that coming. I can't imagine how Julia, Dinah and the rest reacted to the news.Overall, I'll give ""Uncut Gems"" a 10/10. Awesome movie that was definitely snubbed by the Oscars.",Uncut Gems
396,Wwmbrd,"When Idina Menzel said to Adam Sandler ""you are the most annoying man I've ever met"" she said that for everyone. Thank you, Idina.",8,20 September 2021,"""Uncut Gems"" was pretty great. It very much follows in the vein of the previous Safdie Bros' ""Good Time"", so if you've seen that, the general format of ""Uncut Gems"" will be the same. Uncut, like ""Good Time"" also focuses in on characters who do nothing but make bad decisions with terrible consequences. If ""Good Time"" was an experiment in Murphy's Law, then ""Uncut Gems"" is empirical evidence in the inevitability of repercussions. I like the degenerate gambler in Sandler's Howard Ratner though. He never fails to double down on his mistakes, and he seems to get a sick thrill out of the next opportunity to lay someone else's money on the line, even when faced with mortal danger.Speaking of which, Adam Sandler must have woken up in someone else's body. He was unrecognizable (in the best possible way) in this film, and I think it's probably his best performance to date in a dramatic film. This is not an original opinion, but he really shows off something here that he hasn't used since he was a cast member on Saturday Night Live in the 90s- heart. I think Sandler actually cared about making this movie, and doing a good job at it. Building upon the one star they could get in ""Good Time"", Uncut Gems takes it up to three, with Idina Menzel and Lakeith Stanfield working alongside Sandler as the pissed off Jewish wife and salesman/hustler respectively. Kevin Garnett qualifies partially as a cameo and partially as a starring role here, and let's just say he's definitely a better ball player than he is actor. I really liked the way the Safdies melded real life events (The 2011 NBA Eastern Semifinals) with the fictional Ratner's shenanigans with the Jewish mafia. It's quirky, but it worked really well with this material. I think the casting of Sandler and Menzel also went very well together, as they're both actual Jewish people, and are familiar with the customs- so it came across more genuinely when that stuff arose- a small detail.The Safdie brothers probably still safely qualify as indie filmmakers, but with the modest success of Good Time and the major attention Uncut Gems was paid, I think that they're well on track to make great art in the future.8/10.",Uncut Gems

398,benm-41751,A high-concept comedy thriller that leans too much on the concept,2,26 March 2020,"Uncut Gems is relentlessly hectic. The entire film is a sketchy gem dealer and gambler's life lurching forward as its frayed ends implode on each other. Along the way there's a lot of shouting and noise, with the sound design intentionally winding up the feeling of anxiety you get as you watch it.What I thought was the most intriguing thing about the movie is that it appears to be a comedy underneath the veneer of a thriller movie. There is absurdity embedded into every aspect of the movie.But at the end of the day, it's not very funny or suspenseful, or interesting. It's just unpleasant. The dialog and acting are too lumbering for me to think that anything achieved here is by design. Anything clever about the movie seems like an accidental byproduct of a joke stretched way too thin. I would certainly never watch this again.",Uncut Gems
399,nehpetstephen,Just another day in the life,9,27 December 2019,"In screenwriting classes, there's often talk about ""the inciting incident."" Why start a story where it starts? What's so special about this particular day in this character's life? What makes this the beginning of a *story* as opposed to any other random day or event in a person's life? Usually, if a writer doesn't have a good answer to those questions, then they're probably not telling a very good story.What makes UNCUT GEMS rather remarkable, however, is that there really isn't any inciting incident. Yes, the film begins in Ethiopia with the discovery of the titular gem, and when the story jumps forward several years to New York City and the main story, it's on the same day that Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is receiving that gem as part of a smuggled package. It's tempting to view the opal as some magical totem; Howie--with a tinge of racism--dismisses NBA player Kevin Garnett (playing himself) for believing that very thing, and the film itself reinforces such a belief, taking us on a too-fast-to-process surreal journey into Garnett's enraptured thoughts over the stone. The movie itself, set over several spring days with the opal at their center, never does anything to definitively counteract that the stone is a genuine good luck charm, far more powerful than the four-leaf clover on KG's championship Celtics ring. But the film is also dodgy about granting a clear value to the African opal; there is literal debate over how much to appraise the stone in dollars, and Howie is evasive when asked to pin down a number to how much he spent to acquire it, instead deflecting into a convoluted hustle about relative value. Is the opal's luck going to run out one day? Probably. That's how reality works.The film attaches itself to to the opal as though it truly is the mystical driving force of the story's momentum, but the opal is a McGuffin, a distraction from the fact that what we're watching is really just a few normal days in the life of Howie Ratner. The gambling, the hustling, the lying, the evading, the violence--this began long before the film started, and if not for the movie's definitive conclusion, it would no doubt continue endlessly. At one point Howie texts his girlfriend to ""go to Jo's and stick your head out the window""; it's telling that she knows immediately and exactly how to respond to what most regular people would respond to as a pretty extraordinary and baffling request. All of Howie's conflicts--the constant postponement of his impending divorce, his reshuffling of pawned items at negotiated interest rates, the occasional blips of threats from elderly loan sharks--are in a state of perpetual motion. The flux we witness is, quite extravagantly, Howie's state of normal.Don't believe me? Consider what another movie would do with a similar premise. The movie begins with the Chekhov's gun of a colonoscopy and the discovery of a 2cm polyp. The discovery of cancer is a classic inciting incident. Think Breaking Bad. The threat of impending mortality grants free license to do bold things in order to ensure a legacy, to provide for the survivors, or even just to check off the final bucket item lists. In this movie, though? Howie's perfectly fine. It was a routine colonoscopy, and he's got a clean bill of health. Such colonoscopies are the doctor's tunnel to wealth; what he's mined out of middle aged men's rectums has paid for a home in the Hamptons, he admits. The whole film is business at usual. That business just happens to be far more hectic, frantic, spastic, and anxiety-inducing than most of us could possibly imagine.Howie's not dying. He didn't make one bad deal and now he's in over his head. He's not struggling to achieve what he's always wanted; he's surrounded by wealth and success. It would be wrong to even call him greedy; the gain seems inconsequential, mere fungible exchange in the constant commotion that truly sustains him. Such commotion will be the only environment in which Howie can thrive until the day he dies.The Safdies capture that commotion with Altmanesque mastery. In almost every shot, a dozen things seem to be happening at once--disparate personalities with conflicting motivations arguing, haggling, conniving, conspiring. The Safdies make every relationship breathe with realism. The worldbuilding, if it can be called that, never once falters. This is a transfixing, marvelous, and highly original film, and anyone interested in seeing how a fairly unrelatable, unlikeable, and ultimately empathetic character can still command our attention in mesmerizing ways for 2+ hours should give it a look.",Uncut Gems

410,popcolin,"Big swing, big miss",5,18 December 2019,"This is one of those movies that has no likable characters, is about an hour too long, and is so bogged down by its ""realism"" that it forgets we want to be entertained. Put that with an actor that is only known for comedies, a musical celebrity (The Weeknd) that no one has talked about in 4 or 5 years, and an ending that is so atrocious it seems like they forgot the whole point of the movie. Maybe I was just expecting more but for me it was entertaining enough but still very boring. The scene that put me over the top was when the main character has to bring his kid to the city apartment where he has been keeping his ""secret"" girlfriend. Not sure why this scene was necessary, as nothing happened except eat up about 6 minutes of the movie.
Apart from that it was not worth re-visiting the same awful people scene after scene, in a story that goes nowhere. Almost no one has any redeeming value and almost nothing happens. There is the guy who is losing all his money to gambling addictions, then plenty of ""realistic"" scenes involving all the annoying people helping him sell his jewelery, then all the awful people he owes money to, this awkward and stupid relationship with his wife and then a redundant relationship with his girlfriend and then his two kids who might as well not even be in the movie except for the addition of ""family drama"" because the only other type of drama in the movie is a result of a very chaotic way of arranging some of the scenes. This would be all fine if there was some sort of payoff for any of the characters or even us as the viewers but the movie just kind of ends after a few unconvincing coincidences that just are an excuse to end the movie without coming up with an ending. 5 Stars because despite all this was a pleasant enough movie to watch with a pretty cool soundtrack.",Uncut Gems

Let's start with the good stuff first:Adam Sandler sent in a video message, greeting the London audience, which was a pretty nice thing to do, and it already set the mood for the movie, so kudos for that.Don't get me wrong, Adam Sandler is the highlight of this movie and without his awesome performance, the rating would be even lower. He is clearly going down the same route as Steve Carell in 2014 with Foxcatcher. Maybe we will see him in more drama roles in the future, as I'm sure he will be recognised for his performance, it really suits him and shows that he can do much more than comedy(!).........but that doesn't make the movie good.Kevin Garnett and The Weekend, playing themselves, is hilarious, but I'm pretty sure that wasn't what they were aiming for. This movie makes you feel physically so uncomfortable... People constantly shout at each other, this movie feels overly forced to be hectic, aggressive, unsettling, just with the intend of making the audience feel uncomfortable. I get it... it's suppose to make you feel as bad as the character Sandler plays, but I am not sure if he feels worse at the end of the movie, or my stomach.After reading a few TIFF reviews, I was excited to see this movie, but never have reviews been so misleading.I think this would have been a good short film, to stress you out for 15-20mins, but having this run for 2 hours and 15min is just to much for a sound mind.

The script has no flair to it, the writing is completely flat, weasel words and cussing, a 12 year old failing teen could have written these dialogues.

428,politicidal,"Relentless, frustrating, suspenseful, and sometimes humorous character study",8,31 July 2020,"Uncut Gems is a fascinating and deliberately anxiety-inducing drama about a NYC jeweler and gambling addict named Howard (Sandler) who is stuck with a great deal of troubleHe's indebted to some nasty people, has to juggle an estranged wife and a libertine mistress, and retrieve a valuable gemstone from Kevin Garnett. No seriously, Kevin Garnett is in this, and honestly he's not a bad actor.As for Adam Sandler, he's flat out amazing in this. It's a crime that he was not even nominated for an Oscar. I think he may have beaten Joaquin Phoenix if he was included that year. It's a career best performance. His portrayal of Howard Ratner as a sleazy but cunning antihero who truly doesn't know when to quit when he's ahead. Time and again, he makes a foolhardy decision and this should make him utterly irredeemable but I still rooted for him.It's a warts-and-all characterization that will doubtlessly turn off some viewers expecting something more squeaky clean like Sandler's more family-friendly movies. Quick warning by the way, this movie is not a comedy. There's a lot of cringe humor that leads to awkward laughs though. Almost as if it's meant to a relief for audiences stressed out at given intervals.Kudos to his female costars Idina Menzel and Julia Fox, the latter making her film debut. Menzel is given the thankless task of playing Ratner's wife who is checked out and eager to divorce him. But at the same time, there's a begrudging obligation to put up with his antics despite the affection clearly disippated from their marriage. As Howard Ratner's mistress, Julia Fox is a very beautiful woman and she could easily had been just there for 'T&A.

Very irritating, and I need to ask, why? The film is fast paced with frantic conversations with people talking over each other, which although relentless, maybe helps to portray the gambling addicted adrenalin junky of a jeweller. Also, he start and end has some pointless CGI of travelling into a jem, up a colon and into a wound. Again, why? Possibly to give a 60s feel, but the film isn't set in the 60s, it's modern.The ending was good, somewhat fulfilling if you're not the type that wants a 100% happy ending. None of the characters are particularly likeable, but Sandler, wife and girlfriend were good actors. I also thought the story interesting and gripping? Note, this is a serious role for Sandler and there is no comedy. But overall I felt it was a good film spoilt by the music track, weird CGI and not having some better development of the love attachment. Original, yes; genius, no.Should you watch it?

Sandler commands this film with an infectious performance and a character that is so slimy, so scummy and a terrible person, but Sandler manages to make you care about this guy. You hate seeing everything go wrong for him and you start to truly care.The Safdie brothers style is in full force here with great cinematography and score that gets your blood pumping. It is sure to cause anxiety in its viewers as the pulsing beat pounds you throughout. The film also manages to have creative flares in terms of its cinematography especially with the ""uncut gem"" itself. Several times throughout the film we see a close up, a zoom into the inner workings of a gem.

I wanted to leave the theater but I could not give up the chance to see how ended! The movie is kind of like a horror movie about a career in jewelry in New York City! The title depending about how you look at it is either about the subject of the movie or about the character of The anti-hero Howard Rather, played by Adam Sandler. Even if he never showed up the director deserves an academy award for casting Adam Sandler in this role, he is the best choice in American cinema today to play this role! I wanted to give it 10 stars because I respected the message and the emotion it brought out in me (something I never felt in movie before) but I never EVER want to see this movie again, so, 9 stars!",Uncut Gems
435,rsj624,"Fair Warning, Not a Popular Take",3,3 November 2020,"I did not like this film, and although I will attempt to be constructive about it, there is barely anything positive I can say about my experience with Uncut Gems.Coming off how amazing Good Time was, I expected that the Safdie Brothers would hit us all with one of the most amazing films of 2019. Instead, I found myself frustrated for 135 minutes as I watched a lot of unlikable people do a lot of uncool things all while yelling (a lot of yelling) at each other, never reaching many understandings, and I wondered why any of it had to go down the way it did, and why there was such a strong desire to aggrivate us as the audience.In short, its a comedy of errors without the comedy. It's Frustration Cinema at it's best.Most of the supporting roles did not impress me, with the exception of LaKeith Stanfield, who is easily the most enjoyable actor in the film. Idina Menzel provided a very one dimensional take on a relentlessly unsympathetic character with some serious hatred for her husband, Howard (Adam Sandler), and his girlfriend on the sly, played by Julia Fox, who acted well enough, but still felt thrown in the mix as a way to drive the plot forward during certain key moments. It was also hard to sympathize with Howard, as he was thoroughly unlikable, thickheaded, and really good at upsetting people. All of this and we are still expected as viewers to care about his whole world to begin with.If he is supposed to be such a loser (and this is strictly speaking in the most objective of terms), how does he come to run his own Jewelry business, have such a nice house, and super slick apartment in the city? How did he manage to have three kids with a wife who hates him so much? How does he manage to have a girlfriend on the side as well? Or for that matter why is his girl so super committed to him if he has nothing going for him? I guess I needed some more exposition here to buy into Howard's character being such a loser with so many successes in life.My guess is I'm supposed to assume he's not self made. It's implied that his family may fund him, but this is, from what I could tell at least, never truly confirmed. Perhaps I'm not supposed to read into all this so much, but given how Uncut Gems film seems to pride itself on its hyper realistic and gritty portrayal of events, it probably somewhat important that it feels believable.If there is one super high point in Uncut Gems, it's the soundtrack, which oozes synthesizer goodness. Problem is unlike in Good Time, it feels forced and is mostly limited to moments of transitioning from scene to scene. Also putting the spotlight on the superstitions athletes have when it comes to harnessing success was a clever touch, and more believable than the whole of Howard's arch. Even though Sandler does put on a better acting display than he is usually well known for, I'd recommend watching Punch Drunk Love to see his real range put on display, not just copious amounts of yelling and bad decision making.I know this film has many fans, and a passionate audience, and I know many people regard it highly, which is cool. No film should fail if it's made well enough. And this is not me saying that a film has to be happy, or that it can't be sad, or make someone angry, but for me, I need to care about the characters on screen, or care about what and why it's all happening at the least. But in spite of how well crafted it all is, I personally couldn't squeeze much, if any care out of anything that happens in Uncut Gems. It's high stakes ending brings some late game enjoyment, but throws it all away on (wait for it) the dumbest, least most rewarding ending ever to a film, and I mean ever! This ending was just plain bad. The plot felt like it left itself no where else to go but to the worst of places... so it went there, and it was not worth it. It made everything I had witnessed up til that point feel like an even bigger waste of time than I already felt it was. Uncut Gems was the biggest disappointment released in 2019 for me so far.",Uncut Gems

After I read most reviews and critics, and see the trailer I thought this is gonna be another Adam Sandler gem like Punch-drunk Love type of deal.But oh boy what a mess. Only good thing about the movie is the ending and I must say it's too little payoff for that much trouble. Every drama needs its silver lining now and then. This one pushes too hard to the breaking point, I can tell it brake a few times along the way. Many times I checked my watch to see how long I'm supposed to take it. So many events were annoyingly predictable except the ending. It's like Murphy's rule. As I said ending was definitely original and cool with sort of Scarface style thanks to soundtrack.

Especially from Sandler and his girlfriend in the movie Julia..That said Julia was probably the most unrealistic part of the movie..she was absolutely drop dead gorgeous. Her and Sandler's relationship was never truly developed, she was crazy in love with him but it was never clear why. She was also flirting with others (one notable name that she almost banged).You truly start to feel sympathy for this super scummy, pathological liar and scam artist / jeweler, father, boyfriend. Which makes the ending truly bitter sweet.And the weird synth wave type music on the background! It was so good! Together with the neon colours and all the bling, clubs etc it gave a sort of dystopian vibe to it all. The ending credits rolled and it started playing some techno track from the late 90s early 2000s that I remember from my youth and it kinda was a perfect end to this weird movie",Uncut Gems

Let's talk about the essence of this film, Adam Sandler materializes Howard Ratner with all his baggage, the bad and the good, he embodies this character and brings it to life, I'm really tempted to call this his best work to date, it's a big claim but it deserves it, ""Punch Drunk Love"" was something else but this is just breathtaking, honestly, it just wows.
The Safdies brothers really went for it with ""Uncut Gems"", their acid-infused filmmaking is on full display yet again, they shaped the narrative near damn flawlessly and gave Sandler a fantastic story to work with.
A power trip that will play with your primal senses, that's the best way to describe it, absolutely great.",Uncut Gems
450,Deux_Vega,What to say ...,9,10 August 2020,"Every time when I've seen Adam Sandler act in a more serious role he's just epic. Punch-Drunk-Love, Reign over me to note a few. So I knew I had to see this one.This is really an odd-ball movie. I can image the hate on It, which some people clearly give. If you're on the couch, with your popcorn laid back into your comfy chair and turn this flick up ... yes, It will hit you in a sense that may not be what you wanted to get out of it.So, my advice Is, don't watch this movie when you're somewhat tired or annoyed with life. It will hit you on those nerves possibly just a little bit too much to make you jumpy and unsettled.This is like a roller-coaster with mostly loops that seems to lead nowhere ... and yet ... along the way you pick up the pieces and it actually turns into a track that makes total sense.The pace is just full speed the whole time. It's loud, unsettling, it's a lot of talk. It's like When Harry met Sally's full on dialogues on steroids. Most of the movie you're wondering why Howard (Stiller) makes the decisions he makes. There's not a lot you get to figure that out. It creates that absurd tension that you're unsure It's annoyance or suspense. It's almost more of a documentary without any backstory. It keeps you guessing the whole time and then, right at the moment you feel like, where is this going? It's like all the puzzle pieces fall together and It all makes total sense. It actually gives such a strong view of a person with an addiction, I've never seen It that impactful before. It's not about common sense, It's about a guy that has no control over his behaviour because the addiction took over. It's just so well done. And then, once that thing hits you and you're putting the pieces of the movie together, he opens the door and he paid the price for it. Mouth open, processing everything you've just witnessed and then only nod and think: Bravo!It's like a old-school Guy Ritchie movie, but in a very different, somewhat hyper and more raw style though. Really original.And props to Keith William Richards, just coming out of nowhere, having his first role, ever, playing a super annoying very well playing bad guy.

Everything in this man's life is beginning to crumble and it was hard for me to decide whether I was rooting for him or not.

However the Safdie Brothers evolve their directing style from Good time which was also anxiety inducing, however, Uncut Gems uses it so much more frequently and efficiently, making the Safdies some of the best Writers/ Directors to look out for in the future giving us a film that makes you feel stressed and holds on until the film ends. The performances are also excellent lead by Adam Sandler who gives his best performance yet, it feels like he disappears into this role which only helps the film. Kevin Garnett surprisingly gives a good performance also.I do see a couple of critiques for the film however, such as: There are some moments in the middle that dragged on for too long. It also starts off a little messy and the fast anxiety inducing pace startles you for the opening act which means you spend some time figuring out whats what, but when it all starts to click, which I found it did around 10 minutes into the film I was immersed and ready to go on the ride that the Safdies prepared for us.Overall, Uncut Gems is the epitome of anxiety inducing cinema heralded by an Oscar Nomination worthy performance from Adam Sandler, and also showing that the Safdie Brothers have a very promising future with this genre of film that they have mastered. If you're someone who wants to watch a movie to relax I wouldn't recommend this but if you enjoy quality cinema no matter what genre it is, this is one for you.",Uncut Gems

I might have enjoyed the former more but big fans of the latter will probably disenjoy this film because it requires an emotional palette and attention span larger than watching Iron Man snap his fingers and die in 30 seconds after he had been built up as the second man for 16 collective hours. People call this film messy but hail the convoluted time travel/galactic battle/funeral nonsense of Endgame as a cinematic masterpiece. This movie may have come across as sloppy or unintentional, but it was very concise and intentional. Every moment of the film was very deliberate. His gambling issues were established, his relationship with Arno and Julia and their complicated situation where Arno's men are making movies against his will (how he seems uncomfortable in his first scene), how Demany seems interested in Howard's goods, how they reference Mohegan Sun earlier in the film. This film doesn't mislead, but it makes you question the intention of every interaction, up to the final scenes. The writing matches the acting in that it is not overstated but acted very in tune with each character. The relationship between Julia and Howard is as sincere as the relationship between the plot and the gem. A complicated but honest and dedicated relationship. As is the soundtrack, raw and uncut but immensely beautiful. The progression feels inconsequential because it is consistently overwhelming, but each interaction between the conflict and the protagonist are progressively extreme. It is a forceful effort of acting, writing, and directing that results in a product of powerful and turbulent cacophony. It's neither for the weak stomached or the light of heart, but appreciating this films is a big step forward from considering Endgame a masterpiece.",Uncut Gems

If only the directors had the good sense to eject him after 30 minutes, a la Steven Seagall in Executive Decision, this might have been a tolerable film.The movie only picks up when its one bright spot, Julia, played by newcomer Julia Fox, follows Howard's instructions and places a crazy bet on Kevin Garnett and the Celtics in a playoff game at a nearby New Jersey casino, because enabling your lover's addictions is the best way to help him.It looks as if Julia will be sidelined by some predator gambler at the Mohegan, but she is true to her man who, at the time, is lying dead on the floor of his crappy jewelry showroom floor, killed by what is presumably an audience member who wanted Howard to STFU. (Actually it's a goon of the Ratner brother-in-law loan shark to whom Ratner is deeply in debt, unhappy at being trapped in the anteroom of the showroom for 2 hours while the Celtics win and Ratner continues to scream. This guy is so upset, he also kills his loan shark boss.)A nuanced character study might have been more interesting, but that would have been hard to write.

Here is a classic 'rob Peter to pay Paul' story with it's constant wheeling and dealing by the lead character. There is an immediacy and ever escalating drive which comes not only from the performances, but from the fast paced direction, with in-your-face, dazzling camera work mostly shot in close ups, where the performance has got to be be truthful and nuanced because there is no place for the actor to hide. To use words such as edge-of-your-seat, taut, tight with ever increasing tension would be an understatement. Idina Menzel, nails it as the suffering wife. Julia Fox (remember that name folks) (channeling Marisa Tomei) plays Howard's employee and girlfriend in a stunning, breakout performance.

The tension, the anxiety, the fatigue is palpable by the audience for the entire runtime. The movie is filled with over talking, yelling, no one listens, but everyone wants to be heard, movement, sound, lighting. It's all too much.

486,dennisgcarrier,Like watching a two hour train wreck in slow motion,2,21 September 2020,They called this a career high for Adam Sandler. Although there is nothing to criticize about his performance there is little that could have saved this grim movie. It's a story about a degenerate gambler and that's not exactly an entertaining subject. You feel like you're watching a 2 hour train wreck in progress. Actually it is over two hours when there is not enough substance to justify that much film. It could have been done in 90 minutes no problem. I felt it really dragged and that observation is being made in many other user reviews. The direction and dialogue is sort of like reality television and that gets annoying after awhile. During its theater run I could believe many goers were ticked off as they left their seats. Many viewers at home will turn this movie off in the first half hour because of how slowly it develops. Or they will fast-forward through much of it.,Uncut Gems

489,martinlucas-469-207968,"They get it, or they don't",9,8 February 2020,"One of the most depressing aspects of the excellent IMDb system of user reviews is that it consistently reveals that there is a vast body of viewers who have very set ideas about how a movie should work. They basically want simple straightforward narratives which operate within the conventions of a comfortable established genre. When a film doesn't meet their expectations ( apparently often within the first twenty minutes) they switch off and rush to slap an outraged 1/10 rating into viewer reviews. It appears that they never take a minute to check out the lineage of actors, writers, or directors since those crucial elements have no effect on how they approach a film. A shame for them.
You can probably guess that I don't agree at all with the scathing dismissals of this film. In fact one clue as to whether a film is worth pursuing or not, is a really good movie often provokes a binary division into lovers and haters which is what you will see in the reviews here.
You either get this movie or you don't. I get it.
I loved it. I was hugely impressed with the ambition and commitment of everyone involved. Soundtrack, imagery, direction, writing and acting were all outstanding. It has a real documentary feel and rightly or wrongly I now believe I have some sense of the timbre of life among New York's precious gems commercial community.
The film tries to convey the frenetic roller coaster life of a man who surfs from crisis to worse crisis in his outrageous attempts to win what he sees as the the game of life, at any cost. An essentially kind man, he still manages to break the heart of every on he comes into contact with during his doomed life journey, yet the film is funny, uplifting and ultimately life affirming.

I purposely ignored this movie because I was expecting it to be another bad Sandler film. But upon taking a glance at some of the 2019 year end movie top 10's for some movies to watch, this movie kept showing up on the lists. So finally I caved and sat down to watch it.And let me just say... DAMN! Wow! Just wow. That was INTENSE! I could actually feel the sweat form on my forehead towards the end of it because I was so nervous. This movie left me a mess. It was great! The directing, the plot, and the CHARACTERS were fantastic. The directing was done pretty well, but there were a few inebriating shots in the first half and throughout, but it's still directed well. The plot was very intriguing. At first I didn't think I'd care, but towards the end I was biting my nails because I was so into the film. I haven't felt so tense throughout an entire film in such a while, and I left feeling like a trainwreck. When a movie can do that, you've succeeded.I need to give Sandler alot of the credit. I believe it's his best performance acting wise and one of the greatest of the year. Him playing this dark gritty and charismatic gambler was thrilling. I truly believe Sandler should take on more dramatic roles like this, because he was phenomenal. In fact, now thinking back on it, Sandler was so underlooked during the award season. He ABSOLUTELY should've been nomianted for an Oscar. In fact, this movie should've been nominated for Best Picture. This movie is so underrated and I REGRET not watching it earlier.Look, I'll be willing to watch more of Adam's movies if he takes on more of these roles.

497,tomfeller,Jewelry store owner runs scams,9,3 February 2020,"Adam Sandler almost always appears in comedies, but he tries a dramatic turn in this film as Howard Ratner, a Jewish jewelry store owner with a severe gambling problem. Sandler is often accused of phoning in his performances, but not this time. His performance is so over the top that it might as well be comedic, and it may be the best of his career. He even wears false teeth during his scenes. Set over the course of a few days in New York in 2012, Ratner is constantly hustling and scamming people with whom he does business, and it catches up with him eventually. Howard owes money to his brother-in-law and loan shark Arno (Eric Bogosian), is close to a divorce with his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel), and is having an affair with Julia (Julia Fox), who works in his store and lives in an apartment he pays for. To my surprise, by the end of the movie I was so sympathetic to Howard that I was rooting for him.
The title refers to a rock of uncut opals that he smuggles into the U.S. inserted into the stomach of a fish. The rock functions as a ""maguffin"", an object that drives the plot of the movie. The co-directors and co-authors with Ronald Bronstein, Josh and Bennie Safdie are Syrian Jews whose father worked in New York's diamond district, so that part has an authentic feel to it. Basketball star Kevin Garnett plays himself, and footage from his games is used to advance the plot. It is quite a movie.",Uncut Gems

506,grantpaulsen,Adam Sandler's Best Performance,9,19 December 2019,"Uncut Gems is an endless blast to watch. This film was an endless adrenaline fueled rush, and The Safdie Brothers did a fantastic job directing. They are at their best when crafting a tension filled, fast paced thriller. Their style is very noticeable and present here. A lot of the shots are close ups and it gives off a genuinely intense feeling of claustrophobia. The editing and the intense soundtrack, along with the smooth, fluid movement of the shots complements the tone perfectly. If you haven't seen their previous film Good Time (2017) I would highly recommend it.The story is one that is just constantly moving, progressing, and the intensity of this film gives of the feeling that everything could collapse at any given moment. Which is what makes this film such a nail biting experience.This film is also a characters study for a main character who is irresponsible, sneaky, greedy, unethical, and just an all around scumbag. Adam Sandler fit the character very well and this is easily one of if not his best performance. He was great in Punch Drunk Love by Paul Thomas Anderson, but I honestly think he might have outdone himself with this one. Everyone knows him for all the terrible comedies that he's done over the years, but he's so much more than that, he is a fantastic actor, and can deliver amazing performances when given the right role and given the right material and director to work with.Overall the presentation, the thoroughly entertaining story and characters make this an all around well crafted film that is one of the best of the year.

I had a similar feeling when watching another Safdie brothers film - Good Time. I did not feel quite comfortable watching this, which can be a good thing in film. My favorite films are those that tend to make me feel something different, something out of the ordinary. That certainly did happen here. The underlying issue here causing the pressure and intensity in this film seems to be entirely uncontrolled mental health issues in the main character, addiction and likely some type of personality disorder. I would recommend this film as an interesting, unique character study done by the apparently immensely talented Safdie brothers. Though for me, I rated this film lower and probably will be reluctant to watch this again, because as the main character's wife describes I just found him to be too annoying to be able to sit through this again.",Uncut Gems

I mean the way they captured the dialogue here is remarkable. I don't know how much of the dialogue is in the script, I don't think that anyone can write a script like this. It feels like the Safdies asked real people if they can shoot them while this people go through their life or like they gathered a bunch of people from around, hinted to them a couple of notes and let them loose. And to think that other than Adam Sandler and LeKeith Stanfield nobody had never been in a movie before it's mind-blowing. Every actor is amazing but Adam Sandler is just in a whole other level. Adam has been in only two good movies throughout the entire of his career, you would think that he is the most inappropriate actor to play this role but nope, he is incredibly good as this ""crazy ass jewl"", 'so Adam everything prior to this is forgiven'.

523,ljsmith-25626,Sandler's Career Best,7,3 June 2020,"When I was growing up, Adam Sandler was the biggest name in the film industry. Some of his movies were my absolute favourites - Happy Gilmore, Grown Ups, Just Go With It (to name a few). I've never understood how he faded away, starring exclusively in terrible films over the past 10 years. Did I just reach a certain age and no longer find his comedy funny anymore? I don't think so, because I still thoroughly enjoy myself watching his classics. If someone was to conduct a study into Sandler's incredible plummet from the top and write a dissertation on their findings then I would be very willing to read.Uncut Gems may just have achieved the impossible by reviving Hollywood's biggest sleeping giant. I had no idea Adam Sandler was capable of a performance like this, and it is indeed his career best. The film lacks a clear cut plot (I guess you could describe it as... uncut) and to be honest I only started to enjoy it halfway through once I decided to view it as a character study of the contemptible Howard Ratner. There is barely a second of runtime where Sandler isn't on screen, so Uncut Gems presents us with over 2 hours of the life of Howard, a shady gems dealer and gambling addict. The character shouldn't be likeable - he makes poor choices at every turn, doesn't appear to give a toss about his family, and in general is manipulative, rude and vulgar. Yet I couldn't help but find myself willing him to win and walk away a hero. Maybe that's just the charm of Adam Sandler.Uncut Gems has a strong and unforgettable finale, which nearly boosted my rating to 8/10 but overall this would not have reflected my enjoyment of the film. A lot of scenes (particularly in Howard's jewellery shop) were noisy with a lot of shouting, swearing and not much else in the way of dialogue, which in itself was often drowned out by an offensive score. Overall this made for a somewhat uncomfortable viewing experience that at times went as far as stressful. Sandler is magnificent in portraying the fascinating Howard Ratner however and ultimately that's what I'll remember Uncut Gems for. 7/10.",Uncut Gems
524,spitfire2356,Feel bad movie,1,30 January 2021,"Only Joe Pesci could ever play a more irritating character than Adam Sandler in this movie. He plays a good for nothing scumbag with no redeeming qualities. His face, voice, dress code and glasses cry out for a double punch to the jaw. He has no feelings for anyone else but him and his urge to bet. He devalues everything around him. His wife, family, mistress, co-workers, clients, religion, sport. We actually pray for him to get beaten up, but the guys who are after him are way too soft on him for too long. The plot is a hectic rush in a rut which just gets deeper and deeper. We get less and less interested in where its heading, even as we realise that there is only one possible destination.

It is so intense to watch: emotional and thrilling at the same time, and that's what I love in films, when they can bring those weird sensations into your body. The ending is just WTF? (But in a positive way). It was shocking and so sad at the same time. I didn't expect it at all. I also love when movies make you ask questions at the end of it, and Uncut Gems did that.

There are only so many times the story can reinforce the bad situation the protagonist is in - it becomes extremely repetitive,, with no resolution in sight. As such, the movie seemed to be about 4 hours long.I am truly happy to see Adam Sandler in a dramatic role - that being said, this is the worst Adam Sandler movie ever. That's saying a lot - There are some really bad Adam Sandler movies before this one!While the story was predictable, and the abrupt ending was also completely predictable, the story was left unfinished.

The audience is drawn to and immersed in his fast pace of life, his endless mistakes and corrections, as well as his stressful struggle to regain control over his life. Although the lead is more greedy than the average people, we can still sympathise and even empathise with his emotions. The idea is further supported as the character is well portrayed by Adam Sandler.

I get that he probably won't win best actor for 2020 Oscars, still did a phenomenal job and made me feel like supporting his actor yet at the same time hate him and wish that he'd get a taste of his own medicine.The pacing is very quick but to the right extent, filmed in close-up and medium close-up shots from chest or shoulders up or just a headshot of a character arguing with someone else makes the film as intriguing with support of its dialogue and writing.But of course aside from this being an adam sandler film, my first Safdie Brothers film and yet I have not seen any others, The Safdie Brothers like to film in this same style of close-ups and conflicting characters who are constantly bickering.Idina Menzel did a great job as well as Kevin Garnett(former Celtic's player for NBA) who played himself and also Lakieth Stanfield.

Even the former NBA Celtics' player played himself in this movie and actually did a great job for a non-actor.The score is great although it isn't the main attraction. One of the biggest aspects of this film is the camera-angle/shooting style, all we get mainly is close-ups from the shoulders-up or even just a headshot of the character, this helps add a sense of reality and makes you feel like you're in the conversations they're having, you're in the car that the main character's driving.",Uncut Gems
552,mtrburrows,"Simple, but jaw dropping",8,29 November 2020,"Uncut Gems is such a unique movie in how it has garnered its fandom & critical success. It's the first film I've watched in a long time that made me forget I was watching a film. The work put in by the Saftie brothers & Adam Sandler to make such an immersive experience should be celebrated in this day and age. Not that cinema is dead, but the films that came out that make you forget you're watching actors play out the work of a director (films like Pulp Fiction, Back to the Future) sometimes feel like films of the past.Watching Uncut Gems is an anxiety inducing, deeply frustrating experience. But in the best way possible. I didn't see any actors on screen, especially not Adam Sandler, I saw real, grounded people. This is mainly due to the direction, the sound design, the choice to cast first time or lesser know actors, and most importantly, the career-changing performance by Sandler. His character, while seedy and frustrating, maybe even annoying, felt like an honest portrayal of a real life person, and all I wanted to do was reach through the screen and grab him, to stop him on his believable downward spiral.As the film plays, it's atmosphere washes over you, again, as if you're watching real life. As I watched it, it didn't seem groundbreaking. Partly because it may be a little too long, but mainly down to how engrossed I was. However, by the time the final scene came around, it clicked, and I knew that I had just watched a modern day classic. A film is only as good as its final scene, and Uncut Gems could not have ended in a more perfect place, for its plot, and its character arc. Despite its simplicity, it was jaw dropping.",Uncut Gems

In an intricate complex of events in which he tries to quickly turn a profit from re-investing assets from his jewelry store using highly risky methods he paints himself further and further into a corner from which he tries to escape with that one all-or-nothing bet. The talking by the various murky types that visit his store, especially in the beginning is so fast that the sound designers tried to make the most of whatever available surround sound system by distributing the voices over all the speakers. Time and again this movie makes the audience cringe at yet another ill advised move or indiscretion by the jeweler, like a gambler at a slot machine, he does not seem to gamble to make a profit, but just for the sake of gambling until his money runs out. But he does not operate isolated, there's the bookmakers that will accept any crazy bets, there's loan sharks that can lend you fast money but at criminal rates and consequences if you don't pay them back, the general obsession with baseball and its high paid celebrities all together form the luring environment that is so irresistible with its promises but can be so deadly in its consequences.",Uncut Gems

559,gatheringsnow,"Liked the movie, did NOT like the ending!",8,28 December 2019,"Having never seen their debut feature ""Good Time"" starring Robert Pattinson, this is my first introduction to the Safdie brothers and it definitely delivered a satisfactory thrill ride from start to ""almost"" end.When Adam Sandler is giving good direction and material to work with, he can be a surprisingly good actor, and this being a Safdie brothers film, NOT an Adam Sandler movie produced through Happy Madison productions, it clearly shows in how well crafted Howard Ratner's shady and manic persona. Howard, the main character played by Sandler is a jeweler working in New York's Diamond district who is also a gambling addict and on the verge of divorcing his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) who is fed up with both his infidelity and his gambling addiction.Over the course of the film both before and after receiving the Ethiopian Opal which sets the films events into motion, Howard comes into a number of unsavory and criminal elements who are also increasingly fed up with Howard's constant need to pay back debts with money he's either pawned or owes to other people to begin with thus keeping him in a constant cycle of debt although he doesn't seem to upset by this and instead seems to accept it as a part of a fast paced lifestyle not willing to think too hard over the dire consequences it's having on his life until it's too late.At the end it seemed like it was finally going to pay off finally after so much bad luck and misfortune with Howard finally getting his happy ending with Julia and then he gets shot and killed by one of the crooks, who from the start seemed to have an exceptionally short fuse combined with a great dislike of Howard, thus eliminating the possibility of a true happy ending, but what was it all for in the end? He goes through all of that and doesn't come out of it alive, and the audience never even gets to find out what happens after his family and friends learn about his death. It felt really cheap and ruined much of the film for me.I suppose you could make the argument that he never learned from his mistakes and that even if he had lived to reap the spoils of his biggest gamble he would still end up screwing it up. going back into debt and ruining his relationship with Julia much like he had with Dinah. Even if that was the intention I don't know why they played up the climax and other scenes with such tension and seemed to be hinting that it truly meant something in the end. I'm afraid it doesn't cut it for me, they could have written a better ending while still keeping the general idea of gambling and addiction of any sort perhaps, is bad.",Uncut Gems

565,sebastianschlicht,A modern movie gem!,9,4 February 2020,"""Uncut Gems"" is the latest work by the Safdie-brothers, who should be known for ""Good Time"" with Robert Pattinson. ""Uncut Gems"" quickly attracted attention because of the main character: Adam Sandler. A name that is sure to cause choking reflexes in many cineastes, just like me. Sure, he made good films from time to time, but he is best when he mainly works as an actor. Here he shows what he can do, but ""Uncut Gems"" is more than just a brilliant performance by a leading actor.Howard Ratner runs a jewelry store and believes he has made the biggest catch: An opal that he has not quite legally imported from Ethiopia. A small, uncut diamond that is not only beautiful, but is also said to be incredibly precious. When Howard lends the stone to basketball player Kevin Garnett because he is obviously interested in the stone, everything slowly but surely gets out of control ...There's a great studio behind the film: A24. These people have released some great films including ""Under the Skin"", ""Enemy"", ""The Lobster"" and more recently ""The Lighthouse"". Then then there is a not unknown producer named Martin Scorsese and you already have a lot of talent and quality in advance.""Uncut Gems"" scores primarily with its main character Howard Ratner. The film is an incredibly interesting character study about a man who seems to choke on his greed, even though he lives an apparently good life. Adam Sandler's casting is really perfect. There are some roles where people say, ""Nobody else than XY could have played this character!"", but I rarely find that this statement really applies. Michael Keaton in ""Birdman"", for example, is one of those fitting roles. Sandler also fits Howard's role so brilliantly because on the one hand he has a charming side, but of course his long list of terrible films also despises many. This is exactly what his figure fulfills. Other than that, it's wonderful to see Sandler acting passionate again. He plays a character that is multifaceted, has fears but also goals. All these things are noticeable and understandable. You also see an optical transformation with him. A great achievement by Sandler and a shame that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. A sentence that I would have thought would be impossible a year ago.But you can't ignore the rest of the cast here. Julia Fox is here in her debut-film and she is really good, as is Kevin Garnett, who plays himself. Idina Menzel is also in the film and really great. She should be known for her song version of ""Let it go"" from ""Frozen"".What the two directors also continue to master is the story and the insane presentation. The film has an almost continuous drive, is sometimes completely hectic in its dialogues, but never feels annoying or uncoordinated. The Safdie brothers wanted to show Howard's hectic and exhausting life, not just internally but externally as well. Dialogues overlap, people shout at each other, try to make their points, but rarely make it. Money and fear rule below.Darius Khondji shows a shaky but never unfocused camera work. The Cinematography also seems to be moving with Howard. There is also a very colorless and cool look in the movie, which is really fitting.One last mention for Daniel Lopatin's great soundtrack: Electric, driving, sometimes even choral. An unusual but surprisingly harmonious composition that is also used very cleverly and unconventionally.Conclusion: ""Uncut Gems"" is a true jewel in itself! Adam Sandler gives an amazing performance and the direction is great too. A film in which everything feels somehow right. Absolute recommendation!",Uncut Gems

But no one is so consistently awful as Adam Sandler.This time though, his performance fades compared to the writers and directors of this 135 minute piece of torture. Even with some really good actor like Bryan Cranston in the lead role, this would have been one of the worst movies ever made. ""Music"" drowning out most of the dialogue, totally stupid (not in a funny way) characters that no one could care for, constant shouting, repeating lines on and on, unintelligible street slang, people talking over each other all the time, a crappy plot - and then, the icing on the cake, Sandler's annoying voice and stiff ""acting"".Don't waste your time on this!",Uncut Gems

The movie follows Howard as he gets his hands on an uncut gem from Ethiopia and subsequently tries to sell it to basketball star, Kevin Garrett in order to pay off his numerous debts. Of course Howard's plan goes off the rails, and he spends the rest of the movie trying to piece the deal together including a brief stint, naked in his own trunk.The plot is pretty decent and I really enjoyed the new character from Sandler even though no one could possibly like the character, which is where I have qualms.

The story starts off smooth and then goes to 100 in a seconds. You empathize for the character, but also feel envious of the character.

It's so fast paced that it makes you want to vomit! So repulsive and foul mouthed that it can give you headache. The movie will NOT give you a break. It's constant talking, screaming, cursing, violence, something is always happening to the protagonist, who by the way is a very bad person. I like how flawed everyone is in this movie. I like the abrasive soundtrack. I like the cinematography. I love Adam Sandlers performance. I like the violent ending that brings everything to a halt. The thing is, it's perfectly normal for anyone to completely dislike this. The movie is made to stress you out and confuse you. If you're into that experience you'll love it. If not, you will absolutely hate it. I liked this movie a lot despite it stressing me out as much as it did.

The incredible thing about this film is it is a chaotic mess. Straight away, an overload of characters, talking over each other, hard to watch. Now this will put a lot of people off but it gets you into the main characters life, which is a chaotic mess, but it definately works for me.
Great back story, great acting, and a completely different style of directing to what I have experienced

There are parts that go on way too long (like the walking!?) and the pace is kinda erratic. Now, Sandlers ACTING is good, I did not, however, like his script. I get the whole degenerate gambler bit, but idk, there was just something about some of his dialogue that really bothered me. (I think part of the reason is that I HATE characters that are so clearly liars, yet everyone puts up with it, besides the wife. Probably why I stopped watching Shameless.) The big bet on the game was dramatic, but since I didn't like Sandler's character, I wasn't that into the decision.And what's up with Demany (or whatever). His character was pointless, besides showing that he was a liar and irresponsible too. Could argue it's his fault.Anyways, I heard a lot of good things about this and I was disappointed.

595,dv727,"Cut or Uncut, this is no Gem!",3,2 January 2020,"I had previously watched Sandler in a dramatic role in ""Reign O'er Me"" and was very pleasantly surprised, so I had hopes for this movie. Well....
I'll avoid any long descriptions of content, as the other posters pretty much have it , and I wanted to avoid spoilers.
About halfway through the movie, after two couples had already left, I turned to my friend and said ""Sandler's doing a good job with a (cleaned up for this review) terrible script."" I waited a few days before writing this to see if I still believed it. I still do. Sandler's performance was the ONLY reason I gave this ANY stars at all. The script was putrid, the soundtrack annoying, and the remaining cast substandard to neutral. The fight scenes were often impossible to follow, the dialogue impossible to understand (one long argument) and the story itself cluttered with nonsensical BS.
I have watched, and appreciated, Eric Bogosian in other roles, most recently in Billions. I have been a long-time fan of Judd Hirsch in a number of roles, most notably ""Running On Empty."" How and why they leant themselves to this fiasco is a mystery. Their respective stocks did not rise with this one. Thankfully, John Amos limited his exposure to a mildly humorous cameo.
If Kevin Garnett was seeking to do some acting after a great b-ball career, this was not a good start. If he tries again, I hope his next attempt is in a better vehicle.
The actor who played ""Phil"" was making his first appearance as well. He just acted himself into a career of cheap horror movies. Terrible. simple as that,

641,peterguitar,The chaos is the whole point,9,18 July 2021,"I definitely see how the frenetic nature of this movie makes it a hard watch for some. I feel that they accomplished what was needed to tell this story from Sandler's point of view. This is the first time I've enjoyed Adam Sandler in years. His self indulgent gamblers' crazy, combined with the freewheeling ""village bazaar"" style of business on NYC's 47th Street, left no real time for thoughtful introspection. If you were to fully appreciate how he was literally surfing from one interpersonal bartering interaction to the next thug administered beat down to the next tense scene with his wife and kids there literally had to be no opportunity to take a beat or a breath. I don't know if seeing his name as an executive producer influenced this - it felt like I was watching one of those signature parts of every Scorsese classic movie where the camera dizzyingly follows the action, you really don't hear as much as feel the fragments of conversations, and you whip back and forth between sub scenes showing what's going on for all of the important characters all at the same time. The only difference is that's Scorsese does one or two concentrated blasts like that in his movies but in this movie it's starts that way from the very first scene and does not stop until the credits roll. Bottom line - I really enjoyed it.",Uncut Gems

Unlike James Caan in The Gambler and Harvey Keitel in The Bad Lieutenant, Adam Sandler's character Howard Ratner is not the least bit introspective or repentant. Therefore, when his inevitable downfall comes, there is no meaningful catharsis or poignant tragedy.

646,frostyfrog,Uncut Gems,10,14 March 2020,"Uncut Gems is a film directed by the Safdie brothers that stars Adam Sandler as a charismatic New York Jeweler who makes an incredibly high stakes bet to pay off his existing outstanding debts. Uncut Gems offers not just a career reviving performance from Adam Sandler who shines brighter than the previous gem in the film but also a look at the world of gambling and debt in New York City. The film had an unrelenting pace about it, constantly moving to the best of the downward spiral of the protagonist Howard Rather (Sandler) and became increasingly more intense as the steaks were raised higher and higher. The distance placed between him and his family, the debt collectors after him and his interactions with some very well known faces were all painted beautifully by picture perfect acting as well as a sharply written script and kinetic energy from behind the camera in the minds of Benny and Josh Safdie. Honestly, there was not a single moment watching this film that I felt bored and despite racking my brain for flaws in this film from my perspective, I couldn't find any. I view this as some of A24's best work since... Well, ""The Lighthouse"". They consistently make great films more focused on building character, atmosphere and hiding subtle messages for audiences than trying to create franchises or constantly drag out the same ideas over and over and ""Uncut Gems"" is no exception. I'm not saying that film franchises are a bad idea by any stretch of the imagination, I'm simply saying that it is certainly refreshing to see films that stray away from that and occasionally focus on the more artistic merits of filmmaking. ""Uncut Gems"" is one of the best crime thrillers I've seen in the past decade at the very least and a surefire masterpiece.",Uncut Gems

648,FelixisaJerk,"Stress, anxiety and tension OH MY!!",10,26 December 2019,"Adam Sandler delivers a stellar performer as New York Diamond District Jeweler: Howard. Howard is in way over his head. In debt to multiple tough guys, in bed with one of his at least 20 years younger employees, and on the brink of a divorce with a court date TBD. Oh and he might have colon cancer. He's robbing Peter to pay Paul, and borrowing from Tim to pay a bookie and taking money owed to him and placing large bets on NBA games.The constant elevation of tension and stakes is almost nauseating, seeing just how bad and convoluted things get for Howard is mesmerizing. And Sandler embodies it without a hitch. Sandler hasn't been this convincing to me since Punch Drunk Love. I was absolutely entranced by his character. His physicality, his accent, his delivery. It blew me away.The Safdie Brothers have crafted a film that feels so authentic, so real, the audio is not theatrical, it feels like life as it's often hard to make sense of the dialogue when you have five people yelling at each other, two phones ringing, and music in the background. It's a very fly on the wall approach and works perfectly.I didn't know I could hold my breath for two hours. Uncut Gems, is a pot boiler of stress, tension and anxiety. If those three words are triggers for you, this film might be one you want to avoid as it's two hour run time is an endurance test.

650,jrwollscheid,How did this movie not get any Oscar nominations?,10,31 August 2020,Uncut Gems: A masterwork by the Safdie Brothers at its finest. It is a constant thrill ride that will leave you on the edge of your seats the whole movie. There is never a dull moment as Adam Sandler plays a diamond dealer and gambler who's casting gives an endearing side to his consistent poor choices. The film reminds me of a Scorsese film much like Joker did. The cast has much depth and is made up of many new faces to acting and an all star athlete in Kevin Garnett. The film is shot with a smooth camera and is dark in lighting in scenes of badness for Sandler's character and contrasted by bright colors and settings in times of good. The films takes place in the diamond district of New York and shows the quick and rough life lead by Sandler's character. This film is a brilliant work of cinema but will likely see little love by the Academy.,Uncut Gems

Mostly, it's a bunch of unpleasant characters yelling at each other.I'll give the Safdie brothers credit, they aren't just rehashing the same tired tropes. Their earlier feature film Good Time (2017) was also a frenetic, anxiety-inducing drama, but compared to the stress-levels in Gems, Good TIme was downright zen.On the plus side: the acting is quite good and believable. Adam Sandler gives a masterful performance as a down-on-his-luck New York diamond dealer. Still, Sandler's Howard Ratner is such an unlikable character, it's hard to gin up any compassion for him or his troubles. Supporting cast is likewise very good, but unlikable.

The whole time I kept feeling like something bad was going to happen. You know he is barely hanging on to the edge but somehow a deal always works out at the last second...until it doesn't. I don't see how so many people live like this in real life because it's got to be exhausting and very stressful. I gave it a 9/10 because I felt like there was probably about 15 minutes that didn't need to be to be in there. It was wasted time in my opinion and making a movie this long might deter people from watching it. I've had it on my watch list but held off on starting it because of the length.

679,tylerwoodrownichols,Sandler shines within the confines of an unremarkable story,6,7 January 2020,"Things I liked: Between ""Uncut Gems"" and, almost 20 years earlier, ""Punch Drunk Love"", there is no denying Adam Sandler's acting chops (seriously, I want to see this dude in more drama films). In fact, there's no weak acting anywhere in this film. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and the soundtrack is great too (Now I've had 'Rain' by Madonna stuck in my head for the past week!) In some sequences, there are brief glimpses of the kinetic energy that made ""Good Time"" such a masterpiece. All of these elements worked so well for me, so how is it that I wasn't left feeling totally satisfied?Things I disliked: No matter how you spin it, ""Uncut Gems"" is not in the same league as ""Good Time"". Which is fair enough because movies of that calibre only come along a few times a decade, and it must have been a daunting task trying to follow up on that success. I was expecting more of a 'crime thriller', but it did really deliver on that for me. The story was just so basic and dull that I often found myself more focused on how pretty everything looked (those shots of the gems!), as opposed to caring about the plot. Without those captivating aesthetic touches or Sandler's performance, there really wouldn't be much of note going on here. Tonally, ""Uncut Gems"" was a bit of a mixed bag for me... I couldn't quite grasp which emotions I was intended to feel about the things that were happening. My gut feeling is that this would have worked better as full-on black comedy, rather than a 'crime thriller' (which is how I've seen it marketed). Overall, I enjoyed ""Uncut Gems"", but it won't be something that will inspire repeat viewings in the way ""Good Time"" does.",Uncut Gems

They just didn't nail it, although it could have been an interesting thriller. Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler, if you have seen any of his movies, you can expect to see it here. Although he is not a big joke here, his nonchalance and unconvincing delivery is still here - just packed in a box of fake teeth and sparkling gems.In the end, let's be realistic: it's Adam Sandler acting in a Netflix production, what can you expect?

Sandler stars as Howard Ratner, a fast talking New York City jewelry dealer and degenerate gambler whose life is spiraling out of control. With his marriage falling apart and debt collectors closing in, Howard is desperate for a big win. He's banking on the sale of a rare Ethiopian opal to clean the slate. When his assistant Demany (LaKeith Stanfield) brings in Kevin Garnett (playing himself) to peruse the shop, Howard, in his typically frenzied enthusiasm, weaves a tale so compelling that KG insists on borrowing the opal for good luck. Howard has already committed to taking the opal to auction but agrees to lend it to KG because not only is he addicted to gambling, he's addicted to volatility. In his world, the path of least resistance carries no mystique, no story. He lives on fate and parlays chaos. It's an anxiety filled existence but it's exciting! How exciting?

I heard from a few friends that this film was very ""frantic"" and with so much frantic stuff going on in the world it took me a while to get around to ""Uncut Gems"" because I was worried it would stress me out.That being said I ended up loving the film. Sandler is so good, best performance since ""Punch Drunk Love"" in my opinion. He really shows his chops as a character actor in this film. Lakeith Stanfield is also fantastic as always, I think he is one of the most talented actors of this generation, great work from Idina Menzel as well and I loved seeing/hearing The Weekend.The Safdies are versed in creating gritty tension, a world of paranoia and heightened circumstance. It's like if you took the ""frantic"" portion of a Scorsese movie and just made a whole movie out of it, but it works because it's authentic to the characters and the concrete jungle world they are depicting. They also have a cool retro vibe that I like, love the neon coloring or weird 80's video game sounds, it just gives the picture weight.Great work!

Everything is slick, well edited, directed, and flows well, and I guess it took me along for a ride. There's no surprises for me, and I didn't care what happened to anyone. It was a bit underwhelming for me. Not because of what the storyteller tells us, but what he doesn't. I know it's a feature film but I'm selfish.A story like this compared to the same in a limited-series television production of the same quality would have been more satisfying. We're used to this now through consuming such great productions streamed via the likes of Netflix. So I wanted this because I don't want plot holes.This is a story about deals and rip-offs and that's how I felt in the end, ripped off. And maybe that's good enough. I wouldn't discourage people from watching this, but don't expect everything to be answered in the end, because there's just not enough time, and perhaps a lot of material was left on cutting room floor. I must admit I'm a Safdie virgin, so Safdie fans needs to be gentle with my review so I don't feel ripped off twice...",Uncut Gems

695,jeffreyoliverrock,Adam Sandler at His Best in Intense Crime Drama,8,4 January 2020,"Saw this film yesterday and I still can't stop thinking about it. Going for spoiler-free, but I will say that I wish more movies began and ended like this one. The entire film has moments that get pretty intense, but for the first and last 5 minutes, eyes bulged open, jaw on the floor, and I walked out of the theater feeling like I'd just left the circus or something.Adam Sandler is a cinematic legend best known for making us laugh. Several of Sandler's comedic classics are still some of my all-time favorite films. However, like the handful of other dramatic roles he took on, Sandler is on top of his game, and this film puts a bright light on his talents as an actor that can make us laugh and cry. The remaining cast surrounding Sandler really sell the anger, frustration and even pity for the actions of Howard Ratner, and you sometimes wonder who you should truly be rooting for.I overheard a couple leaving the theater say it was hard to follow at times, and I understand. It is a longer film with a lot of information to remember about super chaotic situations, so it's easy to miss something. As someone with sensory issues, I also understand the people talking about the characters shouting and talking over each other a lot. I too found a few brief moments I was saying in my head ""okay, lets move on now"", but I think scenes that appear later make up for it.Given some of the films Sandler's been apart of in recent years, it's nice to see him in a film with some effort again. This is also the first Safdie Brothers film I've seen and I applaud them and the crew around them. I think Uncut Gems is definitely worth checking out, and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.",Uncut Gems
696,sorearm,Pass the skullcap for the Safdies,3,9 March 2020,"I wouldn't want to knock anybody who creates for a living. However, there is always a song, a film, a TV programme that just comes off as so badly done you wonder how it even made it above ground. This (Uncut Gems) is one of those.
It reminds me of the films starring DMX. Remember those? Not very good but with a dollop of stress/ pressure/ tension for the protagonist to grapple with during the runtime.
Now I understand why the press for this film has been focused on Adam Sandler's acting performance because there is really nothing else to recall. The soundtrack is straight from a Sega Megadrive game. The cinematography is so bad I've never seen NYC look so bland. Apart from the Julia character, the other actors involved actually look bored playing their parts.
So, as for turning up each day for the shoot, pointing the camera at the right thing and editing it down to a barely digestible form, bravo to the Safdies. But couldn't you free up your two slots in the creative world for someone else and dedicate yourselves to a more important role?

713,iamlegend-07431,Adam Sandler is the true gem,10,24 December 2019,"Uncut Gems (2019)
10/10💎💸🕶""The Safdie Brothers know exactly what they're doing in this brilliant look at the crime world with a help from a wonderfully acted Adam Sandler.""2019 has had some excellent entries, most of them being A24 films, but none of which have made me feel on edge and shocked as Uncut Gems has. I cannot stress this enough when I say the Safdies might have created a masterpiece of sorts using their well known anxiety inducing strategies. The plot holds down very well by keeping itself contained just enough to tell the story comfortably, even if it goes a quicker pace than your average movie. The characters are never overblown and are used to their fullest potential, most notably Adam Sandler's character, Howard, who literally knocks it out of the park; a career defining performance. I say career defining because it's nice to see Sandler back in more serious roles, but this serious role of his takes the cake over Punch Drunk Love in my book. Another notable aspect here would be the score, which somehow turns the most dire of moods into a comforted way of viewing the intense moments that just happened onscreen; something out of an old 80s Sci-Fi movie. As far as endings go, this has to be one of the most nerve wracking sequences I have ever sat through. It's hard to predict what could come next because the possibilites are all laid out across the table. For assurance purposes, the film does wrap up perfectly.Verdict: Uncut Gems is a film that will stick with you for the days that follow after watching it for the first time. If Adam Sandler doesn't get the buzz he deserves for this one, the true crime will be his snub.",Uncut Gems

😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄(9 laughs)
😱(1 shock)
😴💤⏳(went long)Uncut Gems (Benny and Josh Safdie) throws away any attempt at pacing in an over-the-top push to be electrifying. Inappropriate new-age music drowns out a story of risk, capitalism, and gambling addiction. Adam Sandler attempts to move away from his comedic roles into something more serious, but it is difficult to take him seriously. From beginning to end, Sandler's performance is always at the same level, full blast. After 2hrs and 15min of listening to him screaming his lines at top force, I left this screening with a pounding headache. If I was watching it at home instead of it's TIFF premiere, I would not have finished the film. Idina Menzel gave a fantastic performance, but unfortunately it was overshadowed by the chaos. Surprisingly, Kevin Garnett's televised basketball games worked into the film were the only (and much needed) respite from the unfaltering tempo. There is a shock scene near the end of in the film which makes it slightly more palatable. Overall, Uncut Gems is bound to disappoint fans of Adam Sandler's comedy and anyone who appreciates a well-written storyline.#filmreactiviews",Uncut Gems
715,acpwebreg,Absolutely Awful,1,4 February 2020,Billed as Sandler at his peak. Seriously? Trouble is we're so used to seeing him in comedy films it's hard to work out if this is a rubbish comedy film or an even worse drama.

717,stoneps,Surprisingly good!,8,1 February 2020,Didn't expect a Adam Sandler movie could be that exciting. It was a bit awkward at first. The lines were unnecessarily long and boring. And the music was weird as well. Everyone tries to be all hood and tough in a funny way. Thought this one would be a five or six in the end. But then when the story started to click it got really really good!I guess when all the bet is on the table and you know what is at stake you'll feel connected to Howie and his troubles bit by bit. You'll feel for the guy.But the ending was a bit unexpected. One minute you're all giddy and hyper and then BOOM you're back to reality. It's very clever in a way. Good stories bring you along.Big fan for KG as well! Loved his performance! It's sad that he didn't win that year. But at least he got his own already! Guy is a legend! Hopefully he gets more movie gigs in the future. Would love to see him again on the screen!,Uncut Gems

I would say he should stick to comedies but he hasn't done a decent one in at least 10 years.The directors relied on music to create atmosphere because they couldn't create any otherwise.Zero character development to create any kind of tension. I couldn't figure out Sandler's character, if it was a terrible portrayal of charismatic or he was genuinely meant to be stupid. You couldn't like or dislike him. He has the intelligence to trace a priceless gem but displays zero intelligence to sorting out his problems, even how he talks with people, it's like putting Billy Maddison in the middle of Goodfellas. Just bizarre.Though I thought the 80s esque score was actually good, it was wasted in the hands of this movie's creators. Used beyond excess to compensate for the lack of substance.They tried to create a complex plot out of the simplest idea. It becomes this mess trying to chase the suspense it never finds.",Uncut Gems

723,krupocin-1,Not sure how this could be a 1 or a 10?,7,14 February 2020,"I've noticed reviews on IMDb reflecting the hate or love culture that the internet and more specifically social media seems to encourage, where something is ""OMG the most amazing thing EVERRR!!"" or ""the worst piece of crap ever made anyone who likes it is a beta soy boy!"". Ultimately this just devolves into everyone wanting to shout each other down and prove the other wrong moving further and further closer to the poles, just like politics and social issues and everything else. Getting off my soap box nowAnyway just like 99.9% of movies/TV this movie is NOT a 1/10 or a 10/10. I get if someone finds the intensity to be a bit too much, but as someone who watches A LOT of movies & TV due to having a job that requires frequent travel, I find it really surprising that even if someone didn't particularly like the movie due to personal preferences, that they would say it's a 1 or 2/10. There are so many great performances and unique characters and interesting choices by directors and writers and actors that it just shocks me someone would rate it so low. This is why we don't get much beyond super hero movies and fast & furious franchises and terrible sequels these days because most idiots don't have the open mind to get past a character or a choice they don't like and look at all the good behind it.I get it if this movie wasn't for you, but can you seriously say that this movie is a 1 or a 2?! Have you not seen most movies haha?! Also I can say the same for a 10. Go watch The Godfather or Shawshank or Alien or any of the top movies on IMDb and tell me this deserves a 10...Anyway no one is gonna read this far anyway but I would give it a solid 7. Safdie brothers are amongst the most exciting directors today, they take chances, they have a unique and specific vision, they don't compromise to reach a wider audience or sell more merch, even if you don't like their stuff per se that's something any fan of movies should respect and encourage. Great performances by great actors and novices in this movie. Julia Fox and KG were awesome for first time performers, love or hate Sandler but damn he became Howard Ratner in a way that even some of the best don't always achieve. And besides Billy Madison & Happy Gilmore (for nostalgia reasons) I hate everything Sandler does comedically even though he seems like a great guy. Finally I don't get the complaints about the soundtrack and score either? I loved it! I wouldn't listen to it for pleasure but it held the story together perfectly and really helped with the tension.Oh, and the ending, how someone could hate that, I just don't get either. Was the perfect resolution for what they were trying to say with this story about life and questions about things unknown and/or beyond our control.The reason it's a 7 though is yeah, it IS a little annoying at times! The talking over each other was a choice and makes sense thematically and in practice but it's still really annoying at times haha. Not every performance was amazing, and the scenes with The Weeknd I get why they're there but I felt like they were kind of dumb and the same could've been achieved more effectively with a different scenario but I know they just wanted the star power of having a musician in the movie too and while I get it I didn't particularly like it. Only other complaint was I could've done with a little more background on how Howard ended up where he was at the start of the story. I know he's a man with an addiction that seems to be in the ""heading towards rock bottom"" phase that any addiction has whether to drugs or gambling etc but he seemed to have a great life and be quite successful in the past and destroyed it all, and also was now with Julia and spiraling hard so I wanted to see more of that side to balance out current Howard. Even 1 or 2 scenes could've done that effectively imo but maybe it was a timing issue.Anyway, 7/10 is the correct answer!",Uncut Gems

Adam Sandler's character just keeps digging myself farther into a hole.This movie is very similar to Good Time, but this is way better. I thought Good Time was just good, but not great. Uncut Gems is an improvement, it's amazing. It's hard to pinpoint why I like Uncut Gems way more, it might be because I cared about Adam Sandler's character way more than Robert Pattinson's. We get to know Howard way better. Howard is kinda a idiot, but I want to see him succeed for some odd reason. He seems like he would be a good man if he wasn't addicted to gambling.I never heard of ""Julia Fox,"" but she was so good and beautiful in the movie that I had to look her up right after the movie. Shockingly, it turns out this is her first movie, WOW! I expected a way bigger filmography from her because she seems like a super experienced actor. And not that I only care about looks, but she's legitimately one of the most beautiful actresses I've ever seen, up there with Felicity Jones, but even her beautiful looks aside, this an amazing breakout role for her.But movie isn't for everyone. I seen some complaints that the movie is too depressing, loud, and/or angry, etc. I agree, but still loved this movie, and not all movies are meant to be all happy. This movie intentionally supposed to be loud, angry, and depressing. In my opinion, too many movies are too happy and light-hearted, especially in the mainstream. It's nice to see the other side every now and then, and a movie that challenges it's audience. Nothing wrong if you like happy movies, but I personally don't understand why anyone would only want to see happy movies their entire life, to each his/her own. Besides, main thing I care about if the movie keeps my attention, and this movie kept my attention way more than any movie in a very long time. I was never bored.And damn that ending. I won't spoil it, go see the movie because it's that good. I saw this movie like a week ago and ending still hits me hard, even just thinking about it. To me, it's an unforgettable movie. Most movies, I forget about them like a day or two, even some movies I directly forget right after I watch it *cough* Rise of Skywalker *cough*.

Also, for a movie based around gems and con artists, it's decidedly unglamorous, with cramped shots that would seem more at home in a soap opera than a top level movie of this kind.
But for all this contrariness, in my eyes it works. By the second half I was fully engrossed, and ready for the films brilliant climax. The films unusual choices on almost every level work towards a unique experience which really sets it apart from most movies with a similar theme. Some won't get on with it, but I think the name ""Uncut Gems"" will be on people's lips for a long time to come.",Uncut Gems

I am not surprised by his performance in this one, we've seen the talent in ""Reign Over Me"". He is OUTSTANDING in this, a real classic Jewish New Yorker fighting for his take on the American Dream.I was surprised however, on how invested I found myself in the characters and for their success towards the end. Scrapping for every point in a Game 7 Celtics/Sixers clash was an awesome way to end the movie, felt like I was back watching the playoffs all over again.Also, snippets of a low profile Weekend back in '12/13 was pretty cool to see him make an appearance.Overall, definitely a 9/10 and one for the watchlist!",Uncut Gems

It's the typical ""everything goes downhill""-kind of story. And because of this, the ending wasn't surprising at all. It's very standard for these kind of movies to give a glimmer of hope, and then it just turns out for worst in the end. A ""feel bad"" movie if you're into that.The acting is fine. The directing is raw / borderline amateur-ish. But it gives it a real world feeling, also based on the script and how everyone talks on top of each other.

Wow... this is Adam Sandler's best movie ever. He plays the role of a jeweler that to be honest, is a loser that cannot control his gambling habits. And yet we route for him throughout this movie because Adam Sandler gives us one of the best performances of the year. This and Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Joker are an easy top of 2019. Another great performance is the one by Julia Fox. This is her first movie and she made it look like she was a veteran. Even my boy KG aka Kevin Garnett had a good performance. The script and speed of the movie was spot on. It never dragged and it always felt like we were moving. While watching this movie you feel as if you are on the ride with Adam Sandler's character. The Safdie brothers did an amazing job with this and they got a great group of actors and actresses for this film. They deserve a ton of credit. I made my Top 10 of 2019 before watching this film, but if I hd already seen this film, this would have been number 2 on the list.

Every little detail in this film is built to make you uneasy. From the uncertain chain of events, to the close up shots, to the dialogue consisting mainly of yelling, everything digs into you and doesn't let go. It's a shame that Sandler was not nominated for an Oscar last year, because I believe he would've won. For anyone that thinks Adam Sandler is a one trick pony who only does stupid comedies, take a look at the complex role he plays here. Behind his altered looks and boisterous voice, Sandler plays a truly vulnerable and desperate character here. It's one of the best leading performances I've ever seen filmed before. Even Kevin Garnett gives a very fitting and memorable performance here, deserving of more recognition in my opinion. This movie tops the Safdie brothers' (directors) previous film, Good Time, which was a masterpiece itself. I have no complaints at all about this movie, everything is masterful and it's one of the wildest experiences I've ever had watching a movie.

I was impressed with Pattison in Good Times, but more impressed with Good Times as a film. It demonstrated what the Safie Brothers abilities. They focused on characters, cinematography, music supervision, dialogue and character development.These are the same elements that made Uncut Gems so brilliant. All of the reviews here describe the film as disturbing in some way, and I believe that the directors managed to capture a glimpse into the life of a very disturbed character played by Sandler. This is a great story and great story telling.There is also a sense of reality in these films. The actors, and supporting cast have flaws, and you feel that you're watching a piece of reality. You're watching a character, and you're thinking that you know someone like them. As you start this you'll feel like you're experiencing something. I'd love to see what they do next. You'll need to see this more than once, and if you're a filmmaker of film student, you'll keep coming back to this after you learn about the research that went into making this.Ostensibly, the title is about a precious with valuable stones in it.

I suggest one start with and keep an open mind and make no assumptions when it comes to a movie starring Adam Sandler.This is quite the serious dramatic movie and that fact really surprised me. The story that unfolded was not anything like what I had expected. The storytelling and character development and how their relationships played out is something like how Heat was put together and presented (of course this movie is not a clone of or anything like Heat).Key points for my rating and deciding to write this review: Great writing. Great acting. Excellent cinematography. Great character development. Great consistency of mood, set and setting. And the story the movie told was pretty solid.I do need to mention that the pace is quite a bit slow (without making the movie dull), and at times I did feel that maybe too much time was spent with me waiting for some clue as to what was meant to happen.All things considered, I really enjoyed watching Uncut Gems and seriously appreciated the performances of Adam Sandler, and the movies' other lesser-known actors and actresses.Worth the watch when the mood strikes to watch something dramatic and a bit dark.It was just $0.99 to rent and stream from iTunes, so I took a chance and it paid off.",Uncut Gems

Worse than a two-minute 2001 cell phone clip that films nothing but paint drying. If digital format never came into existence, then every physical copy of it should be lit on fire and wrapped slowly around each person involved in making this pool of diarrhea that has inexplicably covered every wall of your home. This movie has officially killed all of the joy in the world and has replaced it with f-words and screaming over each other until we all reach deep into our own eye sockets to rip our own life forces out of our homosapien flesh encasings.

A fantastic score accompanies a meticulously well crafted script as Sandman gives an incredible energy to Howard with a career best performance.Much like the Safdie's earlier work, your heart is in your mouth for 90% of the film, with few opportunities to take in what you're going through. I say going through, as throughout, Howard's stress is forced upon the audience through the combination of heart pumping sound, dizzy camera movement and fantastically delivered dialogue.It took me a good hour to return to normal after I came out of this movie.

Wasn't going to give a review, then I see 1 star reviews. I'm like, eh it's probably an 7 or an 8, but what's a 10? Does such a movie exist?
Then again, does a 1 star movie actually really even exist?This is a roller coaster on all levels. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Was always a fan of Sandler and this role was made for him to excel with.

The music express this very well, and Sandler's performance is incredible; i couldn't belive it, i was enjoying it, i was glued to the screen!

819,thdudeabides,An Average Thriller,5,11 February 2020,"The opening 20 minutes is full of dialogue. But unlike your average Tarantino movie, this dialogue is loud, fast and above all, utterly pointless. Without subtitles you struggle to keep up with what's going on, who's who, who wants what and who's doing what. It's just a complete mess.
It eventually calms down and we start to learn a bit more about Sandler's character and his life. Unfortunately Sandler's character is not very likeable and you end up not caring about his journey or outcome and are instead gripped by some of the other characters.
There are a few tense moments but it isn't enough to save this ultimate mess of a film. Having endured the film for over 2 hours the ending leaves you feeling quite disappointed and wondering what the point of all of it was.

But even the best made movie about them is more nauseating than fascinating.I liked the celebrity cameos, the thugs were realistic, letting the gambling addict win the crucial parlay was refreshing. Sandler proved he can play some one other than himself and dove deep into a dramatic character.

He annoys and frustrates the audience as much as he does other characters in the movie. From the camera work, to the audio, to the decisions that characters make, to the soundtrack, this movie is pure chaos and is very stressful.Why is this good? It's very entertaining.

841,jerrycoliver,Really a Great Surprise,9,12 April 2020,"I got to watch this and ""Richard Jewell"" back to back (thanks to lock down) and I don't think I could have asked for 2 better movies.What's interesting is both of the titles feature a protagonist that is unlikable, and doesn't have any redeeming qualities, however you end of rooting for them. In ""Uncut Gems"" there's times you'll hate Howard, and other times you'll shrug and say ""you got what you deserved."" Even Adam Sandler (as likable as he is) can't make you care about him.Leading into the third act, something changes. He makes a link between himself and Kevin Garnett (who also isn't a very admirable character in the movie) and for some reason, you root for them (mostly because all the other characters are just as bad as Howard (strangely with more relaiable motives) so maybe you're choosing between the lesser of 2 evils or you're pitying Howard . But it's not that you want him to win, you just don't want him to lose anymore...even if he deserves it.Overall, it's very stylized and a ton of profanity. I guess it's realistic, I'm not too familiar with that world. It does feel like you go a long way to come right back to where you started. But the directors keep your interest, they explore some very complex relationships and overall it's a well made film. A little art house in the conclusion, but I think it's a great watch.",Uncut Gems

He plays the part totally straight (not for humor), and he's 100% professional and acceptable in the part. Likewise all the other actors.

853,nferlisi,That was a nerve-racking experience!,8,7 March 2020,"It never ceases to amaze me what A24 is able to conjure up when it comes to independent film sector. Indie films have their own unique ways of storytelling and style, which Uncut Gems fits that description to a tee. The Safdie Brothers have delivered us one hell of an anxiety driven roller coaster story that keeps your nerves up at maximum practically the entire 2 hour and 15 minute runtime.After seeing the positive reactions to the 2017 hit Good Time many were eager to see what the Safdie Brothers would come up with next. Both Good Time and Uncut Gems has introduced the public to the Safdie Brothers distinct style of filmmaking. The world of Uncut Gems resembles a dirty, grungy and nerve wracking environment that the Safdie Brothers created and they manage to take audiences through this world feeling every bit of it. They manage to keep you on the edge of your seat through Sandler's performance and energetic editing, which maintains that sense of anxiety and stress that we're suppose to feel. At the same time though it can feel a little exhausting by the end, which was something I did feel during my screening.It was my understanding that there were some skeptic mindsets from many people when they heard Adam Sandler doing a gritty, serious drama piece. I would have to admit that it would be hard to believe myself that Sandler would be doing another drama since his last one being 17 years ago with Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch Drunk Love. Yet after seeing this film, I have to say that Adam Sandler really did surprise me with his performance and I must tip my hat off to him. Sandler's portrayal of the problematic gambler Howard gives us a character that we can all be scared for, be annoyed with, be angry at, and even too some extent feel pity for him. Every decision Howard made, whether it was to foolish lend his prized stone to celebrity or use the money needed to pay off his debt and make one last big gamble with it, these decisions made our feelings and emotions towards Howard feel like they were in a massive tug of war match. Sandler take on a more serious role does show good potential for him to expand his ability in playing characters with a lot more darkness, grit and emotion, however, I fear that it's going to take a few more tries for him before people see beyond his traditional silly comedies.The last few things I really want to mention is that while this has been on many peoples' top films of 2019 and has been talked about a lot, but the biggest group that many have claimed to just completely ignore this film was the Academy. Snubbing Adam Sandler from Best Actor has been one of the biggest disgraces(to many people) by the Academy. While I do think Sandler gave a terrific performance and that he can definitely play dramatic roles if he is given the chance, yet I think it is very hard for people to see beyond all the comedies that he has done over the years. Now has Sandler had come could comedy films? Yes absolutely, he has had some good comedies but he has also made some pretty bad ones as well. Many in the entertainment industry are going to look back at his past films and see that it all can be is a ""funny man"" nothing more. As for the film itself, I thought it was well done, but at the same time I feel as if the film was a little too raw and extreme for some- more specifically the Academy. Arthouse films or unconventional films are no strangers to the Academy, but something about Uncut Gems didn't resonate well or hit the right spot with Academy members. I have to be honest and say that I can understand in some way as to why the Academy didn't recognize this film. Throughout this review I have mentioned several things that that make this film unique and its own, however, those same things sort of lead to its omission. I keep thinking that Uncut Gems came across as a little extreme and some people didn't take it well. Some time is needed before a film like this one could become more acceptable by those in the higher brow or prestigious groups.While can appreciate the craftsmanship and unique style put into the making of Uncut Gems. It proved itself to be a film that comes from passionate minds that want to tell their stories in the way they want to. There are definitely some things to admire about this film, but I would say that by the end it made me feel exhausted and unconformable at times which doesn't necessarily mean that's bad just that I wish the intent for it was more controlled/intentional.

Excellent in nearly every regard. It's inspiring to learn how the Safdie brothers got to this point, and even more inspiring seeing their end result. This is one of the most stimulating and downright physically exhausting movies I've seen in the cinema (in the best way possible). Not once did I feel as though the Safdie's treated the audience as if they were unintelligent.

857,tarantino_feet_pics,Thoughts on Uncut Gems,9,5 March 2020,"Once again the Safdie brothers have created another masterpiece. They've fabricated this fast paced, anxiety ridden character piece about Howard's gambling addiction and his need to win. Uncut Gems had me gripped from beginning to end.This is definitely a career highlight for Adam Sandler, a truly outstanding Oscar worthy performance. With the help of the Safdie brothers and their incredible actor direction they have created this very believably real deeply flawed character. Howard is greedy, slimy, shifty and has a real addiction that causes all of the anguish in his life. There a many points that he could get out of this hole he's dug but he just can't let himself. It's just in his nature. He has to keep going for that next big win. Howard is a very nuanced person who, however flawed, still has a heart. Howard's death was unbelievable and shocking but was exactly where his character was leading and was the most fitting end I could have imagined.Performances from everybody were great. Julia Fox showed fantastic acting chops in her first feature film credit. Julia is obviously a damaged, irresponsible person who genuinely does care for Adam Sandler. She portrayed this character wonderfully.Just a brilliant ride of anxiety from start to finish with a fantastic performance from Adam Sandler.",Uncut Gems

The bits I could understand were just shouting and too annoying to listen to.I think I only made it about 8 minutes in before skipping forward to see if this noise was just the intro and when it would end because it was already giving me a headache.The bit right after the 11 minute mark when the music finally stopped was just shouting too so I did a cursory skip through the film to see if it was worth watching but I kept finding muffled dialogue, shouting and yet more intrusive music. So I basically just gave up.Yes this may not be a fair review of the film but it was enough for me to know that I simply will not be able to watch it without getting a migraine.

With them responding ""yes.."" to which PTA said ""amazing"", with the relief to the brothers.The hype around this film is very true. I watched good time last year for the first time and knew nothing about the directors or film and my main thoughts after the film was thinking, my god that was tense, claustrophobic, stressful...but in a good way. Uncut gems is all of that and turned up to 11.Sandlers performance in this is a freight train without any intent to stop. its so frustrating to watch this character go through his addictive motions as the movie progresses.There is so much dialogue and hard to tell what may have been scripted or not.

He really does a good job of elevating his role to a point where you almost understand why he does the things he does but then when he does do something stupid you understand why he would choose to do that because he portrays his character so well. I really enjoyed the screenplay I loved some of the nods to 70s and 80s crime/thrillers. The direction is fantastic and really hits home base. However, most of all the original score is what brings this film to a whole new level. It is pounding and riveting with some classic 80s synth to make it slick and you can literally feel your heart race speed up and become on par with the score as the film progresses.",Uncut Gems

I can see myself reciting lines from it as I place my $50 sports bet, the same way I recite lines from Rounders when I tell my friends that ""I'll Splash the Pot Whenever the F I Please"".I thought Sandler truly captured the character. I know people like this, I've seen it. Successful guys that just need that one last thrill, that one big bet... that always turns into another. Sandler caught the sloppiness, the deceit, the anxiousness of these type of guys so well that I'd bet he or a loved one went through something like this.I thought it was really clever how they tied in Garnett and the NBA ECF he played in too. Can't recall a movie doing that well.The ending was cool too, a budget Reservoir Dogs type of ending, but cool nonetheless.I enjoyed how the Safdie brothers filmed the movie. They were able to display the gritty side of NYC, while still showing the money that flows around so readily. The film was very gray & I think it helped convey the fog that Sandler was in. Great, original movie.",Uncut Gems
869,coopermcdonald-52056,Adam Sandler at his finest.,8,18 February 2020,"From acclaimed filmmakers Josh and Benny Safdie comes the electrifying crime thriller Uncut Gems. This film centers a jewelry store owner in Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) as he gets his hands on a precious gemstone from Ethiopia, he decides to lend it to an NBA star in good faith. What sadly becomes apparent is the fact that he has many issues under the surface. Being a really shady figure and having a serious gambling addiction ends up giving this movie an insane amount of tension. This is a roller coaster ride of claustrophobia and I couldn't get enough of it.
It has been a fascinating ride watching the numerous ups and downs of Adam Sandler's career. From classic comedies like Happy Gilmore to great dramatic performances like Reign Over Me, he has proven time and time again that he is a very talented guy. The problem is that he has let himself fall out of the spotlight over the last ten years, simply due to the fact that he has been choosing some of the worst films of each year, on multiple occasions. I can say without a shadow of doubt, that this has been Sandler's best performance yet. While Eric Bogosian, Lakeith Stanfield, Kevin Garnett and many others here give an extremely solid performance, it's Sandler's show, and it's soulful and tense and harrowing and ultimately (as terrible as Howard can be) tragic. The filmmakers's greatest achievement from the looks of this and Good Time is finding star-actors who aren't known for their wide range and getting career-triumph work from them. If the movie isn't all that complex, I do think Howard is and that helps make this pretty special as a depiction of addiction, more than anything else.
By the time the third act begins, you'll probably wonder why you have been so invested in Sandler's portrayal of Howard because he's really not the best person. With that said, it's the fact that he is a terrible person deep down and is so greedy that is what made it so engaging and unnerving at times.
Right when you think Howard can't possibly dig himself into a deeper hole and that the movie can't get any more stressful, he goes and makes it even worse for himself.
It is impossible to sit through this movie without biting your nails down to the nub. While this movie is out in theaters right now, I'm pretty sure it's coming to Netflix very soon, and I highly recommend watching this movie the next chance you get. I am rating Uncut Gems at an 8.2/10.",Uncut Gems
870,mightyfelix-13842,This was a good movie But too much cursing,3,14 April 2020,"How do I put this, lots of people don't like Adam Sandler because of his goofiness, I always defend him, but the way he portraits this character in this movie, let me down big time with his all cursing words throughout the movie. I know there will be curse in movies but for me, that was a little too much. maybe I should have read the rating but then again most of his movie isn't like this one. anyway, it was a good movie and without all that cursing I would have give this movie and 8. I guess I will never see Adam Sandler the same way. sry But that just my opinion like everyone else here.",Uncut Gems
871,westbayou,Could have been great,1,29 May 2020,"Adam Sandler deserved an award for his acting and making the most out of this trash. Otherwise it is quite possibly the worst movie I've finished in the last few years. If you don't mind 2-hours of F-bombs being screamed at you, then you may like this movie. Otherwise skip it. The Safdi brothers seem to pride themselves in putting out irrational nonsense and calling it a movie. I turned off their other effort ""Good Time"" after 25 minutes. The story could have been good, but the way they filmed it is awful. There isn't a single scene where someone isn't screaming obscenities into the camera. Ooooh, so cutting edge, so original. Or not, not at all...... The critics rating this highly are on crack. Sandler was great, but the rest of this dumpster fire needs to go away.",Uncut Gems
872,j-portnoy,Adam Sandler's Career Turning Performance,9,9 September 2020,"Uncut Gems, directed by Josh and Benny Safdie, is an American crime thriller following a frantic gambling addict and diamond dealer in New York City's Diamond District. Ratner is just the worst. We learn he's in the process of separating from his wife and mother of his three children, presumably in favor of his young mistress (Julia Fox), who by day works at his jewel shop and by night sells coke. Ratner owes money to basically everyone in the Diamond District, having made a series of bad bets and terrible decisions. You'll find yourself rooting for the character at times and then cringing and shouting internally when you see him undermining himself and digging himself deeper. This movie is the most uncomfortable and stress inducing film I have ever seen, but it is still really good. It was very faced paced so paying attention to every detail is important. I did love the fact that Kevin Garnett and The Weeknd played themselves in the movie, it was cool to see celebrities interact with normal people. Overall, I recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a great performance from Adam Sandler and a super interesting story.",Uncut Gems

Not art. I can see why so many people have confused this for a good movie, it's so busy shouting at you from every angle it's hard not to be confused which is a neat trick considering the plot isn't hard to follow at all. Nothing about this movie was explicitly bad but nothing about it was great either. Adam Sandler gives a decent performance considering the shoddy script he was given and it's interesting seeing him play a role so far from his usual, past that this movie has nothing more to offer than a moderately boring waste of 2 hours. Obnoxious synth music plagues most scenes and when it doesn't multiple characters are constantly shouting over each other, a complete cluster **** is the best way to describe this movie.

But wow is it fascinating.Rarely does a movie capture my attention this viscerally to the point where I don't see the movie anymore, I'm living the experience. From the intense direction, and the unnoticeably masterful editing, a good movie is warranted by how well all of the tools are used to expand the unique story being told, and all of those tools were firing on all cylinders for Uncut Gems.For me, it might be a masterpiece. What points I give this movie for realism, I do find this particular characters life to be almost too chaotic, maybe to the point of being unrealistic. But at the same, that's what makes it so much fun to watch.My only warning goes to the average movie goer looking for a lighthearted drama, because this is not that.

882,hmd455,A Two Hour Plus Cussatron,2,4 June 2020,"I saw the ratings decided to watch this movie. I guess the movie has some value as a warning and insight into a person that couldn't control his gambling and in result ruined everything he had built in his life. The character Sandler portrays is a very unlikeable person that you wouldn't want to have as a friend or be around on a daily basis. The fact that he is a cursing machine really gets tiring as could he say a sentence without a curse word being muttered answer no.
The final verdict is I didn't like the movie because I actually have to like a character or two when I watch a film and well there wasn't anyone to like in this move. Even Kevin Garnet playing himself came off as a self centered person that wanted everything his own way. I guess something like this has certainly happened to someone in real life and I feel for them, but it does not entertain me.

Anytime Sandler does something serious, he always delivers in my opinion. That is the case with ""Uncut Gems""!The movie stars Sandler as a top jeweler in New York's Diamond district who has a major gambling problem owing God knows how many people money and constantly cheats on his wife with one of his assistants. The first of his problems come when muscle for Sandler's loan shark brother in law come to his shop and threaten him for constant unpaid debts. Then Kevin Garnett, in a great supporting role as himself, comes in to his shop and sees an amazing Opal that Sandler purchased from Ethiopia and wants Sandler to sell it to him.From there, it's an intense, heart stopping thriller with Sandler constantly trying to get his money back to endless horrible results, trying to sell the opal at an auction, balancing his relationship with his wife (Idina Menzel) and his mistress (newcomer Julia Fox).What I liked most about this movie was it's accurate depiction about how gambling can ruin lives and as for Adam Sandler, he creates a character that is unlikeable in every way that we just look at the screen and find it so hard to root for him even though we would think he'd learn his lesson.This isn't a perfect film but Adam Sandler need to do more dramas cause this is some of the best work he's done",Uncut Gems

This almost deterred me from watching uncut gems. Thank god it didn't...I had a good idea what this film would be like. Some dark comedy, a bit trippy, maybe an overload. Well I was right to an extent, but in every area it really did over deliver. It's INSANE!First 40 mins I thought, yep as expected. A bit hard to follow as it's mental.

924,juddbean-22553,Very Creative & Fun Movie that Should've Been Better,7,14 March 2020,"Although it was a very creative story and a great performance by Sandler, I felt the movie seemed jumbled, rushed, and lacked genuineness. With a dramatic script closely tied to real life people and events, I didn't feel a sense of compelling. authentic emotion from the cast. With these flaws, I didn't become emotionally-invested in the story, nor have I spent time reflecting back on it. Perhaps, these flaws could have been quelled either with a more tightly-edited production to ""remove the fluff and non-essential characters,"" OR through a multi-part series with time to develop deeper, more authentic characters and remove any confusion in the production, thereby establishing rapport with the viewer extending beyond the final scene.",Uncut Gems

I realized living through this much stress is not worth seeing a payoff I am indifferent about.My question, why would the crew of this film get together and think this is a good idea? They just add stress after stress which is altogether not adding to any real story? This brings me to my next point, why would they make this movie's story simply about stressing its audience? I stopped watching after the magnetic door wasn't working and the spilling of the smoothie. I realized I'm not a big enough fan of Sandler to warrant this increase in blood pressure.I understand the filmmakers were going for this stress, but why, why? Why make a film that is just as stressful (or more) as real life and just make you get so mad at the characters? I understand progress in cinema, niche markets which need to be filled, etc cetera. This niche, however, feels like it shouldn't be filled in any possible universe.We are not living in the best of all possible worlds, and this movie is definitive proof of this.

So we know he has what it takes, but this film just fails to impress: nearly all of the cast are simply nasty, unlikable, or obnoxious (including Adam's character); the dialog is hard to interpret without the use of subtitles (thank heaven for those); the music if you can call it that is not to my taste; the gambling culture is without merit.

Something I've come to realize over the years with each additional film is the importance of their long-time collaborator Ronald Bronstein, who has co-written their two most recent screenplays, including the one for this film. As he is the first credited writer on both, I can only assume that he was the head writer. As such I would consider him the true hero of this film.

Throw in a bunch of distracting side plots/characters who mostly amount to nothing.No plot - Just an interminable sequence of stupid actions done stupidly. For some reason Howard seems to lie to people who know not to trust him, and pick fights with people who are stronger than him.No character arcs - No one seems to ever learn anything.No acting - The surprise performance of the entire film was Kevin Garnett. When a pro-athlete playing himself out acts the rest of the cast, go figure.No moral - I thought maybe this is a study in stupidity, but even that doesn't emerge. The stupidest thing Howard does is gamble impulsively. And yet he WINS all his big bets. Not great message that you can gamble your way to big pay days.

Adam does justice to the role of an ambitious diamond merchant who tries to make amends for his lenders by trying to buy one of the opals from the African Jewish community without knowing if his risks would indeed be worthy enough for the efforts.Although Adam Sandler seems artful during the initial parts of the movie, he rather looked gullible when he was hoodwinked by the African group with the Black Opal by selling him for a price that it was not worth for. There are too many scenes that show how helpless the protagonist is when he is unable to spend time with his family and is constantly under the dagger, but beyond a point, those scenes seemed unnecessary to the plot.The movie explains how heartless the loan sharks are in the NYC business centres and how seemingly clever men fall for ways that send them to the abyss. Although some moments created palpable tension in the audience, the movie as a whole fails to cut ice.

The Avengers finale was great fun, sure, but it didn't have the sheer grunt this movie has. The Safdies, who did Good Time and lit the screen up using Robert Pattinson against type, have surpassed even that top-notch film with this one. This is a nerve-jangling slide into an increasingly soul-destroying abyss and Sandler is as good as I've seen any acting job this year if not better. He truly is note perfect.

On the bright side I have never seen Adam Sandler deliver this calibre of acting - he was captivating. However he and this film captivated me into a dizzying spell of anxiety. As piece of art - it is spectacular because it settles you into a dark and stressful mood that gets worse as this film lurches on.

How can someone cancel a $20,000 bet between a bookie and a third party? What sort of bookie allows that? Is the $20,000 refunded? What happens to the $20,000? Never explained. It doesn't explain how such a thing is possible and what it actually means?
Who would benefit from the net being cancelled. If anything the guy would have benefited from allowing the bet, he gained nothing by cancelling it.Also, the main character owes money but he has a very large inventory of jewelry that can be used as collateral. Instead these guys plan to attack him in front of many witnesses at a high school play?Maybe these gangsters are just idiots and they are making uneducated decisions and that is supposed to be part of the movie.

What is gambling addiction really like? The movie moves away from the accepted levels of unconscionable acts we are used to & gives you the real deal. You can expect a hardcore, unsubstituted look into the life of a formerly successful precious gems dealer who is a family man, also a gambler & an adulterer.As the story unravels, what's odd is your brain struggling to come to terms with the crippling chaos breaking out because this man makes all the wrong moves.. Or does he?Still, you accept it; that this must be the norm in the lives of a gambler with high profile clients. That's how convincing both director & writer Benny Safdie, Josh Safdie & surprisingly here breaking stereotypes Adam Sandler captured this raw unconventional story.Recommended to anyone who loved the likes of....

You will feel drained by the end, which was also intended. The erratic interactions, unsteady camera and ominous music all serve to assist getting you to an uncomfortable state.Some won't understand the deeper meanings, but there is a connection to the uncut gems and Howie (Sandler). He's a gambler and jeweler addicted to the high he gets by trying to successfully hustle and gamble. The $ is never enough and things don't usually work out and the he doubles down. He is trying to manage chaos (our universe), but he can't manage his marriage, his personal relationships, his emotions, his business...but he is always desperately trying to.Although Howie is a terrible person in a lot of ways, he has a woman that loves him, his son loves him, he has an odd but endearing charisma with many people. Ultimately, he lives in a dream state that he can control chaos, but when things finally pay off, he is riding a high and then is ultimately brought crushingly back into reality.Humans are complex and although he has many bad traits, he has good ones as well down deep, much like the cold rock exterior of the uncut gem and beauty hidden beneath it that started him on his insane, unhinged journey.",Uncut Gems

The pace of the movie is chaotic, it's loud, it's 200 mph. It does keep you guessing up to a point, but that's where I started to feel short changed.We meet a lot of characters throughout the film, we start to engage with them, figure out their modus operandi, but that's as far as it goes...people you think are going to be crucial to the plot drift away. I was constantly looking for a twist, a reason for some of the characters and the possible plot lines, but in reality they all amount to pretty much nothing, so much so I do wonder if the movie was written with different endings and only decided upon near the end of filming.All in all I'm pleased I watched it but it left me feeling cheated and I would never consider watching it again.",Uncut Gems

1024,dpers,"Safdie Brothers are here to stay, Sandler dazzles",8,28 December 2019,"""Uncut Gems"" has been marketed as a high pace, sports-centered thriller detailing the exploits of a sleezy con man always looking for a big score. It delivers on all fronts, while still preserving the same arthouse style that the Safdie's demonstrated in their 2017 film ""Good Time."" Gems will satisfy the casual movie-goer looking for an entertaining flick with an actor they're comfortable with watching. It also packs a loaded punch of indelible performances and fast-pace moments that are unforgettable for cinephile types. Bring your sports loving dad or your theater major cousin, both will get something out of this movie in large part because of the performances from Sandler and former NBA big man Kevin Garnett.
Gems is one of the more memorable movies of the year because of Sandler's strikingly authentic portrayal of a New York hustler jeweler. Sandlers often gets over-looked for his acting chops. In fairness he did make ""Little Nicky"" and ""Jack and Jill"" so it's understandable to knock him as a perfectionist of his craft. However, he had a dick-swinging performance in ""Punch Drunk Love"" that doesn't get near enough credit, and in Gems Sandler reminds us. In addition, the movie packs a thoughtful soundtrack that augments the interesting looks into existentialism and philosophies about individual success and struggle detailed in the movie. I'm looking forward to whatever the Safdie brothers make next, and with the backing of movie industry big guns, like executive producer Martin Scorsese, I'm sure they'll get plenty more opportunities.",Uncut Gems

The soundtrack is odd. I get that they were going for an 80s-90s vibe, which would make sense if it were SET in that time period. The sound just doesn't fit a movie set in 2012. The story- like others said, it's just a whole lot of yelling at each other with a ""where's the money"" theme to the point that because they're all talking over each other it's hard to know why they're even arguing.

Stylistically, it shares DNA with Greenaway, Altman and early Scorsese. The Tangerine Dream/Vangelis by way of the Chemical Bros. score is jarringly discordant with the visuals to great effect, often overpowering the violent shouting of the characters. The performances are top notch and you find yourself rooting for Sandler's reprehensible Howard, maybe if he wins one time he can turn his life around. Julia Fox is brilliant as Sandler's mistress in almost all that she does here, with the exception of one scene where her tears feel forced and the dialogue ultimately undercuts her performance.

1046,alecalbury,"Intense, frenetic, anxiety inducing nightmare",8,3 February 2020,"Adam Sandler is absolutely fantastic as the gruff, sleazy, naive, endlessly optimistic Howard Ratner, a risk-taking gambler and jeweller who is in debt with some rather angry and unsympathetic characters.One bad decision and a lot of bad luck sends Howard's life spiralling out of control, and the film sticks very closely with Howard as we watch him struggle to keep a lid on everything.Uncut Gems establishes a level of tension right from the get go which quickly increases as Howard pushes further into the ensuing madness.This tension may put people off as its achieved through naturalistic performances and some spectacular editing; quick cuts, lots of reaction shots and characters shouting over each other gives the film its freneticism and then the claustraphobic cinematography and performances imbue a sense of realism in the film that makes the tension almost unbearable at times, it's borderline anxiety inducing.However, if you can go with it then you will be utterly transfixed for the duration.For me Uncut Gems was a masterclass in rising tension, my mouth dropped at the end. Adam Sandler gives a fantastic performance and the Safdie brothers have really triumphed on a technical level, to sustain the pace for over 2 hours is an achievement in itself.My only criticism would be that thematically there's not much to chew on afterwards... this is a story of one man's addiction to risk and the danger of his greed and optimism and that's pretty much it.Overall, a brilliant film that showcases Sandler as a real actor to be lauded amongst the best and that the Safdies are a powerhouse pair of directors, I cant wait to see what they do next.",Uncut Gems

That is literally the entire point of the movie. Not every movie has you thinking happy thoughts and has a happy ending. These people have ZERO clue what they are talking about and should stick to watching Disney movies because life is apparently a fairy tale. Do you think that someone living this kind of lifestyle and running into this chaos is going to be happy and having a good time? Like give me a break people. You need to wake up and realize this is reality for some people. The reason it seems like chaos and is anxiety central is because the film makers made it that way on purpose because its reality!! The music and the constant shouting is exactly how this sort of life plays out for these people (high stakes gamblers) The human race just wants a happy ending and things to wrap up in a nice little bow at the end so they can feel good about their lives. Go watch something else like Tot Story because these types of movies don't want your attention and clueless reviews. The way this movie makes you feel is exactly how it was supposed to, so anyone saying they left feeling odd and upset after means that the movie did its job, unfortunately these people are too stupid to realize what good film making is. This movie is an absolute masterpiece. For anyone reading the tons of 1 star reviews you can just ignore them because these are the types of people that will sit and talk to you about different types of candles and laundry detergent for hours on end.

The movie itself kept me on edge the entire time - you simply could not anticipate a single thing. The ending was a bit shocking and no one could see it coming.I absolutely love how unique and remarkable this movie is. A true masterpiece. There is absolutely nothing close to this movie out there; a class of its own. A must watch for the true cinema fans out there.,Uncut Gems

Decided to watch this after seeing this film pop up on so many ""2019 Top 10 movies"" lists and I couldn't be happier that I did. Adam Sandler absolutely killed it in this, I kept feeling confused at the choices he made but at the same time felt sorry for him.That ending game though... my palms were sweaty and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see if it was going to end badly like most gambling movies do. I was extremely surprised to see him win his bet thinking ""wow this movie actually is going to have a happy ending"" but oh boy was I SHOCKED when Sandler unlocked that door... my jaw was on the ground.Only thing keeping it from a 10 is the ending felt incomplete. What's his family going to think and what's his side piece gonna do once she came back to his dead corpse. Either way this movie was amazing.Edit: wow did not expect so much hate on this film after reading other reviews... not to mention it looks like users here are fishing out positive reviews and marking them all as ""non helpful"".

1062,johnnydangelo000,One of the best movies I've ever seen.,10,14 December 2019,"Words cannot even describe this movie. You have to just see it. The music, the dialogue, the acting, the sounds... it's unbelievable. I've never seen anything like it. The Safdie Brothers have made it clear that they are making films that THEY want to make. You will not find some formulaic storytelling model in Uncut Gems.The brothers' direction is on another level in this film. I'm sure even veteran directors will be blown away by it. Sandler was absolutely gripping and believable as a compulsive gambler with no redeeming qualities. Julia Fox was also amazing as Sandler's employee and mistress. I wish Idina Menzel had a larger role but she was also great in her limited amount of scenes. Some of the actors are first-time actors and/or jewelers in real life, which is astounding considering how good they were. Kevin Garnett also delivers a great performance. Although he is supposed to be playing a version of ""himself"", he came across as a villain which suited the film well.The ending goes down as some of the best cinema I've ever seen (this is not hyperbole). It is shocking but completely fitting while at the same time hysterical. In fact, the entire film managed to balance an insane amount of comedy, thrills, and drama.But this review cannot be finished without mentioning the composer Daniel Lopatin AKA Oneohtrix Point Never. His score reminds me of what Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross did in THE SOCIAL NETWORK. It just adds a whole other layer of complexity and depth to the film.10++ stars. Should get nominated for an Oscar or two. In a different era, this film would get nominated for many Oscars. But I think it'll definitely get nominated for best original screenplay and best original score.Also Ronald Bronstein (co-writer and editor) deserves credit for this masterpiece as well. He doesn't get as much attention as The Safdies but I think he'll have a long, prosperous career.",Uncut Gems
1063,ohadlu,An uncut gem,7,13 February 2020,"This movie really IS an uncut gem, all the characters too, the film itself delivers a nice story but they given a lot more attention to a Celtics ball game, you feel mercy for Adam Sandler's character but nothing more than that, he's doing way too much Netflix low budget films just to make ends meet (I think) but he was the leading act of this film and he really deserves the credit he was applaud for, and when his character died at the late peak of the film, it kind of disappointed me for couple of reasons:
1. He was the leading character of the story
2. It feels like a lazy writing for an end: ""nah, just kill him""
3. They could've done a better sad ending so there's an ACTUAL REASON to kill his character
Also I'm not a big sports fan but I really wanted to see the Celtics win the game at the end of the film! Like I said, the film does give a heavier attention to the basketball game that overshadowing the characters and you wonder if the film is about basketball or about sport betting and the dangers of it or even about a jewlry maker with mid-life crisis.
I did stick to the end of it, just out fo curiosity, as I write this I now truly understand why it got the title it is given but still, they could've done it better to persuade me.",Uncut Gems

The setting and characters feel so real and relatable - you really feel pulled into the movie. The screenplay is perfect - it doesnt get bogged down in jewelry jargon but doesnt make you feel dumb. It gives you subtle foreshadowing to lead you on and then yanks the rug from beneath you right when you think you know what will happen next. Its brilliant. This was filmed brilliant. Further, Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast is unbelievably good. Everything feels so real to the point that it almost has a documentary sense to it.

1070,nhirsteurope-59957,Emperor's New Clothes,1,2 February 2020,"Like so many before me, I wanted to see this movie because of all I had read about the Safdie brothers and their unique style. And the trailer seemed OK and, remembering 'Spanglish' (2004), I know Adam Sandler can be more than the sum of his comedy parts when getting stuck into a meatier, more dramatic role. What a shame then that my decision making proved to be as flawed as Sandler's character in this film - or even Adam Sandler himself in agreeing to do it. 'Uncut Gems' is a mess of half-realised characters who shout a lot, swear even more and whose first reaction to any situation is to resort to violence. So where does this go so wrong - not enough room here but for a start, shouting is no substitute for acting and, most pertinently, the plot needs to have some foundation in plausibility. This is where the whole pack of cards comes tumbling down. The incident that effectively initiates the action is something the Sandler character does that is so mind-numbingly stupid not even donkey with learning difficulties would do it. Let alone someone who is supposed to be a bit of a sharp operator in New York underground betting circles. After that, the plot, and film, becomes a nightmarish mess of unfulfilled and unfulfillable situations. At least 'Uncut Gems' is well-named, hence the one star, since an uncut gem is just a piece of dirty earth...you see where I'm going with that!",Uncut Gems

1083,planetrenzy,Unexpectedly brilliant,8,22 April 2021,"I hadn't heard alot about this film previously and was not expecting it to be the sort of film that it actually is.This is a story about a man who is constantly juggling debts and almost quite literally robbing Peter to pay Paul in order to keep on top of his mounting gambling debts,the best way to describe it is thats its a Jewish Gangster flick
Adam Sandlers Howard is the most annoying,grating,obnoxious, loud ,stupid, horrible character you will ever encounter but strangely enough he is also quite sad and human
You will start to root for the bad guys in some parts just so he will shut up,but by God he plays this character so well you will almost forget his forte is comedy and formulaic rom coms like the wedding singer
Adam Sandler an absolute stand out in this more serious role and absolutely kills it
Without spoiling the film Howard finds himself in very hot water with some heavy dudes and has to lie cheat steal and manipulate his way into making money to pay off his debts all while trying to keep hold of and sell his big break ,a rare gigantic black opal
This movie is VERY slow for the first half which is its only real downfall .The 2nd half picks up the pace when things start to go awry for Howard and his life starts to spiral
The last 15mins will make you feel so tense-nervous-anxious that you have to stop and basically tell yourself to chill because its just a movie ,it plays out THAT well
And even better is it has a great finish unlike alot of other films like this that become unrealistic and predictable
Im so glad I took the plunge and watched this

1084,arraychannel,A Masterclass in Nail-Biting Cinema,9,13 June 2020,"This movie was INTENSE. To put this into scale, the scenes where the characters are merely watching basketball games are the somehow full of unrivaled tension that I've never felt from a film before. I'm 16 and I've seen my fair share of movies, everything from the greats (Shawshank, Platoon, Natural Born Killers, Citizen Kane, etc.) to the stinkers (Troll 2, Stone Cold, etc.). This movie easily tops the list of the most intense films that I have ever seen. Besides from the sheer intensity, Adam Sandler gives a knockout performance as Howard. I was completely engaged in his character the entire time I was watching the movie, never believing for one second that Sandler was any other character. The acting from Julia Fox is especially convincing as well; she has quite a future in the film industry. The cinematography is beautiful, the acting is fantastic, the story is tense, exciting, and very well thought-out, and the ending will most likely catch you completely off guard. I know it did to me. Uncut Gems is on Netflix if you want to watch it, but for the more faint of heart, take a break around the hour and twenty minute mark and let yourself breathe. You may forget to.",Uncut Gems

They are formulaic and I always found his comedy kind of weird with that goofy voice he did and acting like an idiot. He is dynamic in this movie, however, and the film draws you in and doesn't let go. Maybe he's realizing that he's in his 50s and it's time to be a real actor and do good movies.

I suppose he gives a good performance, but the film is so chaotic and messy that in this instance, I can't give him too much praise.There is so much yelling in this movie, it has to be heard to be believed. I missed a great deal of dialogue because of characters overtalking each other. And if that wasn't already enough, the movie has a terrible score which is mixed atrociously, and plays over much of the dialogue, making it even harder to hear.I get that this was intentional. I get that the aim was to induce anxiety in the audience by making the film as uncomfortably noisy as possible, but I think that overall, this is detrimental to the movie, making it harder to follow and vastly more irritating.Look, Uncut Gems certainly had potential. Done well, this could have been a riveting movie, but the point is that it isn't done well, so it's engaging moments are few and far between.

Adam Sandler does a fine job portraying a character as shallow and unrealistic as they come, a cartoon unceremoniously shoved into a caricature of a real world. Idina Menzel was great, considering she laughed in his face and was planning on divorcing him.At any point in the course of the film, Howie had a clear and obvious path to fix his mistakes. His character was the equivalent of Carmen Electra at the beginning of Scary Movie, constantly and obviously doing something stupid for the sake of advancing an incomprehensible plot.There was nothing realistic about this.

1107,Ray53,Memorable Train Wreck,9,2 January 2020,"This excellent movie's like watching some kind of terrible crash; viewers may be horrified but unable to look away. Even people who dislike Adam Sandler movies (like me) have to respect his performance in this film -- the whiney manboy is still there, but not enough to ruin a credible performance as a complex Big Score chaser whose ""surely this time it's my turn"" sensibility makes him insensitive to others and the fool of his own ill considered ambitions. In fact, Sandler's ability to develop a character with a terribly arrested adolescent mindset is central to the film's success. And that ""whatever rotten thing I do I can make up for"" ethos is dead on for so many people today.Most of the characters in the film are pretty horrible -- or, put another way, disturbingly human, though afflicted with some of humankind's worse characteristics -- greed, lust, selfishness, insecurity, hypocrisy. Hustlers abound (and some even sort of sound like a famous occupant of the White House).Keven Garnett turns in an excellent performance -- the gifted and privileged basketball superstar and his entourage of tough guys, sycophants and parasites.The Safdie brothers are phenomenal film makers. Scenes are cluttered with people talking over and past one another (so, totally realistic for a solipsistic age); each scene is designed masterfully (excellent sets, lighting, sound, costumes, movement). The film often feels like an American version of a falling Babylon w/o the past record of greatness.There is a tiny glimmer of hope in the film -- a good hearted (if naive) person sort of makes out.To viewers expecting a block buster, sorry -- this is an arthouse film with some famous people, but even if you end up sort of hating the film, you will have to admit it is a superior movie. It should win awards.",Uncut Gems

1109,doglindsay,Intense roller coaster ride. Sandler's best.,9,12 January 2020,"Wow. I can't believe all the 1's. Strap in, this film is non-stop pressure ride. If you can't handle being anxious or uncomfortable maybe this might not be for you. Sandler's character, Howard Ratner, is a natural born hustler. Clever, driven, wound tight and a little too passionate. He's often a little too smart for his own good. You can't help but hope that some of his schemes will work but a lot of external events or just plain bad luck constantly trip him up. I found myself thinking about it a lot the next day. Definitely one of the best films of 2019. PS-I'm generally not a fan of Adam Sandler. This is totally different than any of his comedies.",Uncut Gems

i thought it´s going to be a stressy, rush with lots of quick cuts, handy cam style movie where he gets chased nonstop etc..but this movie is really not bad, i would even say its really good!
was really surprised in a positive way.the story got me right from the beginning, as well as the characters.
multiple strings attached to one man which appears to be Adam Sandler who plays his role absolutely brilliant in my opinion.shady half wrecked jewish juwellery dealer who gets himself into trouble over moeny and his gambling habbit.the movie has its slow moments as well as his fast but i never felt i was rushed through it or giving to much input / stress.
No it flows very well and keeps us on our toes.another great thing in my eyes was the music.
some find it not fitting but i think it was perfect for certain scenes and it underlined the atmosphere/mood perfectly.they play with the audience even there´s not something of a real twist to the story, but i found myself couple of times guessing the wrong and was happy that i was wrong.i may watch it another time soon and can just recommend it!

I disagree; if he was he would not of subjected us to a film like this. It seems his 'advisers' told him to make a serious movie, something to get him in academy award contention. Sandler comes up with this 'gem', which is basically a 130 minutes chaotic mess were everyone screams and swears at each other while the main character does one stupid thing after another. There's really very little plot, its basically real life tv style film making, watching Sander's life implode as he makes bad choice after bad choice for no apparent reason.

1127,dumbest_username,A profoundly messy film...with rough diamond acting.,7,26 May 2020,"Technically speaking, 'Uncut Gems' is a rather exceptional original film about exceptionally annoying to highly stressful self induced situations thrown into a messy pile, then kicked over out of spite by friend and foe alike. I'm a fan of film productions that go against the grain and groundbreaking music/art/cinema in general. Making me pretty much this films target audience, this is not my first rodeo of broken eggs to make some sort of point omelet. Even if the point might be a bit obligatory as it is convoluted. Some of the best thought provoking films lack a token happy ending. This said, I fall a bit short of singing it's high praises, but I'm rating it a bit higher than my initial impressions simply because it deserves it. There were a few career defining performances riding along in this vehicle of depressingly applied strife gone all brands of wrong. A malfunctioning NYC themed carnival ride of a film likely to cause personal injury and/or nausea to those that regrettably climbed on board. The spa inspired new age-y chime-y synth musical score is one quaintly disquieting example, like much in this film, apparently designed to set the audience on edge, jab at them a bit as they flail and teeter, then give them a gentle shove off. With abundant illustrations of you did it to yourself, enjoy the last few seconds before the bomb drops, or when life hands you lemons, pee in the punch bowl? Not sure, but I'll try to paraphrase as this film does, we are all merely players, (we are also a bunch of pawns, psychopaths, and clowns respectively in it for a buck), and the world is a stage, (to jeer and throw bottles at each other as required). Things don't fit, they don't match, life sucks, then you die, existence is flawed and futile. Belligerent existential reality check successfully received in the shape of a movie. Got it. Already had it a while back, but appreciate the reminder. Adam Sandler is easily as good as any prior break out ""serious"" roles, as are the somewhat oddly assembled ensemble cast. Yet, while it certainly did make me think...something, I think. After 2 hours of various characters shouting hack philosophical variations on the theme of life being a a giant hassle amidst the failed hustle, often delivered with the finesse of an overflowing garbage can dumped on my head...my senses were admittedly relieved the yelling was finally over. Mission accomplished for the filmmakers I guess.",Uncut Gems

I'm not a fan of Adam sandler and this didn't help. His voice was the most annoying part of the movie. Title had little to do with the movie. Ending was the saving grace as it was unexpected.

The story quickly gains momentum and maintains it until the credits roll, even then you're unsure if you can relax yet or not.An element of filmmaking that doesn't often get highlighted is the score, and this film has a great one. The persistent score is the only thing that will remind you that you're watching a movie, giving the film an etherial and almost futuristic feel.Last and certainly not least is the dialogue, I cannot remember the last time I heard dialogue that felt so real, natural, and believable. People talk over each other, have to repeat themselves, and above all they talk like people do. This helps add to the constant intensity of the film and the overall gritty realism.Get yourself some popcorn and an extra stick of deodorant and go see Uncut Gems now.

The film really gets going when he walks out of the theatre but this part doesn't fully make sense until later on as the intricate plot really starts to unwind.Sandler really deserves an Oscar and after watching this a few days after watching the Joker I believe Sandler leaves Joaquin Phoenix trailing a long way behind in acting terms and it's true you'll need blood pressure tablets before watching this film as it's stressful and intense but you'll be smiling at Howard Ratner's chaotic behaviour if you stick it out to the end.Best movie since Bad Times at the El Royale.,Uncut Gems
1148,puffymcblaze,A Crime Thriller Wannabe,2,26 September 2020,"This film wants to be a crime thriller, badly. So much so, that in lack of a good story, dialogue, direction, acting, and basically everything else a crime thriller requires in order to be a good one, they had to resort to cheap psychological tricks to influence the audience into thinking that it is.It's trying to be an urban version of ""No Country for Old Men"", but it doesn't understand how to create true suspense or believable interactions. There is no character depth or progression despite having so many characters around, barely any plot progression despite it being over 2 hours long, It's the same disjointed mess 100 minutes in as it is 10 minutes in. Sendler is like a bad Christopher Walken impression if you took out all of Walken's likability, and he's the most talented actor on screen. You know the acting is truly bad when the emotional scenes are making you cringe and laugh instead of empathizing...Nearly every conversation consists of barely coherent ramblings, with characters constantly talking over each other or being unnecessarily loud. My initial thought was that the purpose of it was to make conversations appear more organic or realistic, since that happens sometimes in real life, but they seem to have forgotten that it doesn't happen ALL THE TIME WITH EVERY SINGLE PERSON AROUND, which lead me to the likelier assumption that it was simply used as one of several psychological tricks designed to influence the audience's stress levels and substitute that feeling of being ""on the edge of your seat"".Like having to listen extra attentively because the dialogue is 80% noise, or feeling uncomfortable because people keep shouting, or using shaky-cam ""reality TV style"" filmography, or creating cognitive dissonance by using Blade Runner-esque 80's synths as soundtrack for a film that's set in 2012 (that one might've been just poor decision, I admit, there's certainly plenty of that to go around).These aren't even clever psychological tricks like some films utilize, they're basically the equivalent of horror movie jump scares.

1153,Kreig303,Meh.,5,14 December 2019,"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. But I came out feeling a bit ill. The frenetic trailer proved a proper foreshadowing: it was like they extended the same pacing over the entire film. As a result it becomes hard to get to know or even like any of the characters and there was a resultant stock quality to many of them, with no real tension between them provided by the story. It skates too cleanly over the main character's gambling addiction and Kevin Garnett's role is almost inscrutable as a character goes; we end up with stereotypes. The tension which exists is generated in the hyperactive cinematography and editing and it leaves you feeling more and more like the end of the film couldn't come too soon... but when it does its nonsensical... it ""wraps things up"" but very unsatisfyingly. There's just not much of a payoff for your 2 1/2 hours. In sum, I'd sit this one out and wait till it's available to stream.",Uncut Gems

I think Sandler portrays the chaotic lifestyle pretty well and I thought the female leads were pretty strong.I think where I just struggle is the amount of stupid decisions this guy makes.

I think it was realistic in this way but Adam Sandler's character was so unlikable as a person, father, husband, etc that it just made me discontent. The last 30 minutes were easily some of the most captivating minutes of my life though and were a masterpiece. It made me root for him even though I really didn't like him. The movie is slightly overrated imo but I also have to concede I may be letting my personal dislike of some of the (realistically portrayed) characters ding the rating.

A film may be unpopular, but that doesn't preclude it from being a masterpiece work of art. I am very glad I took a chance on this and watched it. This film makes you FEEL. So many emotions. I was pulled into the story for the entirety, and I was actually yelling and talking to the screen and characters. That doesn't happen often. What's important is that you watch this film, so you can decide for yourself. It's an experience of sound, intensity and feeling. I've watched thousands of movies and only left reviews for a handful. I took my time to write one for this, because it is well deserving.",Uncut Gems
1171,natehamilton-79324,Disappointment for all the hype,4,31 December 2020,"This seems to be a movie that is either loved or hated. I personally don't like this movie for a number of reasons. One being that there are many things that happen only to make Sandler's life harder or worse. For instance, he constantly is being run around by lakeith stansfield's character for no apparent reason. The whole thing with the opal being undervalued by the auctioneer makes no sense either, as the movie makes you think it's worth all this money. Also the weird guy who keeps pestering Adam Sandler's character, which ends up being pointless overall.I understand the point of the movie is to make the viewer anxious and nervous for Sandler's character, but the film just seems like a wannabe GOOD TIME. Doesn't execute nearly as well and the ending is about as dumb as it gets. SPOILEE AHEAD. Stop reading if you don't wanna know the ending. One of the loan shark's goons just decides to kill Sandler and the loan shark and rob the store. No warning or reason behind it, immediately after the movie's triumph happens.Don't recommend unless you wanna see a slightly above average, non-netflix garbage performance from Adam Sandler.",Uncut Gems

It was so strange to understand, that my stress level kept higher with the film. I was nervous an anxious, felt pitty for the main character, but at the same time was angry about him.

I wouldn't put him on a top 5 list of the year I think, have to see every movie, but because an actor usually does stupid comedies that do not require acting and then does a good movie does not mean he is amazing or top 5 in my opinion.I really liked the main plot as it was a unique story. It was super interesting and fast paced. This is a very stressful movie, emulating arguments and multitasking better than maybe any other movie I've seen.With that said, the first ten minutes (after Ethopia) was borderline unbearable due to the way the music was mixed in to me and at home I might have just turned it off.

A live colonoscopy. For a few minutes. I was genuinely uncomfortable. I don't get it? What a strange directing choice.Then you see the main character do a whole lot of shady stuff, over and over and over. He's just a complete dick to everyone, no redeeming qualities, so you don't really care what happens to him.

From the cameos of The Weeknd and KG, to the 80s sounding, video-game like soundtrack, it's so random and nothing really makes much sense to me but it works. Adam Sandler's character is like if you were to take Larry David from Curb Your Enthusiasm, throw in some crippling gambling addiction, and top it off with some Tony Soprano. It's so cringe worthy and you hate his character but you can't help but feel bad for him at the same time.

The movie is a little bit all over the place in the beginning but it works well because Howard's life is all over the place too, good achievement in directing.
The movie is entertaining but by no means it is a masterpiece. It is a good enjoyable movie and definitely worth a watch.
I feel like this would be a good movie for Scorcese to direct and it would obviously be so much better (imagine the casting he would get for this).
Anyway I think you will like this movie but don't put your expectations too high. Good movie w good acting.

I think they could have cut the scene where he hides in the closet in his Manhattan apartment to surprise his mistress. The entire scene was gross and unnecessary, and I wish it had been cut out. Her character had firmly been established and his as well. This was just vulgar and had zero bearing on the actual plot. Other than that gratuitous scene, I thought the movie was spectacular. I am a writer, so the ending was not.

I only did that for one other film and that was Black Panther (Don't get me started)
The most interesting part of the whole movie is the first few minutes and then we're in New York and everyone is screaming, almost constantly. Talking over each other. Ignoring each other. Threatening each other. And the soundtrack!!! WTF? It was like an elevator version of Vangelis. Cheesy 80's synth pop on a kids first Casio keyboard.
Sandler is like a poor mans Pacino. A screaming Pacino. Just awful. He needs to stick with comedy.... but then again, he pretty much screams and shouts in every movie so why am I surprised?
I'm having a drink now because my nerves are gone and I feel like I need to assault someone. In self defence naturally.

The story requires this. That's why the movie is good in my opinion. As if it was made to reflect the challenging situation the character is in. It also made us feel in trouble. Also he's a very strange character. As if he is used to doing many things at once. This is the character's personality.

1230,bugsmm,Not being a huge Adam Sandler fan makes this movie worth watching,7,20 January 2020,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. I had not seen any trailer or read any advance plot reveal. I did read that Sandler's performance was noteworthy in this film; I won't disagree with that. I was an earlier alum of SNL, and Sandler didn't really appeal to me. I saw a couple of his previous movies, but I found them too formulaic to enjoy. That opinion changed when I watched ""Funny People""; when comedians are courageous enough to parody themselves, that is no small undertaking.Uncut Gems I noticed by some wasn't as appealing due to the frenetic/frenzied pace thread that weaves through most of this story. Being taken from an Ethiopian mine with the same pace to almost literally being dropped into Howard Ratner's life while he is in mid ""light-speed"" mania took some adjustment, but I am very glad I was patient. The directors told the story of a man who obviously has issues, but the people in his life are very integral to determining Howard's salvation or perdition, and after watching there should be no apologies for how the story plays out factoring in those relationships. Howard is front and center in this film, and he is very much on display almost like an art piece; you either love him or hate him.I enjoyed the pace, and while the cast was truly eclectic, I saw them perform at the top of their craft. There are a lot of layers: Howard, his life, his family, his job, his ""co-workers"" (don't rely on spoilers, just watch them), the constellation of people in some very curious situations with Howard, the textured meaning behind the film's title, and yes, that ending. You may not feel compelled to root for Howard, but after knowing him for a bit you squint and cringe more often than not at the predicaments that occur, and DO they occur.This movie isn't everyone's preference. I'm glad I made a decision to watch with an open mind and less experience with too many of Adam Sandler's films. I really liked it.",Uncut Gems
1231,therealcliffbooth,Sandler's great performance doesn't make up for all of the other problems,3,2 January 2020,"Films released by A24 tend to be on the artsy side, and for me can be high risk high reward. I like to support A24, and it's a relief that there are studios like A24 still trying to make creative original films. I was hopeful that Uncut Gems would be a high risk high reward type of film, but it wasn't. It was however highly annoying. First however the good, and that was Adam Sandler. His performance as a gem business owner and gambling junkie was excellent, and arguably Oscar worthy. That's the best I have to say about Uncut Gems, and unfortunately it's not enough for me to recommend anybody taking two hours out of their life to watch it. Now for the bad. I realized I was in for a long ride during the opening credits when we were provided an internal camera view of Howard Ratner's colon during his colonoscopy which was accompanied by a relentlessly annoying musical score that never let up through the entire movie. Since the colonscopy had no relevancy to the rest of the film I'm not sure why we were treated to this experience. I may have enjoyed the movie a little more if they had a music score that fit the film, but it seemed to me like somebody slipped the music for an 80's sci-fi film into Uncut Gems. Since it was such a poor fit it served no purpose other than to act as a total distraction from what was happening on the screen. The other problem with Gems was that Howard Ratner was an entirely unlikeable character. He's a terrible husband, bad parent, abusive boyfriend, and a gambling junkie who is constantly digging himself into a deeper hole. I simply can't enjoy spending two hours with somebody this horrible. Finally the other major problem I had with Uncut Gems was the incessant talking over one another. Nobody seemed to take a breath in this movie, and there was usually at least two people talking at any given moment the entire movie. If making the viewer feel annoyed and anxious was the goal, they achieved that with me. However, I think with a different musical score, and a little breathing space in the screenplay, this could've been a much better film. Skip it.",Uncut Gems

It's aggressive, argumentative and tense from the start to the end. It feels like there's never a moment of silence or room to breathe, and I think that is the point of it. You're meant to be feeling tense throughout the film as you watch the protagonist make one bad thoughtless decision after another, surrounded by his own chaos and that becomes the mood of the film.I can't personally say that I as much ""enjoyed"" because I felt restless constantly, but at the same time I was entertained by it and it was difficult to look away due to it's intensity. The plot is a bit weak and the directing style and characters don't quite suit my taste, but I admit that the film makes up for it with a great acting performance by Adam Sandler (who's films I've never traditionally been a fan of).",Uncut Gems

I can't state this enough forget any debbie downers who may not understand a movie of truly epic proportions but that's exactly what you have here in a whirlwind of a tale that could of easily been a true story with a few dramatic embellishments but anchored by actual events.This fast moving disturbing drama that grabs you and never let's up delivers on all levels. for anyone thinking there's too much going on in this film has missed the point entirely of how much is going on in this film. The cleverly orchestrated chaos that ensues doesn't try to confuse you by doing it through time lapses of the future & past, Nor is it draped in super witty dialogue or banter because it's not. What It does though is dive head first in to the life of a Jewish New York diamond dealer that spans a little over a week and isn't apologetic about each scene twisting and turning your emotions about the choices the lead character makes along his journey for a big win. This film I guarantee undoubtedly will win Adam Sandler an Oscar award and is further proof of how amazing his acting skills truely are when writers and directors have a vision and remain persistent and focused on sticking to the script.
Each scene is crucial to the story adding layers to a cake when looked upon after completion truely reveals it's beauty and perfection.

He also should be given kudos because he pulled off a very admirable performance given his history and circumstances. However, I feel as if when an actor makes a jump or tries something different we feel the need to praise the production as ""earth shattering"" and ""groundbreaking"". This was a good movie not a great movie. The pace pulls you in but the movie lacks considerable depth and complexity that should keep up with the pace, but it doesn't. I understand the idea of the ""rush"" is also to put you in the shoes of character development but at no point did I feel vested in the outcome, I was just purely watching and wasn't consumed or affected by the outcome. The movie also lacked substance and support from the secondary cast. Many of the characters on a supporting role did not give a decent performance. Kevin Garnett was ok but my goodness, Julia Fox was fairly unimpressive in this. All in all, it's a good movie but was way overhyped because of the front man leading an Oscar crusade.

Unfortunately, I was bitterly disappointed. The constant screaming and nagging and running around of the movie left me confused at best.
In addition to the unnecessarily at times frenetic rhythm, there are these caricatures of clichéd characters. Honestly, the most interesting ones to me was the minimalist duo of Arno and Phil, in contrast to that of Sandler who only manages to give an over-the-top performance.

To give some insight into how someone in his position would feel and the surrounding factors, I really felt that he conveyed it perfectly. If the point of the film was simply to transfer his character's stress to the viewer and make them feel like they're in his position, then I think the film was relatively successful.

1298,SuspendedDisbelief_vs_Plothole,"Not for everyone, but the right choice for many",8,2 May 2020,"Everyone will feel off kilter for most of the movie, but especially if you are a straight-and-narrow type about lying and cheating. There are few absolutes here, as all the moralism is relative.Ostensibly the movie is about sports gambling and a precious gem, but those are McGuffins ---this is a character study of a kind-hearted narcissist (oxymoron) and his pulsating impact on his social sphere. If you are intrigued by that type of social/anti-social dichotomy, or even better know someone like that, then you will bravely navigate through the chaos in the bulk of the movie to a riveting denouement. The energy is high - much yelling and cursing, often overwrought - because Sandler's character pushes every opportunity and relationship to its limit for perverse gratification.The story telling is intelligent; natural with no clunky exposition. The unusual choice to set in 2012 pays off thanks to the cameos. The lust to orbit athletes and performers is assumed as given. The Wkend scene seemed gratuitous initially, but added a layer. Loose ends (like the inflated gem appraisal) are left loose. The movie could have doubled its box office with a safe Hollywood ending; but kudos for the gutsy depiction to seemingly glorify flawed humanity, living on the edge, until displaying the repercussions of falling off.Sandler has been universally praised for his performance, but I would say his character as drawn, the rapid-fire situations, and fine supporting actors (Julia Fox is a newcomer with the IT factor) make it comfortable for Sandler to deliver a solid performance. But truthfully, Sandler only operates in one gear here - albeit a different one than we are used to. I envision a gifted dramedy actor like Paul Giamatti would have been able to supply more nuance to deliver more pathos - but that is nitpicking.This movie is about choices. If you're in the mood for an intense, unflinching look at life on the edge, this is a good choice for you.",Uncut Gems

The bad: the script. The entire movie's plot is so predictable that I laughed at the end of the film because I knew how it would end about 20 minutes in. *minor spoilers ahead*. There isn't anything new in this film that hasn't been explored in other movies that deal with *spoilers* smuggling or gambling.

Essentially someone with money to burn looking for a film project despite lack of talent, script, etc...If you enjoy watching a has been in a make work project for himself, then I guess you'll enjoy this, otherwise skip it.Also, the soundtrack is beyond annoying.

I felt it could have kept up its pacing with about 30 minutes cut from it. Would have been much more ""relentless"" and ""enthralling"" as I'm sure others have put it if so. Sandler is good, since he is truly a great actor. He makes scenes which could have felt forced run seamlessly. A huge part of his character has to do with downplaying the intensity of the situation to calm the people around him, and he does a great job. A big part of great acting is forgetting you're watching an actor, and in several moments I did completely. The movie is fun and at times kinetic, but it feels self and wanders. Overall, I had a decent time, but it lacks the structure and depth it painfully attempts to convey, which at times is painfully obvious.",Uncut Gems

Nothing new, by definition already a highly stressful situation. But the stress is increased by the fact that from a personal pov, his ex-wife and daughter treat him with huge contempt, and his relationship with his mistress is also very stormy. So everything in his life is a mess as a consequence of his decisions, and to top it all up the actual dialogue of the movie is constant yelling and swearing. Sadly, everything ends in tears.I think more than giving a grade to the movie, we should strive to describe with facts what the movie is about, and everyone can decide whether they feel like watching that or not.

1319,j_e_hill,"No redeeming characters, an assault on your senses",2,19 May 2020,"This movie seems to be made to cause anxiety. The most redeeming character in the whole thing is a nameless goon that actually shows empathy for ten seconds. The main characters are all idiots and one dimensional. At one point, you're thinking he fully deserves whatever tragic fate is used to wrap up this mess of a movie. Very disappointed as I like comics in serious roles (Will Ferrell in Winter Passing, Robin Williams in a number of great ones, Jim Carrey in Eternal Sunshine, etc) so I was expecting Adam Sandler to be great in this. Instead, he's just shouting the whole time, and does nothing to cause you to root for him.

1324,getintherelewis,"Chaotic and overwhelming, as intended",8,3 December 2020,"I don't know if a movie has ever stressed me out like this one did. And that isn't a knock against it, because it's clearly meant to knock the viewer off their feet. The tone is manic and suffocating and never slows down. Not a single scene was boring, and there's a pervasive tension that never goes away from the very first minute to the last. I understand why this would be too much for some viewers, but I enjoyed it because it matched the personality of the main character. So much happens in the film that it feels like it goes by incredibly fast. It was visually pleasing and the environments fit well with the tone. The shop is small and claustrophobic, and the camera work keeps the main character feeling caged in even when he's in an open environment (like a parking lot). Every character serves a purpose and the dialogue is mostly good. There are some genuinely funny scenes and some that are horrifying (in a good way). My only major complaint is that I didn't find Garnett's character's motivations to be very realistic (though KG pleasantly surprised me with his acting!).",Uncut Gems

1328,benjaminsieur,really masterful,9,12 February 2020,"Uncut gems is a fantastic film by the safdie brothers. The acting to begin with is really masterful. Adam sandler especially is really powerful and embodies the character perfectly. Lakeith stanfield also stands his ground really well and is really proving what he can do with another great role.both the editing and the cinematography are really phenomenal and are crucial in every scene.the writing is really amazing. it's an awesome thriller and the tension of the story as a whole is always felt in every scene, even before the tension even starts, the first scenes keep you on edge through a an unusual use of score but a very effective one at that. The lack of quiet for the first few minutes is nerve racking as you slowly settle into the grimy new york environment with 'Howard' as your guide.i already mentioned the score but it is really one of the strongest points of this film among so much else that is impeccable. the score/soundtrack is so original and not used in the same way as any other film, which i've heard of from the safdie bros with films like good time.to be honest, i had trouble getting into it at first and stopped it halfway before comng back to it and really feeling it much more the second time around. it may be hard to get into and appreciate the actual story beyond all the technical creativity, but the creativity and excellence of this film is just that implicit and unobvious.",Uncut Gems

I'm so C L E V E R",8,27 December 2019,"So went to see Uncut Gems, and to say it was marvelously crafted film, combining dark humor, and crime into this movie. The only problem I have with the film is that you need to be in the right mood if you consider yourself to be an introvert. The film contains multitasking scenes of people yelling, and banging to intensify the drama. I know, it's a strange complaint, but I felt the desire to inform movie watchers that this could literally be described for a movie as an introvert's biggest nightmare. Other than that the film is spectacular. The soundtrack is surprisingly great, and the performance by comedian, Adam Sandler is honestly remarkable. Not to downgrade the other actor's performance, as they were great as well. The writing was entertaining and the ending really did catch me off guard. I'll give this film an 8/10. The film only has one flaw that pushed me away erroneously, and besides that the film is unique. i definitely recommend this film, it's a must watch if you're a fan of Adam Sandler. I'm Austin A.

I watched this movie after watching one of their other ones called ""Good Time"" and figured why not. Glad I waited for Netflix rather then the theatre cause this is not theater worthy IMO. If following characters that get under your skin is you thing, you might like this. Sandler plays a total degenerate, and he played it well. Near the end of the movie you can't help but face palm this dude's choices. All in all, this movie is isn't horrible, but far from great. Sandler does a very good job creating a character that fries your nerves to the point of exhaustion. Safdie bro's have a way of making their dark themed moments stick with you for a while.

We all know his brand of humor and i personally resonate with it a lot. On the other side of the comedic angle of this man is an incredibly emotional dramatic angle that emerges once in awhile from him to blow us away with an honest character portrayal. This film utilizes his acting variety brilliantly and does still have his signature brand of comedy in a more refined nature. At times the story, direction, and overall dialogue style does get a little too contrived but thrives for the most part with some intensity and sly grittiness.

1343,TheCountVictor,One of Adam Sandler's best performances,8,16 December 2019,"I grew up with a lot of Adam Sandler's comedies (Big Daddy being my favorite one) and I always really liked him as a actor. Unfortunately, I had never seen any of his dramas he did so this was my first experience of him being a dramatic actor. And I have to say he knocked it out of the park. His performance truly makes you care for his character, even if he isn't the greatest person in the world. You want to see him get out of this bad situation he is in. He has so much energy and is charismatic as well in the funnier moments.I have seen a film from Josh and Benny Safdie before, that being Good Time, which I didn't really care for, but however they have absolutely improved in terms of directing here. They do a great job establishing a sense of urgency and intensity throughout it's runtime. I also like those shots where we go inside of the gem that bookends the film, I thought it was very fitting. The writing is very good, and had it's fair share of funny and crazy moments.
My only complaints are that the film is a bit slow at the beginning, it takes a little while for the story to actually get going, but it does establish the characters in the story so it's a very minor complaint. I also didn't really care for the ending, it felt to me like it came out of nowhere only because they wanted to be different. To me, it didn't work. But other than that, Uncut Gems is a solid film with a commanding performance from Sandler and lots of intensity.

I've watched this with with headphones and the first 10 minutes or so the score was scratching my ear and I had to skip a few tenths just to see if it ended and it did(well not really but they were considerably shorter than 10 minutes). Everybody is yelling CONSTANTLY, score from the 80s is UNBEARABLE, dialogues is not clear because everyone is yelling over each other and the characters actions just doesn't make sense.

And I can't make up my mind about which is the better film. Sandler in one of the year's best, it's really true.The directors are very exciting young filmmakers. I loved their previous film, Good Time. Their style reminds me of Steven Soderbergh's work on Out of Sight, an underrated 90s comedy crime masterpiece, and Paul Thomas Anderson's early work, as well as the Pusher crime saga from Denmark. You'll get everything from wide, high-angle shots, zoom ins, zoom outs, quick cuts, long tracks, shaking cam. It's energetic film making by two gifted filmmakers.It's that type of film that will hold your attention every second of the way. That's really the biggest compliment I can give the film. The 130 minutes go by quick. By the time the shocking conclusion came, I wanted it to keep going. I didn't want the movie to come to its conclusion. I have seen too many movies this year where I wished I could fast forward.And Adam Sandler is a big part of what makes everything work. He might not be the next DD Lewis, or John Malkovich, but he possesses that special king of charisma. He is such an amazing presence.It's not a perfect film and there are aspects of the movie that I thought didn't quite work. Certain plot mechanisms and stretches of dialogue that didn't quite work with me. But in a movie that has so much going for it, that is forgivable.

The sound track kills the movie for sure. It is loud, intrusive and instead of adding to the intensity, rather irritates the viewer. Add people talking over each other all the time to the anoying soundtrack and you have one big noise. I kept turning the sound down on my home theater system until I had to stop the movie.
It actually gave me a headache.
Sandler was good in the movie, but during the dramatic crying scenes, I just could not believe his sadness or humiliation. It felt like he was little Nicky as an adult.

1361,calebthorley,Sandler At His Best,8,5 June 2021,"Wow. What a thrill ride. Uncut Gems was an unusual film; it is made up of mostly strong components, with very little to let down this adrenaline-pumping thriller.Let's start with Sandler's performance: this is a career high for the man. He somehow retains his charm whilst portraying a scumbag, and this is what makes his performance so enjoyable to see on screen. Supporting actors also do a fine job, delivering performances ranging from serviceable to downright menacing. Furthermore, cinematography is what you might expect from the Saftie brothers, as it's erratic and very intense, and gives a unique feel to their work. It's stylish.However the film is very fast, with a lot going on at once. This leads to some characters being shrouded, however if you pay enough attention then you will get what's going on. Yet, with all the chaos, it can some times become a muddled mess.The films chaos is offset by a frankly awful soundtrack that doesn't fit. It is wrong, stop.Overall, this film is worth your time. If you can dedicate focus to the film, and can put up with frankly awful soundtrack choices, then you may well love this film.",Uncut Gems

There are movies which tackle dark subjects but the good ones spend time on developing characters to offer insights into how they came to be. But this movie didn't do that.

I actually like the guy, done just really enjoyable movies, but to me it seems every one of those is followed by a completely non-sense movie, like completely. Sandler here is a jewlry retailer, apparently he found his once in a lifetime diamond, and of course he plays dirty. Here comes the stress: It seems to be the good tone in this society that everybody screams at everybody, in every single scene. No joke. The main people of a scene not only scream at each other, they also scream at other people, they scream back, background prople scream at background people. Also, Sandler tries to make money with everything he gets. He borrows the diamond to Kevin Garnett of all people gets his ring gives it to the pawnbroker, bets with that money, gets beat down and cancelled, can't give back the ring so he borrows something else, tries to make money with that and digs the whole deeper. Stressful and hard to follow, just like that last sentence. Not a whole lot of story or relevant plot here. Also: Julia. She looks different in every scene, you can't recognize her. I was so confused. After that stupid closet scene, all of a sudden there's a club scene with The Weekend, camera zooms into a woman I should care about, she snorts coke with The Weekend on the toilet, Sandler freaks out, I don't care cause I don't know who that woman is until way later. You got some entertainmenr value from the basketball, KG and this whole criminal world but that's about it. It's telling that this is a Netflix original and they try to hype it that much. Not awful but definitely not a movie I would wanna watch if I knew what I know know about it.",Uncut Gems

He is a chaos addicted erratic unlikeable idiot. The rest of the cast is not much of a difference, basically every character is displayed as mean and angry.

If you like sports betting and luxury goods/wristwatches? This movie is for you. As someone who has some experience with betting and loves watches, I loved the references and appearances in the movie. I can't really come up with any (major) faults to the movie.

There's a scene where a door buzzer must sound a minimum of 40 times in five minutes. It made me want to put my foot through my tele.In another scene, having just hiked up the bids in an auction, (which is surely illegal) he starts shouting ""sorry"" to his accomplice in the lobby of the auctioneers. Really?

1383,christiananderson24,"Well-Acted, Intense, & Obnoxious",7,26 December 2019,"Uncut Gems is a well-acted, intense, and obnoxious movie. The main character Howard Ratner is a shady gambling addict who neglects his family and gets himself into all sorts of trouble with loan sharks. I had hoped he would be a more likable character, but I ultimately found myself only wanting him to succeed simply so that he wouldn't get killed by the loan sharks.There really isn't a redeemable male character in the whole movie with the exception of perhaps the wealthy but harmless man in the hotel suite who obliviously helps Howard's mistress, Julia. Howard's wife Dinah has every right to hate her disloyal husband, and Julia is surprisingly the most likable character in the film.The stakes are high and the director really drives that fact home with what feels like non-stop yelling through out the over two-hour run-time. Characters are constantly shouting at each other and it became quite annoying. I understand that it may be realistic, but there are plenty of movies with high-stakes and a lot less screaming.Something I will give the movie credit for is it does seem to be a true cautionary tale. Unlike other movies that glorify illegal activity, Uncut Gems makes the darkest aspects of sports gambling look very unappealing.

Adam Sandler smile mumbles every single line of dialogue and tries his hand at an oscar ugly cry that felt as genuine as a toddler throwing a tantrum. Every character in this is an unlikable sleaze, half the characters in this movie should have gotten twice the beatdowns that Adam does and the finale is like watching a game at a bar with a bunch of overenthusiastic, obnoxious clowns. The storyline is just a bunch of random BS to drag out the run time and not a single decision makes any sense whatsoever to anyone with a semblance of sanity. Random characters show up out of nowhere for no other purpose than to show how bad Sandler is and then are immediately dismissed.

The hype got me in the door and now I'm bewildered to see it referred to as ""brilliant"" or ""suspenseful.""What we have here is Sandler playing a totally unlikable character in a movie full of unlikable characters, and because he is such a sleazeball, he deserves whatever misfortune that comes his way. Because the guy has no redeemable qualities, the audience is basically waiting for his bad luck to catch up to him and for him to ""get his."" I don't know where all the tension and suspense is supposed to come from when the guy continually makes bad decisions that are all begging for a bad outcome.And Sandler's character is so closely related to the kind of dirtbags that he's played in the past that I don't see what's so special about his acting job here. In fact, the character itself is so one-dimensional and bordering on cartoony that it feels as if Sandler isn't acting at all. Sleaze comes naturally for him here, but there's absolutely nothing else to latch onto.The only time a real development happens is towards the end, after spending an hour and a half with this clown playing with other people's money.

Everything from the directing, to the soundtrack, to the writing and cinematography. And Christ, the acting. Adam Sandler gives quite possibly the best performance of his career as a charismatic yet overly ambitious jeweler, who never quite knows when to keep his wallet closed. The film is surprisingly very funny, which is only surprising based off of the advertisements and the films' overall sell as an ""Sandman Drama"". The humour works so well, it feels absolutely effortless. Audiences (including myself) have seem to forgotten how funny Sandler can be, this film proves that he still has it. It's just been hiding. The film is tense, hilarious, intimate, and very, very slick. Bound to be a modern classic. See this in a theater if you can, there hasn't been anything quite like it in a long time.",Uncut Gems

Then the entirety of the film is just about solving one problem and creating 99 new ones. The ONLY impressive thing i could name was the acting. Everyone is frantically yelling at all times so that must've been tiring.

He treats his family, his employees, and customers like dirt and and takes advantage of all of them. He is unlikable to a fault. This film was difficult for me to watch because Sandler gets the unscrupulous behavior of a gambling addict perfectly. He screws everyone in his life and is hated by everyone of them. In addition to the bad luck of a gambler, everything that could go wrong does. And this made the film for me, uncomfortable and anxiety provoking. About half way through the film I was about to give up, and took a break, but found myself curious to find out what happened next, and *Spoiler* the end made it all worth the trouble. I liked seeing the Celtics win as I am from Boston. If you can get through seeing Adam Sandlers character life spin out of control, and ignore his unlikable personality, its well worth it.

1470,Goldman_67754,"A Brilliantly Made, Compulsive, Difficult Watch",10,18 May 2020,"This was an absolutely terrific film. I can't compliment enough the writing, direction and acting, and it doesn't give the impression of having been put together on a huge budget. However, even though I watched it compulsively, I don't think I actually enjoyed it at all! And that itself is a testament to how good it is.The story is like a giant pincer of events, constantly threatening to overtake the main character, jeweller Howard Ratner and his attempts to stay ahead of them. The movie is extremely claustrophic, and the tension ramps up and up towards the end. It's an extremely uncomfortable watch and makes you squirm in your seat.The main driver of the story is the main character, Howard. His main attribute seems to be his ability to absolutely mess up, thoroughly, every single situation he's in. Even when he's doing well, he ends up pushing his luck just that bit too far and then losing - one misstep after another. He is a pretty unlikeable guy; when given the chance, he is weasely towards anyone that might be able to do him harm, yet does not shrink from treating else with utter contempt when he can. But you end up sympathising with him. The entire movie follows him as he is repeatedly insulted and slapped around by absolutely everyone, and as everything repeatedly explodes in his face. When he finally breaks down some way into the film, you actually feel bad for him. It's brilliant writing to make you feel bad for such a reprehensible individual.I will acknowledge that I would, ordinarily, avoid any film with Adam Sandler in, because he's in it. I really hope he's able to do more films like this. He's brilliant.The tension ramps up and does keep you guessing as it builds to the finale. You feel cynicism that it's going to go the same way as everything else that has gone before, but you may be surprised at the twists it takes. Overall, very highly recommended.",Uncut Gems

1472,colinstmichael,Not worth your time. Seriously.,1,7 June 2020,"I'm surprised so many people liked it. It was the same thing over and over again, most of Sandler's dialogue was him yelling ""Arno"", most of the dialogue overall was jumbled shouting, Kevin Garnett's acting consisted entirely of him being mad then confused, and just when you start to think the movie might not end exactly the way you expect because they have something more interesting planned, it ends exactly the way you would expect after all of the events up to that point make it very clear that it's going to happen. It was 45 minutes too long, and packed full of tension without suspense. Between the epic feel of the opening sequence and opening credits, I was left hoping for some incredible curve ball; instead, it was over two hours of people being mad. The main character's wife is right in her assessment of how annoying he is. That's all he was throughout the entirety of the film, and it was a relief when it ended.

As I got to the halfway point I felt my heart racing, my teeth grinding and I found myself pacing around.This film performs at 100 mph for the entire duration. It's not 2 hours of action, it's just 2 hours of mindless bickering and talking over each other. From the first 5 minutes I just wanted it to be over. It took me over an hour to wind down and fall asleep after it was over.

It was a very fast moving plot with different characters shouting at each other in just about every scene which initially was a turn-off, but once I got used to it, you start to see what a real loathsome character that Sandler plays. He even took his entire family to the apartment where his mistress recently moved out of. He was just so self-absorbed that he was scarcely aware of anything outside of his immediate bubble and jumped from emotional drama to emotional drama. Sandler was just excellent in this film.What most impressed me about the film (outside of the acting) was that the characters were consistent. Everything that they did was within what you would imagine that they could do. There wasn't any epiphany moments where suddenly someone decides to do something so far outside of their typical behaviour that it ruins the plot.Highly recommended.",Uncut Gems

I want to say I actually like Adam Sandler..well his early movies. They made me chuckle.
This movie was frantic, disorganized, and sloppy at times.
I thought Sandler's performance wasn't bad, Kevin Garnett was pretty good and Idina Manuel's performance was wasted on very limited screen time.
The absolute worst part of the movie was the score. The loud weird techno trance music was distracting and took away from the whole movie , especially the critical intense scenes.
The movie tries too hard to show off Sandler's acting skills. It could've toned things down a bit.
I gave it a 5 because their were decent things but also some bad things.
The ending was good but couldn't save the rest of the film.",Uncut Gems

1562,BenHarley1138,Seen at TIFF 2019,8,10 September 2019,"Ever since watching the Safdie brother's previous feature, Good Time, I was eagerly awaiting their next feature. Good Time showed that they are masters of tension and momentum, with their impressive culmination of unique characters, editing, dialogue and of course musical scores, and Uncut Gems further cements that they are not only masters of tension, but they are truly two of the most exciting rising filmmakers right now.I usually know how to structure a review, but Uncut Gems is so unconventional in nearly every regard, and frankly I'm not quite sure where to start. It doesn't let up, ever. Pretty much from the first minute to the end you are shot into a relentless world of chaos among various reoccurring characters, all gravitating around Adam Sandler's ""Howie"". That leads me to Adam Sandler's performance and character. I LOVED it. Oh boy, is he good. He's not only fantastic at delivering dialogue for extremely long and exhausting takes, but just seeing his characters psyche continuously digging himself deeper is electric.I'll leave off with saying Uncut Gems is one of the most exhilarating and unique films that I've seen this year. Adam Sandler (and the entire cast) kill it, the musical score is loud and exciting, it looks beautiful, and it has an energy that I haven't seen in any other film this year.I really can't wait to see what the Safdie's come up with next.",Uncut Gems

1575,danielvaledj,"L'Amour Toujours, Howard",9,3 February 2020,"After sitting through 2 hours of what can only be described as a gritty, anxiety filled, adrenaline ridden performance from Sandler, I have finally calmed down enough to concur what has already been written about Uncut Gems.This film is not for everybody. My partner had lost interest in Sandler's portrayal of Howard by the hour mark. She hated him. She loved the supporting cast and not Howard. She hated the dialog and the constant persistence of f'bombs and everyone shouting over each other like a primary school lunch.Much like The Wolf of Wall Street, you're rooting for an anti-hero as Belfort pillages his way through debauchery, money and fraud to the point where you just think ""you got it coming"".With Uncut Gems, you're glued to your screen watching Howard crash his way from one bad decision to another. Every choice he makes is a bad one; but the difference is the pay off has so much more meaning than Wolf of Wall Street.And that's the point of Uncut Gems; it drip feeds you this poison where you're constantly asking for a vaccine, and you're asking yourself if you will ever be cured.Sandler without doubt deserves the praise for this film, but the supporting cast equally deserve a mention.As mentioned before, this film is not for everyone, but if you want to delve into the madness of Howard's quest, then you'll certainly need a rewarding shower afterwards.",Uncut Gems

People who have never ventured outside of conventional cinema, and C. Karens.
This movie reminded me of ""Irreversible"". A chaotic mess of life ending in horrible tragedy. I too didn't think much of it when I first put it on as background noise while I was working but I was quickly sucked in. Sandler should definitely get an Oscar nod. People just don't get it.",Uncut Gems

The story builds well as we follow his character spiral from one crazy parlay to the next.

1579,Abraxan,What a waste of time,1,26 December 2019,"My husband (who gives this movie a 3 out of ten) and I saw this movie with our daughter, son-in-law and their friends. I was entranced by the beginning and end where we ""flew"" through the opal. That's what earned the 1. It would've earned a 10 if the rest of the film wasn't such a waste of our time.I mentioned my daughter, her husband and friends because it wasn't very long into the film before I decided this movie must be aimed at their age group, not ours. The dialog was too fast, usually with people speaking over each other. The story seemed nearly pointless, with Howard (Adam Sandler) making more and more stupid decisions. There were few if any redeeming characteristics in Howard or most of the other characters in the film. Interestingly enough, our daughter, son-in-law and friends all wished there was a way to give a film NEGATIVE numbers in a review!Adam Sandler gave a wonderful performance as this loser who spirals into more and more trouble. The rest of the cast is good. Idina Menzel's jewelry was gorgeous! But the film itself . . . yuck. And they left a lot of the threads of the movie unresolved.We normally don't pay a lot of attention to critics reviews, just to the audience's reviews, but this time, for Uncut Gems, the audience tested must have all been from New York since they liked it. We should've asked for our money back.",Uncut Gems
1580,Seni_uvu,My Favorite Film of 2019!,10,7 May 2020,"The Safdie brothers flick Uncut Gems (2019) is a Masterpiece of Cinema. To its Core it is a Character Study on the Greedy and deceptive. Thus, the plot doesn't necessarily have to be tightly written however I would not say that this film has a boring plot rather a thrilling and exciting ride of a plot. By the end of the film the audience will very much be on the edge on their seats waiting in anticipation of whats to come simultaneously anxious about the film.And this Film has one of the best most satisfying Ending's to cinema in recent years.I refuse to let go of this review without mentioning Adam Sandler's performance. MY GOSH he has executed his character so brilliantly due to his understanding of the character. There are scenes where he is scared and you really do feel his pain. I personally felt anxious when I saw his character make bad decisions but that what Adam is trying to express.Overall I really would like to dwell more into this film and understand the meaning of some scenes and perceived allegory of the film (which I think is that Bad people deserve a bad fate) but meh.10/10 - I wished this was recognized more by the mainstream",Uncut Gems

Adam Sandler did a gooood job in this movie, his character was living in a dangerous world - well technically he's responsible for making it dangerous - and i really hated him for his choices and actions but i can also imagine that there really exists people like him, buried on debt after debt trying his best to gamble his way out of it and fail over and over.

If you don't appreciate nuance and subtlety and want an experience akin to a sensory overload, then this one's for you. I personally prefer filmmakers that apply due care and due diligence and handle their films with grace, not bombard them with as many things as they can to overwhelm the viewer's senses. It's an utterly claustrophobic, cacophonous, and over-the-top mess that doesn't allow the viewer ample breathing room until the second half of the film, where it actually does slow down and develops into something much more focused and coherent, but not coherent enough to justify the adulterated chaos that preceded it. The sheer amount of times the n-word is unnecessarily used in this film is enough reasonable cause for any non-African American to get uncomfortable and walk out of the theater. And even though the dialogue may be deemed authentic to some viewers, it still promotes ignorant stereotypes and renders the characters frustratingly one-dimensional and flat-out uninteresting.",Uncut Gems

Yeah I get it, that's the directors intention. But it was just too much. I just wanted to walk out of the theatre. Lousy arguments were all over the place with very unnecessary, irrelevant scenes that makes me think like why would they even put this in the movie. If you want to put little clues in it, use it wisely! Do not let go wasted. Also, the tempo of the movie was so lost, they didn't know when to stop or keep it going.

I don't like Sandler's films anyway but I thought I'd give this a chance. It was absolute rubbish, frankly.
Every scene was loud, chaotic, hard to watch and with jerky camera work and a constant score that feels like a mosquito buzzing incessantly at full volume in your ears. Many of the scenes served no apparent plot purpose. I think all this was intentional by the directors to cause a 'chaos' effect for the viewer.

Dinah gets it right when she says, ""I think you're the most annoying person I've ever met in my life.""

1608,featherspear,A Man and His Rocks,8,30 December 2019,"This is a comedy thriller in which almost every annoying film trope on the list - from the Lovable Sociopath character to the trash-talking dodgy minorities to the shrill woman who's actually got a point to the constant shaky close-ups - is used to maximum effect. They even wheel out the family, holiday and sports movie cliches for a skewing at one point. But as natural progressions in the story, these scenes are as satisfying as any in the best of those movies.Sandler's Howie is a selfish man with a serious problem that effects everyone in his manic orbit, most of whom are locked into it by personal or financial relationships. For me, it worked all the way through, with the exception of one character that really just needs to be there for the story to progress. There's a great darkly funny exchange, after it's established that his personal life is an escalating disaster, where a pawn broker shows genuine concern for Howie's health. It should be a touching moment, but just underneath is the fact that this is one of the few people that will always benefit from Howie's high-risk scams.All the performances are believable. There are cameos that I didn't know about, but I didn't know the people anyway, so I can at least say I enjoyed them for what they were in the story. Keith William Richards stands out as another trope-tackling element and both the leading ladies - Fox and Menzel - do well with thankless and/or confusing roles.I like this type of low-action thriller.

The camera constantly shakes and violently turns. The characters shout at each other (and swear a lot) so when the movie slows down you really appreciate it because there are really few calm scenes.Since the movie starts it makes pretty clear that Howard's lifestyle isn't healthy. He's a compulsive gambler buried in debt and a cheater who has close to none redeeming qualities (which I like about the character). The way Sandler portrays him as this dirty obscene man is superb and one of the best portrayals I saw last year (he should have made it to the Academy Awards)I'm also in love with this movies view on risk and victory even if I don't share . The quote: ""This is how I win"" has stuck with me. It felt really powerful.I also strongly agree with the way they decided to end the story, with Howard's death as I thought that having him survive would have undermined the feeling of danger they had developed during the movie.

Is it because his regular trendy movies are being box office bombs lately? I don't know, you guys need to tell me. It looked like he is taking the path of Once Legendary - Nicolas Cage, John Travolta, Ethan Hawk and Edward Norton. Looks more like a commotion and ruckus, rather than a compelling story telling. My wife gave it up half way of the movie but I still felt Sandler's character would pull off a huge gamble at the very end- he did but only to get shot and be dead !

1640,kylestephans-32311,One of the best movies of 2019,10,12 May 2020,"I have suffered only a few panic attacks in my time. Without going into medical and psychological jargon, I can tell you that it feels as if all the stress of the world is focused on you along with increase in heart rate; basically it feels as if you are going crazy with worry, while having a heart attack. Without mimicking the feelings and in all the most entertaining ways Uncut Gems is a two hour panic attack. However, do not in any way allow this to deter you from seeing this phenomenal flick. I was on the edge of my seat and in a constant state of suspense throughout the entire runtime. The movie hits you like a bolt of adrenaline.
The basic story of the movie revolves around Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a diamond district jeweler in 2012, New York. Ratner is in a very stress film environment that could pop at any moment. He owes $100,000 to load shark Arno (Eric Bogosian) who is growing impatient and sending hired muscle to rough Ratner up in order to ""encourage"" him to pay his debt. His long suffering wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) wants a divorce, his mistress Julia (Julia Fox) is requiring a more lavish lifestyle that Ratner can afford, and he is alienating nearly everyone around him with his scheming ways and crippling gambling addiction.
Everything seems lost until Ratner receives an extremely rare opal (an Uncut Gem) from Ethiopia, that took him over and a year and a half to obtain. He is planning on selling to at an auction that all but guarantees him to net at least one million dollars. But things get interesting when he lends his favorite NBA player, Kevin Garnett (playing himself) the opal when the player becomes enamored with it and promises to return it the following day. Soon Ratner's life becomes a constant spiral of peril when Garnett fails to return the opal, and Ratner cannot get ahold of him, along with Arno getting more ""physical"" with Ratner to pay him his money along with his gambling debts that are getting so bad that his bookie is pretty much begging with him to take a break.
The biggest surprise about the film is just how good Adam Sandler is as Howard Ratner. I never thought I would be praising Sandler's performance based on his track record of films. I mean, he is usually synonymous with crude, juvenile, and lame humor, atrocious movies, and obnoxious, annoying characters. This role allows him to become the selfish and irresponsible jeweler. His infectious grin, used car salesman demeanor, and charisma make him seem as if he was born for his profession. It is to the credit of Sandler that he makes the character likable and sympathetic. As impulsive and crazy as Howard may be, I could not help but root for him and wanting him to come away unscathed even though he keeps digging himself a bigger hole. He loves to gamble, because he desires the suspense. He's the type of person who could win one billion dollars and blow his entire earning in bets by the end of the weekend. It's a crime that Sandler failed to receive an Oscar nomination.
The other performances are all very good also Idina Menzel does have a little bit of the thankless role of playing Howard's put upon wife. Although, at first she seems to always be complaining and putting her husband down, but when think about what she most likely put up with for 15 years it seems like she is letting him off easy. Kevin Garnett does decent job at playing a hopefully exaggerated version of himself and is not afraid of making his character idiotic and unlikable. Judd Hirsch briefly appears in the movie as Howard father-in-law and does an admirable job. Julia Fox is a newcomer but tackles her role like a seasoned pro as Howard's much younger, but loyal and loving girlfriend. Also Eric Bogosian still working which is great to know and illustrates why he needs to do more films period.
This is the second film I have seen from the Safdie Brothers who blew me away with the similar character study with Good Time in 2017, demonstrating that Robert Pattinson can act when given great material. Uncut Gems never lets up for the entire runtime, whether you are seeing Howard getting chased by loan sharks at his daughter's school play, pawning valued sports memorabilia to get quick cash to place his bets, or asking his father-in-law Gooey (Judd Hirsch) to help drive up a price at an auction neither have the money for in order for him to net more of a profit for the opal Howard is auctioning. The film is 2 hours and 15 minutes and I enjoyed every second of it. It is a shame that the movie did not get a best picture nomination at the Academy Awards, because it was the most deserving film that year. This is one film you do not want to miss and is the best movie of 2019.Final Grade: A+",Uncut Gems

The movie has the stylistic favor of a 2010's synth soundtrack and multidimensional shots of gemstones, the cosmos, and a colonoscopy. Howard Ratner's middle aged life is turned upside down by high risk behavior, his facade as a family and businessman crumbles due to a gambling addiction and a mistress, his high stakes betting intersects gangsters and high profile entertainment figures. One of Adam Sandler's best roles of all time, with an excellent supporting cast including the beautiful Julia Fox, Eric Bogosian, and newcomer Keith Williams Richards.

They always been a bunch off annoying stuff. But when I saw the high ratings on this I got curious and was interested in watching. I think the main reason Mr Sandler was picked for the lead role of this flick is because the lead role character in the movie is supposed to be annoying, lame (which he is good at portraying), desperate, and non stop nonsense who just can't stay away from trouble no matter what.And the direction, editing, background score, dialogue totally suck. Constant yelling/screaming. one personnel is yelling at you constantly and you are talking about something else to to someone else. Sometimes you can't even figure out who is saying what! And what's with the constant use of the F word? I really didn't Manley any sense. The F word was in Mr Sandler's every dialogue almost, when it did fit into the line/ dialogue. I really don't have a problem with the F word being used in movies but in this movie it was as you trying use it with out a reason. Seen classics like The Departed where the F word was used a record breaking number of times but it wasn't annoying because it went with the flow of the dialogue and fitted the situation/sequence/ scene of the movie.

As a person, he seems nice though but his humour is just not funny to me, only annoying.So again, in a serious role, really?No. No no no. It's not a serious role. It's not a thriller. There's just non-stop Adam Sandler, and he is just as annoying, loud and over-the-top goofy as he usually is, but then again - he probably is co-producing at the very least so I guess he could just steal 96,8% of all the screen time since he paid for it, right?Twice I tried watching this, this, I don't honestly know what it is, and I failed miserably. Suddenly just reached out and shut it off, couldn't take any more of it.
Oh, I know what it is now!ITS A REGULAR ADAM SANDLER MOVIE!So, if you like it, want to like it, your partner maybe likes it, or if you just need to get really angry OR waste important life-time ticking, then by all means, go ahead. But if you are one of the above, or maybe you actually think Adam Sandler is a funny guy - that means you're a fanboy / fangirl - yeah then go ahead. I was going to give it two stars, but I add one for Julia Fox, poor woman who had to endure shooting this crap, as she is a very fine woman and has hereby done a great debut, although in completely the wrong movie IMO. Thats all!",Uncut Gems

1691,PurleyAwesome,Utterly chaotic and hard to watch,1,20 March 2020,"I can see where they where going with this and they absolutely nailed it. The movie is frantic, chaotic and a total trip but it's also unwatchable because of it. Every shot is handheld making you dizzy as the camera quickly pans between the different people talking. The industry standard of ~25 FPS makes every pan hurt your eyes. With the amount of clutter on screen your eyes have no where to focus during the very brief moments where the camera points at someone. In addition to the visual clutter and chaos comes the audio. Pretty much everyone is screaming during the entire movie and they have to because there are at least two other conversations happening in the background. Everyone is talking over another while the spacey trippy soundtrack is constantly playing in the background giving you a hard time to even understand what is being said. It's utter chaos. After about 15 minutes my eyes hurt and I had a massive headache.The story isn't anything special. The protagonist is written in a way that makes it very difficult to identify with him. Which would be fine if the story was interesting enough but it isn't. They tried to garner some sort of empathy for the protagonist but at least for me they couldn't achieve that. The ending twist isn't really one as the story only had two likely endings.All in all the audio and visuals make the movie unwatchable and if you where to read the story or tell it in a more calm and organised fashion it would be slow and predictable.If they wanted to make a movie that is pure and utter chaos they achieved their goal 10/10.
But if they wanted to make a movie you can watch they failed miserably 1/10.",Uncut Gems

I don't think it either deserves a 9 neither a 3 -well maybe if you get a headache from so much screaming-, but if you put yourself in the director shoes, it seems harder to send the message of how messed up his life is and how crazy he is if it wasn't for so much noise in the whole movie.It honestly also isn't an Oscar worthy performance from Sandler, he did good, even great, but not outstanding.

Much is made of Adam's so called laziness with his other films, the same was said about Matthew. Each Happy Maddison production reaches a market of people wanting escapism from every day stresses. This would make Adam the smartest guy in the room, by meeting market demand and taking on the occasional dramatic role like Uncut Gems to keep him industry relevant.

Some people enjoy the fear and adrenalin, some hate it. The script and acting by Sandler are insanely good. I could not eat during the movie because it made me feel constantly full on excess thrill. I'm so glad I gave it a chance based on the score out of 10 rather than reading the reviews. It's so easy to miss the out-of-this-world good movies because sadly negative reviews tend to be trusted in this generation addicted to stress - which is ironic!Go see it, you will NOT regret it.

Chaos is easy to create but hard to control - and I think that is what this movie is about. Controlled chaos - and Adam Sandler is right in the middle of it.His soon to be ex-wife says in one scene ""You are the most annoying person I have ever met"" and I echo her sentiments. He moves from one disaster to the other thinking that he could salvage the situation but is just digging himself a bigger grave every time.And I think this is where the beauty of the movie lies. Josh and Bennie Safdie directed this fast-paced thriller that keeps you on the edge as much as it annoys you. The background score goes on incessantly at places when you want some quiet and you question Sandler's choices every other second of the movie.Sandler is known for his comedy and when someone shines in something that they are not known for, it is even ore special. I don't know if Sandler will win any of the big awards but he will definitely not be considered just a comedian. I liked the role of his girlfriend too, played by the charming Julia Fox who genuinely seems to be in love with him (why I can't understand). The supporting cast is great too.But I am truly torn - when I finished the movie, I was sure I hated it.

I had very high expectations for this picture, I'm a fan of Adam Sandler and I really enjoy a lot of his films, my favourite probably being Anger Management. And the write up suggested a polished crime caper - perhaps a cross between Oceans 11 and The Italian Job I thought. But I couldn't have been more wrong. From it's blurry, noisy outset to its woefully underwhelming conclusion Uncut Gems is a total mess of a film.
Nothing works in this movie. In just about every scene there are several people all talking over each other. It's so disjointed that it's virtually impossible to keep hold of an extremely poorly implemented plot. There are no likeable characters, no backstory to any of the lead roles' journeys and no chemistry between anybody.
It's like the creators just sent the cast into a series of rooms filled with hidden cameras, told them to talk among themselves for a bit, but then instead of directing them, they just left them there and went right to lunch.
And riding on top of all of that is an almost continous music score which sounds like the backing track to an ultra-low budget sci-fi movie from the 80s. It's absolutely awful, quite possibly in fact the worst choice of soundtrack I've heard from a film. It doesn't gel at all with what's happening on screen and because most of the time the characters are just shouting gibberish over each other, makes for an extremely unenjoyable experience.
If like me this film has left you stressed and confused, put on Anger Management featuring the legendary Jack Nicholson, he'll provide you with all the therapy you need, and before you know it the scars from those uncut gems will be returned to the murky underground world in which they belong.",Uncut Gems
1799,Lingo56,A Rollercoaster of Emotions,8,1 February 2020,"This is one of the most stressful films I've ever seen.If I could compare it to anything Scorsese's filmography is a good bet. Sandler's ""Howard Ratner"" isn't far off Di Niro's ""Travis Bickle."" The excess shown through the movie is close to a Wolf of Wall Street. The intensity of the film even surpasses Goodfellas.It's a visceral character study of a quality we don't see very often. Howard Ratner is no less well executed as a character than many of the other greats like ""Daniel Plainview"" or ""Joe Buck."" Sandler nails it out of the park. This part was made for him and the entire fabric of the movie comes together on his acting alone.The film's score was also fantastic. Drowning out people's voices, creating dissonance and relief from the actions on screen. It's both a wordless narrator and mood piece to the whole movie.This is a must see if you've got a strong heart.

I fail to see anything of value in any of these critiques. If anything it proves that the director got exactly the response he wanted. It was tiring and loud and stressful and even now after watching it my blood pressure is high and my neck is taught with nerves, but that's literally the point. Not every film has to center on a conventionally attractive hero progressing towards his goal after a setback and consequently fixing whatever romantic issues they had. One of the moments that made me love this film even more was Howey's attempt to reconcile with his wife at Passover. For just a moment, they roped me into believing that this could be the classic Sandler movie turning point, where he grows as a person in some way and his significant other takes him back. He didn't get this chance here and I love the director for that. Instead of the generic turn around story, we got to see a natural end to his destructive tendencies. It may not be the feel good experience you went to the movies for, but that doesn't make it bad. I think watching at home is a good choice though. I had to take a break in the middle of the film, and that likely made all the difference in my ability to enjoy it.",Uncut Gems

The opening sequence produces one of the weirdest film scores ever produced. The odd sounds rattle through your eardrums like a five year old who has just discovered a keyboard/synthesiser for the first time and is playing the keys in an awkward annoying way, hardly making out a tune, gaping through a set of images that resemble a 70s episode of Star Trek with some psychedelic hallucinations.Onto the plot. I gather you aren't meant to like Adam Sandler's character but by the end you end up liking him and changing your view on the heart of a degenerate gambler. The majority of the film is boring as you struggle to get through the monoluge or even believe in any of the characters. Some of the acting is appalling. Adam Sandler shouts throughout the entire film reminding me only of the annoying parrot from Aladdin, as he continuously curses his way through the plot and dialogue.

The music is stressful, Howard's life is stressful. This guy has his fingers in so many different pots, he can't keep it all straight. The editing reflects that.This is also conflict central.

The fact that the characters talk over each other makes the viewer feel stressed, annoyed, and irrational. This gives insight to Howard Ratners impulsive and often times stupid decisions.

The movie is not bad, but it's just so meh. Audio-wise, it's always clocked at 10. The characters are always screaming and yelling. I'm telling you, 70% of the movie is just obnoxious yelling. The score is all very loud Forgettable songs. Many of times you can barely understand what the characters are saying in times of dialogue. And yes, Sandler is good and it's a different role than he normally performs but it's not best actor worthy. The story is somewhat forgettable which saddens me because I was expecting so much more.

The movie progressed with no real back story or any character build whatsoever. The only emotion I had was I disliked every character in the movie.The wasn't a storyline and the main characters came and went with no rhyme or reason why. The movie was set about 10 years ago I'm guessing based on the nba games and athletes shown. Kevin Garnett clearly is not an actor, yet had a supporting role.Bottom line, the movie was all over the place with no real direction.

I like watching films that elicit some sort of emotion and a lot of the negative reviews talk about how this is a mess and chaotic. I see that as the point of the movie. To show what a mess the main characters life is. Yes there is a lot of yelling but that added to the stress and I barely moved for the whole show waiting to see what he would screw up next. I watched it on Netflix late at night so I maybe had a different experience than someone at a cinema/film festival in a loud room. I imagine it could be annoying if the volume was up and you couldn't control it but that wasn't an issue for me.
I have to say I was captivated by the intensity and stress of the constant juggling by Adam Sandler's character and I barely moved for the whole show but I do have patience. I guess it's not for everyone and I think 'blockbuster' people won't like it but it clearly pushes people's buttons and is not a superhero flick so how is that a bad thing when so many movies are just trying to be the biggest explosive CGI hit of the season?
I enjoyed the film it for it's difference and I think watching it in your own lounge room might be the best way to deal with it. Ps.

Never the less the music score was horrible. Reminded me a lot of Pacinos Scarface. Very dated electric music which was overly loud and course.

1847,intothetunnel,Lets talk about the ending,6,8 January 2020,"I watched the entire movie... unlike some people making reviews... don't review a film unless u actually watch the whole damn thing ok?
It was not terrible and it doesn't deserve on star reviews. Look into the accounts that give this movie a 1 star and they all seem to have bad taste in movies.
Yes the music is a bit loud but it didn't bother me that bad.. although i watched it in my own house... not a theater.
The story and characters are entertaining... the pointlessness of the film is a subtle joke.. the mundane lives people live... how much money a stupid basketball game is worth... Sandler's characters puts his life on the line for the ending game.
What the movie says without telling is how hopeless and pointless our lives can become.. or is.
I enjoyed the scenes with the basketball player and sandler.. their interactions were funny. The other people in the main characters life where dull and uninteresting.... his love life had a chance to become something other than a shank but it never really happened.
Now for the ending... I think it could've been so much better... I would've liked to see sandlers character escape from that situation... he could've gone on a ledge outside of his window and trapped those guys in there for good.
But a random act of utter stupidity compels sandlers character to open the door to a group of men who held a gun to his head earlier and also almost through him off a skyscraper. you know... like sandler couldve armed himself with a gun to protect himself from his enemies..... but instead we get an ending where hes shot to death and gets no money.... this is a reason why i wouldn't see this again too soon... because i can imagine what happens after sandlers death and it doesn't keep me interested. I think a good story keeps people thinking about it for weeks.
That's not to say this movie didn't have strong points. I would've been really invested if sandler left town with the money and the girl and see what unfolds.
i give movies a 6 when i just cant imagine seeing it again to soon... but i still feel like it was worth watching. its style and morid hurmor was fresh..",Uncut Gems

Sure, it's not a 'girlfriend suitable' movie, but at least it doesn't romance everything like every other hollywood movie we see these days. As to the yelling: have you ever heard a guy from NY talking? Exactly spot on, and if you accept this, you might have a good laugh about because americans and specialy big city americans are always all over the place when they're talking, it's genius character creation.

Also what other movie could have ""people watching sports"" be the most exhilarating part of the story?I also loved that the score (Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never) is used super strategically to build discomfort, especially when it swells to drown out the dialogue.Looking forward to watching this again when it gets a wide release in December.",Uncut Gems

Adam Sandler was very good in this movie; I have never seen him perform better than he did in this movie.The plot was very intriguing. Howard had no clear objective (There was a broad goal for Howard which was to get money, but no specific conflict) until around halfway through the movie it seemed like but I did not feel like that was a problem. It allowed me to take in everything that was happening in the movie and not focus on how Howard would achieve his goal.I became very invested in Howard's success and character early in the movie. I really wanted him to succeed, so when we found out that Otto cancelled the bet at the beginning of the movie, I felt bad for Howard. I was anxious throughout a good portion of the movie. The chaotic nature of the movie and the unsettlingly loud voices of the characters immersed me in the movie. It made parts of the movie great but I thought it was too much at times. There was a segment in the middle of the film where I lost a little bit of interest because of this. I felt like it was obnoxious at points.The score for the movie was amazing. The music did a wonderful job of setting the tone for each scene and creating a very engaging movie. The cinematography was also really good. The close ups of characters guided the audience to imagine what each character was thinking at the time.The best scene of the movie was also the most shocking and disturbing. The very last scene of the movie was an incredibly bold choice by the Safdie brothers. Howard's death was so unexpected and brutal. My jaw dropped when Otto's heavy man shot Howard in the face with absolutely no hesitation. I was in shock for a good while after the movie ended. The directors did not hold back when creating this scene. The scene was not especially gory but it was merciless and so realistic that it made the audience react with awe.Lastly, Sandlers character was extremely well created. He was in constant need of being in control and proving other people right. He did not seem to evolve throughout the film but got what was coming to him in the end. His character was especially shown when he stopped at his apartment where he had kicked out the woman he was having an affair with. Howard told his wife that he was going to grab something, which he did not do; he merely walked in and made sure she wasn't there. Howard cared so much about being in control that he exposed his son to the truth of his relationship with his son's Mom.",Uncut Gems

1881,piercemichaelfinnegan,Absolutely Terrific,8,6 February 2020,"Absolutely fantastic film, from the music to the incredibly unique visuals. Every actor brings their A-Game into developing colorful and deep characters especially Adam Sandler, whose performance shines throughout the film. The film is a breath of fresh air from the usual Hollywood crap with stunning cinematography and masterful camera shots. It's truly a beautiful looking film. The pacing is great as we see Howard struggle to solve problem after problem, constantly digging a hole for himself. My God that ending... absolutely incredible. It will place you at the edge of your seat. The only thing I wasn't particularly a fan of was the opening scene, I understand it provided the origin for the gem and showcased how dangerous it was but it felt extremely out of place and the scene where Howard is having dinner for a Jewish ceremony, again it didn't really mesh well with the films pacing and slowed it down quite a bit. However the film is a must watch. Fantastic performance by Sandler and another magnificent movie by the Safdie brothers.",Uncut Gems

1887,susieemmakavanagh,Nothing quite like this,9,2 February 2020,"This film is just insane. If you expect an action movie that entertains you and your family, you're definitely not on the right path. It is fast, intense, many people talk at once without listening to each other and there is a good chance your brain will explode at some point.I had to take a break in the middle for how intense it was getting; it gave me tachycardia and anxiety. Maybe it sounds exaggerated, but it is exactly how I felt. For some this may be a downside, but I honestly think that very few movies are so powerful that your feelings are not limited to a genuine laugh or a little tear anymore. Screenplay and cinematography together make you share those feelings with the protagonist even when he doesn't explicitly express them through words, dragging you into a climax of suspense and engaging you more and more as the minutes pass.This is not a movie that can be appreciated by everyone though. If you don't usually like or understand the concepts behind independent cinema, this film might not be for you. It is not something you'd just watch on a Friday night with friends, snacking on pop corns and drinking Pepsi like you would perhaps do with many other Adam Sandler's movies.[PS. If English is not your first language - like in my case - but you still want to watch it with original audio because the cast is amazing and the acting is so damn good, it will take much more concentration than you expect, even using subtitles.

The only good decision made in this movie was Indina Menzel's character laughing in Sandler's face when he asked for her to take him back.

It was also very well put together.

I recommend this movie to anybody that loves action and excitement as much as I do.If I could watch this movie 3 more times, I would in a heartbeat.

1908,breniscool,Jarring and Intoxicating,8,1 January 2020,"A lot of people have been lauding this film as a different direction for Sandler, as it isn't from his Happy Madison catalog. Howard Latner is no different from Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, etc. Characteristically, he still follows his typical motifs of being a loud, volatile, Jewish manchild like in most of his past films. What separates Latner from the majority of his past performances is that his immaturity is not tolerated by his surrounding castmates at all. With the stakes for his own life heightened by greed, lust, and redemption, Latner ultimately drives himself into a deep hole.The most critiqued upon part of the film is its loudness. Some have argued the synth driven soundtrack, or just the overall dialogue itself is unnecessarily loud. However, the Safdie brothers wanted just that. Sandler overwhelms the audience as he frantically drags you through the streets of the diamond district, while being constantly attacked by various loan sharks. Without its audacity, the movie would fall short as Latner's wrongdoings are rooted from his constant rushed, brash decisions.Overall, I would say Sandler's performance is as memorizing as his black opal jewel. The Safdie's were able to build the film around Sandler's strengths. In doing so, it pushed Sandler to leave his comfort zone and allowed the audience to experience his faults in a more explicit situation. Like the jewel he coveted, Sandler is able to fixate the audience on to himself, and get you enamored with his toxicity.",Uncut Gems

How the scenes are chaotic, everyone is yelling over eachother, etc....Yeah. That's the point.Sandler's character is a mess. His life is chaotic. The people he deals with are loud because they've either had it with him over his sketchy deals or they want him dead because he owes them money. Additionally, it's not like the movie is non-stop anarchy. There are plenty of points where the story slows down a bit and becomes more intimate between characters. It gives you a second to breathe and catch up...but just the right amount of time.I'll admit, the score for the movie surprised me a bit but I personally liked it. I enjoy that 80's synth vibe style and I dont think the score was featured enough to take away from the movie.The real standout for me however was Adam Sandler. Wow. This is HANDS DOWN his best movie in a very long time. Watching him play the role of the deal making gem dealer who's always got another trick up his sleeve...until he doesnt; it was refreshing. It was something unlike anything that hes done (that I can think of).The only thing that felt strange or out of place in the movie is the colonoscopy scene at the very beginning. I thought they would come back to that by saying his biopsy came back as being positive for cancer. It would have added another layer to the story but might have made it feel busy. Instead he gets a call out of the blue from his doctor who tells him hes alright and that everything was perfectly normal....okay. So what was the point of that being in the movie?

1924,marcofermin,A Two-Hour Anxiety Attack Like No Other,8,12 January 2020,"Let's get this out of the way......Uncut Gems is by no means a film meant to be easily enjoyed, and deliberately so. It's a frenetic, disorienting, and alarming work that smashes through its own plot and refuses to let up. This approach will work for some and completely deter others, but when all is said and done it is clear that the Safdie brothers have succeeded in what they set out to do. This is due in no small part to the superbly talented cast that excels across the board to truly sell the sporadic nature of the story. Idina Menzel, Lakeith Stanfield, and Julia Fox all nail their respective roles, but it's even more stunning to see complete amateurs like Kevin Garnett (yes, the basketball player) provide convincing performances when thrown out of their comfort zone. In spite of this, Adam Sandler completely steals the show with a tour de force that is likely to be remembered as the highlight of his entire career. His character is a sleazeball the likes of which he has never emulated before, and that is exactly why it is difficult to understand why he deserves so much praise. Adam masterfully portrays a hopeless, despicable gambling addict as he repeatedly chooses to make one wrong decision after another and turns his life into an absolute train wreck of his own making. It is through this continuous cycle of the main character's bad judgement that the film creates this unending anxiety that never ceases to increase, culminating in a third act stretch where the stakes are so unnecessarily massive that it teeters on equal parts immense suspense and extreme frustration. At the end of it all, it becomes impossible to empathize with Sandler's character because he is not given even the smallest window of opportunity to show any redeeming qualities, and this is precisely the point. The directors set out to illustrate a person's life unraveling into a full-blown disaster, and that is what will be witnessed even at points where a character is supposed to ""improve"" or ""learn a lesson"". Whether that concept is appealing to a viewer or not is up in the air, and it's why Uncut Gems will continue to be so polarizing in regard to its merit. All i can personally say is that the Safdie brothers had me screaming at my television screen repeatedly throughout this madness, and i think that's exactly what they were hoping i would do.",Uncut Gems

1928,w-09201-37720,Uncharacteristic for Sandler,4,23 January 2020,"An ambitious New York City jeweler drowning in debt from loan sharks attempts to get his head above water in risky ways like placing a high-stakes bet on his world-famous client Kevin Garnett. The high-paced lifestyle in New York City ultimately is too much for the selfish gangster as he has trouble satisfying all parties which leads to his ultimate downfall.Uncut Gems features the world famous actor Adam Sandler in an unusual role. Sandler, who has been the main star in many movies like Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Grownups is a world-renowned goof-ball. But in Uncut Gems, his role is flipped on its head as he acts as Howard-a cold, selfish gangster. This switch of dynamic for Sandler really upsets me. I have loved watching the many comedies he has starred in over the years and hate to seem him in a criminal role in a movie with few laughs. I was not a fan of the plot either since it ended in a way that a Sandler fan, like myself, would never wish to see. Also, the innumerable risky actions Howard takes throughout the movie like pawning Kevin Garnett's ring and betting the money he needs to pay off his debts makes the audience have a roller coaster of emotions. In addition to the plot, the music creates suspense and gives you the feeling that something bad could happen at any moment. The risky actions and suspenseful music had me worried for Howard during the entirety of the movie. My concern for Howard had me in an uncomfortable position emotionally throughout the whole movie because I did not want to see anything happen to my favorite actor. The cold-blooded murder of Howard and his brother at the end of the movie really pushed me over the edge. Having Sandler die in a movie is one of the worst plot decisions I have ever seen a movie writer make, so shame to the Safdie brothers and Ronald Bronstein. Despite my displeasure with the position Sandler was put in, the plot, and the music Uncut Gems' theme does teach a good lesson. One theme Uncut Gems has and I think is important for everyone to understand is addiction is a real thing and can greatly affect people's lives. The gambling addiction Howard has negatively affects his life. He is a very poor husband and dad and he is in deep trouble with loan sharks. Ultimately his addiction led to his death because if he would have paid his brother off instead of betting on Kevin Garnett the gangsters would not have had the anger stored up from being locked in a confined space for hours. This theme draws a similarity with the one of The Gambler. They both illustrate how gambling addiction is real and gets people in trouble, specifically in these two films with loans sharks. Ultimately, the uncharacteristic role of Adam Sandler, fateful plot and suspenseful music cause me to give a negative review on Uncut Gems despite the lessons you can learn from watching it.",Uncut Gems

With this in mind, I am convinced that the Safdie brothers have displayed one of the most engaging and exciting thrillers of the decade, capping off 2019 with the release date being Christmas Day.
Within this masterpiece comes the exciting development of known and unknown celebrities and actors, as they all come together in the pursuit of success and wealth. The film starts by following Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a jewelry store owner in New York's financial district. Under the heat of recent financial losses, Howard discovers and purchases a rare black opal gem, from an Ethiopian mine. With the gem in his possession, Howard is approached by Kevin Garnett (as himself) and his celebrity supervisor and scout, Demany (LaKeith Stanfield).
After trading out the gem for one of Garnett's NBA championship rings, Garnett goes on to have the game of his life. Once the legendary Celtic fails to give the opal back to Howard, the gambler and jeweler is faced with the task of tracking down the gem and regaining his profits. All while this struggle is unfolding, Howard also has to deal with family and psychological impacts. Howard struggles to deal with the growing separation of his immediate family after Dinah (Idina Menzel) and him file for divorce. Also, Julia (Julia Fox) comes into play as his new lover, and Howard must attempt to keep their newfound love a secret from his family. As the movie progresses, Howard is dealt with incredible setbacks and is left trying to salvage his wealth all while running from and escaping the people he owes money.
While the plot can be seen as rather simple, it is the special elements of the film that gives it its deserved appreciation, especially as it relates to the acting of the characters, script, music, setting, and dress.
The selection of actors chosen by the Safdie brothers truly brings out the flow and specialty of the movie. In contrast to his usual comedies, such as Grown-ups, Happy Gilmore, and The Waterboy, Adam Sandler steps up to the plate and crushes it to deep center with one of his best movies of all time (even more credit to him for it not being a comedy). Sandler does a spectacular job of portraying a man who has been on the go all his life, constantly on the move to the next thing. Also, amidst all his other issues, Howard seeks a life of purpose and fulfillment, which is gratified through the exchange of high-end jewelry in his 30 X 30 foot shop. Another set of characters that compliments Sandler's role is the works of the ""bad guys"" of the film. Arno (Eric Bogosian) and Phil (Keith Williams Richards) do a beautiful job at purposely disrupting Howard's moments of success, to the point where you wish they'd leave and never come back.
When looking at the script, the Safdie Brothers do marvels of leaving the reader anxious as to why certain events are happening (and more on the anxiety later). As the plot unfolds, Howard is left with one disappointment after another, and each one is treated with the same enraged manner that the audience feels, which is broadcasted through the unique word choice they use to, in a way, anger the audience.
Until you truly watch the film, you'll never know that Uncut Gems possesses some of the most engaging and powerful music of any movie ever. Not only is it beautiful, but most importantly it's used as a tool to convey the meaning and characteristics of the movie. For instance, but to not give too much away, in one of the scenes towards the end, Howard and the henchman are all watching the Celtics game that Howard bet money on. As the game progresses, the music intensifies and creates a feeling of uncertainty.
Both the clothing and setting choices compliment each other to a pinpoint of perfection. It was a superb choice to place the film in New York City, given the already chaotic nature of the city. Along with running from place to place in the ""city that never sleeps,"" Howard's dress fits the situation of the film as well: classy dress shirts and pants, with the special touches of expensive watches and earrings to give him that true gangster feeling.
As I mentioned earlier, with every great thing comes a flaw. With Uncut Gems, it's flaw relates to the anxious and stressful feeling that is received when watching this movie. Simply put, if you have anxiety problems, do NOT watch this movie. For a solid two and a half hours, you will be cringing and trying to pull your hair out as your left befuddled with all the poor choices that are made throughout the film. And although some people may enjoy this, for most people it will take your attention away from the themes and plot, since all you can do is sit and ponder the protagonist's decisions.
With all of that said, I still truly believe that Uncut Gems is a must-watch for anyone that wants a roller coaster of a movie, whether it's in the theaters or at home (preferably at the theaters; trust me). All in all, it is a truly game-changing and frenetic masterpiece that will leave you pondering long after your first watch.",Uncut Gems

During the whole movie everyone was talking and screaming at once, therefore very difficult to follow and understand the conversations (even though I used subtitles).

1958,matejmivsek,Our uncut phase,8,10 December 2020,"The movie starts off with a rather confusing and disturbing atmosphere that can be challenging for the viewer's understanding of the story. This rather confusing first quarter of the movie can be the main factor of disappointment for some but it plays an important part for the rest of the movie.
Movie does an outstanding job regarding the rise of suspense. Audio plays an important role, which is common in most dramas. But what Uncut gems does differently is rising suspense using not just the soundtrack but also dialogue. The viewer is sent on an incredible journey without even noticing it. Great examples of that are the first confrontation in the jewellery store and the scene right before the murder. Different conversations overlap themselves while still keeping the main dialogue clear. This is where story development, the soundtrack, quick cuts and other elements achieve unity.
The relationship between the viewer and the protagonist is also an important aspect that can easily go unnoticed. Howard is portrayed in a very negative and unappealing light but somehow the viewer builds a bond with him throughout the movie. At the end we cheer for him and for his success.
The basketball match takes the suspense to another level. I don't think I have ever seen a sports match in a movie so dramatic and intense - and the movie doesn't even revolve around sports! The viewer easily forgets about the life threatening dangers that Howard is facing. It is fascinating to me that such unsuspecting atmosphere can be achieved almost unnoticeably in a very chaotic movie. That is why the ending hits that much harder. The suspense stops for a moment right after the basketball match. Howard (and also the viewer) feels a sudden sense of relief. And right then, during the truce of the caos - the bullet hits. Out of the blue. The world crumbles below your feet.
The interpretation of gems can go in a couple of different directions. They portray a milestone that concludes the movie and brings it to its beginning (gives the viewer a feeling of sensual circular narrative). The other interpretation focuses on the meaning of an uncut gem in correlation with the people. The final scene introduces us to the mindset that we are all uncut gems. Howard fights an endless battle with himself and his surroundings that shape him. But as we can observe, he is never satisfied with himself, he constantly seeks for something broader than he currently is. Because of that, he will never achieve the ""cut"" phase that he so desires to achieve. In a dialogue between him and Kevin Garnett we can clearly see the aspiration for achieving more and more. His mentality is then transferred to Kevin Garnett, who becomes an uncut gem himself. The endless desire to achieve more and more is the recipe for our tragic demise.",Uncut Gems

I can't tell. The game of hustling, high stakes, and betrayal just seemed like a loud, graceless, ugly mess with no finesse, or likeable characters. The main character lies, cheats and badgers everyone around him so hard in his pursuit to make it big that by halfway through the film I was was counting the minutes to his inevitable murder as the betrayals and failures racked up and he continued to push the limits of all the wanbabes and truly dangerous people around him. It is a testimony to the writers and directors' fascination with this modern noir descent into addiction and risking everything to win that they could wring a whole second half of a movie out of this story. I'm not fascinated with the adrenaline and seduction of this type of sad, dark rush into oblivion. A nod to the filmmakers' passion and craft in the tight, stitching together of a glittering, fast paced, chaotic tale, but I'm not left with a sense of time well spent.

The charachters scream ALL the time, the dialogues are a continuous stream of cursing and yelling while saying absolutely nothing important to the plot and, in the end, you don't understand what the movie is about at all. If it was meant to teach you how money affects people, well, there's plenty of movies who did it waaay better and without being a 2 hour torture.

Between its hodgepodge casting, unique score and pacing, the movie strives and succeeds with what a lot of films don't get right.Sandler plays an eclectic and high strung jeweler seeking to score big by borrowing money and gambling with the wrong people. The plot is very basic and easy to follow, but sometimes you don't need it to be complex to tell an engaging story that's memorable and worth watching. The film takes you on an anxiety rollercoaster from start to finish through intense overlapping dialogue that feels very reminiscent of Tarantino. The score brilliantly accompanies the film in a way that adds to the anxiety and reflects the intensity of our protagonist. One of the few films where I found myself wondering how long this ride was going to last and screaming internally while praying for a calm resolution.

Even tho Adam Sandler is one of my favorite comedy actors, this movie was catastrophic (and this is a compliment).
Yelling, swearing, no story to follow, it's just chaotic tension through the whole movie.

Adam Sandler took us on a journey involving how, as a completely poisoned man, he poisons everything and everyone he touches. He does so while screaming for the better part of 2 hours.
There is nothing appealing about Sandler's character, yet somehow he manages to attract not one but two beautiful women, the devotion of his father, and a host of other's who make living his miserable life possible.

1984,shohruha,Norm of Gambling,10,15 March 2020,"Howard Ratner, played by Adam Sandler, a protagonist, is a jewelry show owner. His gambling addiction gradually but steadily has been taking everything from him: his family, his career and has put him into hundreds of thousands of debts. Ratner keeps pursing his goal of winning big in one of those bets, but the time was not slowing down. At the end of the day, Howard manages to somehow produce his 'last' gambling, but the pre-developed consequences did show up.
The movie not only shows the hidden side of Jewish communities, but also refers to some of those as depraved. One of the most important topics the film focuses is the gambling. The main idea is that the gambling even though may grant you with a rich life, it still, sooner or later, would take everything from you.
For some people it is normal to bet on or against something. Such practice has become a norm many centuries ago. What I love about ""Uncut Gems"" is that it shows harmful and damaging effect of such developed norm, which became a sub-culture. The 'Uncut Gems' moreover may be looked at as a 'guideline' of what not to do. The movie, nonetheless, exposes the nature of gamblers: a player bets not for winning, but for the feeling of the play. In this sense, the gambling becomes an addiction, which can be compared to the drug addiction.
The protagonist usually is a positive personality with lots of contradictions. The fact the he/she is caring about family makes him/her a publicly loved character. In 'Uncut Gems' Howard Ratner is caring about his family, he worries about them, he wants to re-build his marriage with his ex-wife. The first few bets Howard makes a viewer ask ""Why did he do that?"" As the movie goes on, the question keeps repeating with more frequency and anger towards the protagonist. Viewer can track down that any of the problems Howard has are result of gambling. Even those issues Ratner has, which do not really affect the main story, are still the results of betting. At the end of the day, all of his issues and problems come at him and want to shake him off. He could have solved those problems at that second, but, again, his takes the risk and makes that one 'last' bet. And, of course, it did not really matter whether he won or lost, since the abovementioned issues wanted him and not his bets.
That all said, I would recommend watching this movie for those who like it to take a risk and to make a bet 'just for fun'. The established norm of betting is an addiction, which is harmful not because of losing the big numbers, but because of the players' satisfaction of doing so over and over again.",Uncut Gems

If this movie bares any likeness to the life of any New York jeweler or any high profile sports figure, then I'm so happy to not be them.

I get that it is supposed to show the dangers of gambling addiction and the desperation it can cause, so maybe the movie is supposed to leave you feeling depressed. But I'm more mad that I just spent over 2 hours watching characters I hated make one bad decision after another, only to get a terrible ending. I can watch some very difficult and unsettling movies and actually feel a meaningful sense of despair and contemplation afterward, but this one just left me feeling like I developed an ulcer during it's runtime. Props to Adam Sandler for doing well in a more serious role I guess (by doing well I mean making me hate his character). I've been sitting here trying to think of something good to say about the movie, but other than the acting, I'm really struggling. Other movies that are rough to watch and have difficult endings (e.g., Requiem for a Dream, American History X, etc.) at least leave you feeling broken in a meaningful way.

2011,mielpi,"A Good Cut, Far From Flawless, but Sandler is Highly Appraised",8,24 May 2020,"The first few minutes of the movie were bizarre and did not get why they needed the colonscopy footage. I did not know I was watching the right movie at first. But, Adam Sandler is fantastic in this movie and makes it very watchable and re-watchable. Yes, there is a lot of foul language and yelling in this movie. As someone who grew up in New York and has been to the diamond district, this is commonplace. When you are selling items that can fit into the palm of your hand for many thousands of dollars, there are high emotions, especially amongst the nationalities of those who sell these gems.
If you are thinking this is a sports betting movie, you will be disappointed. Sports betting plays a role, but it is not the main focus, by any means. The main focus is Sandler. He delivers in a way he never has previously. You truly believe he is a store owner in the diamond district with a myriad of problems in his life. Are there some far-fetched parts? Absolutely. I do not believe you can beat someone up in the middle of midtown Manhattan, dump them in a pool and no one says anything anymore.
Kevin Garnett was really good, and New York sports radio icon Mike Francesa was good as a bookie. I liked how they had they actually had footage of the Game 7 that the Celtics and 76ers played in 2012. But, why did they have her place a sports bet at Mohegan Sun where sports betting is not legal.
I hated the ending. While it was completely unexpected, I just did not understand why would they kill Howard off after they were all going to get paid?
I am giving it a 7.5 (round up to 8), Sandler carries the weight of an odd script that is not sure whether it was to be a comedy or a thriller.",Uncut Gems

You want to root for Sandler's character during some times and other times you want to spit in his face. There's a lot of passion in his performance. But when you get to the end of the film, the story really stabs you in the heart and lets you know you invested 2+ hours for nothing. There's no clear good guy or bad buy. There's no winning or losing. It comes down to a heist film, you just don't know who is stealing from whom. At the end of the day, I can't recommend this film. I can only tell my worst enemies that this is a good film. I'd love to see their face when they get to the end and feel as bad as I did. This film was one big April Fool's joke.

Like it had to be a certain length. NEWS FLASH!! IT WAS TO LONG!!If I paid to see this movie in the theaters I would want to get my money back. I got the feeling that this was just any film that he had to complete in order to fulfill a NETFLIX obligations. After you watch the trailer stop there. You just saw the best parts of the movie and I saved you 2 hours.If this movie was so spectacular to the critics as it says in the trailer then why didn't we see any promotional support behind the release?

Adman Sandler's performance covers a full range from manic to manic. The rest of the cast is swept along in the same tenor. A famous athlete submits himself to portrayal as an avaricious, superstitious lout.

""Uncut Gems"" had so much potential to leave the viewer musing on how a human being is much like a gem that has yet to be finished properly - how we have inner beauty and redeeming qualities that don't always shine through on the surface, but that can be developed and brought to light by our actions. Instead, the film's ending serves only to drive home two very clichéd and overplayed points: ""crime doesn't pay"" and ""a gambler never wins"".

Being a gambling addict isn't good enough to justify his shallow characteristics. He's cheating on his wife, but goes bat-s**t-crazy on his girlfriend for ""cheating"" when he finds out she is doing drugs in a bathroom with some dude.His character and the storyline lost me altogether when he lets Kevin Garnett (mediocre performance would be an exaggeration) borrow a gemstone that is supposedly worth a million dollars.

First of all, it has way too much noise and chaos. I understand they want to portray the stress of Howard (Sandler), but it was throughout the whole movie. Everyone would be yelling, buzzing in the background, the phone is ringing, like come on! Thats fine for one scene but not the whole movie. We wanted to stop the movie so bad, but we just wanted to know the ending.
Next, everything you want to happen in the movie just goes south. If you're expecting all to go wrong, thats exactly what happens.

My recommendation to the film makers would be to see The Long Good Friday, an English film from 1980 which deals with a similar tale of dodgy dealings and a protagonist's come-uppance. Although it looks dated now, it manages to combine grit with strong characterisation and bucket loads of humour. It wasn't until I watched it for about the tenth time that I realised how little swearing there is. Uncut Gems could be shortened by about 20 minutes simply by cutting out the redundant expletives. It would have been more emotionally absorbing if the writers had troubled to make the characters seem believably human and add a little humour (there was only one laugh in over two hours). As it was, I didn't care about any of them and didn't feel any tension, only irritation at the ceaseless yelling. Some dynamic modulation wouldn't have gone amiss.

2044,Liu-Guo-Qiang,Madness and vitality,10,14 December 2020,"The camera follows the protagonist constantly shuttling through the urban streets. The vitality shown by the close-up of the face is really surprising, but it complements the fast, short and flowing crowds and commercial buildings. The human mind is in madness due to the power of accumulating capital, but there is a rationality for the body in the gap of madness. This contradiction seems to be reflected in every modern person who has a physical examination and weighing on time.
After missing the first gambling victory, the male protagonist lay alone on the sofa in the office. What we saw was every worker who was busy day after day but got nothing. But this loneliness is too common, and it can be rejuvenated the next day without the companionship of family members or the comfort of a lover; this vitality is so extraordinary that after learning of the protagonist's Jewish ancestry with natural merchant attributes , We can relax and relieve the burden of maintaining this vitality in the competition. The director's kindness was maintained till the end. When we could no longer stand the man who was almost crazy in mind, he sent two audience members to quickly solve him. No one feels sorry for the heroes not enjoying the fruits of victory. Everyone understands that this is the best redemption for extreme madness and exhaustion.
The conclusion may be that the brutality of breaking the rules of contract is a kind of liberation to the alienated under capitalist conditions. After all, the emotional exchange between the two people in tears fell into ecstasy for money in the next second, and the pious ceremony with their religious partners did not conceal the coveting of the sacred objects of the people on the other side of the ocean.

This movie is very stressful there's moments where you don't know what's going on and there's moments that sum up everything at once.

2057,devoe-49693,Just Stop Running,9,22 March 2021,"Uncut Gems follows Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) who owns a Jewelry store in New York. Howard has a terrible gambling addiction, is in hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and his home life is falling apart. He is not very present in his children Eddie (Jonathan Aranbayev), Marcel (Noa Fisher), and Beni (Jacob Igielski) lives and his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) absolutely hates his guts and cant wait to divorce him. Howard thinks he has finally found a way to get himself out of debt, the black opal mined from the Welo mines in Ethiopia. But this seems to only create more problems for him.
I believe the theme of this film is that you cannot run forever. Howard is constantly borrowing money from here and there to pay off different people only creating more and more debt for himself. This somewhat reminds me of The World's Greatest Dad. They both are lying to everyone and trying to get away with it but the major difference is in the Worlds Greatest Dad Robin William's Character, Lance, eventually outs himself as a fraud where as if Howard had the choice he would've gotten away with it all.
Howard is constantly trying to ignore the people he is indebted too. There are a couple scenes where these two twins (Mitchel Wenig and Stewart Wenig) keep showing up asking for their money. Howard gives them a fake Rolex watch to try to get them off his back instead of just paying them back. One of the twins then comes back when they realize it is fake and try to get Howard's Girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox) to help them find Howard but yet again just get ignored. I kept thinking there would be more to come with the Twins story line but I believe their main purpose is just to remind you of how many people Howard is indebted too and how he keeps trying to run from them all. Howard also keeps avoiding his brother in law Arno (Eric Bogosian) and these two guys, Phil (Keith William Richards) and Nico (Tommy Kominik), Arno hired to help him get his money back from Howard. They constantly keep following him and trying to shack him down for whatever money he has. They give him plenty of warnings, such as kidnapping Howard at his daughters play and then locking him in the trunk of his own car naked, but Howard keeps trying to place bets to get out of it rather than just paying them the money he has. They finally get fed up with the last bet he places and Howard finally gets what is coming to him. Yet again tying in with the theme of not being able to run forever.
Over all, this is an insanely great movie that I would recommend to anyone who can handle the high intensity of it. The Safdie brothers did an excellent job with this film. You are on the edge of your sit holding your breath the entire time waiting to see if Howard is able to actually get his big win and finally be able to pay off all his debts. But in the end he has to stop running from it all and face his fate.",Uncut Gems

2079,silverfox93,Adam's Folley,1,2 January 2020,"I suppose that every comedic actor yearns to be taken seriously as a dramatic talent. Jim Carry, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and others have successfully made that transition. I thought Adam Sandler had also achieved that status with Spanglish... but since then it's one failed attempt after another. Uncut Gems continues that downward spiral. It's a movie about an unbelievable character surrounded by a A+ group of actors all given a script that belonged in a PlayStation Video. The music is so over the top in it's attempt to create suspense...the volume level of the music and dialog would work well as an open commercial for Dolby ATMOS, but as a drama, it just becomes way over done.
The plot is hard to believe given the Sandler's character's already established lifestyle...all in all I didn't buy any of it.

There is lots of shouting, loud music, folks speaking on top of everyone in sight but that is what made the film for me. I'm always saddened by 'street' films that use little profanity and the characters speak in turn. In this industry and setting the chaotic, shouting, profanity laced dialogue is true to the atmosphere. I have lived in it and worked in it. When films use this to add chaos and 'noise' it helps to put the viewer inside of the world being presented. I want my ears to hurt, I want to hear shouting, I want it to feel authentic. There are parts where luxury clothes are bought inside of the shop which added nice detail to the hustle aspect of Sandler and the world of luxury/jewelry/material in general. Anything of material value is bought and sold daily and in this specific business it helps to show details that allow the viewer to realize that it's about fast money, greed and finer things.",Uncut Gems

Any movie that throws a compound break spurting blood in the first 60 seconds just screams lack of thoughtful plot development. And from this you know how the movie will end. Completely predictable tragedies with several missed opportunities to actually thrill the audience.
Kevin Garnet's acting was as painful as Napoleon Dynamite. I kept waiting for Adam to scream ""Abie Doobie"". He has other movies like Spanglish where he is developed and other characters compliment his development. This was not that kind of movie. Random violence. Unbelievable situations and lack of normal reaction from characters was just annoying.Every plot twist was so predictable it became and layers deep you knew what was coming next. Again as a comedy this might have worked.The end of the movie was like ""screw it"" let's end the movie in 5 minutes cause 120 is just too long.

I grew up around gamblers and bookies my whole life. You can't really believe how chaotic things can get in that lifestyle. Adam Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a down on his luck gambler to perfection. Howard is in way over his head, and there's only one thing he can think about....His next move/gamble. I won't get too much into the plot other than the ending. And I won't even necessarily spoil that but I will just say it's perfect. In every gambling movie the protagonist always sails off into the sunset. For example use the movie Rounders (which I always said was the greatest gambling movie ever until today). He pays off his outstanding debt with a few hours to spare and goes off to the World Series of poker in Las Vegas. That just doesn't happen in 999,999/1,000,000 cases. This movie almost gives you the typical happy ending that everyone expects. Then it proceeds to snatch it away from you. In an unexpected, yet realistic fashion. He was in too deep. It would've been too unbelievable for me to think he was going to pay off all his debts, repair his damaged relationships and get the classic Hollywood ending.

I get it that people don't want to constantly be fed with unrealistic ""Hollywood endings"", but does that mean movie makers are now trying to make movies as annoying and depressing as possible?

2140,abdulla_khaled,Love or Hate,1,2 May 2020,"You either love this movie or you hate it, there is no in between. I did not love the movie, so here goes my spoiler free rant.To be fair, I understand the message which is being shared by the movie, and it is a very powerful message. Gambling is addictive, and it is not only addictive because of the money or the gain alone, but is also addictive for the rush and the thrill of betting and the excitement of risking eventing in the hope of gaining more. Adam Sandler has done a perfect job in portraying that and bring it to life, his character Howard Ranter was a completely annoying, hyperactive, garrulous gambling addict that makes you want to punch his throat every time he opens his mouth. If an actor is able to make me feel hate and anger for the character he is playing, he gets my respect.The movie failed for me mainly on the storytelling aspect. The events, scenes and dialogue were all extremely random with no proper introduction to the characters, and it had zero character development. The pacing of the movie had me worn out, and I could not mentally keep up with it. Everyone is talking fast, and everything is happening fast, as if it was intended to be a 3 hour movie that was cramped into 2 hours. The movie had me on my nerves throughout the story, and it did not give me time to emotionally rest or digest what is happening.To make things worse, the soundtrack chosen for the movie was just a collection of random noises that had nothing to do with anything in the movie. I cannot stress this much, the soundtrack is what brings emotions to the scenes, and it is what makes the audience connect to the movie.I cannot recommend this movie to a regular person who is looking for entertainment only, but I would recommend it to someone who loves reviewing and analyzing movies. The movie will definitely add to the experience of the reviewer, and introduce new ideas and perspectives.",Uncut Gems

He's upset because - as he puts it - nothing is going right in his life - because he constantly lies and ""kicks against the pricks"".

2171,Jwlucas42,Sandler Shines in Manic Adrenaline Rush,8,28 May 2020,"The first thing that really jumps out about this movie is the phenomenal performance from Adam Sandler. I am a big fan of Sandler's older comedies: Waterboy, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, etc., but he hasn't been in a decent movie in a long time. Until now.In Uncut Gems, Sandler completely disappears into his character. You truly believe that he is this impulsive, conniving diamond dealer. I think this performance is given a bit more credit than it deserves due to the fact that no one expected anything halfway decent from Sandler at this point in his career. I don't agree that he was an ""oscar snub"" for best actor. There were a few scenes when his character cries or gets emotional that didn't ring completely true to me. Despite this, this is a phenomenal performance by Sandler and I hope it is a sign of things to come.The movie itself is a fast paced whirlwind of stress and excitement. The Safdie brother's do a great job of letting the audience experience the manic highs and lows that Sandler's character himself is experiencing. I found the experience of spending a day in the life of a wheeling and dealing jewel salesman highly entertaining. As a slice of life movie this movie is a great success. Sandler's character is very compelling and I found myself rooting for him even though he is a bit of a scumbag. Would recommend 8/10",Uncut Gems

2200,ash-powell0,Still a better thriller than Hereditary,2,4 July 2020,"The first 5 minutes makes you think you're going to watch a film similar to blood diamond. How wrong I was to assume that.
If you enjoy watching dialogue of people shouting at each other constantly, and the regular random hench men turning up at Adam Sandlers jewellers door (one with a stereotypically rough voice), then you'll love this.
Not to forget the pointless scenes of ""where's my stone?"" ""I don't have it"", which repeats in different settings, followed by ""where's my money?"" ""I don't have it"" in different settings, again, you'll love it.
There's a point in the film where I mistakenly thought there could be some drama (as it's described on imdb as a crime, drama, thriller) when the stone is placed at auction, and Adam sandlers father-in-law tries to up-bid the stone to raise more money, only to end up winning the auction - not really much comes of this other than a ""sorry about that"", followed by another ""where's my money?"" in a different setting.
There's certainly some drama with the security doors, which leads to a nice 5-10 minutes of shouting back and forth.
I would say that you're better off watching game 7 of the celtics vs sixers 2008 playoff game in its entirety rather than this film.
People say that this is Adam Sandlers best work, which I feel is harsh on films such as Happy Gilmore, Waterboy and Little Nicky, as these films have much better dialogue and drama - not Sandler's fault however!",Uncut Gems

But for me I loved the messy chaotic nature of it. It's not a movie you can compare to others and truly stands out by itself.

Returned to it the next day, thinking that the good imdb score and all the critics can't be that far off, only to watch another 30 minutes when I actually got to the point of skipping forward once every couple of seconds, a thing which I haven't ever done before. Managed to finish it this way but it left me with a very foul taste in my mouth. Such a foul taste that I actually dug up my imdb credentials, logged in and wrote my first review on an account which I had for 7 years.
In my opinion, the acting was good but the directing, the soundtrack and the plot are rubbish. It just makes you confused and angry and might even give you a headache. There's a plethora of far better movies with a lower rating than this one.

With Scorsese in the titles I was optimistic, however this film stands as proof that not everything he touches turns to gold.Sandler was an offensive stereotype in a film loaded with offensive stereotypes.

2274,philliamh,Like a gritty Mr Bean,8,7 November 2021,"Uncut Gems is a rollercoaster through the sleazy backdoor of NYC jewellery. The story revolves around Howard - a basketball-loving jeweller and gambling addict. Howard presents very few redeeming qualities throughout the movie and presents a case study for how deep you can be placed in the pit of gambling addiction. Every decision he makes is irrational and informed by delusions of a 'big win' that will set everything right. These gambles stake his money, his reputation and his safety. Many have discussed how stressful this movie is to watch because of the insane risks that Howard takes throughout. Whenever things start to look up for Howard, he will take another crazy risk inducing a similar reaction to watching Mr. Bean worsen his situation. The storyline flows smoothly, giving us just enough relief and optimism to make the anxiety last until the end.Almost all of the first time actors (of which there are many) shine in this film. The two heavies, Phil & Nico, fit the bill as tough guys better than any known name in Hollywood could. The other men working the jewellery district are convincing because that's exactly what they really are and Kevin Garnett seemed like a good choice to play Kevin Garnett. I was least impressed with the only two actors I knew already: LaKeith Stanfield and Adam Sandler. This could, of course, be because they are distractingly famous compared to the rest of the cast. However, Stanfield's character didn't come across as convincing to me and I wasn't as wowed by Sandler's 'serious role' as everyone else seemed to be. I think there is a tendency to see someone funny in a 'serious' role and be so caught off-guard by the lack of jokes that they come across as better actors (Steve Carrell in Foxcatcher, Seth Rogen in Steve Jobs, Jonah Hill in Moneyball etc). Howard is a very well-written character though, garnering sympathy for his clear inability to look after his interests rationally which is swiftly lost for being the ""most annoying person [you've] ever met"".The story is well-crafted, the portrayal of dangerous NYC is vivid, but the acting could be better in places and character development beyond Howard was lacking. A film which is as clever and discomforting as the colonoscopy with which the story begins.",Uncut Gems

One demential characters that played out as stereotypes with not enough writing to make me care about any of them. AWKWARD CAMEO by The Weekend and a disappointing use of Oneohtrix Point Never. Their sound didn't belong in the universe they were trying to create. It felt like they used left over songs from Goodtime and hearing them made me think about how that's a much better movie. The only parts I enjoyed were the sequences inside the gem and human body. It was implied the main gem had intoxicating and supernatural energy. They could've done a lot with that idea. When Adam Sandler first looked into the gem his eyes shrunk and dopamine released, that could've just been from the amount of money he knew he could make but there was a surreal nature to that scene. When the basketball player looked at the crystals inside the gem, his life flashed through its colors. By taking the gem with him, he is given luck. These scenes encouraged the idea that the gem has powers. If they took more time to show its value, this could've made for a really refreshing and unique film. The established Safdie brothers cinematic universe would've done well handling such supernatural themes. Something like Goodfellas meets Enter the Void. BUT INSTEAD WE GOT ANOTHER GENERIC HOLLYWOOD GANGSTER ""YOU OWE ME MONEY"" PLOT. Have fun following a degenerate gambler who keeps making Little Nicky tier mistakes for two hours.

2312,marcelbrandel,"Nice acting, well created atmosphere but rhythm and music are at its worth",1,7 March 2020,"The acting and atmosphere created is really well done. But following points I believe do not make this movie having such a high rating.To see how well a movie did is like looking at a barrel consisting of multiple planks. These planks are like all the different elements that make up the film, like directing, cinematography, production design, editing, music, etc. Due to the different skill levels of each department all planks are not at same length, and the water (content of the film, or how good the film is) you put in a barrel is only as much as the shortest. In this case:The Acting was very good, the atmosphere created was nice, the cinematography helped to push the characters forward.BUTThe directing was bad, the first 3 scenes had no breathing. You had multiple people talking at the same time, hard to understand what is going on. It's very chaotic, which yes, was on intention and nicely done. BUT you have to have a couple of breaks in between, and not having everyone talking at the same time for 3 scenes long. This is unbearable.The editing was also bad, similar to the dialogue, there is not breathing, bad pacing at especially the beginning of the film. We as an audience do not get a slower edited scene to digest the beginning chaotic scenes.Music was the worse, it is ok to use the music being used in the film for the beginning to emphasize this world of diamonds trades back and forth, greed and the high pace of selling valuable items. But this kind of music becomes very annoying the longer you listen to it. And it has been also used for at least 3 scenes long making it hard to watch and getting unconcentrated.Overall, I had to put the volume down and skip forward some scenes that I felt were just being chaotic and not really useful.When comparing it to marriage story, there was also similar acting of chaotic dispute and back and forth uncoordinated talking.

I love Adam Sandler when he's in his more dramatic roles, so maybe I was already poised to love this film, and don't get me wrong -- Sandler's performance was great, but that wasn't what kept me locked into this movie the entire time. It was the Safdies' direction and pacing that kept me hooked.Their style of photography is a really fascinating blend of 70's/80's style long-shot cinematography with a more modern mix of quick-cuts and close-ups. The pace of the movie never lets up as it ratchets up the tension and I believed the stress and desperation of Sandler playing a man that's just barely staying afloat. To be honest I felt the need to cringe most of the way through the movie as the situations Howard (Sandler) got himself into just went from bad to worse. But I was riveted the entire time, fascinated by the personalities of the characters and the world they live in. The Safdies do a great job of representing chaotic environments, especially in the jewelry store. Having worked in many similar crazy spaces, the way that people are talking over one another and tasks start piling up is really authentic -- it brought me back to those days.My favorite movies keep me wanting to follow these characters, and I found myself checking the clock to see when it would be over, not wanting it to end.Summing it up --The acting was great.

The dialogue is written in a way where it doesn't feel designed for a story, but captured from a moment. The way the dialogue feels reminds me of how ""The Meyerowitz Stories"" handled dialogue. It feels real.The main thing that brings the experience down for me is the fact that the movie didn't grip me. I'd say that comes down to the story and the characters (or maybe only the characters). The story isn't boring or generic, but it isn't fantastic either. The characters weren't that interesting, and I had a hard time rooting and sympathizing for anyone in the movie.

It's a screaming, swearing mess, filled with horrible and irredeemable characters. And the sound track magnifies the general unpleasantness of this film. The performances of the actors unfortunate enough to be in this film were all pretty good, including that of Mr. Sandler. They convincingly played despicable people, but that didn't save it; the story and the presentation were too strong obstacles to overcome. It was an unrelenting melange of betrayals, cons, violence, and stupidity overlaid by all that screaming and swearing. The reason I'm confused is that its scores were high, so maybe it's just me - but I don't think so. See it at your own risk.",Uncut Gems

2368,hemi_kitty,Full Circle,8,26 May 2020,"In a good way, it was extremely stressful to watch, and every outcome felt so believable. I think it's a powerful statement about the inner destruction of gambling addiction, which could be described as an obsession with the thrill of winning or losing it all, regardless of your life being on the line. Some people play to lose just to keep betting for the sake of making a bet. Being a family member or friend of someone with a gambling addiction is a serious rollercoaster of emotions, and I think feelings of frustration, desperation, and betrayal fuel the tone of this movie; we're frustrated because our protagonist is so arrogant in his ill-conceived convictions that we're desperate for him to have a win so he'll finally stop- even though we have seen enough evidence to know he will gamble his winnings away and will continue to do so because he will have learned nothing from previous consequences- and we on the outside need a moment for ourselves to feel he's going to recover, but then we are ultimately betrayed by our trust in a happy ending for those who spend their lives gambling, since there is no happy ending for those who constantly steal from one to pay another.
Sandler is perfect as Howard. He makes him loud, annoying, arrogant, deceitful, pitiful, and straight up chaotic- exactly what most addicts are like when they are in too deep. So, if you hate this movie's energy, then it has served its purpose of bothering you. It should bother you. It's not a feel-good movie, it's not a redemption story- it's an agonizingly painful story of a delusional person spiraling out of control... as it is with a gambling addict who is ruining your life from their obsession with power.",Uncut Gems

2373,russredman-50784,So Much Static Hides a Good Story,3,18 September 2020,"Uncut Gems tells the story of Jewish-American jewelry store owner and gambling addict Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler). Howard is in debt big to loan sharks, and is constantly trying to work his way back to even. In the true form of an addict, Howard can never resist the temptation to gamble away any cash or valuables he comes across in spite of his debts; he even pawns the NBA championship ring belonging to customer Kevin Garnett, who leaves the ring at the store as collateral when he borrows a large rare gemstone. Howard's girlfriend Julia (Julia Foxx) seems to be an enabling force to Howard's bad habits. Garnett's best friend and entourage leader Demany (LaKeith Stanfield) seems to know that Howard is a degenerate, but it does not stop Demany from frequenting Howard's shop with Garnett. Demany even has a set of expensive watches on loan to Howard, wanting Howard to sell them from his shop for Demany.This film follows a theme of bad decision-making and the downward spiral of fate. The viewer gets to watch, helplessly, as Howard Ratner makes quite literally every possible horrible choice a man can make in a film's short time span. Likely one of the most distracting films in modern memory, there is literally no break for the viewer in terms of sensory load during these two hours. Every scene inside the jewelry store features Howard and his clientele, some of whom are engaged with Howard and some of whom are talking to each other, but all of whom seem to be yelling all of the time and at the same time. Even the customers who are not on camera can still be heard very loud and clear in the background. When there isn't a room full of voices who are all talking at once, loud and strange music plays over what could be an otherwise peaceful reprieve, or Howard's cell speakerphone competes with other loud background conversation.With respect to acting, Uncut Gems contains some magnificent performances. Sandler's Howard Ratner could not be more brilliantly designed and executed. Julia acts as a perfect cherry on top to Howard's already self-destructing lifestyle. Demany adds the right check at times to Howard and is entertaining to watch. Strong executions aside, the viewer cannot help but come away feeling the effects of an under-developed plot. So many questions linger, and it remains a mystery whether some were answered and the viewer just missed them among all of the background noise.The film's climax features Kevin Garnett finally purchasing from Howard the rare gemstone he has desired for a sum of $155,000. Howard was expecting upwards of $1 million for the stone, but settles for the sale to KG when his auction house drastically reduces the stone's appraisal value. With the loan shark men in his lobby waiting for him, Howard could walk to the lobby with the money and end all of his trouble. Instead, he passes a Louis Vuitton bag containing the cash out the window to Julia with instructions to immediately gamble the sum on Garnett and the Celtics for that night's game. The viewer guesses that the film is on full-tilt downward spiral at this moment. Surprisingly, Howard wins his parlay bet, netting over $1 million. In true keeping with the film's theme, however, Howard is killing by his loan sharks moments after his victory is sealed. The downward spiral was there, just for a different reason than the viewer had guessed.This film relies heavily on camera angles and background sound to create the effect desired by the directors. The camera angle is often very close to Howard's face, and the viewer is able to see and feel the helpless desperation of degenerate gambling up close and personal. The film constantly makes the viewer feel very squeezed-in; many camera shots are in very small rooms like Howard's son's room, which seems to be about four feet deep and only feature a TV and a basketball hoop for him to dunk. Even the jewelry store feels claustrophobic at times, particularly in the never-ending scenes in which people become stuck in the corridor.Overall, Uncut Gems was not enjoyable due to its incredible level of distraction. Much of this was by design of the directors, but a more balanced approach would have lent itself much more effectively to the otherwise strong acting performances put forth. There is a good story here, but the way it is told equates to listening to an AM radio full of static. Many viewers might prefer more character explanation and development, slower plot elaboration, and less background noise and overwhelming sensory overload.",Uncut Gems

2404,westmegh,UGH...what?? (SPOILERS),1,17 September 2020,"I knew coming into this film it was not the typical Adam Sandler comedy or even the not so comedic Adam Sandler Spanglish but I had no idea it would be one of the worst films I'd ever seen. To be completely honest I felt like I wasted over 2 hours on a film that had no real conclusion for all the story lines that it intertwined; if I had to give it a theme it would be chaos and confusion, maybe overcoming obstacles. It often reminded me of the chaos and obstacles in the film A Star is Born. The main characters can't seem to get themselves together enough to just enjoy life.In summary, Howard, Adam Sandler, is a compulsive gambler, owes a ton of many to multiple bookies and never seems to be ahead in the bet. He is also a high end jeweler with clientele that are famous and also some 'associates' that also have stake in the game but are more into selling counterfeit merchandise. Howard helps them by letting them keep their stock in his store and in return they funnel the high profile clients to Howard. Howard is married to Dinah, Idina Menzel (who I may refer to as Elsa, because duh), their marriage is falling apart as evident by Howard's girlfriend, Julia, played by Julia Fox. Howard is constantly avoiding his familial responsibilities to gamble, sleep with his girlfriend, avoid loan sharks, and try to recover the precious 'uncut gem' (the opal). In my memory of the film the opal is a main character, but also, it's role seems so minor to me. The movie was more about the madness of Howard's life in general and less about any gem. While it's integral to the film as the desire of Howard, and also Kevin Garnett (played by himself), it was not the primary focus, as I thought it may have been.We see at a family dinner for Passover the main bookie that Howard is indebted to is actually a family member, his brother in law, Arno (Eric Bogosian). This adds another layer to the chaos of Howard's life as he cannot escape the loan shark even when he's with his family. This is also when we see that Howard and Dinah are getting never going to get back together. Howard has a 'coming to Jesus' moment where he tells her he wants her back and is changing, and she has a few choice words that I never thought I'd hear Elsa, I mean Dinah, say.In the end Howard's compulsion to gamble is too strong and he cannot overcome the drive to bet. He makes the biggest bet of his life and in fact wins, only to be killed by Arno's henchman who he had locked in his jewelry shop. Arno is also killed on the spot, quite a shocking outcome. I felt throughout the film Howard would end up dead, but I figured it would be via suicide to avoid the loan sharks. This again reminded me of A Star is Born, Bradley Cooper's character struggled throughout and I kept feeling like he would die. Julia, assumingly, makes off with over a million dollars, Dinah never realizes the whole impact of Howard's gambling, no conclusions are apparent, I hate when movies do this.Throughout the film's entirety the noise, soundtrack, levels of sound were overwhelming at points. This added to the chaos and confusion. Toward the beginning, we can't even follow the dialogue because the layers of noise were so distracting. The film using sound to keep the chaos moving forward, nightclub scenes, raised levels of sound (seemingly random), and so much yelling (and cursing). I found it distracting and annoying. Overall, I wish I would have never watched this movie.",Uncut Gems

The talking between any characters are so loud and annoying. The background music is so wired and chaos!",Uncut Gems

2411,BugsyMalone-1,Did I Miss Something?!,1,2 February 2020,"With a rating of 7.9 on here, I expected this to be really good. I'm sorry but after an hour, I couldn't handle the shouting anymore and turned it off.This script is a mess from the start to the middle, of you watched it all, let me know how the other half was.I'm a huge Adam Sandler fan and I was excited to see him in a role like this. But all he does is yell!",Uncut Gems
2412,igrodroch,A waste of time,2,15 February 2020,"I'm sorry but this is a bad movie, the type of movie you would never watch again. I have nothing against Adam Sandler, but he has several bad films, including one that has another annoying character, Punch-drunk love.
I respect the 10 stars reviews, I understand that Sandler acting is good, but for most people this is not the idea of a good movie.",Uncut Gems
2413,getghost,A Solid Film,7,23 December 2019,I don't understand why there are such bad reviews for this film. I will say that I had higher expectations for Adam Sandler's character but his performance was great. There are many frantic scenes but they work. I found myself slightly anxious at times; This only speaks to it's effectiveness. I connected with the main character and was rooting for him the whole way.,Uncut Gems
2414,mihamull,Panic and Yelling,6,11 October 2021,"All the time!!! Panic here panic there, panic music, screaming, cross-talking (yelling, again)... No scene after 20min of movie got me going or surprised me or whatever. Yelling in every second of the movie. Horrible. Sandlers Act was great, just the movie itself could be great due the story is gambler alike great. Anyways, he finally shuts up, when he is shot in the head. Omg was i relived. No more yelling, no more panic. I don't go to church, but thank you god for this action. No more movies for me tonight, i cant handle even one loud voice anymore.",Uncut Gems

2416,misskitty-63274,Save your money,1,29 December 2019,"One of the worst movie I've seen in my 76 years!! If they didn't use the ""f"" word it would be a silent movie.
I would have walked out but I went with another couple

2417,adytj,Don't waste your time or money,1,2 January 2020,"This film is basically just people yelling over each other the entire time. I thought about leaving midway through, multiple times, but with all the positive reviews I figured there would be something worth staying for. Wrong. Trash movie all around.",Uncut Gems
2418,frye-09534,Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen,1,6 January 2020,"The movie made absolutely no sense whatsoever. There was no flow to the movie, just random events happening that had no impact on the movie at all. Would have rather watched paint dry. It would have been cheaper.",Uncut Gems
2419,deletia6,"Spoilers: this movie is awful, don't see it",1,29 December 2019,"SPOILERS! I spent 2 hours anxious for a character I didn't like, and when I was finally rooting for him to win his final big bet they unceremoniously kill him. I don't know what purpose that served other than needless ""angst"". Try a little less hard to be ""gritty"" and tell an interesting story.",Uncut Gems
2420,georgemcaree,Great pace but lacked pay off,6,6 February 2020,"From the get go, this film told you that it was going to be taking you on a journey. The first scene literally brings us through the colon of the main character.Once we have emerged from the aforementioned bowel, we are immediately immersed into the fast paced and seemingly haphazard life of the main character Howard.Let go of all of your Sandler -comedy- misconceptions; this is not a comedy. Rather, you spend the majority of the film watching the so-called protagonist engage in a series of ever-escalating bets that will leave even the most virgin of wagerers on tenterhooks.The pace is of this film is extreme and unfortunately lacks pay off at the end. The tone seems to build from the first scene, but I was disappointed with how it ended.It is unfortunate that the film lacks grounding in reality (for me). I loved the cinematography and the soundtrack is awesome (if a little out of place).I can only assume that this film is designed to serve as an allegory of gambling and the blind faith of addiction. Unfortunately, I would prefer the message to be less obvious.",Uncut Gems
2421,Mrpaulbuzz,Don't waste your time,1,29 March 2021,Watched the first 25 minutes and its 25 minutes I won't get back. One time I wish I had read reviews beforehand so I didn't have to listen to the 25 minutes of rubbish but at least I didn't suffer the rest. Not sure what people are seeing that I'm not for this to be rated over 7.,Uncut Gems
2422,nico0-1,"Well, that's a first...",1,3 February 2020,"First time of my life, I can't finish a movie because it's so loud, so noisy that I could not bear it.Every single line of dialogue is shouted. All scenes are just people shouting at each other and shouting at the same time.I was really attracted by the catchy trailer but the movie is just ... I have no words to describe what I just saw.",Uncut Gems
2423,aerebs,"Over rated because Jewish, no disrespect",1,12 April 2020,Not worth the number of reviews which suggests it was watched because of hype that only Jewish or Italian movies recieve,Uncut Gems
2424,anthonymwoodsculptor,A cluster f@*k,1,29 May 2020,This ranks in the top 5 worst sandler films of all time. So messy and trashy. Terrible dialogue and acting samdler is going down hill more and more by the second. Stick to B comedy's dude.,Uncut Gems
2425,simon-66751,Bad music,6,8 May 2020,"The movie/storie was good, but the music give me headache.",Uncut Gems
2426,zscottoakland,Stellar Evocation of Time & Place in Culture & Style,8,12 January 2020,"Adam Sandler leads this cast in pinpointing even the most minute details & distinct mannerisms unique to this story and its characters, that moviegoers, particularly those raised in the Tri-State area in the 80's-90's, will no-doubt find themselves lost in this film as if the characters were somehow truly friends of their actual friends. Nailing the particularities and distinct idiosyncrasies of these people without any support of oft-used parodic caricatures, coupled with gracefully weaving in a heavy pop culture storyline without being gratuitous, was masterful and made this a joy to watch. Given that the story itself was so well-written, this film lives up to all the hype- if Spike Lee, Guy Ritchie & David Fincher together spawned a writer/director, this is the film he would have wished he made himself. What a way to start the 2020 movie year; everyone crushed their roles, but Adam Sandler really stepped up to the plate to hit a homer at Yankee Stadium.",Uncut Gems
2427,veteremartin,Constant noise.,1,28 March 2020,This was pure BS. I do not recommend this at all. I think I've wasted my time here. 135 of nothing but noise and non understandable dialogues with a stupid ending.,Uncut Gems
2428,thatnicozanotti,A masterclass in filmmaking,10,14 February 2020,"Uncut Gems is a masterpiece. The score, the direction, and Adam Sandlers Beautiful performance make this movie easily one of 2019's best films. The Safdie brothers create a world that is purely inhabited by high stress and anxiety inducing situations that you can't help but sit through to see what'll happen next. The central character Howard, is extremely charismatic and you just want to see him get out of the hole that he is in. In any other movie I would hate this character, but Sandlers performance makes it almost impossible to look away from the screen. The way every scene is directed is exemplary. The music and chaotic conversations overlapping each other make almost every scene force me on the edge of my seat .The Safdies really showed their talents in this movie and I can't wait to see what they do next.",Uncut Gems
