0,SnoopyStyle,restart and too long,4,7 January 2021,"In 1995, four western friends are hiking in the mountains of Bhutan. Paul falls down a crevice and becomes entranced by a mysterious shrine and a whistle. In 2018, former undercover police detective James Lasombra investigates the disappearance of his friend's daughter. A message ""The Empty Man made me do it"" is left in her bathroom.There is a really fun fifteen minutes of horror to start the movie. Then it goes to a different story with different characters in a different time. It's a stop and restart which doesn't do anything for the pacing. The restart is an ok story for a little while but it goes on for two hours. At some point with the restart and the long running time, the story loses tension and the movie stalls out somewhere after the suicides. Lasombra needs the introduction section to set up his character and the story. Even though I like the start, it may have to be cut and it still needs more trimming to cut down the running time.",The Empty Man
1,kosmasp,Hollow man,9,28 July 2021,"How do you like your horror? Want a jump scare every other minute? Well you may want to either try to adapt to this or not watch it at all. Yes it does have jump scares too, but it lives off the scary and creepy crawling up to you - no pun intended.On the other hand anyone who is into horror movies that give you the mood, that give you more than just a quick fix (again no pun intended) - you will more than cherish this. The intro ... quite a long one, but considering the length of the movie it is more than ok - is a short movie of its own. And it seems detached from the rest of the movie. It just seems that way though. Let's just say that if someone told me not to touch them, if I valued my life (I'm paraphrasing), I would listen to them.But and that is important here, there are no big moments where I question the actions of the characters taken ... the sane ones that is. On the other hand, who am I to judge who is sane and who isn't. And what actually is happening ... there is quite more than meets the eye (again no pun intended). There are some very violent scenes in here ... but they are spikes, because this does not live off that, but through the setting, the acting and the story it does tell. And the beautiful cinematography combined with an exceptional sound design.One of the best movies of 2020 - which does not mean you will love it. It's still a taste thing - but artistically speaking ... wow! And while I rewatched certain scenes (a conversation at the beginning - well beginning after that lengthy intro - makes much more sense the second time around for example), there are still so many unanswered questions ... which you may love or hate - it's up to you.",The Empty Man
2,classicsoncall,"""There is only the great binding nothingness of things.""",8,19 July 2021,"The story line in ""The Empty Man"" is constantly compelling and will keep you in it's grip, only to end with an unsatisfying question mark as the film's protagonist, James Lasombra (James Badge Dale), is faced with the horrific possibility that he's not real, and that his very being was summoned into existence by an occult force. That idea will have you question how the ex-cop could have possibly had a former life with a wife and child who died in a tragic auto accident, while at the same time, he was carrying on an affair with the mother of a teenage girl that he's now searching for since she went missing. The concept of the 'Empty Man' plays out over a three day time span, just as the opening twenty minute segment did featuring a quartet of hikers in Bhutan twenty three years earlier, who all fell victim to an unexplained curse. The skeletal remains of a creature in that underground cave had the look of a vampire, and might give one a false impression of where the story is going. As if to capitalize on the non-corporeal aspect of the entity terrorizing the small town of Webster Mills, Missouri in general, and Lasombra in particular, you have that sequence at the Pontifex Institute where it's mentor (Stephen Root) expounds gibberish that's meant to sound philosophically engaging. It gives the entire search for the missing Amanda Quail (Sasha Frolova) an aura of supernatural mystery, which is only compounded when she's eventually found by the determined investigator. It was unclear upon a first viewing what if any connection there might have been between the opening segment and the much longer mystery dedicated to the Empty Man, and I'm uncertain whether another watch would clear that up. In case it does, I'll get back to you.",The Empty Man
3,michaelRokeefe,A compounded confusing plot,2,18 February 2021,"A chiller like this is a lot easier to enjoy when sticking to one subject. Based on a graphic novel; James Lasombra, an ex-cop, is investigating a missing person case when he stumbles on a wide spread cult with intent on summoning a supernatural entity. Not exactly hard to get into, but sure is easy to get confused in what you're watching.",The Empty Man
4,AlsExGal,Chris Stuckmann brought me here...,9,24 July 2021,"... and I'd like to thank him. I would have never looked for it on HBO Max and I would have never stuck with it for the 2 1/2 hour running time if he hadn't reviewed it on his youtube channel as being something worth watching. If a Blu came out of it I would definitely buy it, but I would be so disappointed if there was not a commentary. If you go to Chris' review about this film there is a link to an interview with the filmmaker.So this thing is almost a miracle. It was the last thing that Fox did before they were absorbed into Disney like the blob. As Chris points out, there's lots of money up there on the screen. In a global pandemic year a large studio gave a first time filmmaker a bunch of money and said ""go make your vision"". Disney would have never allowed this to be made because there are no light sabers in it. But I digress.So Empty Man has a 25 minute prologue set in 1995 which is horrific enough that seemingly has nothing to do with the other 2 hours of the film and that just suddenly ends. The two hour part of the film after the prologue is set in Missouri in 2018 and the action is set in motion by a teenage girl going missing. Ex detective James LaSombra is a friend of the girl's mother, and so he goes looking for her after he and her mother determine the police will probably do nothing.He encounters what appears to be a religious cult, and suicides by teens who were not depressed or in trouble with the words about The Empty Man written nearby.This is almost a silent film. The dialogue is minimalist. And if you are looking for all of the answers of what transpired you are not going to get them. It is beautifully shot and does a great job of building tension. And don't think that some of the dialogue is cartoonish as others have said. For example, LaSombra keeps saying to the strange people he encounters that he gets it, that he is from San Francisco. It makes sense that somebody who is nervous and having their concept of reality challenged would revert to something that grounds them - like saying where they are from.I would highly recommend this one, just realize you are probably going to need to watch it twice to pick up on everything. I think this thing is headed towards cult classic territory.",The Empty Man
5,deloudelouvain,"Good sound, building the suspense in a refreshing horror movie.",7,11 March 2021,"I did enjoy The Empty Man for several reasons. First of all I never get ""scared"" by a horror movie, so for me to enjoy it is to see my wife being scared, which I find entertaining and funny. She got scared with this movie, and that's mostly due to the excellent soundtrack and effects, that made this movie suspenseful. Visually it was pretty basic but like said before the sound, which is always very important, if not the most important thing for a horror movie, was on top. The acting wasn't bad and that from the whole cast. The plot was something new, not a frequent subject in the horror genre, so that was refreshing. Overal The Empty Man is certainly worth a watch, if you like the ""strange"" then evenmore.",The Empty Man
6,FeastMode,i'm conflicted,6,24 July 2021,"I was debating between an okay 5 and a positive 6. I tentatively give it a 6 because i want to watch it again.I'm very conflicted. So much about this movie is great. The opening scene is fantastic. The tone is chilling. It's atmospheric. Lots of interesting images. Some really scary moments, some omg wtf moments. But i had two major issues with the movie, which are spoilery. (1 viewing, 7/22/2021)SPOILERSi was completely into the movie, but it started to lose me about 70% of the way through, they delved into the cult ideology and i wasn't really buying it. I know it's based on nihilism, still sounds like madness to me. And it seemed to slow down the build-up.The other is what's making me so conflicted. Some of my favorite parts of the movie have to do with the main character and his backstory. Then we find out it was fabricated. So it didn't actually happen. And part me me feels like it makes those parts i loved almost meaningless.They even have more reveals of his backstory after we find this out. It still gave me the feels so i still give it credit. But i kinda feel jipped. Altho after watching some analysis videos, i wonder if i can grasp onto the idea that it still is ""real"" since they conjured it up using their noosphere gibberish. As well as the fact that the needed him to have a history of grief and guilt.Lots of interesting concepts and things to think about. Hopefully i can like it more the second time.",The Empty Man
7,Cineanalyst,Lovecraftian Relativism,8,27 August 2021,"""The Empty Man"" is far more intriguing--ambiguous and complex, witty, and on the surface also a serviceable genre picture--than the other semi-horror movie that conflated post-nihilistic existential dread with contagion that I've seen from the pandemic year of 2020, ""She Dies Tomorrow."" Both pictures clue the spectator in on what their characters are blathering about by referencing a specific 20th-century French philosopher. In ""She Dies Tomorrow,"" it was absurdist Albert Camus; here, it's deconstructivist Jacques Derrida, whose name is prominently displayed in one shot as also that of a Missouri high school. This philosophical virus, bizarrely enough, spreads out into a relativistic New Age cult (as preached to by Stephen Root, who played a similarly menacing genial role in ""Get Out"" (2017)), and before that there's a 20-some-minutes tour-de-force of an overture in Buddhist Bhutan.It doesn't take much paying attention in Philosophy and Religion 101 or a bit of web searching to see a connection between nihilism and relativism and Buddha and Nagarjuna, and the camera here significantly lingers on a group of bhikkhus much in the same way as later on it does with Jacques Derrida High School. In both the Himalayas and the American Heartland, we have characters figuratively and literally crossing bridges in search of truth. (Also, ""pont,"" as in the Pontifex Institute, is Latin for bridge, and ""pontifex"" refers to Roman priests.) Doing so in Bhutan, a character falls into the abyss, or void--nothingness manifested, the unfathomable primordial chaos, a black canvas, the empty man--and is found in a cave, which again is both literally such and figuratively so--in this case, to get back to Western thought, Plato's Cave, where the Platonic ideal, the underlying truth, takes the form of a tulpa. My favorite visual pun, though, is that what characters are searching for is literally found at the bottom of a bottle, which they blow into to summon the eponymous Empty Man. (Good soundscape overall in this one, too, by the way.)I also like how smoothly these philosophical endeavors fit within genre conventions. In Bhutan, we get the usual young-adult couples secluded in the wilderness. Cabin in the Mountains instead of the Woods. With the Midwestern teenagers, it's an urban-legend teen-and-boogeyman thriller, which is how the trailer (rather unsuccessfully) sold the movie. Then, there's the noir-style private investigator of an ex-cop getting in over his head. It rains, as it tends to do in noir to purify the hero, and he also receives the genre trope of a figurative wake-up call of the cult's whispered chanting (another character receives this while actually sleeping), plus smoking and drinking. Noir is rather akin to horror in some ways--similar to giallo--both with their mysterious, oppressive fates. First-time feature writer-director (although with experience chronicling and working on others' features, including those of David Fincher) David Prior evidently knowns his genres and subgenres and their clichés, their repetitions--we even get a bit of a slasher here with the only scene of gratuitous nudity; body horror as the infectious philosophizing at one point takes the shape of some black gunk vomited into another's mouth; and there's even a bit of Japanese, ""The Ring"" franchise style horror with the VHS tape of a film-within-the-film (with a metanarrative script in a folder, to boot) threatening to leap out to kill the characters.Before escalating into some ""Mullholland Dr."" (2001) type twists, bringing it all together is the ""un-indictable"" cosmos of the Lovecraftian fear of the unknown--perhaps the most relativistic subgenre out there. And, the bottles may be the funniest pun here (to me, at least), but the cleverest might be of the other sort of theory of relativity that makes for the illusion of time and the consequent doubles. Apt for a movie that warns of the dangers of what could be its own definition, of transmitted and received communication. A disease carrier and a carrier signal. A pandemic narrative released when the real narrative is a pandemic. That plays with genre deconstruction while its narrative panics over the implications of that of Derrida's poststructuralism. A film about a cult that is (in part credited to Letterboxd) gaining a cult following.That's my attempt to deconstruct the text, anyways; right or wrong, what's the difference, and isn't that unknowable, or is that even my interpretation and not just one I received. Am I The Empty Man... aren't we all, or did we just discover, conjure, become, or become infected by it....",The Empty Man
8,UniqueParticle,Very effective horror/mystery,9,18 July 2021,"Love the top reviewer that person is so right in every aspect! The sound design is addictive, horror elements are top notch, and story is a million times more enjoyable than I would've ever thought. Youngers involved are intriguing characters that don't let me down. Concept reminds me of Candyman and Slenderman just less iconic.

9,paulclaassen,"Bloody hell, I loved this!!",7,31 May 2021,"The film starts off with four hikers in the mountains, in 1995. These first few minutes are freaky, to say the least!We then jump to 2018, with new characters. The film remained creepy and eerie throughout, and also very mysterious. It is said that, if you find an empty bottle on a bridge at night and blows into it, and think about the Empty Man, you will hear him coming for you. On the first night you hear him. On the second night you see him coming for you. On the third night he finds you. Yeah, I know, sounds a bit like Candy Man who comes for you when you calls his name three times whilst looking into a mirror.'The Empty Man' is unlike anything you've seen. Ex-cop James Lasombra (played by the incredibly handsome James Badge Dale) searches for clues when his neighbor and very close friend's daughter, Amanda, disappears - together with a few of her other friends. He discovers they played the Empty Man game, and now investigates the legend and rumors behind the Empty Man - while at the same time fighting his own inner demons.His investigation takes him - and the viewer - on a scary roller coaster ride of thrills and chills. There is also so much emotion in this film. The acting from the seasoned cast is very good. James Badge Dale in particular was fantastic. He owns every scene he is in. On top of it, he is so dashing, its a pleasure just sitting there watching him. Just saying...'The Empty Man' has an incredible amount of detail. This is a horror film with substance. Some scenes will have you jolt in your seat, some scenes will give you Goosebumps all over, and some scenes are sure to scare the living daylights out of you! It is so well made, this is an instant classic. The film has a constant foreboding, unpredictable atmosphere. The cinematography is excellent, and the photography is also very good. I absolutely loved this film. The ending might be a bit confusing and I must confess I don't understand everything (yet), but no doubt I'll be watching this again!Would I watch it again? Yes, for sure.",The Empty Man
10,cruise01,Promising start but falls quickly in the last few mins.,5,14 January 2021,2.5 out of 5 stars.The Empty Man is a eh supernatural horror thriller film that is too long. Long stretches of nothing. And has some decent creepy weird moments. But definitely a forgettable horror film.The plot is about a former detective James (James Badge Dale) who starts investigating after a few mysterious teenagers have been found dead. They have been trying to summon the empty man. A supernatural figure that they blow into a bottle and try to think of him.The plot is decent. But it is a concept that has been done in every mysterious supernatural horror movie without giving much details. Trying to summon a figure. The main character encounters the three days of horror. And the final scene i guess we can all predict what happens then. It does play with the cult idea as many followers are more scary than the figure itself.It does have some creepy moments. With the figure showing up in a black shadow chasing the person. Or when the main character comes across a cult performing a ritual.James Badge Dale did a decent job with his role. Playing a detective who has a traumatic past. And filled with regret. The rest of the cast is forgettable.The film does lack thrills and scares. Especially for a running time of 2 hours and 10 or so minutes. The film has long stretches of nothing. Having James investigate the empty man and interviewing people who may have known about the cult. It does get a little boring before it gets to the point. The final few minutes is weird. And mind bending. But falls terrible with its direction and script. Character making dumb decisions. And everything just falls apart after that.,The Empty Man
11,eddie_baggins,"Ladies and gentleman, your new cult horror film is here!",6,6 May 2021,"Filmed all the way back in 2017 and unceremoniously dumped into cinemas late in 2020 in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic by its new studio Disney (released under the now defunct 20th Century Fox brand), initial critical and commercial failure The Empty Man has started to build itself a readily growing reputation as a new cult-film in waiting as David Prior's horror/thriller hybrid refuses to be easily pinned down into a quantifiable genre or experience.Adapted from the little known graphic novel of the same name, Empty sees debut feature director Prior take his leading man James Badge Dale on a strange journey as his ex-cop turned security firm owner James Lasombra gets caught up in a mysterious case involving his missing teenage neighbour Amanda who appears to be caught up with a shady organisation that is not the type of place you'd like to wondering into on a rainy day.Where an extended prologue in Bhutan, a collection of creepy VHS recordings, a grisly multiple suicide and a hamming it right up Stephen Root come into play is best left to be discovered by unsuspecting audiences with Empty constantly moving in various directions across its epic two hour plus runtime, creating an experience that is unlike anything you're likely to recall seeing and a large reason why this at first instance misunderstand oddity is likely to live out a long and prosperous life in the cult circuit.Garnering terrible test screening results and scaring its studio into abandoning it's release support, it's not hard too see why a film of this unique nature didn't quite stand a chance out there in the public realm, only a handful of critics sung its praises late last year and audiences weren't shouting its virtues from the rooftops but the films flaws (of which there are many) and strange/half explained moments are part of what make this experience so memorable and far more long lasting in nature than many other similar hybrids.Throughout this almost impossible to explain journey is a committed James Badge Dale performance, one that allows the one time Jurassic Park visitor a rare chance to play leading man and when combined with Prior's often energetic and inventive directing choices, Empty does feel like more than just another B-movie with a few cult fans and while its legacy is still unpredictable this early on, its likely this film will be spoken about and analysed for a significant period of cinematic life.Final Say -A flaw-filled, bonkers and utterly unique experience that deserves its detractors and supporters in equal measure, The Empty Man is an odd beast that stands out from the crowd and while it is by no means a masterpiece, there's a lot here to like and an abundance of elements for audiences to investigate further as its cult reputation grows now and well into the future.3 teddy bears out of 5.",The Empty Man

14,jtindahouse,A beautifully shot film that was nothing like the type of movie I expected going in,6,2 November 2020,"When I saw that 'The Empty Man' was going to be 137 minutes long it had a little reluctant to go to it. The reason is that if a horror movie isn't good then even a 90 minute runtime can be an absolute drag. It's a real gamble for a film in that genre to be anywhere near two hours, let alone well past it. I usually try to avoid trailers for movies before I see them but on this occasion I did happen to catch it. It didn't fill me with confidence. Luckily the trailer is actually a little misleading, and the film actually has quite a different feel to it. Even though I wouldn't say I loved this movie by any means, it did have enough going on to keep it watchable for that runtime - just.The first thing I have to say is that the film is beautifully shot. There were a number of expertly crafted shots throughout the film, but one tracking shot from a map that turns into a forest and then finds its way down to a car driving through it was truly exquisite. I love that the artistic touches Ari Aster fills his films with are starting to inspire other directors.The second thing that occurs to me is that isn't really a horror movie, or at least not solely a horror movie. Apparently it is based on a comic series which are more like dark detective stories. That's kind of the vibe I got here and why I think this was able to survive a 137 minute push. It isn't just a case of passing from character to character and watching a new and inventive way for them to die. In fact the film is very rarely scary. I say that more in the sense that it doesn't actually try to be scary all that often, however when it does try it rarely hits the mark either sadly.If you're a fan of ASMR then you are likely going to have a good time with this film. There is a lot of it in the film and it is a pleasure to listen to (although it can be a risk to have you dozing off). I have a very middling opinion on this film. I neither hated it nor loved it. I wouldn't recommend people go out of their way to see it, but if they were going to see it I certainly wouldn't dissuade them either. Don't be too put off by the trailer is all I would say. It is not an accurate representation of the film.",The Empty Man
15,stevendbeard,Interesting Story,7,24 October 2020,"I saw ""The Empty Man"", starring James Badge Dale-The Lone Ranger_2013, World War Z; Marin Ireland-The Umbrella Academy_tv, Hell or High Water; Sasha Frolova-Little Women_2019, Red Sparrow and Stephen Root-Barry_tv, The Lone Ranger_2013.
This is a supernatural horror movie-from reading the end credits, I discovered that it was made in 2018-that is based on a comic book by Cullen Bunn & Vanesa R. Del Rey and published by Boom Studios. I have never read the books but the story was interesting. It starts in 1995 with some hikers in the Himalayas that have a tragic accident where only one of them survives and then the story jumps to 2018-when the movie was made-and a teenaged girl has gone missing. Sasha is the girl and Marin is her mother that calls on her friend, James-a former police officer-to try and find Sasha. James learns about a game the local teens played, which involved blowing into an empty bottle on a bridge-you know, making the whistling sound-and saying 'The Empty Man' over and over. It's a variation on the Candy Man movie with the bottle blowing thrown in for good measure. After you blow into the bottle and say his name, you will actually hear the Empty Man. Then, you will see him on the second day and on the third day, he finds you and ....well, you don't want him to find you. The investigation leads James to a cultish organization where the local recruitment office is run by Stephen and you also find out what happened to the surviving hiker-from the beginning of the movie.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, disturbing images, language and sexual content-including nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 17 minutes.
I would probably buy it on DVD-it would be a good Halloween watch.",The Empty Man

19,kluseba,Three movies for the price of one,8,16 November 2020,"The Empty Man is a horror movie with an extensive length justified by some surprising genre, mood and plot shifts.The opening sequence feels like an atmospheric horror movie set in the ice and snow. It shows how a group of four friends accidentally discovers a cave with a strange extraterrestrial skeleton. One of the two men gets possessed by the mysterious skeleton and starts to behave awkwardly. He whispers words in an unknown language into his friends' ears, leaves the cabin to sit in the ice and snow and slowly drives everyone around him anxious, confused and unstable.The film then shifts to the tale of an urban legend as a group of teenagers in Saint Louis attempt to contact a supernatural entity. These teenagers soon see things only they can see, get followed by the menacing entity they have called and ultimately have to fight for survival.The last part of the movie shows a former cop who has lost his wife and son in a car accident while sleeping with another woman. He investigates the sudden disappearance of his lover's daughter. He soon finds out that she has joined a mysterious cult. As his investigation progresses, the desperate man faces mysteries and dangers that might be much more personal and intense than he would have initially anticipated.All three parts of the movie convince with spooky atmosphere, very good acting performances and several unexpected plot twists leading to a stunning finale. The major downside of the film is that the three parts are so different that they don't really fit together and feel more like an anthology. The scriptwriters could have created three entirely different movies and it would have been particularly interesting to explore the opening sequence in greater detail.Some people have criticized the movie for its lack of coherence and its extensive length but the creative script and addicting atmosphere compensate for those flaws. This movie is one of the better contemporary horror films because it's neither predictable nor moralizing. Many horror movies these days either rehash old ideas or try to teach a lesson. The Empty Man is like a horror movie should really be because it's creepy, mysterious and surprising. If you like horror films with conventional styles but some creative twists, then give the underrated and overlooked The Empty Man a fair chance.",The Empty Man

In the pre-credits sequence we see hikers in Bhutan who come across a huge skeleton in a cave (a Yeti?) , one of them is possessed and gets the others to kill each other. There is also an Occult Society whose outer face resembles the Scientologists but has darker aspects. A disturbing film with scenes of mass suicide, slasher style killings and eerily, a mob of cultists in pursuit of an ex-cop who is investigating the girl's disappearance. A crowd of cultists dancing around a fire and then turning in lockstep to chase an intended victim through Mark Twain National Forest is a sight to behold. You also get Tulpas and some interesting plot twists. A good horror/mystery thriller which would have worked better if perhaps 30 minutes had been shaved from it's 137 minute running time.

21,aidanratesmovies,"Destined to be a cult classic, The Empty Man is easily the best horror film of the year",10,30 October 2020,"Films like this is the reason why I miss 20th Century Fox. Sure, they have had their handful of duds in the past, but no company has ever truly been there to give great films a chance like them, and The Empty Man shows that even up till its fatal end (by the hand of Disney) it still accomplished just that. I LOVED this film. Granted, you may see familiar elements in this film in other horror flicks, but it plays on those tropes in such an interesting and unexpected way, that I couldn't help but praise it for its originality. This isn't like any horror film before, I assure you, nor is it the film the trailers led you to believe it was. What this film is, is not a stereotypical, cliche filled nightmare that we see all too often today, but a brilliant psychological horror with flair to spare. It contains some great performances, some excellent writing, and some of the best cinematography I have seen all year. James Badge Dale proves to be a fun and charismatic lead to follow, and Joel Courtney, Marin Ireland, and Stephen Root provide stunning supporting performances as well. Surprisingly there isn't much music to really comment on, but needless to say the atmosphere is chilling, and the sound used throughout is honestly terrific. I usually don't care for things in film like sound, but something about the way the film looked, acted, and sounded just makes it feel so incredibly grounded that I couldn't help but awe at every moment it was on screen. It can be a bit of a slow burn, but the film always remains interesting, and provides a rather compelling and clever mystery to follow. It may not be what you expected and it may not be for everyone, but The Empty Man is easily one of the best horror flicks I have seen in some time, as well as one of the best films in general of the year.

23,lambiepie-2,A Horror Film wIth a Lot of Potential,4,18 July 2021,"The Empty Man had great potential. The opening scene before the credits was great. Then there was about two hours of getting it all together that I believe they could have cut down to about an hour. And then the last 5 minutes. I had a hard time connecting the opening to the bulk of the film (as it seemed to want to go one way, then another and another...), but it really felt like something was supposed to be there and they just were not getting to it - in an engrossing, frightening kinda way.",The Empty Man
24,gedikreverdi,An A24-arthouse-horror-wannabe-Candyman-rip-off with a protagonist that cannot act and horribly bad CGI,4,25 March 2021,"It doesn't come across as an art house horror from A24 when you try this hard to be smart and complicated. I've never watched a movie that tries this hard to sound smart. It started very promising with tourists hiking up in the mountains of Bhutan and they snowed in a cabin after one of their friends fell into a crack and rescued by his friends but something was off about him after he sat in front of a humanoid skeleton in the crevice, he became hypnotic. His girlfriend killed the other couple and jumped off of the cliff. He then became the transmitter to the cult members of the institute. And it Cut to an American where where a bunch of kids summoned the empty man on a bridge and they were found dead hanged under the bridge except for one whom I didn't care at all because we barely learnt about her nor did we see her. The only good thing was when he watched members running in circles around a huge bonfire that assumed the shape of the empty man and then everything went black, they noticed him and chased him frantically. He learnt that he's the new transmitter possessed by the empty man because he's so grieving for his late wife and son who died while he's cheating on her. He shot dead the hypnotized Bhutan transmitter that had been in the intensive care for decades and everyone bowed down in front of him like they bowed down in front of the former transmitter. Less is more. With so much background story, explanation after explanation along with philosophical excerpts sprinkled on, the film became such a mess.",The Empty Man
25,IonicBreezeMachine,Not the trainwreck you've been lead to believe.,8,29 March 2021,"James Lasombra (James Badge Dale) is a former cop mourning the death of his wife and son. When Amanda Quail (Sasha Frolova) daughter of friend Nora Quail (Marin Ireland) winds up missing leaving behind only the cryptic message ""The Empty Man made me do it"" Lasombra volunteers to help Nora find Amanda. As Lasombra digs deeper, his investigation brings him to the edge of sanity as the nature of real versus unreal is challenged by an enigmatic cult tied to the equally mysterious Empty Man.Loosely based on the 2014 Boom! Comic book miniseries of the same name, The Empty Man marks the feature film debut of David Prior, better known as a documentarian for various Peter Weir, David FIncher, and Ridley Scott films. Prior merged elements of the comic with an unproduced screenplay which resulted in the finished proeduct. The movie although speculated to be held up by the Disney/Fox merger was actually held up by post production problems including terrible test screenings. A situation involving south African tax rebates, and loss of studio faith in the project. When the film limped out into whatever drive-ins/cinemas were still open during the COVD pandemic, the movie didn't receive great feedback with many unfavorably lumping the film together with horror duds like Slender Man, Bye Bye Man, Boogeyman, and Darkness Falls. And yet with all that baggage associated with the movie, The Empty Man may be one of the finest occult detective/Lovecraftian horror stories EVER released by a major studio outside of John Carpenter's At the Mouth of Madness.From its 22 minute cold open that feels like a little minimovie in and of itself, to an investigation that takes us through dark, twisted, corridors that simultaneously lead nowhere and everywhere, it's clear that Prior has his sights set on a film of grandiose ambition. There are some absolutely amazing shots in this movie that give a good sense of scale to the vastness of oblivion that James Lasombra faces off against. From faceless hoards, to shadows in the night, to laughing lunatics who delight in his inability to comprehend the forces he's up against it's an absolutely amazing experience for those who happen to like this kind of procedural descent into insanity.The movie does have a few spots of drag here and there that probably could've helped pacing wise, and the fact that the movie is more investigative than a straight up horror story will definitely mean the film is not to everyone's taste. But the movie's avoidance of jump scares and its reliance more on creating an atmosphere of dread and helplessness is a factor that will win over many horror fans.The Empty Man isn't perfect, but it's an well told and well made occult detective horror story that isn't afraid to play itself against audience expectations. It's not surprising how the film did poorly in both test screenings and cinemas because it's not a mass market audience horror film like something from James Wan or Blumhouse. It's only thankful that the movie wasn't cut to ribbons like Paul W. S. Anderson's Event Horizon was so it could be appreciated as intended. While I can't guarantee you'll like The Empty Man, I can at least guarantee you've rarely, if ever, seen anything like it.",The Empty Man

28,abisio,EMPTY MOVIE,5,26 October 2020,"Let's go with the good parts first. Acting is very good and satisfying. Cinematography the same. The first 15 minutes on the mountain are really interesting and suspenseful.
The former cop story looking for a neighbour's daughter starts very good. Suddenly after the SPA scene, the starts making no sense at all.
This is not an psycho killer, entity or possession movie; in fact by the ends try to be somewhat Lovecraftian.
Now with the bad. The movie is too long and feels even longer. The script does not seems to decide where to head the movie; by the end the different concepts get mixed but not properly tied up so basically many things has nothing to do with overall plot.
Without spoiling too much; most of the ideas came from ANGEL HEART, THE SECT or many other better, where the main character is more involved than he thinks.
In brief; is not too boring but is really long and the mystery and final twist is not that surprising",The Empty Man
29,Sir_AmirSyarif,A very strong debut from David Prior,7,1 August 2021,"Although the movie probably runs a little too long and occasionally suffers from confusing editing, but David Prior's 'The Empty Man' is a carefully-crafted horror that will get inside your head and mess it up. It is broad in its scope and ambitious in its goals, but Prior has both vision and talent to pull it off. A very strong debut.",The Empty Man

Less experienced horror fans might enjoy it, average viewers will find it boring.It's long and very predictable. The main character is just running in circles, and just as in Kill List (2011) you know that nothing he does actually matters.It's this basic type of story when everyone is a cultist besides our main hero. Everything is pointless. Everything was planned and predestined from the start.And since it's just over 2 hours it feels like a waste of time. Most of the investigation scenes are just there to give you an exposition on what is going on. The ending isn't really an ending in terms of the story, just a milestone.The film itself is done well, the production (besides some weird CGI), the acting, most of the things were ok. It's just the story itself, repetitive, uninteresting, and pointless.",The Empty Man
31,Movi3DO,Pretty creepy story,7,18 August 2021,"Me when I'm hungry: I am the Empty Man.A horror back in 2020 that I didn't watch. The story about a bunch of kids trying to call up the legendary Empty Man.What I liked about the movie was the legend itself, which was original and not based on real-life folktales. This led to an interesting mystery and twist that did not reveal itself early. This movie got a 20-minute opening scene that was surprising and very creepy. That was probably the best part of the movie. After that, the background music created a creepy and mysterious atmosphere throughout that actually got me on edge couple of times.As for problems, first the runtime was definitely too long. The middle part of the story was dragging, and I would say 15-20 minutes could be trimmed off. Then, I didn't like the acting from the main guy. He was nonchalant and should have more emotions.Overall, a creepy story about a made-up legend. 7.5/10.",The Empty Man
32,Neptune165,"I like the beginning, it is genuinely creepy",4,6 February 2021,The first 20 min was very solid. Shame. Right like the first part when they saw the bones i was like this is going to be scary but they wasted so much time not on the actual creature. I still think how the first guy in mountain go back to states. I really loved the scene with the cult members running around the fire and then chasing him. This movie definitely seemed to succeed much better at being a crime chase thriller rather than a horror weird-sci-fi type thing. I really felt that the mountain scene in the movie should have just been the whole movie and to be honest the first act the whole beginning of the 4 people in the mountains was so creepy and good but then they didn't know where to go from it and they just tried to connect all these other suggestions of what this movie probably originally wanted to be and they made a mess. It's pretty bad. Midway thru it just becomes an investigation movie and not even a good one. Did anyone actually care about finding the girl and her outcome? I didn't.,The Empty Man

34,SoumikBanerjee25,"Certainly Has its Demerits, But a Fascinating Take on Supernatural Nonetheless.",7,5 September 2021,"David Prior's 'The Empty Man' has built up from a strong and distinctive premise. With all the technological ingenuities on its side; I must admit that the film delivers! Well, for the most part; it certainly does. It might have had its fair share of demerits, but you couldn't argue with the principal approach it takes while typifying the very fundamentals of such an intriguing concept.Just so you know, It won't count in the list of conventional horror of modern times. In all honesty, I might as well refrain from calling it a Horror Feature. Instead, I should consider it as a 'Psychological Drama' that clearly employs some of the authoritative tropes of the Genre. And you can contemplate the same in its Cinematography, Art Direction, and across-the-board narrative structure. You could absolutely feel the atmosphere, the kind of eerie and unsettling vibe the makers were deliberately intending for!Now, the Screenplay might come across as cumbersome and elongated from time to time; nevertheless, it succeeded in grabbing onto our conscience. The perpetual air of uncertainty & dread will often make you nauseated. And before you even realize it, you would be unknowingly longing for more!",The Empty Man
35,RussHog,Very good indie horror film,7,28 July 2021,"This movie is not quite what it seems. It starts off and it seems like it is about a slasher monster who kills teenagers and unsuspecting hikers (and it sort of is) but as it goes on we follow a detective who investigates a cult that seems hell bent on summoning this being.

As a matter of fact, the beginning was quite original and not forced, but after that the movie took a lengthy, round about path. Visually appealing? Yes.High quality, genuine soundtrack? Yes.

But in the last hour things deteriorated, the story went completely overboard and turned into something of a Lovecraftian gothic thing. It was all way too much, and the overlong duration made it even worse, some prudent cutting and editing might have helped a lot.
All in all a disappointment.",The Empty Man
39,lareval,"Not perfect, but a gripping entertainment harshly treated by Disney",7,23 September 2021,"This is a complex film, not just because of its somber plot but because of its background too. While the movie has bits of movies way much better than this ('Angel Heart', for example), 'The Empty Man' stands on its own as a incredibly well shot and compelling entertainment that is really good and better than your average thriller. It's a risky, bold thriller with a big budget and backed by the creative freedom from late Fox studio. But the Disney merge add extra problems, zero marketing, worse Theatrical release and NO DVD/BLURAY RELEASE! A massively unfair movie-making studio experience that somehow survived the cutting floor and is gaining recognition in those who are lucky to see it like me. Its cult following is fair. A good movie that overcomes its flaws and faults to deliver a great, stylish Cinematic Experience.",The Empty Man

Firstly, almost half of the movie is extremely interesting and original. Acting and script and execution are almost perfect too. Secondly, I didn't like the strange turn on the script from half till the end. I think it was incoherent with a lot of plot holes. Last, it could have been far better with a more original and interesting ending/explanation. Not sure if the book is better, I'll give a try.

Let's add some Blair Witch forest scenes, cause they are popular now. Ok, lets finish with a cult horror and try to wrap this up.
David Prior wrote this and then ventured into his first directing job.
It seems as though there are a lot of new ventures approved with little to no experience and the entire industry is just putting out filler. This feels as though it needed to be proofread before getting the green light.
My only guess is that the executive only read the first 20 pages of the script before signing off.Ugh.",The Empty Man

They totally lost me with all the noncoherent sci-fi babble. Then again I didn't grow up in San Francisco. I will say It was shot well and had a few creepy scenes here and there.

'The Empty Man' is not one of them, but its title is spot-on - everything about this film is empty.Here, we see James Badge Dale as a retired cop who must solve the riddle of a spirit who seemingly takes the lives of anyone who blows on a bottle and says his name three times (what, Bloody Mary isn't good enough for these people?). The plot is creepy, sure, but as is usually the case with these cheap horror movies, the execution is flawed.There are a few scenes that will startle you, sure, but they are really random and do not build to anything of substance. It's also much longer than it should be, and that usually indicates that fat has not been trimmed from the plot (and guess what...this is the case here). The plot takes unnecessary detours and the payoff is not as shocking as it should be. As for the acting, no offense to Badge Dale but he's not exactly leading man material. The only other semi-recognizable star here is Marin Ireland, and her role is basically relegated to being a glorified cameo.It's no surprise that 'The Empty Man' was chronically delayed for years and finally dumped in theaters right before Halloween so 20th Century Fox could cut its losses.",The Empty Man

52,Med-Jasta,Finally a little ambition,8,11 August 2021,"The opening confused me because it went against everything I knew about the movie. It was good but went on for so long I thought that it was the whole movie. I actually almost gave up on it. Then one minute later I learned that I had only watched the opening sequence.What follows is very good and engaging. I was very sucked into it. The suspense scenes had my eyes glued to the screen. It was nice to see a movie that kinda just went at it's own pace. You don't see that much these days. They're either formula or going out of their way to be ""unique."" And with that you get unwatchably slow that hides behind the title of ""art."" This was where movies should be which is right in the middle.Now these things also prevented this from being a perfect movie. But I'd rather have the attempt then not. It was long and needed another trim. The opening didn't need to be that long. And the scene where the girl tells about what happened on the bridge also didn't need to be that long. I just looked it up and Disney (since they don't understand artistic integrity) released the movie before it was ready and the director intended to cut 6 minutes out.And I'm not entirely sure what happened at the end. Was he created the whole time? Did they infiltrate him at some point? Was he actually taken over and was he going to be the new leader? I'm not really sure. Usually with ambiguity I can piece it together after thinking about it. But here I'm only left to guess. I could have used a little more explanation. Not much but a little.James Badge Dale is really good and I was glad to see him in something good. He we what caught my eye at first. Also the joke where he abducts the guy on the street and no one notices because they're all looking down at their phone was great.

53,fciocca,"A very strange movie, with ton of potential, but extremely confusing in the development.",6,28 March 2021,"""The Empty Man"" is way better compared to the average horror movie that is released nowadays. It has a lot of good ideas, that unfortunately could not be properly developed. The result is an extremely disjointed film, that does not know what to achieve.The intro lasts more than 20 minutes, which is quite a long time, and does not connect to the main plot until the very last minutes, so why even bother to create such a complex storyline, if it is not used more during the movie? James Lasombra, the main character is an ex cop, that experienced a big trauma and tries to cope with it. I really liked the slow burner approach, as we discover his story, building a lot of suspense and tension. This kept me glued to the screen until the very end. I really enjoyed the idea of the cult, able to summon the Empty Man, but it is not properly established: how this organization managed to call this demon? What is their story? Do they have something to do with all the deaths shown? Because nothing of this is explained, by the end I had more questions than answers. They should have developed more this aspect, because it feels that there are missing pieces. In defense of the movie I have to say that I liked the beginning and the middle sections. How the mistery is developed, the investigation around murders that unveils little by little really dark and sick secrets.From a mere technical perspective this is a piece of art. There are no cheap jumps scares, which is good, as I am really tired of this useless technique. How the tension is built with subtle and extremely effective noises. Whoever handled camera movements, photography and lighting just nailed it. It was a while that I was not watching a horror shot in this way, with a magnificent sound design and soundtrack. Special effects are amazing and they feel realistic. Hollywood should really take some notes and release more stuff like this.I enjoy when filmmakers tries to push boundaries and want to experiment, especially when there is a big studio behind. I think that some things are left without a resolution on purpose, so the audience can give his own interpretation about the ending. The problem is that too much is unexplained and this generate a lot of plot holes. Even with its flaws, ""The Empty Man"" is still a really nice film with solid acting. If you are a horror lover, please give it a chance, you might be surprised.",The Empty Man

In the covid ravaged moviegoing experience there is almost nothing new to see for ys that want to go see movies in theaters. I saw The Empty Man was playing and ihad never heard or seen a trailer. I now have found that this movie is based on a graphic novel series. I watched the trailer on this very app and decuded to give it a chance. It looked like a decent horror-thriller. It is actually a goid thing sometimes not to have expectations in seeing a movie for the first time.I have to say that even though i can't say i loved it The Emplty Man is a well done supernatural suspense movie. It has no big stars and I'm sure not a huge budget but it is a very effective, well made movie. The biggest problems i have with it is that it suffers from being 15-20 minutes too long, and also falls too much into the twisty plot and ending trap that so many movies dintoo.much these days but it is a pleassnt surprise.It starts with a very tense and well done 20 minute intro that sets up the origin story of The Empty Man. We don't even see the title card until after the 20 minute intro scenes. We meet 2 men and 2 women hiking in the mountains in Asia. One of them falls in a crack. We see a skeleton who is presumably The Emplty Man and when his friend comes to get the hiker, he is not speaking and suddenly goes into shock. The group takes him to a house to try to save him. Eventuañly one of the woman gets a vision of an entity. It has her under some kind of spell and kills the other 2 hikers and herself. After credits the main plot starts. We meet an ex policeman played by James Badge Dale that begins to investigate the disappearance of a friend's daughter. There are soon some disappearances if the teenager's group of friends and ñearns about the urban legend of the Empty Man. He begins to investigate a group that seems to be a new age religious cult that us based the worship of the entity. The appearance on The Empty Man was in 3 three days after someone blows in an empty bottle on a bridge. First you hear him, then you see him, then he finds you. Yes, uts on the poster but that is the way the film presents it. The movie has the benefit of a very effective, eerie but powerful score that fits very well with the atmosphere which is cold and dark. I won't go into more plot details but the movie has some very good performances. It isn't necessarily scary but it does have some tension. And tgere are some twists and psychological elements in the story that make it worthwile. The fact that I had no real knowledge or expectations for the movie inthink enhanced Tommy enjoyment of the movie.Grade: B-",The Empty Man
56,deexsocalygal,Took a chance...wasn't worth it,4,23 April 2021,"Because I'm a fan of horror all the good IMDB reviews convinced me to spend the money to stream this. It wasn't worth the time or money. First of all the story was hard to follow. I struggled to understand what was going on, rewatched it & I still don't get it. I hate convoluted storylines! And this movie had my biggest number 1 pet peeve of all against horror - - MOST OF THE SCENES WERE TOO DARK TO SEE. I couldn't see anything when the kids were on the bridge, blew into bottles, saw something got scared & ran. What were they running from? So this movie is about high school kids who hear that if you blow into an empty bottle while standing on a bridge, The Empty Man will kill you in three days. Of course they all do it. For some reason there's another storyline in it about some weird cult institute that brainwashes kids into believing in some bizarre hoo-hoo that makes no sense & involves a man lying in a hospital in a coma for years who sends them subconscious messages. He's been there for years so long that he's wearing out & they need a replacement for him. A retired cop is looking for one of the High School girls who was on the bridge, blew in a bottle, & is now missing. He is the star of the movie & he is also the chosen one that the kids are preparing to take coma man's place. It's so bizarre it's impossible to explain. I cannot in good conscious recommend this movie. It's not scary enough, the story is too confusing, & the entire movie is way too dark.",The Empty Man
57,leesimon-26357,Somewhat disappointing with armchair philosophy to boot,6,23 February 2021,"This movie has a fairly solid cast, and our 2 main leads showed great acting. The soundtrack was compelling and added to the overall mood. It is shot extremely well, and each location is beautiful. Even shots of horrific events are artfully done.
The story itself begins to unfold as a missing person's case, with a troubled, ex-cop protagonist. As far as the developments, they are cool and suspenseful for awhile.
I personally found myself incredibly uninterested in the themes discussed (nihilism, tulpas etc...) and would have FAR rathered this movie invent its own supernatural world, with its own supernatural/philosophical rules. This is only because I have reason to discuss philosophy with academics and beginners on a regular basis, so I am relatively ""full"" on my desire to see those conversations play out on screen. Especially the oversimplified movie-versions.
Having said that, there are a few scenes of cult behavior that were chilling and riveting. I liked all the cult scenes and themes, and would have rathered more time was spent on that part of the ""investigation.""

59,youngcollind,"Dense and atmospheric, subverting genre expectations to convey a pitch black landscape",8,27 October 2021,"The trailer to the film totally fails to capture it's essence, and almost made me skip this one altogether, as it makes it seem like just another Slender Man/Candyman/Blahblahblah Man, urban legend comes to life and kills some kids b.s., which is a complete misrepresentation. The actual film is far more convoluted, falling somewhere between big budget horror and an indie art house affair.It takes some big risks, starting with a magnificent prologue that boldly lasts nearly half an hour, setting the stage for the spooky tone of the picture, it could almost be a self contained short in an of itself. It does eventually settle into the supernatural slasher alluded to in the trailer, but quickly shifts gears again before things get too run of the mill. From there it goes down a rabbit hole, exploring some more abstract, existentialist themes before ending somewhat ambiguously.The film had a surprisingly sizable budget, so it's overall very well put together. The simple but effective visual and audio effects are downright chilling, finding clever ways to be creepy without resorting to cheesy monsters. The film is deadpan and self serious, which can often be a bit heavy handed, occasionally resulting in some corny dialogue. If taken at face value though, it's suitably moody while taking enough chances to avoid predictability.",The Empty Man

The film is first and foremost a horror film, but the content is structured as an investigation. Which means that the eerie is revealed along the way. It works well.

It didn't come close to the movies noted above.This film also seems to set up entirely for a reveal twist at the end, and I can tell you it was so stupid and not worth that wait. The direction was good, the sets were great. The feel and vibe was there, the music was a good accompaniment to the scenes. The acting was soso, enough to get by; and the slow burn I enjoyed although come on this is over 2 hours long and boy does it drag.Really the entire thing here is built upon a stupid twist, and I was waiting for it and I was so angry. The protagonist and his twist was a little predictable but how they explained this with a plot dump was so lame my eyes rolled back into my head.With the payoff not landing, the entire movie falls so hard.

66,jdring2007,"harrowing atmosphere and soundtrack, but drawn out ending and lost potential",8,9 August 2021,"The long prologue was so well filmed and acted and was thick with a haunting atmosphere that I almost didn't want to end. Once thrust into present day, the true slow burn horror starts. Pacing, however, is never really an issue. I never felt bored; always intrigued, and James Badge Dale helped keep me interested. Creepy bits here and there were very effective. The soundtrack especially was memorable and disturbingly good. Although some people might think certain scenes were too ""preachy"" and wordy, this sort of Lovecraftian/Cthulian theme is right up my alley. Does it borrow from Slenderman? Yeah, sure. But it felt like so much more. Sadly the amazingly creepy ""skeleton creature"" in the trailer is given very little screentime but still had an effective presence. Ultimately there was so much unfulfilled potential here. Nonetheless definitely worth a watch; the trailer is very misleading, so don't judge it based solely on that. This was hard to rate for me, because of how much I loved the atmosphere and theme; a high 7 or low 8. I hope there will either be a sequel or an expanding upon this premise. I'm certainly going to have to look into the source material (graphic novels) now.",The Empty Man
67,totalovrdose,A phenomenal Mystery with a *Killer* Twist,8,26 March 2021,"It's impossible to talk about The Empty Man without mentioning *that conclusion*. It doesn't come out of left field, per se, but it certainly feels like it does, at least on a first time viewing. Having had 48hrs to think about it, the feature (very) subtly alludes to its ending, but in the 'blink and you'll miss it' kind of way. It's an ending that takes pivotal moments from the narrative, and spins them on their head, and having the rug pulled out from under me, when I was 100% invested in the feature until that point, was incredibly jarring. The Empty Man has a brilliantly unique concept, with a fabulous pace, a likable protagonist, and a shudder-inducing mystery, that kept me rooted to the spot. However, again, the conclusion took everything I was rivetted with, and forced me to reconsider it, and still, I am grappling with the question; am I happy with that narrative decision?The Empty Man technically has two beginnings, the first being a lengthy prologue sequence that introduces us to the film's concept, something that initially seems to have little connection to the over-arching narrative, but is revisited later. This sequence drags out the tension, in a spine-tingling fashion, until, like an elastic band, it snaps, summoning us into the present. James Badge Dale is a fantastic character to root for, as ex-cop turned private detective/gun store owner Lasombra, who is ridden with guilt over a family tragedy, the nightmares he constantly suffers plaguing not only him, but the viewer, in the best possible way, increasing the suspense. As the story unfolds, as does the taught mystery behind his agony. When Amanda (Sasha Frovlova), the teenage daughter of Nora (Marin Ireland), who Lasombra shares a past with, inexplicably goes missing, he agrees to help find her, after the police chop up the behavior to something akin to angsty rebellion.Though occasionally briefly showing other characters, who typically only have surface level characterization, Lasombra is the film's center. This is fantastic for us, the audience. The film is, essentially, crafting an original urban legend, and through the eyes of the lead, we can investigate, both Lasombra and the audience being along for the same ride. Lasombra is a believable, sympathetic character, often making rational choices. One moment, he literally says 'nah-ah', and high tails it out of there when crap gets too real, and I perfectly agreed with his decision. As he investigates deeper and deeper, all roads lead to a strange organization, who possess an uncanny fascination with summoning otherworldly beings, through the power of thought and meditation.At over two hours, the film might seem alarmingly long for a horror feature. Au contraire - not once did I feel the movie was going longer than it ought to, and, it, moreover, may not be right to dub this a ' horror' at all. It isn't particularly scary, though there are a couple of good scares. What the film does expertly well however, is create an atmosphere that punctuates dread, and more than once, I felt genuine chills, and a sense of lacking security, as I entered further into the world that director, David Prior, creates. I equally enjoyed the vibe, akin to Pellington's The Mothman Prophecies, which accompany the visuals. In the aforementioned film, shots linger on settings, props and characters that allude to the titular character's shape and silhouette, and a similar concept was used in The Empty Man.The entity itself, like any good supernatural mystery, has much of the answers left out of arm's reach, the film never dumbing down the narrative, demanding that audience's become absorbed in the product, and make up their own mind. That said, the lack of definite answers, in a genre (or sub-genre) that tosses out answers like they are going out of fashion, could be a jarring choice for some. This is a smart film, which isn't overly reliant on blood to get its story across. It's beautifully shot and edited, which only aids in hooking you, to the point that you are not taken out of the film - until, again, *that conclusion*. That is what I meant in the title of the review ~ a 'killer' ending, as this may be what kills the film for some viewers. That said, The Empty Man makes teddy bears creepy - and any film that can pull off that accomplishment, is absolutely worth a viewing.In all seriousness, to talk about the feature in greater detail would begin to spoil what should not be discussed before an actual viewing, and the less you know before seeing this, the better it will be. Recently, I have been going into movies with zero expectations, and I would recommend that here, because whatever you expect - The Empty Man will do something else entirely. I'm not sure I would say 'disappointment' described my feelings leaving the movie. 'Perplexed' might be a better word. However, am I perplexed enough not to watch The Empty Man again? Absolutely not. In fact, not only will I totally re-watch it, and soon, it's the first film I've seen in a long time that I cannot stop thinking about. No matter how you feel, just like the Empty Man itself, this movie will have you thinking about it - just don't go summoning any otherworldly abominations when you do.",The Empty Man
68,Mivas_Greece,Special dark/occult/mystery film with lots of potential but really poor presentation of that mystery and lacking explanations...,6,5 April 2021,"Metaphysical/mystery film. A group of young people go hiking in the snow, until one of them accidentally discovers a skeleton. Except the skeleton belonged to a ""host"" for something supernatural, and the young man who discovers him stops responding to his friends and acts strange, as he becomes the new host for that entity. Later we are transferred to the near future and to an independent story where another group of young people listening to a story/reputation, decides to do it for fun and end up invoking The Empty Man, the same entity that is transferred from host to host and that seems to exist a whole cult behind it. Although the film started promisingly, it continued at an increasingly slow pace and grew increasingly boring as time went on, since instead of explaining, things became more and more complicated. No clear explanation was given as to what Empty Man is, and the ending was particularly strange and incomprehensible. Although there could be a particular plot twist, unfortunately like the rest of the film, the twist of the ending further complicates things and the few explanations given to the audience are also overturned. Despite the good performances and the special script and the directing, unfortunately the presentation of the mystery to the viewer was particularly inadequate, so instead of enjoying a special mystery film, the film ends and the audience won't understand what they watched...

I think it could become a cult classic. But it feels like the ""kitchen sink"" of horror movies.First, the fantastic first 20 minutes could have been expanded into a full-length movie in itself. It doesn't fit well with the rest of the film.Second, the viewer is subjected to a whiplashing of plot jumps for 137-freaking-minutes.Not to say there isn't a lot to like in here somewhere. This would've worked much better as a mini-series which would've justified the runtime and more.James Badge Dale is good and you can see why he's in a lot of military roles. He's like a pod creature (just saw Invasion of the Body Snatchers) with no emotions as he glances at a pot of blood or a bunch of dead teenagers, expressionlessly moving onto the next thing. Until the end when he emotes like hell.There's a phrase I'm looking for -- something like ""crushed by one's ambitions""? Not sure that's right but it sure feels what this movie is like.P.S.

80,BeanieCore,"A misunderstood, poorly marketed cult classic, awaiting it's audience.",8,13 February 2021,"This film quite literally came out of nowhere, and disappeared almost as quickly. After being shelved for a few years, it was dumped into theaters during the very middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. Almost as if distributors didn't have enough faith in the film than to use it as anything but a guinea pig to test how many theater seats they could fill with the pandemic still ongoing. This may cause one to be cautious and skeptical of the film's quality, and while I normally would be under these circumstances, I urge you not to be. For those who appreciate slow-burning, atmosphere fueled, mind-bending horror films, this one is just for you. I'm honestly quite shocked by the general public's initial reaction to it. Being a long-time horror fanatic and especially an admirer of cosmic, Lovecraftian horror, there wasn't anything the least bit confusing or muddled about this film. There aren't enough cosmic horrors being made these days, and perhaps that's why modern audiences are not susceptible to the influences this picture wears on it's sleeves. For those people, I'd recommend taking a look into Lovecraft's writing, but even then, I just don't see why so many were so confounded by this picture. Rest assured, as someone who knows their taste in horror, it's very good.This is not to say that it isn't a mysterious, complex film that requires attention and thought. In fact, it requires much more concentration than the jump-scare riddled horror films that usually receive releases this wide. But the film's slowing unfurling atmosphere of dread and existential anxiety make it easy to be drawn in. It's a very hypnotic experience if one just allows themselves to be enveloped by the creepiness and mystery. The filmmaking is top notch, with gorgeous, yet melancholy cinematography, and a plot that unravels piece by piece, like a thick but engrossing novel. Best of all, there are almost no clumsy, predictable jumps or atrocious CGI. There's only one ""gotcha"" moment in the entire film, and it is very well earned. Instead, this is a film that seeks to unnerve it's audience through the horror of the things it suggests, the concepts it probes. It's like an existential crisis laid out on screen, the unraveling of a man's perception of the world as he knows it. These things are pivotal elements of Lovecraftian/cosmic horror, and this film knows how to deliver them. Moments and lines of dialogue will bury themselves in your head, and it's the sort of film that you'll be thinking on for days afterwards, regardless of whether you want to or not. There are elements that speak to the human condition of wondering and dreading our place in the universe, that I haven't seen a big studio film probe in a long time.The acting is quite good, with James Badge Dale making for a likeable leading man. There may seem to be a lack of character development, but trust me when I say that there is a very good reason for this vagary. The twist ending is very shocking, and quite brilliant, if you allow yourself to accept an ending so jarring and upsetting. It's not easy to accept, and that's the very point of the film. To make you uncomfortable in your own head, to turn your perception of what you're watching upside down and rattle you to the bones. Hopefully, this film will become something of a cult hit over the years. It already has the makings, what with the IMDB rating steadily climbing with more viewers discovering this little gem, and in time it will find it's audience. Lovers of cosmic and psychological horror myself have already embraced it, and it honestly deserves much more respect and praise. Don't be fooled by the tacky marketing, avoid the trailers and the generic title that paint this as a goofy, ""urban legend"", teen horror film. It's not any of those things. Approach it with an open mind, a patient mind, and be ready to be spooked.",The Empty Man
81,WisdomsHammer,"Know before you watch, this isn't really a monster movie.",3,24 September 2021,"Spoilers below:This movie starts out great and had me really interested. Then it cuts to an unspecified number of years later and a completely different cast - and essentially a completely different movie.It starts out as a sort of monster movie with a weird skeleton and a wraith-like thing chasing people, then it jumps years into the future and turns into a crime drama, then from there into a weird Jonestown-like thing with a huge cast of people with very punchable faces. The wraith-like thing does keep showing up in the movie, but in an odd and confusing way. In then end, most of the movie may not have happened at all. That makes my eyes roll. It's not as bad as an ""It was all just a dream"" ending, but I still didn't like it.There are people who are going to like this movie quite a bit, and I suggest reading some of their reviews here to see if this movie is your thing. I wish I would have read them before I watched. Some of the people who like it are calling it Lovecraftian horror, and yeah, I think I agree with that. The thing is, I was looking for a monster movie with The Empty Man and I got a freaky girl who looks like Will from Stranger Things (but WAY less likeable) and her Scientologist friends talking about nothing being real and blowing into bottles. I'm not a big fan of Lovecraft-based films, and this does feel like one. I'm not knocking people who like them at all. I think they'll love this, and I think it should be marketed more towards them a little better.The acting, cinematography, score, and even the lighting were all incredible. The story felt disjointed to me. And I felt like I was being sold something I wanted in the trailer and in the beginning of the movie but by the end of the movie they delivered something I didn't want.Giving this a 3 is harsh, but I was so disappointed, especially with the ending, that I have to go that low.

There is an underlying plot of infidelity that at first I thought was just a side plot and filler but it's not. The imagery, use of bridges and blood, connectivity of each scenes are smart and creepy. The deaths might not be goriest or schocking but they work and the ending is satisfying despite having some loose ends.Yes it is well shot and well directed but the ace card is background score and sound design. Dialogues are clear, footsteps, wind noises, breeze and other environment sounds are so well used. Background score is worth buying or listening on YouTube.This is a solid movie but not for everyone.

When all the story threads were pulled together at the end I could kind of see what the film had been very ineptly trying to do. There is a kernel of a potentially cool story here that could have been a cool movie with completely different direction and editing but what has been done here is so far away from that you can barely see it.Apparently this is based on a graphic novel and I hope for the author's sake that the story potential wasn't fully realized in that only to be butchered by this terrible movie.,The Empty Man

Think of it like an annoying houseguest that stays too long.This thing is a absolute mess.The first 20 or so minutes aside, which was very promising, this falls into an example of a script that was seemingly written by someone very unfocused, to be outdone by a director who might have need some level of intervention to edit. Weighed down by silly derivative Candyman versus Emptyman teenage tropes at it's onset, the films shifts into storyline archs that are headache inducing and spiral from mind control deathcults, to doubting existence to blowing bottles to summon some evil spirit that kills for unexplained reasons, missing people, misplaced flashbacks (that are only there to support the nonsense that's forthcoming).The ending will only further numb your brain.

I learned about this movie a day before it released by accident. I'm a horror aficionado and this movie was so below the radar I don't believe anybody knew about it; especially about it releasing in theaters. The story is about an ex-cop investigating a missing persons. The story evolves from there into a nightmare of sorts. The acting was good; though James Badge Dale as James stole the entire film through his incredible performance. The jump scares weren't numbered in the likes of Paranormal Activity or Sinister and etc, but I also believe jump scares are so cliché now. The pacing was very well done; granted the movie is almost 2.5 hours long. The ambient audio was spectacular and honestly one of the best sound designs for a horror film I've ever heard which I know is a tall statement. The cinematography was extremely well shot. If you can imagine a combination of Sinister, Hereditary and It Follows rolled into one, but executed wonderfully then you will have an inkling of what this film is about.

The Radio Show All About the Movies.First and foremost... hideously terrible movie! I'll instantly tell you this now ranks up there with ""Hot To Trot"" 1988 (Bobcat Goldthwait) as one of the WORST movies I've EVER seen! On a 1 to 10 scale (10 being best), I'd give this a 1 star (not even a 1.5). The plot was nearly non-existent. The first 20 minutes (prior to the actual open) was the set-up, but it was as necessary as the concession stand selling prosthetic middle fingers. This was meant to be a horror/drama movie, but there were NO characters that were developed to where you cared what happened to ANY of them.Don't waste you time. If they offer you free admission, free popcorn, and a free soda to come see this movie, take a PASS on THAT and go volunteer cleaning a bathroom in a night club at closing time (there's a good chance, you'll enjoy THAT more!). It really WAS THAT bad!I saw this movie with my 19 year old daughter, and the consensus on the drive home was that it actually was the WORST movie we've EVER seen together!I sure prefer to NOT give such a heinous review because so many people put a LOT of work into a movie's production, but this movie is a GREAT reason for theaters to offer refunds to movies that completely and totally STINK!!",The Empty Man

108,slimecity-38663,"""I grew up in San Francisco....""",8,23 February 2021,"2020 seems to be a good year for new horror, including this film.It takes a long time for the intro setup to mesh into the rest of the movie - but when it does, the result is good. This film is what happen when a studio accidentally throws a ton of money and high production values at a very well written and directed film. There is no way that this film could have done well - its just too good for todays' Marvel-fed mainstream audiences.I've never quite seen a horror quite like this. It starts off appearing to be a simple teen horror concept (ie: blow into this bottle, say ""the empty man"", and he will come...) but it evolves and twists and turns into so much more. The concept of the cop looking for the missing kid also seems cliched, until that also warps into something else.After watching this film I sought out David Priors past work. Unfortunately there isnt enough of it. However AM1200 (a horror short) delivers very similarly-well-directed dark tension with a very good story about characters who are also in a hopeless situation.It isnt until the end of the movie that you work out where the introduction fits in with the rest of the movie. The main twist in this film is probably one of the best things I have ever seen in a film, let alone a horror. The realisation that hits the main character (once he finally understands what is going on) will probably mirror your own expression as you realise the truth. This plot twists expectations on their head.There are also some pretty fantastic directorial moves - look out for the scene with a map that zooms into a car driving along the road - its was done incredibly well.Good acting, plot and ending. Well worth a watch if you like intellectual, tense, dramatic horror thats done well. Im SO keen to see more from this director.

And I really found this to be a good blend of real myths, real philosophies, real cults, and horror tropes.Yes, it might come across as borrowing from anything and everything, but that actually fits one of the philosophies discussed by the cult: everything is connected and is the same.I enjoyed the score; it underpinned how scenes should be interpreted without TELLING you how to feel like many tense movies do. The lighting and camerawork helped play out the story, and the set design gave a grimeyness that made the evil seem more ancient. Good dialogue and good acting.

It really is a shame I very much like the lead actor and so wanted this movie to be good, and for most of the movie it was pretty good. Kept you guessing, but like so movies they outsmart themselves and have no where to go in the final 10 minutes, so they wing it and take a shot in the dark, and as usual they missed. They did what so many of these types of movies do, they leave a 'non ending' to their ending. and to top it all off they end it with the bad guys victorious, or in this case the nut case cult and the evil entity that drives people to kill themselves. by the way what was that about? I realize it is hard to not be cliche, but these types of endings are so common now a days that they have become a cliche.My suggestion to the writers of future movies like this one, end in a good note, the good guys win and the evil is stomped out, at least then you leave your audience feeling good in the end, and for those that dont, well forget them because odds are they are just unhappy people with unhappy lives and want everyone else to be unhappy with them.

144,chancellorpink,Overly Long Visual Art Masking As a Movie,5,18 July 2021,"I saw someone disgraced the excellent Alan Parker movie Angel Heart by comparing it to this mediocre flick. Sorry, that one had great performances by Mickey Rourke & DeNiro. No one in this dirgefest can act their way out of a semi-coma.Empty Man is certainly unoriginal; I'll give it that. Name a much better prior creepy, noir horror flick, and it's pretty much represented here.At 2 hours and 17 minutes, the film is bound to have a couple effective sequences, and so this does - but only a couple (Hints: there's a great lengthy pre-credits opening segment and an excellent use of outdoor nighttime lighting in the woods, with hundreds of spooky hooded extras in a (much) later bit).But nothing here adds up to much, logically or dramatically, in the end, mostly because the acting is so B-grade, and the narrative so derivative, that we just don't care about anyone at all.",The Empty Man
145,Humphreywashere,"Stunningly creepy, and 'edge of your seat' excellent movie",10,31 October 2020,"We were engrossed from start to end. A skillfully constructed creepy thriller with original, unpredictable storyline. Never dull, fast paced, and lacking the silly tricks that less intelligent horror films tend to overuse. My companion is very hard to please and is almost never 'scared' in horror movies, but he said this was 'really, really creepy and very well done'. I was on the edge of my seat throughout. The ending was very well done. Acting was superb. Cinematography is also stunning. There are some truly scary scenes that have no gore nor violence, yet generate tremendous fear, perhaps by triggering some primeval survival instincts. Seeing masses of people behaving in inexplicable and potentially dangerous ways will do that to you.
I don't understand the negative reviews, and glad I paid no attention to them. If you do not like horror or creepy films, don't go to see this movie. If you like mindless slasher films, don't go to see this movie. If you like simple storylines and simple scripts with pretty teen victims, don't go to see this movie. But, if you like intelligent, original, thought provoking films that play with space and time, and with universally identifiable fears and horror, then you are likely to find this movie absolutely fascinating.",The Empty Man

It started out promising. After the last teen dies it went haywire.
Any movie that you pay attention to but at the end you still don't know what happened, has failed as a movie.
I was hoping to read a review that would explain this enough so that I could say oh, now I get it.
There was a pointless dead dog scene that had absolutely no place in the movie which makes me wonder why 90 percent of every movie has a dead dog in it.
The 2 I gave it was for the 10-20 minutes I actually thought the movie had a chance.
Sorry but I'm not one of those woke individuals that understands cosmic nihilism and out of body and mind stuff.

147,shannonlong636,Refreshing,8,13 October 2021,"I'll just come right out and say it. Everything about this movie was excellent except the ending. The Empty Man is original, it's thought-provoking, it's well-acted and beautifully shot. The sound track is spot on, building tension in all the right places. It provides a mystery that keeps you engaged throughout. It's not your typical horror film with a bunch of jump scares, but more of a psychological horror that steadily builds a feeling of dread. For all this, I would have given the film a 9 handily. Unfortunately, the ending was unsatisfying and left a lot of questions unanswered. I don't know if a sequel is planned, but I hope there will be more to this story that ties up all the loose strings. I agree with other reviewers who've said this movie is destined to become a cult classic because it is not quite like anything else out there.

A new take on somewhat old ideas, shot beautifully and told interestingly. I was really amped up and excited because that feeling of watching what you know is a new classic doesn't come around very often. I found myself thinking about what I'd say to my friends when I recommended that they absolutely must watch this film!And then it took a _very_ hard turn about 20 minutes from the end and it completely lost me. The 10 stars quickly became 5 (which it only held on to because of how good the rest of the movie was) and I honestly can't think of another instance where I was so immediately soured by a ""twist."" I'd really never had that experience before, enjoying a movie as much I was and then suddenly being annoyed, justifiably confused, and fully stripped of all horror-fan joy. And don't get me wrong, it's not solely because there was a twist at all. It's that the twist is just... nonsense. I mean, not to be overly cruel, but... really, _really_ stupid. I had no idea this was based on a comic until after watching it, so if the story is a true adaptation, then we can obviously blame the source material and not anyone involved in the filmmaking.

158,pacocharte,The Empty Man made me do this review. A conflicted 8-stars,8,20 September 2021,"I watched this film without first reading anything about it or watching the trailer, which I'm glad I did. If you stumble on this review, I'm here to tell you that you should stop reading anything more about the plot or at least caution you not to take the hyper-critical sub 4-star reviews seriously. I'm really not sure what the big problem was for people who thought the different story lines were disjointed. They weren't.There was some excellent acting and amazing (especially for a first-time director!) camera and cinematography work along with a soundtrack that doesn't insult the viewer with jump scares or become overbearing.TL/DR (my spoiler-containing novel of a review will likely annoy some): Creepy, original genre-bending movie that deserved a much wider release and more studio support. The ratings are dragged down by some overly negative reviewers that seemed to want a shorter film that fell more neatly into a single genre. If you have 2+ hours at your disposal and you like the thought of a supernatural horror-occult-urban legend-shaggy dog mystery movie, then I recommend this highly.You can stop reading now if you don't want any spoilers.I must admit that I'm in agreement with numerous other reviewers about the opening sequence being one of the best parts of this movie. It was genuinely creepy, original and the story could have gone virtually anywhere from that point; I had no idea what was coming next knowing there were still about 2 hours left. I wish there had been more of an explanation about the crazy skeleton that looked like a cross between HR Giger's art work (in the ""Alien"" films) and something out of John Carpenter's ""The Thing."" What the heck was that thing and if that was the Empty Man, why didn't it re-appear in that form at any point again besides a quick, obscure textual reference to Bhutan in a Wikipedia article on the Pontifex Society much later on...When we flash forward to 2018, I wanted the story to follow Paul back to the USA and thought at first that our ex-cop detective *was* Paul living under an alias. It turned out not to be the case, but back to that Wikipedia reference - if the events in Bhutan were documented, how did Paul escape any kind of criminal charges? Were his friends assumed to have all killed themselves? Were any bodies found? Alas, no explanation was forthcoming about Paul's whereabouts at all until near the very end of the flick and the back story provided by the nurse was only surface level sketches of his history at best. How did he and the Pontifex Society end up coming together if he was comatose? But man, that opening sequence was awesome and I had some very high expectations, albeit without any clue where things might go, from there.When we pick back up though, the story centers on a grieving man and his only real friend, the teenage daughter of one of his neighbors. She disappears one day and they find ""The Empty Man made me do it"" scrawled in some kind of blood on her bedroom wall. At this point I'm like WTF? How has this got anything to do with the scenes in Bhutan? So I was a little disappointed when the story turned into one about some kids disappearing after going along with what was essentially a dare about a (rather silly, unfrightening) urban legend.Well, as the ex-cop/detective goes about his investigation into the missing kids, the details start to converge on a cult-like group called, again, The Pontifex Society, who seem to practice some kind of philosophical combination of Nietzschean nihilism, eternal return, and goofy Scientology self-help. The sheer number of people (mostly young) hanging around the cult's HQ in St. Louis is pretty unbelievable for how obscure this group is made out to be in the film, but that's a minor quibble I guess. But, yeah, with so many acolytes of a group like that all gathered in one place (St. Louis proper's population is only like 300,000 IIRC), it would probably be in the local news at the very least. As it happens, at least a few of the missing teens had gotten themselves wrapped up in this cult which seemed to be predicated on worshiping and/or bringing this Empty Man character from the silly urban legend to life.But for what??? I just don't see how nihilism could possibly co-exist with self-help as a practice and worse still, it was never explained what any of these practitioners could possibly have gotten out of it. Like why are they even wasting so much energy and time trying to channel or conjure the Empty Man if 1) All you have to do is blow into a bottle on a bridge at night and 2) TEM doesn't do anything good for them or bring them enlightenment or wealth, nor is it clear what the leader of this cult gets out of it himself if not money (ala Scientology). Blah. Bleh....that part of the story was clumsy IMO.Anyway, we eventually learn that most of the missing kids are dead, that two are still unaccounted for and we find out that Paul is comatose in one of the main St. Louis hospital and receives dozens upon dozens of strange visitors every day but it doesn't raise any red flags for the hospital staff. Silly. On top of that, it's almost like the operations of the entire hospital have been co-opted by this John Doe as we hear the dispatcher call all doctors to the third floor via the intercom system seemingly to prevent them from seeing all of Paul/John Doe's visitors. Again, bleh, meh.At the end of it all, it becomes clear. These cultists are trying to find a new host for the empty man (who they use as an antenna to another dimension - again, for what?) and the viewer is led to believe that in fact our protagonist detective has either been kidnapped and brainwashed or straight up conjured out of thin air and given fake painful memories to prime him to be the new Earthly manifestation of the pointless Empty Man entity.And yet, I still give it 8 stars. LOL. It was super entertaining for me, very well crafted, original, and the score/soundtrack was top notch. It wasn't until the end that I found myself asking all those questions, and by then I'd already enjoyed the ride too much to ding the whole film for the sum of its parts.",The Empty Man
159,jdowney-57-371157,"Starts Strong, Brought down by Bad Ending",5,28 January 2021,"It could be asked, should this have been stretched out to a mini-series? There are three very distinct settings and stories here, and all though this slightly too long movie seems to get everything out of each part; it also has to gloss over some characters and relationships that cause you to be less invested in the protagonist than you need to be for the ending that is setup. Since this was from a graphic novel, it seems possible that the story could have been expanded out to build the drama in the individual parts of the story.Overall this movie has some good style to it, the acting is good, and it begins with a good level of horror tension and weirdness. We get a long prologue to introduce us to the horror element. Then the story moves to what seems to be a traditional teen horror structure. And finally we get a detective investigating a cut mystery.Steven Root, Samantha Logan, Robert Aramayo all have small but important roles and all of them do a good job. James Badge Dale who becomes the lead, Marin Ireland and Sasha Frolova are all fine as the leads, but actually they don't have much to do.The first hour builds in tension and suspense and works really well.

I'm trying to keep this as spoiler free, as honestly, the less you know going in the better.The thing I enjoyed most is that the movie is really great at building tension. The first half to two-thirds of the movie are a slow burn, but VERY compelling. I was genuinely interested to see how the mystery would unfold and what would happen. The movie is shot beautifully, and acting is generally good. The movie also contains very few jump scares, which I really appreciated, because it doesn't use them to try and get cheap thrills. The movie is excellent at slowly building horror and dread.My issues with the movie largely come from the narrative, which will likely make it break the movie for you. I can guarantee that a lot of people will probably dislike the ending, which I totally get. I haven't decided how I feel about the ending yet, but I know I didn't hate it. The movie also suffers from a few horror/thriller tropes, such as ""the Google search to get exposition"". It also left a few things unexplained, but not in a good way - they were in a ""okay, well how did that work?"" type of a way that I didn't always love.Overall though I genuinely enjoyed my time with the movie. It's got some story issues and a couple of thriller tropes, but I thought the directing was excellent and the movie was really great at building tension.

Say the ones that find a sliver of originality in this bore of a movie.No, it is that.But it is also Rosemary's Baby / Mountain of Madness / The Wicker Man plot where our protagonist finds himself at the center of an evil conspiracy.I would say that this movie has not one sequence that hasn't been done better in another movie. But the truth is, those sequences have been already bad in other movies.I find no reason for this movie to exist, and obviously the studio didn't find it either, since they dumped it without any promotion.It is hodgepodge of bad tropes, done bad before, and done bad yet again in this completely forgettable movie.",The Empty Man

There are elements of that but then things get really weird. This is cosmic / Lovecraftian horror at it's finest and deserves to be seen by a lot more people.

However as it drags out into second act, it turns into a weird cultish mess that is really bizarre and the pace slows down so much that I lost interest. The last 1.2 hours of the film is really boring, that is all I have to say and a complete disconnect from the first part. Any film that lasts more than 1.5 hours and well into 2 hours has to have a very good pace and transition. This film failed to do so and made the mistake many scripts make by making a disconnect from the first act for no good reason.

199,sorrelloriginals,Can you say storyline or narrative?,1,4 August 2021,There are so many scenes in this movie that are artistically composed and beautifully lit and are under scored with great music but unfortunately I can not tell what one scene has to do with another. I don't know who's dreaming who is awake or really what the hell is going on at any given moment.I challenge any individual who gave this a 10 out of 10 review to tell me what it's about. If somebody asked me I would say the story is about people who sit on a bridge and blow air into a bottle till it makes it sort of a low music note and then after that really bad things happen. And then so what? I have no problem with very drawn out long story lines that take a long time to develop. For God sake I watched 88 episodes of Game of Thrones just to see who would wind up sitting on one but this was completely unsatisfying. There was no character in it that I cared about. By the time I was halfway through I was already thinking there's no way that they can make sense out of these plot lines. I only watched the rest of it just to see if I was right. If I had paid money to see it in the theater I would've asked for my money back.,The Empty Man
200,eggrolljr,Clunky,5,1 November 2020,"Not a bad film by any means, but certainly not a good one either. The Empty Man clunks along like a car with square wheels, meandering through most of its story with little direction or energy.I'm a fan of slow-burn horror, but you need to have interesting characters for that to work, and sadly Empty Man's characters are all largely underdeveloped and forgettable. I think the film also suffers from some tonal issues, it was rather strange to watch a naked high-school girl get stabbed in the face with scissors. It was a scene that felt completely at odds with the rest of the film.I was intrigued by the story and the concept of tulpas and the cult, but the film's languid pacing kind of kills the interest. David Prior needs to learn how to kill his darlings, the film easily could have lost 20-30 minutes and been a tighter film.

205,xecutionrecords,The Shadow of HP Lovecraft in all but name.,8,27 March 2021,"The Empty Man largely went unnoticed when it hit cinemas in 2020, not surprising as a raging pandemic was in full effect & the world wasn't quite ready yet to sit in a darkened theatre for 2.5 hours & be bombarded with an atmospheric slow burn horror that does more for HP Lovecraft fans than the Slasher Kids the initial trailer was aimed at. Great then that in 2021 via Streaming services this excellent little movie is finally getting some well earned recognition. As always the genre that has the longest legs is horror. How many great horror movies flew under the radar only to re-emerge years later as 'Classics'?. Think John Carpenters 'The Thing', Another Lovecraft inspired movie that is now regarded as a benchmark in the 'Sci-Fi Horror' field & thats just the tip of the iceberg. It's true to say Horror fans will never let good movies get away from the general public & in the case of 'The Empty Man' this is already the case & a well deserved one at that. Not a classic yet but the potential is there for sure.It's easy to see though why those that did brave the cinema (Not that many to be honest) were a bit confused, this is not a Friday night date movie, more one for fans of off-centre Indie horrors like the awesome 'It Follows' or 'Mandy', The Empty Man is full of ideas & be it long, is well thought out & paced slowly enough for anyone to get to grips with it's many concepts. Firmly placed in the realm of 'Cosmic Sci-Fi Horror' a genre represented & pretty much created by HP Lovecraft, you can tell the director is slightly obsessed with all things 'Cthulu' as the movie has all the trademarks. Metaphysical beings, weird cults, ideas & entities human brains lack the ability to comprehend. All of this centred around a career best performance from James Badge Dale (Like Hereditary before it, this is an award worthy piece that will get completely ignored by all in that arena)The Film is in part a Noir-Like Mystery as Dale goes about trying to solve the dissapearence of his neighbours daughter who's only parting words are written in blood on the bathroom mirror 'The Empty Man Made Me Do It' this eventually leads him to a Crazy Cult who dance around Fires at night & whisper unintelligable ramblings into peoples ears, completely normal right? All the while suffering terrible nightmares & guilt around the death of his wife & son in an apparent car accident. On the surface It's a pretty normal set up but the movie has many tricks & traps along the way & for that reason a second watch is pretty much essential if you want to pick up all you missed first time around. It's a clever thinking person's film & for that reason might not be everybody's cup of tea but if you give it a chance, The Empty Man will have you firmly in it' grasp so don't be put off by that.The Film starts with a lengthy opening sequence as a group of Kids venture into the snowy mountains of the Himalaya's & stumble upon a cave with a rather creepy looking skeleton inside. This was criticised by some when the film opened for being 'Too Long!' but in hindsight is absolutely essential to the story & like most of what follows, is perfectly paced & beautifully shot (The movie has some inspired moments of camera work that feel similar in tone to the previously mentioned 'Hereditary' & 'It Follows' but have their own stamp of weirdness on it) This prologue sequence really sets up the movie in the best 'What The Hell?' kind of way & certainly delivers on the chill factor & i'm not just talking about the snow.Overall 'The Empty Man' is one of the best horrors of 2020. It took the Director 4 years from page to screen & you can really tell this is a labour of love for him. It's a shame that the combination of Fox selling to Disney, a pandemic & a misleading trailer all led to it flying under a lot of people's radars but at least in 2021 this chunk of Lovecraftian gold is finally getting the audience it deserved. If your looking for basic linear 'Conjuring' type chills this is not going to float your boat but if you are a fan of dark 'Lynch' like madness without going too far left of centre this will tick every box. Worth watching for James Badge Dale's performance alone. This is 'The Wicker Man if re-imagined by Lovecraft, & if that doesn't make you want to watch it, nothing will. So... watch it & join the Cult of 'The Empty Man'.",The Empty Man

219,sethklee-77687,Friedrich Nietzsche x A Cure for Wellness,6,5 November 2020,"Decent. A dark, mystery thriller which follows an ex-cops investigation into a friend's missing daughter. The plot, which stays suspenseful and intriguing for the most part, is complex and philosophical, leaning on nihilism and Friedrich Nietzche. I'd say the film is more of a mystery film than a horror film, but that's ok and it certainly has horror elements. When it is scary, it doesn't rely as much on jumpscares which is always a plus.I'm unsure of how I feel about the ending, but I had a good time with the buildup. It definitely could have had some of its 137 minute runtime trimmed down though. It almost feels like it was put out before being fully complete, which is definitely a possibility considering it's discrete release. The feeling could just be coming from its perplexing nature though. James Badge Dale gave a good performance. The cinematography and sound design were well done. Overall, while not great, it was something out of the ordinary and I found it to be a fairly enjoyable and philosophical film.

Could be wrong about the location but yeah pretty much the first twenty min makes the movie and really makes you wish this was pretty much the entire central focus of the movie of these long time friends slowly going insane in this cabin after stumbling across the remains of a long dead demon in this cave but you get the idea of whatever this creature did was so horrific and unspeakable that some of its essences is still present in the area the idea itself is a very cool one that this demon choses a man to put all of its evil and knowledge into to send messages to its slowly growing cult and the longer this person is the ""empty man"" the more it starts to eat away at his body is very cool and original enough idea in my opinion also a really big fan of Lovecraft inspired horror which this definitely is mainly having ties to Cthulhu with the demon being this ancient forbidden evil which we never see only its skeletal remains which is creepy enough and honestly the right choice to make things even more creepy but the problem is after the prolog things kinda start to fall apart for me the story is not as interesting now being set in a city where it becomes more of a murder mystery film where a detective is solving a missing person's chase which we later find it is tied to this cult for the empty man which is mainly these teens that look like they all have Tumblrs its kinda lame going from a creepy suspense filled Lovecraft horror of people going insane from an ancient unspeakable horror and a lot having to be left up to your imagination about the demon in the cave to a very typical run of the mill movie of a detective who gets in to deep into this investigation you've seen it before not to its like horrorible or anything it kept me interested enough to watch the movie all the way through but still makes you think about what could have been instead of what we got the lead detective was a really good actor and I give him credit for his performance and the overall concept of the film is very unique and interesting feels somewhat waisted.",The Empty Man

230,sbash22,Full of promise but ends up Empty,5,8 April 2021,"The first 20 minutes? Amazing. Set the tone incredibly well. A group of young travellers in Bhutan have a terrifying experience while exploring the wilderness. Then, all of a sudden, we're thrown out of that beautiful Bhutan scenery and into a modern day city, in which the entire remaining 1 hour 40 minutes of the movie is spent.That was the first major letdown in the movie. For the following 20 minutes you're wishing that the movie ventures back to Bhutan as soon as possible, to recapture that spooky mystical vibe that was created so well at the start. Sadly, it never happens. The movie then turns into a strange mish mash incorporating elements of crime investigation,cultish creepiness, bogeyman summoning, and eventually the power of projected thought. However, it does remain entertaining throughout and keeps you guessing as to how all the various elements will be tied together at the end. Unfortunately, this is where the biggest letdown occurs. The extremely poor ending.The acting is excellent throughout however, every actor does an excellent job and the movie is cast very well. It's not their fault that the script took a major nosedive at it's conclusion. The cinematography and directing is also of a high standard for most of the movie. A bunch of talented people were involved in the making of this, apart from the ending - that's where it feels like the script was handed over to a 5 year old to complete.For a movie to start so incredibly well but to end so abysmally, it's difficult to fathom how the producers could allow that to happen. It's as if two entirely different teams produced the start and the end. Frankly the ending enters the realm of sheer stupidity, both in plot and in execution. Such a shame! What could have been a 7 star movie is ruined because of the inanity of the conclusion.So bear in mind, it IS entertaining for a large chunk and therefore still worth watching.

It's definitly well thought, well put together, and it got me engaged the whole time. It didnt felt long even considering it runs for more than 2 hours. Sure thing the story requires a bit of attention to follow along, and I think the audience has to cope with the fact it's an artsy film which don't follow a typical genre path. There's sci-fi elements, fantastic, drama and of course horror with actually a good amount of scary scenes. And it's a pretty dark story.
There's a lot of good twists and we are as much lost as the main character, an ex cop, that we follow through a bizarre investigation.
Acting was good. Shots are very well done, and above all the sound design and music are extremely good and contribute to a unique and incredible atmosphere.

It is difficult to describe, but this feeling has hit me a just few times before - where a really great film just keeps running on and on after the impetus is stalled, and the movie magic turns to tedium. Thus the final thirty minutes, had it been editted to ten concise minutes, might have brought us a 9 star film, rather than 4. I for one simply was dismayed by how much the final scenes just ran the gamut of too long and tendentious. I suppose the premise of inner revelation that main character's life has been hollow and meaningless, needs to be tortuously and torturously temporizing, but I prefer it done without torturing my patience.

In 1995, a group of hikers in the Himalaya mountains of Bhutan stumble upon an entity and 3 days later tragedy ensues. Only one hiker survives. Cut to 2018, an ex-cop investigates a missing teenager who may have ties to a death cult.SPOILERS:
At the end of the movie , you find out that the ""empty man"" entity has possessed the comatose hiker and has been transmitting his ""messages"" like a virus, as he is being moved from one hospital to another over the years. His medical care being funded by the growing cult. The missing teen and cult had been manipulating the ex-cop to be the new vessel for the Empty Man. The Empty Man entity possesses the ex-cop in the end.Why does the movie overstay its welcome? The big issue for me was pacing.
The film runs over 2 hours long. With some judicious editing, they could have come to the conclusion a lot sooner. The second act during the investigation dragged with pretentious talk about thought-form, philosophy, and power of the mind. The jump scares didn't work for me. The motivations of the entity are vague and not really explained.Overall, the movie had a few creepy moments and imagery. For me, it leans more on the mystery side, than horror.

I watched this twice within 24hrs and enjoyed it on the first viewing but loved it on the second viewing.I read a ton of reviews and anyone who said it doesn't make sense needs to contact Gerber and ask them to make a channel with just movies and shows for them.Those that say it's too long probably binge Netflix shows and don't understand thier own ironic impatience.I wish it was longer personally.Some people say there is no connections between the stories... are they mental narcoleptics?

In the beginning of the film the hiker stumbles across this hidden temple and awakens some kind of demonic god and becomes the vessel. The other hikers in the group then become victims through unsettling deaths. I thought this was well done and very creepy. The rest of the film follows an ex-cop suffering from depression and nightmares over losing his wife and child in an accident while he was having an affair. He sets out to find the missing daughter of his mistress and notices many cases of missing people / deaths that end up being linked to a cult group formed around the hiker.The film played out more like a mystery thriller and had very little that would be considered horror.

I think it would have worked better without showing the trip to Nepal/Tibet (since the girl who sees Empty man never blew a bottle on a bridge) and instead start with the guy trying to find the missing girl. It should have been a movie about a strange cult with a twist at the end rather than a movie about a weird demon that only turns out to be about a cult at the end.I did like the whole noosphere idea and the Jaques Derrida reference, and especially the cinematography, music, and acting were all excellent. In fact I think this should win an Academy award or at least get nominated for both of those.The choice of shooting locations and sets were all super as well. The trip through the bizarre cult complex and the creepy campground were all super well-done.It's just unfortunate that the the overall story seemed to lack cohesion and the twist at the end felt somewhat tacked on.

I went in knowing nothing about this film except that a friend had suggested it. I want unique and/or creepy scares, not just ""jump scares"" that send the theater into a quick panic. Or just the 88 minute slasher flicks we often see. I want some suspense with the horror. Sometimes the scariest part of a movie can be what you are NOT seeing on film. The unknown. This movie is exactly that. I'll probably watch it again maybe in a month or so, to see how I react a second time through. The movie is intelligently made, well written and solidly acted.

264,VBeretta,"Finally, a genuinely Lovecraftian horror",8,23 March 2021,"""The Empty Man"" is a slow burning horror movie that could be defined as ""a story that Lovecraft never actually wrote but that he would have loved"".First and foremost, it is centered on some form of unknown ""cosmic horror"" whose fingerprints can be found everywhere among us puny humans: from Central Asian rites, to modern cults, to urban legends (don't let the trailer trick you, BTW: the ""urban legend"" angle is simply one of these fingerprints).The movie is drenched in Lovecraftian lore and visuals (sometimes literally: it always rains, everything is wet, and the color palette is dearth and decaying). The main character himself is an investigator doomed to discover a ""reality beyond our reality"" both extremely grim and not completely understandable to our inadequate brains. Other classic lovecraftian themes include the progressive blurring between reality, madness and even the inability for us to rely on our own memories - until our grasp of the real world shatters and we are forced to contemplate an unfathomable abyss.I had two problems with this movie. While I appreciated the slow-burn approach, I felt that, at 2:20 hours it was a bit too long. Shaving just 10-15 minutes would have been perfect.The second problem is that the plot gives us too much. There is a distinction between ""incomprehensible/hallucinatory"" and just ""confusing"" - and some passages are only the latter. A leaner script would have been welcomed (to make a comparison, by concentrating on the ""cult"" angle ""Midsommar"" offered a cleaner and more focused approach. ""The Empty Man"", by trying to be a bit of everything, sometimes looks like if it is trying to chew more than it bit).It is easy to forgive these flaws, however, in a movie brave enough to tackle the horror genre in a way hard to see these days, and with this level of production value.

Otherwise, the Angel of Death does not frighten but appeals only to the senses.In the end, there was much left to the imagination that could have turned it into a better film.

There seems to be some intentional distortion of reality as a component of the narrative.I actually just rented it randomly out of boredom, with zero expectations (I was unfamiliar with the graphic novel upon which it is based, nor did I see the trailer other reviews are referring to), but I was quite impressed. On the technical end, it's beautifully shot, scored and the actors all give great performances, which seems strange for a movie that seems to have just quietly slipped under everyone's radar.It's a pretty quiet, slow-burning story that utilizes outre philosophical concepts such as solipsism and panpsychism to mess with the viewers sense of reality, so if you're after the usual jump-scare garbage, you may be disappointed, but if you want to watch something original, with a lot of thought and care put into it, here ya' go.",The Empty Man

And taken individually, each of the three stories could have made a decent movie unto itself. But for some inexplicable reason, the producers decided to try to mesh together three storylines that have virtually nothing to do with each other - and in the process none of them is fully fleshed out.I've read some of the glowing reviews on here, and for the life of me, I can't figure out what they're seeing that I'm not. I'm not a simpleton that needs to have every plot device explained to me; I have no problem with abstract concepts, implied relationships, or things happening off-screen in a film. But this movie is either about an ancient subterranean entity in Asia, a scary U.S. childhood legend that may have turned out to be real, or a secretive cult that has somehow been manipulating people's thoughts and/or creating people to use for its own nefarious, but undefined, purposes. It tries but fails to be about all of them at once. I tired, I tried so hard to make sense of these three disparate storylines - but finally I gave up. If the movie can't make them line up any better than it did, then why should I kill myself trying?Intentionally obscure storytelling is not the same thing as being avant-garde. For all this movie's strengths, it cannot overcome poor plotting. You should wait until it's on some streaming service and try and decode it then, but don't pay to go see it.",The Empty Man

This is David Prior's first film and he did a pretty good job writing/directing. The cinematography and music was cool at times, but everything was just ok. I was confused on what was happening at times. The title of the film is what give me low expectations cause it just sounds so stupid, but there is nothing else you could have named it.

James Badge Dale is an actor with limitless potential, but just like this movie, it feels as if neither him or this movie, have fallen short due to that universal forever enigmatic power behind being in the right place, in the right movie, being produced by the right company or studio, or the right director, and last but undeniably never least, at the right time. So it goes with this film, I felt an almost uncertain sadness when I watched it, not from knowing exactly where my finger was supposed to point to, but more like a feeling that this movies poor success can't be ultimately determined or blamed on the artistry behind it but more on the business side if you will. A title ""the film that almost could..."" kept popping up on my head.So It's sad on retrospect, and genuinely scary, I'd think to a more educated and mature audience, some I'd whom I'm certain will be left with the same sour sweet taste this humble reviewer experienced.

Either it went over their heads or they're reviewing based on the title alone and not the content.The term Empty Man does feel a bit cliché but as it's an adaptation of the comic series of that name, I get why they used it.I hope that this becomes a cult favourite so the director is given the chance to make a prequel about the events in Bhutan prior to 90's incident.The film has a Lovecraftian vibe and builds the tension up and unleashes it in a twist ending that I didn't see coming, in the most darkest of ways.",The Empty Man

It has 2 or 3 decent scares and the cult definitely gives off creepy vibes, but all this build up leads to an infuriating cop-out of an ending (along the lines of ""it was all a dream""). It's as though the writer for the movie and the writer of the ending ""twist"" didn't talk to each other until the film was already in production, with the result that the twist makes half the plot points of the movie make no sense and makes the entire movie feel pointless.The only reason to watch this is if you like gratuitously long movies with a lot of ""atmosphere"" but not a lot of actual scares, and don't care much about a cohesive plot or a decent ending.

Christopher Young has also produced stellar horror soundtracks, namely Hellraiser.Dale plays a detective investigating a whole slew strange characters and mysterious deaths and disappearances. Marin Ireland is in a supporting role and her struggle is subtle yet quite visceral. She is in another noted 2020 horror, The Dark and the Wicked. I did not enjoy that one so much as it was overly nihilistic and too mean-spirited for me. But she acts very well and was super scared in that one lol.Everyone making The Empty Man cared. You can tell.I recommend this for sure. There's a chase scene that sent my skin on edge! You'll see.",The Empty Man
340,tashondaparkertp,You'll either love it or hate it,8,11 September 2021,"Idk why this movie has such bad reviews because it was genius to me and it wasn't some bootleg version of ""The Slender Man."" Their premises and concepts were nothing alike. The plots/storylines may have seemed to have similar deliveries but they were in themselves nothing alike.This is a movie that was made for ppl who have unique ideas and views in regards to reality and thought. You also have to have some sort of knowledge and understanding about Buddhism and the monks.At first glance, it seems like the storyteller is saying that the empty man is the Buddhist monk who has achieved the mastery of a rare meditative state and is seated in the lotus position but a closer examination will show you that he has 2 figures, one on each side of him appearing to hold him down which also is unlikely depending upon your perspective. Mine suggests that they were alien and found him and touched him to try to communicate with him through thought and consciousness and got trapped in the plane of existence the monk had traveled to.I do believe in the noosphere and shared consciousness and creating your own outcomes with thoughts. Your thoughts make the things you think about most happen even though you most likely won't be able to choose the course of actions and events. That's what the empty man does. He sets the events in motion for the acts to produce the outcome your mind has already chosen. This means he wasn't good or evil because his followers who called out to him regularly weren't harmed. They were also given the thing of their dreams; they just weren't dreaming of their deaths like those who died/killed themselves on the 3rd day.It was an interesting concept. There were so many other things going on in the movie as well. You have to see it for yourself.8/10 because the concept was good and different but the delivery will lose you from time to time.",The Empty Man

The mysterious cave and the unknown skeleton apparently associates with some ancient and cult things.But then the another overlong boring story starting in the contemporary society reduces the feeling of isolation. Well we all know everything happened relates to the cult pontifex institute. But the policemen choose no to regard these so obvious clues. How stupid they are. I can't believe this plot still exists in 2020 that the director lower the police intelligence quotient for highlighting the main hero. And the pontifex institute is founded for the empty man. According to the movie the people have to die if they call the empty man. What confuses me is this terrible cult locates in a apparent building with lots of followers and there must be a lots of deaths. FBI should have concerned with this cult. But these never happen. I even don't understand how the cult creates a new empty man who's is the main hero. We just know they do it.Come back to the subject of the movie. What I can say as a conclusion is that the cult tests the main hero if he is qualified to be a tulba who connects the virtuality and reality and apparently it's successful. So if everyone and the world are virtual why the empty man kills the people? Why doesn't the empty man kill more people from many followers to the extent that cause the FBI investigation? And if Paul is a vessel what does he transfer to the others?So many questions remain. And the overlong time of this movie doesn't make everything clear.

364,chubsstuart,Be Open Minded And Patient,10,24 October 2020,"This movie is just insane all I can say be open minded and patient. The movie is slow paced in a good way at the beginning then picks up intensity with wtf moments until the opening title for the movie. Then your back to the pace where it started. Leaving you at a wtf just happened state while wondering if the guy was dreaming or hallucinating. Then it starts with a new character with a vivid background. Then when the story starts to get going again you start to understand what's kind of going on or so you think lol. Then little by little the intensity picks up then once it's picked up there's parts were your heart is really going to start beating. Then your starting to question reality with the creepy factor at a all time high the forest scene will get your heart going trust me. Then once movie is starting end you find out what happened to the guy at the beginning while figuring out the purpose of the new guy at the end of the opening title of the movie.
Like I said the story requires you to be opened minded and patient for you to fully understand and enjoy the movie. It's very intense, creepy, supernatural, heart racing movie. Perfect for a Halloween movie date night or your watching it by yourself.👻👻👻👻",The Empty Man

I love that it leaves a space for the viewer to interpret and the whole atmosphere, that the movie sets, drags you inside as well. At some point, I felt as if my room got darker.But unfortunately, the movie is twice as longer, as it should be and has a lot of unnecessary moments and characters and a little bit of plot holes as well.

It is told in such a realistic, non-cartoonish way, that I never would've thought that to be true.This is a film that grows on you and never lets go. Like its subject matter, you can feel the itch grow as the mystery unfolds in ways you might guess, but are shocked to actually see the details of what you think things mean. It builds in suspense and terror - yes terror - as the full extent of the evil's plan works itself out.Currently I've begun to think there are supernatural forces at work in the world. Way more sinister and way more real than what QAnon could come up with. This film fits right into that paranoia - and feeds it.",The Empty Man
376,joelplascencia,Read this if you're curious,4,28 October 2020,"I was hesitant about this movie, at the time it was a 7 out of 10 (89 reviews) and I figured maybe it was secretly an awesome movie and the trailer ruined its chances... Nope. I got tired of waiting and just went to see it so here's my thoughts. This was intended for the type of movie goer that likes a film that tries to make you think... It's not bad, but it's not good either. The opening to the movie is fantastic, most people complain about how long it is and who cares. Then, when the movie really starts going it's kind of cool, but it misses the mark for all the ideas and mystery it creates only for it it feel like it was created just to extend the movies run time. The first hour, is alright. It felt like I was watching a true crime drama, so it wasn't too bad. There's a scene in a sauna, totally gnarly and then you don't get anymore after that. It made me curious to see where it was all leading up to and eventually it just kind of falls apart near the end. The movie felt like it was trying to be the next midsommar or Hereditary with the big reveal at the end and I think there was a chance to make it so, but it was done so awfully in terms of what they didn't do. They needed more instances to call back to make it everything have a bigger impact, but the two small scenes you get a call back to is just disappointing. People say the movie doesn't make sense, it makes sense. Without spoilers, the problem is the main character has a realization and suddenly the last 2 hours never mattered.

I would guess they tried to remain as true to the story as possible without sacrificing an enjoyable screen experience, but may have made it a little hard to follow if you aren't paying attention.

We then cut to the present day male protagonist as he helps his neighbor slash lover find her high school daughter. In an effort to now spoil to much, no more synopsis is necessary.

The way the movie is setup pulls you right in during the intro and has you guessing at what is going on the entire time. It's 100% worth the watch. I've watched this movie more than 2 times and I'm still noticing little details I never noticed before. This is one of those movies that deserves multiple rewatches.

I got my wisdom teeth pulled the day I watched this and that was more entertaining than this. The empty dude only pops up in a few scenes, and other than that it's just this guy going all over the place with a flash light. Definitely one of, if not the most boring movie I've ever seen. It also never explains how or why this bowl-cut kid convinces her friends to try and summon a demon, like WHY would you want to do that? Who would want to do that? That scene just took the realism away from the movie because no one wants to summon a demon, and if you do, then I suggest you get some help. Since my review is too short, I will start picking on some other stuff in this movie. I tried to follow the plot in this movie, but it was so boring and confusing that I immediately lost track, and this led to me being very confused throughout the movie. Oh, and in the opening scene in the movie, a dude falls into a cave, and his friend hops in to investigate. The friend walks in on the dude, who is meditating to this demonic looking skeleton thing. The meditating dude then tells his friend, ""if you touch me, you will die."" And what does the friend do? He starts shaking the dude, like how stupid can you be?

Now while I agree it is a bit long winded as it diverges from this formula ( 2 hours 15 minutes) for me it was never boring. You watch as the lead spirals into the realization that it was already too late before he started. It does remind me of Hereditary and Midsommar with a cult that preys on the weak mind. I preferred it to Midsommar for general creepiness though it's not quite as visually eye catching. There were parts that just gave me the chills, goosebumps and all. Though one thing is certain this movie is underrated and if you stick with it you are in for a truly well made psychological thriller that touches on much more than just some urban legend monster flick.",The Empty Man

420,V-O-I-D,A underrated cosmic horror masterpiece,10,22 September 2021,"I would like to start off by saying that this film simply is not for everyone, and I think I can say that with complete confidence. The Empty Man is a very slow burn film, its purposely ambiguous at the best of times and its anything but a conventional horror film, this movie has a real A24 feel to it, and if you're a firm fan of mainstream horror then this film might not be your cup of tea. However, if you're into more unconventional horror films like The Witch, Hereditary, It Follows, Annihilation, Midsommar or arguably even The Lighthouse (a personal favorite of mine) then The Empty Man might be exactly what you're looking for, especially if you're a fan of cosmic or psychological horror, which again I very much am personally. I feel that this film has a lot in common with Hereditary for me, in that I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it, and I've been listening to the soundtrack nonstop, so far I've only seen The Empty Man once, but I have a feeling that this is one of those films that starts to get scarier the more you watch it, because you start to pick up on things that you just wouldn't look at the first time through. Looking at more reviews I started to immediately notice things that seemingly had no context in the first viewing, which is the Exact same experience that I had with Heredity, the more you watch it, the more pieces fall into place, and the picture that starts to form is absolutely terrifying. It makes me incredibly sad that this film is so brutally underrated, but thanks to people like Chris Stuckmann, this film is slowly getting the attention and following that it deserves, and in 10-15 years I really think that The Empty Man will have a real cult following, because again, it absolutely 110% deserves it. So as I said before, if you're only accustomed to mainstream horror like The Conjuring I'm not sure that you'll like this, but if you're really into more art house or A24 kinds of films you owe it to yourself to give The Empty Man a try. Now excuse me while I go immediately watch this film again.",The Empty Man

It is deconstructing the characters, the story, and reality itself.If nothing else, this film deserves more respect for attempting something different and interesting even when it does not stick the landing.How many bad reviews of this original concept enjoy other, more derivative fare?

428,dnlplainview76,"Epic, visionary, existential creepfest. Do NOT miss this one if you are a fan of serious horror.",10,8 April 2021,"I'd been avoiding this one because it sounded exactly like one of those other ""... Man"" films that have been pretty much interchangeable, copy and paste fare. About third of the way through, once I understood just how different this film was going to be, I thought; ""why didn't they title it something else to prevent the association and grouping with a bunch of similarly titled, but wholly substandard, other movies?"" Of course, I then immediately realized that ""The Empty Man"" NEEDED to be the title and I'm glad the producers made the artistic choice over the commercial one. The only other ""... Man"" film worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as this film is ""The Wicker Man""...one of my favorite films of all time.This is definitely one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen, very possibly THE creepiest...or at least on par with ""The Tenant"", ""Repulsion"", ""Hereditary"", ""I'm Thinking of Ending Things"" and ""Inland Empire""....and it's more epic than all but two of those. If you like any of these, or other creeping dread, deeper horror films, then you should absolutely buy it (don't rent it....it has tremendous re-watchibility factor!) If you are also a Lovecraft fan, you are in for an even more serious treat. Man, this thing is existential horror dialed to 11.I only found a couple of things that were a bit untidy as far as the story goes, most other things fit in perfectly and are in sync with the terrifying logic established. The filmmakers were extremely effective in all choices, and if creeping dread was the goal...they succeeded beyond my wildest expectations. The music is amazing and the sound design is an absolute mind****! I watched it with headphones and had to frequently pause and rewind to make sure I was hearing what I thought I was hearing....deeply dark and unsettling, like it was piped in direct from hell. Only Polanski's ""The Tenant"" has a sound design that I'm still trying to wrap my mind around as much as this one....it invites additional views to focus on the sound alone to try and piece it all together.Maybe it worked so well for me because I've long held a similar philosophy as to ""what it's all about""...but not with the dark aspect that was depicted. What's presented is like a horrifying, never ending loop of expanding and contracting possibilities, experiences and visualizations. If you can get your mind in sync with it early on, you will spend most of the film with your mind trying to resist meltdown. Visionary and epic horror, this film shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as those other ""... Man"" horror movies....it's something so much more heavy and substantial. This is a film that will grow in stature as time passes. Do not miss it (unless you idea of a great horror includes any of those other ""... Man"" movies! ;) Watch is soon, then watch it again.Disregard the low ratings....it's specialness is exactly what makes it not for everyone.",The Empty Man
429,nateberens,I love this movie.,8,25 August 2021,"I recall seeing a trailer for this movie and assuming it was another Bye Bye Man type thing, or a Blumhouse sort of movie. Those are the types of horror flicks I'm not really into for the most part so I quickly dismissed it. Fast forward to August of 2021, almost a year after this movie was dumped into theaters, and I'm watching it based on a friend's recommendation. This thing is everything I want in a horror movie. It's chilling, creepy, and dread filled, exploring Lovecraftian themes alongside a great detective story, and with a folk horror tinge. The movie is ambitious and shoots for the moon, which is the thing I love most about it. Anyway, it's burrowed into my head this past couple days, so much that I've sought out interviews with director David Prior, whose future work I very much look forward to. If you are into A24 type genre storytelling, I have to recommend this. It was treated very unjustly and I hope it keeps finding its audience.",The Empty Man

432,g-kralits,Incredibly mediocre execution of an interesting premise,5,27 May 2021,"I really wanted to like this more than I did, considering I'm a sucker for Horror and contemplative, artsy movies in general. But man, these guys dropped the ball pretty fast and never picked it up again. The first 20 minutes are actually pretty interesting, but afterwards it just goes downhill. Weird conversational writing, bland characters, horrible pacing, cheap use of horror tropes and a convoluted story make this film hard to enjoy. It seems that the writers had a lot of semi-intellectual ideas they didn't quite think through to the end, nor did they know how to present them in a compelling way, leaving the whole experience utterly unsatisfying. The acting was okay at best, but nobody knocked it out of the park either. That being said, I don't blame the actors for that, cause it's apparent that the main issue lies in the writing and directing.The best part by far is the cinematography and sound effects, which are actually quite decent most of the time and save the movie from getting a sub five star review. I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but if you absolutely have to see it I suggest you skip the whole middle part of the movie and only watch the first and last 20 minutes, treating them as two indie short movies.",The Empty Man
433,benram2597,A Pleasant Surprise,8,29 October 2020,"This movie is quite slow but it doesn't mean its not interesting. The plot is incredibly complex which kept me thinking the whole time about what was going to happen and why it was happening. The overall story point is that the empty man is not the supernatural being, we as the viewer do not know who or what the creature really is, great use of a cosmic style horror by the way, the Empty Man is an actual man who is empty. With that little plot description and slight spoiler out of the way back to the actual review.
The acting in this movie isn't anything amazing but its also good enough to seem believable when characters are in parallel or facing the unknown. The real kicker is the sound use and the use of sound in this movie is amazing, the quite parts really add tension as slow humming choruses build up in the background really setting a good unsettling feeling throughout the movie. If you haven't already i defiantly suggest you check out the soundtrack on spotify. The camera work was also very well done keeping certain plot devices centered and keeping your attention away from other items in the movie that will appear later. There are a few scenes that drag on but when you reach the end of the scene its kind of a ""Oh thats why they included this"" moment.

449,ryanrose-32301,Fun enough ride for fans of horror/thriller,7,27 December 2020,"Horror is a difficult genre for a film to do something new and fresh. This film falls somewhere between something groundbreaking like 'The Ring', and those super predictable formula following movies.My suggestion is to watch the opening sequence. It's about 20 minutes and if it raises enough interest, there is another almost 2 hours of story that builds upon and gives more of an explanation what happens in the beginning.There are a few jump scares, and a lot of tension building, but the film does rotate through familiar feeling sub genres as other reviewers have complained about.My big complaint is that there are some goofy tone changes later into the film. The original intensity gets tarnished by some scenes that feel just plain silly. Not bad enough to make you want to turn it off, but definitely enough to notice.Overall I liked this movie, and as a fan horror and supernatural thrillers, I see a lot of bad movies. This was good enough where I was engaged for the over 2 hours and genuinely freaked out by certain scenes.

It started off pretty clique. But once you get past the first 30 minutes, it begins to lure you in. It slowly unravels from a clique story into a dark, complex story involving a religious cult following this Empty Man. And it's actually a very scary movie! I have never been so shook before, it's one of those flicks that creeps under your skin and makes you grit your teeth and cringe.
It's definitely worth the watch. I would recommend it to any horror fan looking for something outside the ordinary, or just a horror movie that's well-performed and well-written",The Empty Man
